Diddy,"So tired, tired of these drama
No more, no more
I wanna be free
I'm so tired, so tired

Broken heart again
Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burn
Gotta count on me
Cause I can guarantee
That I'll be fine

No more pain (no more pain)
No more pain (no more pain)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
Noone's gonna make me hurt again

What a player fool
Go through ups and downs
Nowhere and all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
Cause I was young and restless
But there was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

No more pain (no more pain)
No more game (no more game messin with my mind)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
Nooone's gonna make me hurt again
No more tears (no more tears, I'm tired of cryin everynight)
No more fears (no more fears, I really don't wanna cry)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
I don't ever wanna hurt again
Wanna speak my mind, wanna speak my mind

Uh, it feel so good
When you let go
Avoid these drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain
Free from all the game
Free from all the stress
So bye your happiness
I don't know
Only god knows where the story is
For me, but I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whatever we win or loose
And I choose to win

No more pain (no more pain)
No more game (tired of your playin' game with my mind)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
No more, no more, no more, no more
No more tears (no more tears, no more cryin every night)
No more fears (no more waking be up in the morning)
No drama, no more in my life

No more drama, no more drama
No more drama, no more drama
No more drama
No more drama
No more drama
No more drama
No more drama
No more drama in my life

Diddy,"Yo, check it
Call Lil' Cease
Tell that motherfucker to bring me some motherfucking weed to this hospital
Man fuck that
Tell that reporter to go pick up ten thousand from Dez
And go take about like twenty G's from Gino
Tell that motherfucker get this nigga next door up out of here
Nigga be snoring all night I can't sleep (hehe)
Call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick
(Bad Boy Big, c'mon)

The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is loving me
Saying the best part of the day is my half
Feeding me breakfast, and giving me a sponge bath
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga I'm getting high, getting head on the beach
Chilling, sitting on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin'
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (fuck them)
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips (that's right)
All the time, Big Poppa kick the war rhymes
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

Notorious!
C'mon, we are, we are
No, No, No, Notorious!
He is, he is,
No, No, No, Notorious!

This for my niggas slingin' thangs, hammer ringin' kings
Truck, necklace, igloo ring and things
For the bitches, who see them rims spin and grin
That shit with the V-trim that win
And the enormous fields disperse of rap
On the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggas to kill, than birds to bag
Hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh
Hops, out the truck like, ""Trick, what up?""
Call me Sean if you suck, call me gone when I nut
That's the end of us, get your friend to fuck
Untwist and bend her up, you know the deal
Niggas talkin' real greasy on some ballin' shit (that's right)
Funny how quick these pricks forget
Actin' like I ain't the reason they traded they shit
Switched that 5, copped that 6 (that's right)
It's all good, you know who the clone is
Fuck the Jones's, niggas trying to keep up with the Combses

C'mon y'all
Notorious!
We are, we are (what's his name)
No, no, no, Notorious!
He is, he is (c'mon, what's his name?)
No, no, no, Notorious!

Who that queen bitch, keep her glass filled to the rim?
The Notorious K-I to the M
That's me, on MTV, no doubt
Titty out like what, I don't give a fuck!
Y'all know my attitude, can't stand my cologne
Then stay your ass home, you and your chaperon
Things done changed, but we continue to reign
As the King and the Queen of hip-hop, me and B.I.
Frank White still the center of attention
I'm by his side, with the chrome fifth, playing my position
Sexy, young thing, from the ghetto
That bitch rocking mics in high heel stilettos
We taking over like Francis
Switching our styles like the hottest new dances
See, I let y'all live to stack a little paper
Be glad I pushed my album back, I did y'all hoes a favor!

She did you a favor, c'mon now, yeah
No, no, no, notorious!
He is, he is (c'mon, what's his name?)

Cheri Dennis
Bad Boy
La Familia
The saga baby

Before I met you couldn't take stress
'Cause after BIG died my nigga Mase less
And that's when I started havin' faithless
'Cause Black Rob he on trial and I escaped death
Still in your tape (yeah) still gettin' hate threats
Still gotta take that
Still gettin' sued for money I ain't even make yet
Without you girl I'm incomplete
I can't lie ma I'm in too deep
And yo I know we don't get to spend time together
Just you and me never mind the cheddar
And though we barely speak on the phone
Could tell by your tone, you hate bein' home all alone
And I wish I could sleep witcha
Roll around in the streets witcha
No fans hold hands on the beach witcha
Girl I'd do anything just to be witcha
On the real 'cause I feel so complete witcha
Yeah, talk to me girl

I remember what you said
When you said it to me last night
We was talkin' and you reassured me everything's fine
When I woke up this morning to get some lovin' from you
I turned to one side
To my surprise, I wasn't layin' next to you m'mm

Why did you get close to me
Thought it was supposed to be
Me you you me so complete
Why you handelin' me this way
What was it you was talkin' yesterday
Yesterday, I could say, I seemed to be
So complete so complete

[Chorus]
Went away you said nothing
You didn't no kiss no lovin'
You didn't it's a shame
But it brings about the weak in me
You didn't spend a lot of time with me
You didn't share things I wanna see
You didn't when ever you're around me it's so complete

So I waited and I waited
'cause I knew that you would call
Hours 1 hours 2 hours 3 hours not at all
If I'm dreamin' wake me up
'Cause I just about had enough, I had enough
I cannot see how you would ever let this happen to me
Oow oow ooh

I still believe that it was supposed to be
Me you you me so complete
If you're sayin that you need to leave
Then be a man about it step to me
Step to me, tell me please
That without me it's so complete, so complete

[Chorus]

Won't you tell me right now what you want from me
What you want from me
'Cause it's been too long that you've held it in baby
Held it in
Thought you were the one but you just played me
You know you played me
Now I feel that I'm so incomplete
Yeah ho ho yeah yeah

[Chorus]

Please, give me the response I need
I want you to complete me, ohh baby
Pleas, give me all the lovin I need
Promise you'll never leave me whoa baby

Baby what more can I say
'Cause I want you to tell me
What it is you wanna do
'Cause I wanna be with you",So Complete,2002
Diddy,"Fuck the whole industry you tried to get rid of me?
Y'all must be kidding me y'all must be kidding me
Aye yo fuck the whole industry come on
Staten Island come on hold me down
 
Monster cut truck balley shit
Champagne spilling while we hitting every bump that my Denali hit
Outfit is four thousand and better
The rhinestones in my Flintstones look crazy in my sweater
 
Pah it's not a big fairy tale that's my M.O.
Fuck bitches on the reg' with no problemo
Iceberg rabbits and the fox and more
Where I coped two more brought four for RZA

And though my heart can't take no more,
I won't keep running back to you

I think I found my strength to finally get up and leave
No more broken heart for me
No more tellin' your lies to me (And another one)
I'm lookin' like I got my head on right so now I see
No more givin' you everythin'

Glad to wake up every day without you on my brain
No more waiting late up at night
No more havin' to fuzz and fight
I'm proud to say that I will never make the same mistake
No more thinkin' about what you do
There's no more of me runnin' back to you

Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright wit' you, we fuckin' (that's cool)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot next to yo sister
Damn I really miss the way she used to rub my back when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian, trips to the Caribbean
But tonight, no ends

You must be used to me cryin' (And another one)
While you're out bumpin' and grindin'
But I'm leaving you tonight

And though my heart can't take no more,

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I know at times you feel stressed out
But I'm tryin' to set you up so later I can buy you up this guest house
But for now I gotta hug the block
I know you sick of visits from undercover cops
Runnin' to the kitchen tryin to hide the box
Just give me a minute and I'm gonna flood you with rocks
I gotta wicked jump shot but let's be real
Ain't no scouts gonna give a sad nigga a deal
I gotta do what I gotta do that's what's up
What's with this new attitude you know bitch that is what's up

Sittin' in the Vanquish, the same color as cinnamon
Ma' I'm tryin' to be your knight and shinin'
To put you in the house on the Cayman Islands
Spend your whole life with stylin'
With that light that got me
Through it all you was right behind me
And ma' I know I gotta change
But right now a nigga is dealing with a lot of things
It's not the same
Girl with me you can achieve whatever
But I can't change, I'm a Bad Boy forever

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we livin' up in Jersey
In the t.v. in the car got the game on starrin' Marbury
And your ring gotta rock the size of strawberries
Everything that you want I got it don't worry
And I know it ain't about the chips
Just my way of sayin' thanks for the years you put up with my shit
I had to change like the chorus said
And I'm reminded why every time we do our thing in the waterbed
To me this is more than head
It's more than a crush
It's all about us
It's love and trust
Took the time out to make things right
It may seem nice
But I'm gonna be a Bad Boy for life

Hey yo, ladies and gentlemen
You could never imagine, what's about to happen right now
(Hey yo check this out)

Hey yo I'm back by popular demand and shit
Niggaz want the crown but can't handle it
This rap game's getting scandalous
I done lost my best friend in Los Angeles

My other nigga turned Evangelist
But I can't quit cause I'm on some Evander shit
Fuck the money and the white sand and shit
When it's said and done you gunna understand this shit

Your man talking about Hummers and little cars
That only fit in his little house little garage
His lifestyle is just a little mirage
He the type of cat that never had a menage

Backrub, you know a little massage
Tight shit you get when you Head Nigga in charge
I'm in the Rolls listening to the bars
Leaned back wit a chick smoking on cigars

From Bogota, Colombia, chicks from Panama
The diamond fellow, mami hello
Pull up in the drop my Ferrari yellow
Pull off your top make it shake like Jello
(Lenny Kravitz)
Drop everything! When you walk in the door
Free your self 'fore get ya ass on the floor!
Ah be a maniac-ah! lose control (just lose control)
Get naked! Strip down to your soul!

Well strip down! (work)
Show me some more! (work)
Is that all you got?! (work)
You got to make me believe it girl! (work)
See'mon now!

I'm sitting on your Louie bag, now you're braining it
Lookin' like your little sister came that painted it
Slick, like calamari tentacles
Staring at my chain I kicked off your Jimmy Choos

I weigh 155 pound when I'm soaked ma
That Rolls Royce Phantom, it ain't no joke ma
Weed brownie at 2, but I will not smoke ma
Don't talk about licking if it ain't deepthroat ma

I give you great dick, I make your face flip
Then take ya aboard a nigga Spaceship
Star Trak, my fault I mean Mother Ship
Put on the cameras, try it you'll be loving it

And you can bring your girl and we can get on another tit
Me? I'm a Mount Airy fellow
Or down in Florida wit the Maranello
Driving slow watch the mami mouthing ""hello""

Get wit ya man if you want love you better
Trying to get +Dirty+ like +Aguilera+
Yep, he's a skater the kids that's rhyming
But I'm also young and rich wit a big ass diamond

Hey yo my intro's crazy, I'm in a new Mercedes
Rocks the same colors as daisy's
Why'all niggaz is lazy, I'm on my j-o-be	
And that's why ya hate on me

But here's the update, Loon ain't got nothing but cake
And power from here to upstate
Why'all sweet as cupcakes
So why niggaz stay wit tough faces?
I stay trying to figure what Loon and Puff make

Bitch please! you ain't been in a helicopter
Flying 'round Jesus statue wit a mountain in Brazil
Bitch please! you ain't never been to Guatemala
Eating shrimp by the dollar taking flights to Negril

Bitch please! and you ain't been wit Lenny and Pharrell
Me and Loon in the hills giving mami's the chills
Bitch please! and you ain't never seen a hotter nigga in the game

Diddy,"Ma, I tried so many years
But it seems like all I brought you is tears
I tried to eliminate all of your fears but it's conflict
Yeah, check it out, uh, yo

Aiyyo, the game keep callin', niggaz in the streets is ballin'
Tryin' to creep just to keep from fallin'
But the block keep hollerin', yellin' my government name
I tried to stop but the love of the game

They got my girl in a frenzy, my niggaz used to be friendly
'Til they seen me and Puff in the Bentley
Now, forced to stay, forces use force and spray
Coffins lay when I'm forced to play

Like an animal, dawg, if I put my hand on you
I'ma handle you, like I'm Hannibal, the motherfuckin' cannibal
All plans is through, dreams and goals
The block hot but why this shit seem so cold

This shit seems so old, tryna redeem my soul
The Feds roll and my team done fold
Like a bad hand of poker, even ya man'll smoke ya
For these crushed up leaves of coca, now

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Yo, check it out
It's been four years and you ain't shed no tears
And through the course of that, I lost four pairs
That's why I smoke more blunts, drink more beers
You never consider it, like you just don't care

The pain I feel inside, you just don't share
When I share my deepest thought, you just don't hear
Well aware of my fears of me losin' my life
I'm well aware of my fears of me losin' my wife

That's why I stay usin' my gun and usin' my knife
Gotta deal with this shit 'til my music get right
I buy you pretty things just to see you wear it
You sayin' I ain't shit, tryna break my spirit

I try to change my life but you just don't hear it
Guess I gotta find another girl to spend four years with
Damn, all that time got wasted but I guess I gotta face it

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

Uh, yo, uh, aiyyo
The cops don't like me, they always eager to fight me
Even though I know they wanna be like me
'Cause they see a nigga icy, doin' a buck in the white V
Twizzy gettin' busy with wifey, gettin' head on the highway

I'm gettin' money to fly away
Pull me over just to fuck up my Friday
What could I say? Nothin', still they be frontin'
Throw a brick in the trunk and try to make up somethin'

But I'm not with the bullshit, that's why I roll with a full clip
Flint cock the hammer and pull quick
Don't care about your uniform or that bullshit you be on
Now who gon' really mourn when you be gone?

One in your head like a unicorn
You movin' on, your favorite suit is on
Moms singin' that stupid song, ""My baby ain't blast nobody""
But he still got smoked at Bay Bay's party, that's why

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do
I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do
I can't talk to you the way I used to
You don't understand why I feel the way that I do

I wanna take you where it feel like June in December, too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a day aside to go to Bloomies and spend with you

Flights I don' flew some alone

Just to erase all the negative views from your dome

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The girl-boy killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two Midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Luc'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, with just Mase and 'em
Placin' them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P.Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition

Before '99 I was born again
5 years later I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's an oxy moron
Forget a bus, I brought a drop to tour on

Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gonna make me cry

Crucified for bringin sex in the city

With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Ain't no if I...Know

This ain't my life

Put up a good fight

Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God tI'me now, and I don't plan to play

Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.B. taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When _Ready to Die_ was a sick part of my life {yeah}
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I.

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yellin that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset {uhh}
And when the ressurection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally!
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga!",It Has Been Said,2005

Because of you
And I'd be on the highway, if only I could leave my place

I used to be a talker but I ain't got nothing good to say

I really thought you were the one, the only one
I guess that I was wrong
And you turned out you wasn't it

What can you say when it's said and done
Nothing at all
Cause you can't hide a heart break

The feeling I had sorta felt like my birthday
Beautiful I must say
She was my earthquake
Cute face, nice shape, she made my earth shake
I'm a try an keep the faith, do it like the church say
She the one for me and I don't care what him or her say
Thought I had a home run
But I'm just at first base I found out the long run
Just another heart break
So how much can my heart take

You know I wouldn't leave, I needed you to breath
See life is but a dream, so is love and I believe
If you ever been in love you would know what I mean yeah
So lord help me please I wanna see the light
She keep telling me I'm wrong but I know I'm right
But trying to ignore cause I don't wanna fight
I know I make mistakes
But still I need her in my life

Tell me how I'm supposed to heal this open wound
Because of you
And tell me who woulda thought that id ever be trying to get over you
I'm stuck in the moment, of memories of me and you
And I can get over it, but I ain't sure if I want to
Cause you dun made your bed, now you gotta lie in it
You gotta lie in it babe
Now all the things you said don't mean a thing
Don't mean a thing to me now
I can't believe I gave you one, last, shot
I let it ride now baby it's your stop
Oh so so leave
Now the jokes on me
It took a while to finally come to my senses
But what
What do you do, what do you do after love? oh
What can you say ..what can you say when it's said and done
When its over, oh
Cause you can't hide a heart break
Wen you can't stop these tears from falling down (i can't stop these tears)
So what do you do? what do you do?

After love.
After love.
After love.

(i know you hear me..listen to me (please)
This is what you made me do
Pay attention
She know who I'm talking to, and I know you listening
I think about you all the time, if not every minute
I promise hurting you was never my intention
Something bout your style, the way that you presented her
Every fantasy I ever had you was in it
I apologize for every time that you might have cried
There's not enough words to describe how I feel inside
Guardian angel sent from the skies
I always knew you woulda made a beautiful bride
And that's why
I wish you could of stayed, so much
But I fucked up, an went and betrayed your trust (you know)
There's no more Dolce Gabbana, Gucci, Prada, trips to Nevada
And I admit what you probably heard was true
But outta of all these girls the only one I loved was you
I love you

You know I love you more then anything tho
That's one thing you can't run from
I just wanna end the conversation in a good way man

A lot of people don't understand
They'll understand one day though

I just like to make people feel good
I really feel I can do anything
I really truly believe in God that way
So much that I believe in myself
I guess I'm kinda like my father
You know, who had a relentless spirit
You know
He would stop at nothing to achieve his goal

You know who it is, I'm back in the building
Security strapped, still stacking a million
It's doubt with the stallion, somethin' Italian
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris
I'm in it to win it but willing to carry
The game, if you think I'm not, look at the carats
I buck clean about in a Phantom
The people go screaming like an opera anthem
I did it before, do it again
I got it to blow, got it to spin
Lies before, cool as the wind
Got hits go back like juice and gin, yea
Shine the best and diamond necklace
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes
They know I'm the ish, they wanna get next
That's why she had to fit 'cause she wanted to get next

I'm here, when will you make your move?

Admire your body language, speaking loud and clear like (I want you to come be with me)
She be waiting, anticipating for oh so long
Fantasizing wild thoughts of me coming on like (I'm here, when will you make your move?)
She digging my style, my swag, my suede, my swerve
My way with words, the Boy's absurd for sure
You can't fall till my aura called
I make miracles like I walk on water
What you want, mama, order, it's on my tab
I'm so bad with the cash, I dropped the whole bag
Where you at, girl?

I'm here, when will you make your move?
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha

Can't you see the wait is over?
I need you to come closer

Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer,
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city,
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy,
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle, 
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle,
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher,
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture,
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest, 
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project, 
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier,

Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma,
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing, 
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her,

Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar, 
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers,
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder,

Summer jam stopper, Tim truck wearing,
Pineapple rocker, then I spray choppers, 
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me, 
Draped in paisley bandannas,
Suits with Adam Stacey,
Cigar like Dick Tracy,
Its dark I get spacey,
Alcohol and laced weed,
That was part of my 80's,
The Cartier consigieres be near me,
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,
Liz Taylor tried to joke me

Across 110th sharp Caesar with a lime music
Fine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning

Stop teasin' 'em you can't rock Palladium
We bring New York back like that West side stadium

And you was there 
Just to roll by your man 
And came back 
Even know what I did 
I realize and I'm aware 
I know what it is 
Put that on everything 
Girl you my everything 
I don't know where I'd breathe 
Cause you the air I be 
If lovin' is wrong 
Who could be right 
I wouldn't know what to do 
Without you in my life 
You're more to me than the world I pray 
The more nights for your heart to ache
Right in the middle of the dawn of day 
I think of all the pain I caused 
And throw it away and say 
I need you in my life 
Can you feel it in your soul 

You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 

I know it's hard to love me 
That don't mean I don't love you 
Hey rich 
I love the way you got Harlem singin' 
Mary take us home 

You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you 
You makin' it so damn hard 
For me to love you

I've been thinkin', times is hard
'Fore it get worse and fall apart
Maybe you should quit your job, and do what's right
And make you my partner for life
So we can chill (and have a little fun)
So we can chill (and have some little ones)
So we can chill (until our living's done)

Can I talk to you for a second?
There's some things I've been meanin' to tell you
Some things that have been on my mind
Listen to me baby (let's go)

Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)
Boo you know what? (What)

The day when I first seen you
You know I didn't stand, but I ain't mean to (yes you did)
Back then it wasn't oh so fair
You came through like some good clean air
Skin softer than the softest fabrics
You heard about me (I heard about you)
How I ball like the Dallas Mavericks
Sayin', anything you want, you can have it (give it to me)
That's Harlem World, I get on my grizzly savage see?
From the first day, we laid eyes on each other
At the office I knew we was goin' be lovers (I remember)
Mark hotel under the covers
You said I was cool and not like a lot of them brothers
Who used and abused you and took you for granted
See you a Goddess, that's why you was put on this planet (I love you)
Since you got me all sentimental

[Chorus]

C'mon, don't stop
Girl, maybe we should think about it (think about it baby)

You're so amazin'
All I can see is us now in the sun just grazin'
Boo your brown complexion, I never seen a
Same color as coffee a teaspoon of creamer
'Member when I had the Beemer? Remember?
Goin' through tough times and knowin' the other side was greener
We had a dream, we pursued it
'Member that conversation, all or nothin' before we lose it?
You remember, it's all words like music
Came at a time I needed soothin', soul body and mind
At times I felt violent, you kept me in line
Where-ever I went you wasn't far behind
Girl, we got a bond no one can break
And I'm sayin', I pray to God every night we make it, pray to God
I'm hooked and I don't wanna shake you, c'mon

[Chorus]

Yeah I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' lately baby, yeah
Now I know I done put you through a lot of shit
I know it's hard fuckin' with a nigga like me
Yeah, you get a lot of respect for that shit
Ridin' with a nigga
You know, you might as well.

[Diddy]
Now sit back and reflect, on all our accomplishments
The mansions, the plush apartments and
The big boats and the cases of whole klicko
I don't ever wanna let you go
It's a certain kind of feelin', you know that feelin' you get
When your girl right and you know what's what, uh
You got me on some lay low stuff
You stood by me, all through that J-Lo stuff
Brush your shoulders off girl, go 'head and brush 'em
Without you around, I can't function
We gon' be together 'til the day we die
And when they put us in the ground we'll be side by side
I never had a girl make me feel like you
And every day I wake up, I feel brand new
I live for you and I'll die for you too
I love you girl

[Chorus]

Girl, maybe we should think about it
Oh we could be down for life
Have a couple kids and make you my wife, baby
You're beautiful lady
My beautiful, so wonderful
I love you so

When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you
That makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing
And the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it
Not saying a thing

Going in and out of them lanes

And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me

Can y'all hear me out there? Uhh

Through blocks and boroughs, cops is plottin'
Snakes slither while hustlers chop they product
Foreign cars exotic, got hoes hypnotic
While I cruise through the concrete, blowin' my chronic
And I move like a diplomat, hoodie and fitted caps
Dwell in the habitat where cons and killers at
Faced a thousand deaths, cowards'll bow to the feet
Of the almighty, a God to the black child
I told moms I would be somethin'
I gave myself to the world now it's like you owe me somethin'
Listen up, I got a story to tell
It's like I fell out of heaven just to walk through hell
It's what, fueled my fire, ignited my desire
You gave me the bricks and the sand to build the empire
Throw the seal on my forehead, my faith still strong
With all I've been through, you would think my faith gone
But nope, I hold my stance in stone
I move mountains with my will and succeed that's how I keep goin'
Won't stop been the motto, feelin' rich like I won the lotto
It's almost like seein' through the eyes of a crack child
Dodgin' crisis, three strike system niggaz trapped in a vice grip
You can't defeat me, I defy all odds and sabotages
I survived Reagan, I survived the first Bush
Thinkin' back when my moms gave that first push
Thank God for my life I came through the room
Until the evil of part two, when God gave me a sequel
Rags to royal, momma hand her hands in soil
Pops moved drugs in capsules and foils
I foiled your plans and made you aware
And turned America's dream into a nightmare
Yeah, you feel the vibe muh'fuckers
The first B.I., ""Ready to Die"" muh'fuckers
So ""Who Shot Ya,"" nine to five muh'fuckers
""Bad Boy for Life,"" is I muh'fuckers
And it's back, better than it ever was
I'm talkin like we was gone but we never was
So I deliver the truth uncut
We produce more hits got the booth fucked up
On top of the statue yellin ""Who want what?""
For the past ten years, the future is us

Take a good look at me
I done cried from the lies
It hurts so bad inside
If you need a thing ain't never had nothing to me 
break me down to the floor til I hide the pain 
And to show you your girlfriend 
What you had me thinking you word was your bond 
(don't you know)
That your never gonna love if you knew it was a situation 
you knew you weren't ready for
I could see if your feelings had changed but damn you just slammed the door
You told me the one you said you would put down your whole life for 
I can comprehend 

How can you turn on me
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heat
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said wen you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that your never gonna let it go

The times that you weren't there
The times that you left me here 
The times that I needed you 
You know my love is true
My passions inside for you
The nights that I cried for you 
A man has these feelings too
Same shit that chall go through 
I been here before 
Sometimes the pain you ignore
Until its right at your door 
And then you just can't no more
Why does love feel this way
Why does it hurt so bad

Can't even look me in the face
Why does love hurt this way

How can you turn on me 
(how can you how can you)
How can you purposely
(how can you how can you)

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heart
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said thought you said that you need me
Thought you said thought you said you complete me
Thought you said thought you said you were never gonna let it go
Thought you said thought you said when you held me
Thought you said thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said thought you said that you never gonna let it go

The heartache and pain 
Sometimes it goes to your brain 
Sometimes it makes you insane 
Sometimes our joy is our pain
'cause it tears you apart these affairs of the heart
I think I'm strong but I'm not
And when I look in ya eyes you know it kills me inside
But I can't wait for that day that you come back to me girl
After we both go away its just to see if its real
There's no denying the fact its meant to be
If you let it go and then they come back.
If this is our last dance we need to practice our steps,
The situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept, 
You said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault 
And of course you lost me with your alibis and all of your talking 
And most important I just question my self

The pain is taking over I can't believe
(I need your hand)
What happened then compared to now is dreams
(I need your hand)
And I know now that you'll, me

I can't sleep, I can't breathe, I ain't eat in days, stomach pains from arguing
Didn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started 
And as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson
Well its all in the healing and that process has got me stressin'
I'm so pressured I'm so physically drained 
I ain't thinkin' straight I loved you more than my own self
Although I couldn't bear the pain of seein' my old self 
Young wild uncontrolled self
I love you girl I don't need no one else

Lessened learned house can burn were close to heart
Betcha words don't mean nothing to me
Thought you said, thought you said that you loved me
Thought you said, thought you said that you need me

Thought you said, thought you said when you held me
Thought you said, thought you said when'd you tell me
Thought you said, thought you said no one else could replace me
Thought you said, thought you said that you never gonna let it go

When I look in your eyes you know it kills me inside

Didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, didn't you, ooh ooh 

Lesson learned
House can burn 
We close to heat
Bet your words don't mean nothing to me

These affairs of the heart I think I'm strong but I'm not

Come enjoy the ride

Hey yo Ciara 
Take us home baby 

I feel high on the music

To move 
I feel high on the music

Diddy,"Baby this is your last dance; you know how you do it
There's no nigga like you and there'll never be another nigga like you
Put your foot on these motherfuckers necks
Do it to 'em daddy, do it to 'em

As my, Daytons spin lowrider sittin' low
Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims
Hard top six-four, I'm Diddy no tint
I can't hide in New York City
I'm 'bout it in the South, sleep good in the West
Know a chick from Watts with Bad Boy tatted on her breast
I done been there and did it (I done been there and did it)
Ten years without gettin' sweat inside my Yankee fitted
1990-Raw I showed you ice
You ain't know who Jacob was so I showed you twice
When it was (All About the Benjamins) I had two bezels on my arm
Like a Don's supposed to, Sean
Ride with a chauffeur in Gucci loafers
And switch to All Stars without losin focus
These rap niggaz hopeless (hopeless) you can change the locks
But I'm a shine for niggaz that ain't know Big

[Chorus]
Do, seem, like, my, fu-ture's, here, now
It feels good to see the sun in the mornin'
I'm tired of feelin' that the people are talkin'
I heard a rumor that things ain't changin'
But Lord knows that we goin' make it
Oh

The world famous
As we proceed
To give you what you need
It's been so long
It's been so real
So magnificent, thank you

Tell me who shot Big (who shot Big)
And take the bullets out of 2Pac's ribs (take 'em out)
If I could I would reverse the car, reverse the beef
Put it all in a pot and boil it on a D. Dot beat (hit me baby)
Sometimes I get drunk, for stress relief
Other times I put ""Life After Death"" on and peep
We ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe
Without my nigga on the passenger side?
And still I try (I try) to get money stay fly
Finish the race, holdin' my crown high (take that)
I fly next to God, my eyes on the prize
Been away a long time but now I'm re-energized
(AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)
Dedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)
And the day I die, let a G4 fly
And dump my ashes over N.Y.

[Chorus]

Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
I told you I was gon' be great ma
I told you I was goin' be somebody!
Oh!! Feel so good
Feel so free
Put your fists in the air, aow!

I'm the King of all Kings, I abide by no rules
And do what I do by any means (c'mon)
Call him necessary, the great visionary
Born extraordinary, a life legendary
Who else put flows out, that put clothes out
Flee the cold weather, short sleeves with my toes out
Nine-six Big showed me what to do
But deep in my heart, this is ""No Way Out II"" (let's rock)
I spend absurd money, private bird money
That Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bloomberg money (you know what it is)
Old habits die hard, the Vanguard award winner
New York torch gripper, O.G. of the floss nigga
I'm seein' visions like I did a bag of angel dust
This is life when you black rich and dangerous
I'm with God, I'm a live on forever
Bad Boy for life bitch, nobody does it better (nobody)

[Chorus]

Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
I'm in the best shape of my life!
Y'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin' name
Yeah! You created this monster!
It's so inspirational, it's so real
Bad boy bitch!

I lost a couple loved, yeah, I cry for my homies

Big guap on deck, crack rocks on my neck
Patron shots up next, make it rain, leave 'em wet
What I got you can get it, pimp, tell what's the bid'ness pimp?
Fresh cake, then make them flip, then be shoppin? on the imp

If you think I'm lyin? then my name ain't Joc
The hustle gotta hollerate ?cause I ain't gon' stop
Yeah, I play my cards well but this ain't poker, I ain't bluffin?
And if you thug it like I thug it then I got one question

Shorty, what the mood is? Stacks on deck
(Hell yeah)
Is that your life savings layin? 'round your neck
(Hell yeah)

You place ?em shoes on that old school ?Lac
(Hell yeah)
Is you my nigga 'til they take your last breath?

Any kind I'm with your way, with your way, I'm with you
(Hell yeah)
Any kind I'm with your way, with your way, I'm with you

Oh yeah, my swagger kill 'em, call me Bellugi Williams
Don't let the smooth taste fool you, J so sick need penicillin
I love the streets, boy, I fuck with d boy
Whole lot of money off in these streets so pull up a seat let's eat, boy

Haters gon' have plenty to say long as pennies off in my safe
So don't make me retaliate, AK spray every kinda which-a-way
I do shit you never seen before, all my clothes next season, hoe
All my whips the cleanest, yo, if you ain't gon' ball what you breathin? for?

From hood to hood my name good, Cartier lens, frame wood
Your bitch a 10, the brains good
(I love this song)
I knew you would
Real recognize real, dawg, that's just how I feel
I got nothin? but love to give on everything, that's how I live

Shorty, what the mood is? Stacks on deck
(Hell yeah)
Is that your life savings layin? 'round your neck
(Hell yeah)

You place ?em shoes on that old school ?Lac
(Hell yeah)
Is you my nigga 'til they take your last breath?

Any kind I'm with your way, with your way, I'm with you

Any kind I'm with your way, with your way, I'm with you

Ayo, Joc, lemme get some of this, man
C'mon check this out

Okay I live it, I done it, oh yeah, that's Hustlenomics
The ice, the clothes leave hoes astonished
I know you see it, think twice to believe it
Dope boy, magic got my pinky gleaming

Give you the shoes off my feet, shirt off my back
The blueprint to these streets, show you how to make that paper stack

c'mon
(Hell yeah)
I'm there for real
(Hell yeah)

Last night,
I couldn't even get an answer.
Tried to call,
But my pride wouldn't let me dial.
And I'm sitting here,
With this blank expression.
And the way I feel,
I wanna curl up like a child.

I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

You can see it in my eyes.

With nothing to say.

Your heart belongs to me.
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch.

Now come and sit yo big ass down
Right here on daddy legs, now hush, take a sip of the brown
Lap dance on it, leave a white stain on my Levis
This the twat team, I'm a show you how we ride
Through a lasso over your hips, rustle your mean thighs
You bow-legged too? I'm a hit it from all sides
Uh huh, we brought the bar, you bought the bar
Beans got the big lighter out, waiting to spark
Word up, dance floors, noise, asses shaking
And she winding that body like she got Jamaican
Asians, sistas, blacks, bad Caucasians
Get em all Goosed up, then I persuade them
To bounce to the c-r-i-b

We'll just talk about those I knows
The world is mine, can't you see
I'm just trying to be all I can be
Oh, yeah

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore she be game for sure
Pimp so hard, a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it? I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fucking with me, believe me that's a privilege
I won't be satisfied, till all my niggas get it
See you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga we be flying through your hood
And hood rats scoping with they eyes on my goods
See we date em like we hate em, see em like we don't need em
Treat em like we meet em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you, never knew, what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
And if she's flexible fuck the nigga next to you

The world is mine, can't you see
I'm just trying to be all I can be

When the Remi's in the system, ain't no telling
Will I fuck em will I diss em, that's what these hoes yelling
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all still chase on, I'll replace on, punks

Spitting words making birds till they flock see you later
Whether, drunk or high, skunk or thai
Nigga play against some player shit, slugs goin' fly
Ain't no lie, pimped out, the SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o, she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew, in each state
Now I got two in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now I pop bottles with models, larger steaks on large estates

I had a whole lotta bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game always say the right lines
Had a few prostitutes and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let em do it to you
She ain't no sucker, I know that bitch man
She wanna be a Pretty Woman loving a rich man
Now here you come, drop top riding
You ain't no pimp fake nigga stop lying
Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that live it
Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figured
She left you cause you couldn't be, like them real niggas
She was a hustler by nature, and you was just faker
Than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too Short

Crazy ass man
I never would of bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that hoe man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe!
Man I'm thirty years old nigga
And that bitch was hoeing when I was in 9th grades and shit
Think about that, she been around then right?
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes man
Just the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fucking witchu cause you had a good ass job, nigga nerd
Treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga
She ain't nothing but a hoe!
Bet you fell in love with her man!
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife fool
Every time you turn your back that bitch is fucking with them gangstas
Eastside Westside these are my partners
Do that shit, you know what I'm talking bout nigga

Lost city of New Orleans, we call him this

Now
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sitting on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina, we should've called it Hurricane (Georgia) Bush
Then they telling y'all lies on the news
The white people smiling like everything cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do?
Got to no trailer, you gotta move
Now it's on to Texas and to (Georgia)
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see
But they don't let you know what's really going on
Make it look like a lot of stealing going on
Boy them cops is killers in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Georgia) Bush
So what happened to the levees, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the levee
That keep on telling me they heard the explosions
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy

Wait, have you heard the latest, they saying you gotta have paper if you trying to come back
Niggas thinking it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Georgia)
Now it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say don't worry 'bout it
And the children have been scarred, no one's here to care 'bout 'em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they calling y'all, but fuck president (Georgia) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker motherfucker that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollars, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cause he died in the storm, fuck president (Georgia) Bush

Twenty five on the bank I be stunting on there ass
And they mad cause the bitch won't stop

Hello, good morning, how you doing? What the move is?
Welcome to the future I'm the captain of the cool kids
The revolutions never been televised
Great booty better thighs I ain't wanna tell her bye
First, I tell her hi, then I give her one and let her fly
Never tell her lie the night you couldn't find a better guy
King shit fly to anywhere you get seen with
Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of them, honey feel free to bring with
G-5 waiting, fly away at my convenience
You seen Tip checking in a 5 star suite with some 5 star freaks
Gettin' high all week, catch me in the V
I was in the back when y'all sleep
In a fast car super bad broad back seat
That's me, see I'm nothing nice, fuck a couple nights
See the moon say goodbye and the sun greeting us like

Hello, Good morning
Lets go, lets ride,
Hello, good morning
Hello, good evening
You blow, you feindin'

And I'm the one that you wanna be with
But right now baby you dreaming
Wake up and turn the lights off

Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads wont give me my props

Diddy,"So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Ain't nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
When you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Chorus: x2]
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly,
So many lonely sleepless nights,
I'm going through hell to convince you love me,
But never her approval no matter how I try,
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
But what am I to do when her parents do not try

So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say
Ooh

[Chorus: x2]

I've been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
My life ain't the same as it was,
Heart broke to the point, sometimes wanna end it,
If I can't have what mean most to me

So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say

[Chorus: x2]

(Diddy, Drizzy baby)
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn, tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became somethin' different
Its just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure

So selfishly
You can only show fear 
Unless you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh time, oh time has changed 
And I'm no longer wiling
You can see how my heart is bleeding
Oh yes

Tell the world that I'm coming

I'm back where I belong,

(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
And if you with me put your hands high
(Put your hands high)

If you ever lost a light before,
This ones for you
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear ""The Tears of a Clown""
I hate that song
I always feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another Dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but its harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitable prolongs
Another day another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taneisha I'll be back in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

""A House is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone (no)
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own
Pick up your phone, come on

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home

I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
'Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
Is what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you big)
And here I stand, a better man! (a better man)

My drama, my karma
My love my life, dear momma
The war's I've fought, scars that I've garnered
The hustle, I got that honest from my father
Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can't face defeat (nope)
I did it all in a week
Still incomplete as I stand on my feet
It take a lot to still dance to the beat
Skin more cold and callous than concrete
I love swimming but there's just one ski
In a rich man's cheap hotel with bed sheets
Uh ah, you know what I'm looking for

Looking for someone to love me
Now, now, now I'm looking for someone to love me yeah

When you ain't got dough, you scratch and you crawl
In your state of mind, 
You want somethin', ay you want it all
Look at the sky wonder when its gon' fall
Cry in the rain so the pain is stalled
Its too dark, my world is in gloom
Chest cold, my soul howls at the moon
My mind spins, my sins crowd the room
My heart don't beat it just skips out of tune
I can't even hold down food I'm so rude
Bad attitude, what point I got to prove
Sometimes to win something you gotta lose
Love ain't dead my life is just dues

Looking for someone to love me
Now, now, now I'm looking for someone to love me yeah

I'm impatient, I'm so vacant
I'm so real with myself, I'm so blatant
I thirst more, I'm far from complacent
Always placing my heart last I'm paper chasing
Left craving the warmth of one touch
So whats money if you never had enough
I'm disgusted, people say I'm not to be trusted
Insomnia driven, my eyes crusted
So come and save my life if you can muster 
Up enough strength to show me how to love some
Body besides myself I crave comfort, 
Stars may align just right for us, 
Start a new life for us
Build a fortress beyond coffins

Come one you know just what I'm looking for

She's in line waiting
My guest list too long
I told her I would love her
Love her as forever
Forever's just a word
I put words together
Stepping on the stars, she pause and I know that
One day this show will end, applause
The strobe lights are dancing
We've taken all the chances
She question what we are
And I'll drink to the answer 'cause
My heart is out of service
My eyes turn black
I don't see love anymore I'm blind to the fact
I got my world in my pocket cause I ain't tryna drop it
The sky is at my neck, so I turn up my collar
My world spin around her
Cause its a whirl without her

When you know, like I know
When the sunlight falls down
There she goes

Strobe lights dance with the stars
And I just can't live without her
And she knows what she knows
And the rain is coming down
My heart is closed. I know she knows

And I always take my time
And when the lights fade
The lights they turn gray

I got wounds and scars

Dancing with the stars

What happened because
The rain is coming down
Now we trapped in the storm
I step right out of her spotlight
And into the strobe lights
I don't need your light

Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus
Shouldnt've been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, 
Gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep
Making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone I'm on her like a drug

Stuck in my head vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

Give my all, you take it from me (from me girl)
And don't even replace it for me (no)
I wish you just fake it for me (fake it)

Gettin' high all week, catch me in the V

In a fast car super bad broad back seat

Responsible for all this inner-city genocide

I can't identify with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin one breath
Outsiders looking in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single handedly carried me
Escaped clever through the fox hole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me

Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can’t face defeat (nope)

Still incomplete as I stand on my feet

But she want a photo, so I took a photo
Yeah, I took a picture with a IAm Foto Sosho
Yeah, you got a cold chick, but I got a colder ho
But she don’t really know shit, so I gotta show the ho
Hide your paper, yeah I’m stackin’ paper
Money to the ceiling, now I need a skyscraper
You are now, now rockin’ with
Will.I.Am and (Britney bitch)
Waka Flocka Flame, Lil’ Wayne, Hit-Boy, Diddy, bitch

When you hear this in the club
Just put your hands up
Just put your hands up
Just put your hands up
When we up in the club

Motherfuckers I said put your hands up
Turn the fuck up right motherfuckin’ now

Oh, it’s time to party
Oh, it’s time to party
Smokin’, drinkin’, no passin’ out
YOLO, I’mma shout it out
We party hard, we yell it out
Disrespect me, knock him out
Crack a smile, Pacquiao
Fuck the VIP, I’m in the crowd
Me and Britney, we actin’ wild
It’s Waka Flame, you know my style
This little chain like 40 thou'
All eyes on me, thugged out
Pop a bean, that’s the old me
Molly’s here, we don’t fight fair
My buzz big, like Lightyear
You ain't real, shorty, you can’t stand here
Friends, fans and family here
Outfit real, live with no fear
Turn the club into a mosh pit
Spend 20 bands, do a back flip
Girl, drop it low, shake that
My wrists rocky like A$AP
This a G mix and I laced that, Flocka!

When you hear this in the club
You’re gonna turn-turn it up (turn up bitch)

Hi! I’m Tunechi, I give the girls my room key
Money can’t buy you love, so I don’t pay for no pussy
I don’t pay these haters no mind, so fuckin’ call me cheap
I grab life by the horns, and that bitch went “beep-beep”
I swear right now I feel like ‘Pac, ‘cause all eyes on me
And I don’t mean to throw no salt but these niggas small fries to me
And my bitch bad like Britney, but I wish I had Britney
She remind me of my jeep, but I got a bad memory
And I’m feelin’ good, I’m lookin’ good, I’m smokin’ good, I’m sippin’
These hoes think they classy? Well that’s the class I’m skippin’
Got a party in my bedroom, that’s a party she ain’t missin’
I brought her by Will.i.am, but she kept callin’ him William
Only God can judge me, case closed
I got more hoes than Drake shows
I got this shit on lock, no escape doors
And I’ll make that bitch scream, and shout, and let it all out
I’ll put it in her backyard like a fuckin’ doghouse, Tunechi!

Scream and shout, and let it all out (yeah, yeah)
And scream and shout, and let it out (yeah)

Oh this the moment they feel ya?
We back on our get down
You see what it is
So lay down, Bad Boy, Blood Line
Get up, talk to 'em

I got tats all on my arm,
Racks on racks in the bank
Forgiatos on my Range, Pepsi blue my paint
All these girls be choosy,
Can't find a bitch who ain't
Haters they out ballin' like fishes in a tank
Stuntin' wit my whole crew, ball
Hangin' out the window when we roll up
You know when we come through, ball
Make it rain we don't give a fuck
'Bout what you say, I do this every day
Don't buy bottles, buy bottle case
Seem like every night my birthday
I can't help but get the cake

Feel like I was born for ballin' out
Live it up and just for fallin' out

Tattoos on my neck, half a mill in my car
Dream team I rap, just me and my dogs
Straight cash in that haircut
Sea Bass and that lamp chop
Met her at the bar
Tryin' to get some head shots
62 that Maybach, fake jewels don't play that
Take off like Blake Griff, money tall like A6
Never hit that red zone, baby I was airborne
Hoppin' out that Ghost
Sippin' red dot with a red bone
Trunk up in the back, drop the population
And I'm never fakin' Jacks,
You know I'm poppin' Aces
I'mma ball, Illuminati bank rolls
Suicidal Lan' doors, and two Italian tan hoes

Time is callin'

I'm flyin' around and I'm gettin' it
Like 90thou in my denim
Told a bitch I just met,
Write your problems down and I'll end 'em
I'm creepin' on a billi,
Got these niggas buyin' large lead
Bout to take my LA crib
And drop that bitch on Wall Street
Peep my watch and hand game,
Like Peach Ciroc and champagne
You buyin' jets, I could buy the Jets,
And I ain't speakin' 'bout no damn planes
This passion and pain fashion,
Matchin' my things catchin'
Action from things mackin',
Then flashin' my rings captain
Twin V's, thin tires, envy my entire
Catalogue, but don't have the heart
'Cause real kings build empires
Everything that I said nigga
Was everything that you saw
I did everything that I claim,
You ain't like us 'cause we ball

Diddy,"Yeah, yeah
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they ? me
Nigga's is jealous
Fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try sell us
Probably why I'm rebellious
To the fraud niggas, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll up and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and you're homie chilling and
You know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
Instead wait for them haters because they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small sucker, I ain't never really around squares
They say it levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bosses
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly that shit cold
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
And that was A1, they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't deem me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like ? but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Go ? all bust down, fuck clowns

My heart getting cold
Then the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day
Young lord knows

Dedicated, de-terminated and disciplined
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking I'm listening
When I be in the jungle the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling, that was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur
I was like told y'all
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's going I got your medulla
? I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he'll probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though ?
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did

Ayo
It gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you ""you acting different nigga""
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister, your mother, your father
That shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen you done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
You got raised, you done played in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son?
You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame?
You sure you want this power?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit
Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers
Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them
Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?
Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got
Don't let this money bring us down
Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats lets go

Uh, yeah
And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs
And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember somedays we ain't have nothing but live
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
And you main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant, Meta Peace and Gasol nigga
But i know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
And as long Pop is probably smiling
Imma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it

Then the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold

Gangsta distinguished, cool as a penguin
Got a team of them, honey feel free to bring with
G-5 waiting, fly away at my convenience
You seen Tip checking in a 5 star suite with some 5 star freaks
Gettin' high all week, catch me in the V
I was in the back when y'all sleep
In a fast car super bad broad back seat
That's me, see I'm nothing nice, fuck a couple nights

Diddy - Dirty Money,"So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Ain't nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
When you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Chorus: x2]
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly,
So many lonely sleepless nights,
I'm going through hell to convince you love me,
But never her approval no matter how I try,
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
But what am I to do when her parents do not try

So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say
Ooh

[Chorus: x2]

I've been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
My life ain't the same as it was,
Heart broke to the point, sometimes wanna end it,
If I can't have what mean most to me

So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say

[Chorus: x2]

(Diddy, Drizzy baby)
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn, tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became somethin' different
Its just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure

So selfishly
You can only show fear 
Unless you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh time, oh time has changed 
And I'm no longer wiling
You can see how my heart is bleeding
Oh yes

Diddy - Dirty Money,"I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming

I'm back where I belong,
Yeah I never felt so strong
(I'm back baby)
I feel like there's nothing that I can't try
And if you with me put your hands high
(Put your hands high)

If you ever lost a light before,
This ones for you
And you, the dreams are for you

I hear ""The Tears of a Clown""
I hate that song
I always feel like they talking to me when it comes on
Another day another Dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but its harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night the inevitable prolongs
Another day another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Taneisha I'll be back in the morn'
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place I belong

I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

""A House is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone (no)
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own
Pick up your phone, come on

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming, home

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
'Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
Is what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you big)
And here I stand, a better man! (a better man)
Thank you Lord (Thank you Lord)
Thank you all!

The hustle, I got that honest from my father
Mix me with violence, blend me with peace
Combine me with hate and I can't face defeat (nope)
I did it all in a week
Still incomplete as I stand on my feet
It take a lot to still dance to the beat
Skin more cold and callous than concrete
I love swimming but there's just one ski
In a rich man's cheap hotel with bed sheets
Uh ah, you know what I'm looking for

Look at the sky wonder when its gon' fall
Cry in the rain so the pain is stalled
Its too dark, my world is in gloom
Chest cold, my soul howls at the moon
My mind spins, my sins crowd the room
My heart don't beat it just skips out of tune

I'm so real with myself, I'm so blatant
I thirst more, I'm far from complacent
Always placing my heart last I'm paper chasing
Left craving the warmth of one touch
So whats money if you never had enough
I'm disgusted, people say I'm not to be trusted
Insomnia driven, my eyes crusted
So come and save my life if you can muster 
Up enough strength to show me how to love some
Body besides myself I crave comfort,

Start a new life for us

Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus
Shouldnt've been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart, 
Gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep
Making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone I'm on her like a drug

I'm off to play in Houston
And I'm too busy with the millions things I'm doing
You can't make up for what you've done
But you still try to be the one

Love me, love me
Feed the flame
If you want me back again

Burn into the sky
Higher and higher
Baby, can you play with fire

(Burn into the sky)
Love me, love me
(Far into the sky)
If you want me

Ooh, by the way, by the way
I've found someone who gives me space
Keeps me safe
Makes me sane
Found someone to take your place
Now I'm safe in his arms
And I decided only he can play with fire

Love me, Love me
Feed the flame
If you want me back again

Burn into the sky
Higher and higher
Baby, can you play with fire

I can't believe it's really you
(Love me, love me)
I hear you're doing really well
(If you want me)
Finally every tear has dried
(Love me, love me)
Can boys like you, boys like you

Elle aura sûrement pris le premier autocar
Et sur la Nationale sur les bords de la Loire
Elle voit des paysages se raconte des histoires

Elle m'oublie
Elle m'oublie
Elle m'oublie

Ses cheveux blonds serrés dans un chignon mal fait
Elle pense à Dieu sait quoi, le soleil disparaît
Et la nuit va venir, le chauffeur fatigué
Cherche un vieux restaurant où elle voudra dîner

Elle m'oublie

En regardant la table en me tordant les mains
Et moi je vais passer la nuit dans le jardin
A compter les étoiles, ca ira mieux demain

Demain matin bien sûr elle arrive à Paris
Elle retrouve les rues, ses parents, ses amis
Je lui donne trois semaines pour tomber amoureuse
Et devant son miroir elle est déjà heureuse

Didier Barbelivien,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Les Moulins de Mon Coeurn,1995

High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Didier Wampas,"Oh oui on me dit chanteur de droite
Et C’est tout c’qui restera de moi
Oh oui on me dit chanteur de droite
Et c’est moi qui ai l’esprit étroit
J'ai chanté la maladie d’amour
On s’rappel’ra que de ""je suis pour"" 

Et si tu veux être à la mode
Que tout l’monde t’ai dans son iPod
Suffit d’chanter Che Guevara
Et d’jouer à la Fête de l’Huma
Etre un chanteur populaire
Ça fait pas forcément l’affaire

Aujourd’hui si c’était à refaire
Je rechanterais les Ricains
Même si on me traite de chien
Même si on m'traite de moins que rien

Les femmes des années 80
Savent bien que ce n’est pas pour rien
Que j’ai chanté toutes ces années
Sans avoir mon nom dans Libé
Quand je regarde en arrière
Pas de raison de me sentir amer

Je n'étais pas l’seul à penser ça 
On ne peut pas tous être Jean Ferrat
La France je l’aime je n’y peux rien
Et les français me le rendent bien
Je ne dis pas que j’avais raison
Mais au moins c’était mes opinions

On a aussi des idéaux
On te traite de démago
Quand ce n’est pas de salaud
Quand ce n’est pas de facho


Aujourd'hui on ne me joue plus guère, le samedi dans les bals populaires
Je me sens comme un vieux paquebot, la France elle m'a laissé tomber
Comme si tous les fans de Sardou avaient un berger allemand",Chanteur de Droite,2011
Didier Wampas,"J'veux pas vivre vieux

Ce sera comme ça jusqu'au cercueil

Même si j'ai la foi
J'aimerais qu'une actrice
Se souvienne de moi
Mais je veux seulement tenir ta main éternellement
Oui je veux juste tenir ta main éternellement

J'irai pas à San Francisco
Ça ferait du mal à mon  ego
Je resterai tant qu'il le faut

Des fleurs et des citrons confits

Ce matin j'ai des bleus partout 
Comme si toute l'équipe des all blacks
Était passée sur mon âme

Sur mes bras et sur mon coeur
Sur mes espoirs et mes peines
Sur mes envies et ma folie

Ta voiture préférée

Plutôt que de chanter
Mais tu es parti

Ça fait bientôt 20 ans
Mais encore aujourd’hui 
Quand j'entends un disque 
J'ai envie de t'appeller
Pour avoir ton avis
Même si je l'connais

C'matin j'ai envie de relire
Les souffrances du jeune Werther
Car tu es parti, oui tu es parti

Heureusement que tu ne vois pas comment je joue de la guitare

Ça t'énerverait sûrement
Mais tu sais je fais de mon mieux
J'espère que tu es fier de moi

De toutes façons t'es toujours là

J’aime tes baisers
Ils sont magiques
Comme le serait
La plasticité mentale
D'une vie dans des sandales

Toi et moi

Tragique
Je veux t'aimer
Çe serait tragique
Si on vivait
La rusticité fractale
D'une vie dans les étoiles 
Qu'on aurait choisi de vivre
Sur le toit

Qui médite sur la plage
Sait bien que je ne partirais pas sans toi

Didier Wampas,"Je ressens parfois comme un espoir
Un orage mécanique 
Quand je pense à cette fille
Une fille qui la nuit se morfond
Quand bêtement elle oublie 
Elle oublie que c'est elle

Une fille qui préfère des chaussures à un Magritte
Et qui pleure quand elle a peur que je la quitte

Je ressens au fond de ma mémoire 
Un grand coup de canif
Quand je pense à cette fille
Une fille qui croit dormir pour rien
Quand elle oublie ses rêves 
Le matin au réveil 

Une fille qui préfère des chaussures à un Magritte
Une fille qui voudrait un amour en kit

Regarde autour de toi, regarde autour de toi

Lalalalala

Une fille  qui d'un sourire ferait plonger Wall Street
Elle me tue mais pourtant tous les juges l'acquittent

Regarde autour de toi, regarde autour de toi

Car je sais très bien qu'il n'y a qu'avec toi que je peux l'faire

Je sais je sais je suis un ange surtout quand ça m'arrange 
Et je suis beau comme une sirène
Le premier mercredi du mois
Et le jour où le soleil ne se lèvera pas
Moi j'arrêterai de t'aimer

Didier Wampas,"Je traverse Le Mans sans m’arrêter
J’aurais dû ne jamais m’y arrêter
Mais comme les gouttes d’eau sur les carreaux
On n’arrête pas une vie qui tourne
En rond sur un circuit depuis 24 ans
24 heures ou une après midi
À boire un thé ou manger à deux
Dans un champ ou bien sous la pluie.
Trop sûr de soi ou bien pas assez,
Des regrets ou bien des remords
Même si je sais que ce n’est pas vrai
Une voiture bleue, une vraie femme
Un ancien chagrin aujourd’hui éteint
Par l’amour plus grand, par l’amour plus grand

Surmonter un pêché tous les ans
La liberté totale sans rien à offrir
Je traverse Le Mans sans m’arrêter
Je ne peux même plus lire les panneaux
Je n’entends pas de musique
Je vois juste des étangs 
Je me sens un petit peu plus fort

J’ai traversé le Mans sans m’arrêter
Il y a si longtemps, au delà d’un rêve
J’ai traversé le Mans il y a si longtemps

Dido,"A young gentleman came riding past,
On a snow blue winters day,
He asked to drink by our fire
And I was pleased to let him stay,

He drank there quietly for a while,
And then he turned and said to me,

Your eyes are green,
Like summer grass,
Your lips are red,
Like a fresh cut rose,
Your hair is soft,
Like an Irish stream,
And your voice,
Is filled with sweet beauty

And the last words I heard him say

Were I shall return,
For you,
My love,
On Christmas Day

And the night will come,
But I won't sleep,
As I watch the stars that lead him,
I cannot place where he is,
But still my heart goes with him,
I'm saving all my Sunday clothes
For the day that I'll be leaving,
Father knows,
My sister knows,
And my friends,
They're happy for me,
And the priest he says,
You should thank God,
For the blessing,
Of such beauty

And the last words
I heard him say,

Were I shall return,
For you,
My love,
On Christmas Day
I shall return,
For you,
My love,
On Christmas Day

(On Christmas Day)

(I shall return for you my love)

And the last words
I heard him say
Were the last words
I ever
Heard him say

I shall return,
For you,
My love
On Christmas Day
I swear,
I will return,
On Christmas Day,
And yes,
I shall return,
On Christmas Day,
I shall return,
For you,
On Christmas Day
My love,
I will return,
On Christmas Day
I shall return,

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

Or tell you that
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and
Destruction to come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of it's over
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on

And I won't put my hands up and surrender

Dido,"Two weeks away feels like the whole world should have changed,
But I'm home now, and things still look the same
I think I'll leave it 'til tomorrow to unpack,
Try to forget for one night that I'm back in my flat
On the road where the cars never stop going through the night,
To a life where I can't watch the sun set
I don't have time
I don't have time

I've still got sand in my shoes,
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye,
Anything else would have been confused
But I want to see you again

Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanitation,
Run a bath and then clear up the mess I made before I left here
Try to remind myself that I was happy here,
Before I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away,
From the road where the cars never stop going through the night,
To a life where I can watch the sun set,
And take my time
Take all my time

I've still got sand in my shoes,
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye,
Anything else would have been confused
But I want to see you again

I want to see you again

I want to see you again

Two weeks away,
All it takes,
To change and turn me around, 
I've fallen
I walked away,
And never said,
That I wanted to see you,
Again

I've still got sand in my shoes,
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye,
Anything else would have been confused
But I want to see you again

I temporarily forgot there's better days to come

But I found, tonight, what I'd been warned about

Well it's taken me a while to see, you're not so special

So paper thin that one real feeling, could knock you down

And I've seen, tonight, what I'd been warned about
I'm gonna leave, tonight, before I change my mind

So see you when you're 40, lost and all alone
Being comforted by strangers you'll never need to know
Not sad because you lost me
But sad because you thought it was cool to be sad

And we make love, it seems a little desolate
It's hard sometimes not to look away
And think what's the point
When I'm having to hold this fire down

If you won't let me fall for you
Then you won't see the best that I would love to do for you
Instead you will be missing me when I go
'cause I'm bored of hanging out in your cold

And the world moves with me
When I feel lost I just slip away
Silently, quietly take my things and go
And think what's the point

To travel the world alone and live more simply

Dido,"""I have returned to the northern skies""

I have returned to the northern skies,
Where the summer had not touched
The clouds that pass above.
Oh, and I have returned to the somber grace
Of the days too early to come, and too early to stay.

Oh I have left a million stars,
And an ocean light, and clearly blue.
I have left the warmth of the sun
And a million adventures not yet begun.

[Chorus]
For once, there was beauty here for me
Under the wide Northern skies
And once, there was magic here for me
Under the wide Northern skies

I saw trees as green and as dark as blue
I break in poetry the deeper roots
And now I know, this is lonely country
And it leads me only, back to the sea

[Chorus]

I have returned, to Northern skies
Where summer hasn't touched
The clouds that pass above
I have returned, to the somber grace
Days too early to come, too early to stay

And once there was beauty here for me
Under the wide Northern skies
And once there was magic here for me
Under the wide Northern skies

The pages turn and the tale unfolds
He left me for another lady
She stood so tall and she never slept
There was not one moment he could regret
He left me for another lady

He took my hand one day and told me
He was leaving
Me disbelieving
And I
Had to let him go

And it was New York, New York
And she took his heart away oh my
And it was New York, New York
She had poisoned his sweet mind
Mmmm

The wolves they howled for my lost soul
I fell down a deep black hole
He left me for another lady
She poured the drinks and she poured the power
Diamond girl who could talk for hours
He left me for another lady

Now I am on my own
He told me he was leaving
And I was pleading
And I I I I I I I I
Had to let him go

And it was New York, New York
And she took his heart away oh my
And it was New York, New York
She had poisoned his sweet mind

The greatest times
I don't want to hear it
Your new laughter lines
I don't want to hear it
The new found friends she introduced you to
I don't wanna know them I just want to be with you
Please don't make me go to

Dido,"I thought it was done when I packed my bags and walked into the light
I picked the books I thought I should and closed the door behind
And when I handed back the keys I thought that I was free
No shame, no dirt, no surprises wait for me

I want to believe, where I began is not where I'll always be
But you're all I see and I carry you with me
You're all I see and I carry you with me

Thought it was safe to assume once I locked up the room
That I'd be gone for good but I would be back soon
Memories burned out still I'm smelling the fumes
Melodies turned down still I'm singing the tunes
Like a witch on a broom I wish I could fly fly away
Disappear into the ether find a hideaway
But the memories invade when I lie awake
Can't hide from yourself is what I'm trying to say
And by the way what would I be without my past
Only find the right number when I doubt my math
Avoid blunders only after I recount my last
Setbacks that don't kill me just amount to laughs
Anyway if I could turn back the hands of time
Would I change the events or change my mind
Wouldn't recognize myself without my doubts and fears
Got a feeling all I need is all right here

You're all I see and I carry you with me
You're all I see and I carry you with me

I've been told apples don't fall far from the tree
I hope they're wrong when they're talking about me
All I see are the ruins of a plan gone wrong
All I need is a reason to keep on and stay strong
Gotta couple old ghosts that won't leave me alone
Even after moving three thousand miles from home
Thought I shook 'em when I hit Brooklyn wasn't even looking
But they're putting their mark on everything I do
Find a few quieted moments and they creep back through
Infiltrated my dreams and held my sleep back too
I don't know where I could go without them following me
It seems everywhere I look they're all I see

You're all I need
You're all I need
And you're all I see and I carry you with me

When all you give me back is pain?
Why do we search it out

The sand lying on the floor
The bed upstairs, still unmade
The dust float in the light

Down the hall
And towels on the floor

Flying low and fast

All that saying you were scared

I walk down this easy path where shadows fall behind
And rest beneath the trees and wait for me

Lost where I belong, lost where I've gone
And lost is my new home, lost where I belong

Usually darkness gets to me, this place is mine
No idea what led me to more peace than home
Dressed in blue she takes me through, no doubt for me
To follow right behind the sun is blind and I can't see

Lost where I belong, lost where I've gone
And lost is my new home, lost where I belong
'Cause lost where I belong, lost where I've gone
And lost is my new home, lost where I belong

So I'm not to blame, I'm not to blame

Try to live how I believe
And of course I leave things behind that I'll regret
But there's time enough for new things yet, for new things yet

And brought me down

When I let my 3rd eye exaggerate
Freaky visions, I tell you what I see
Cold concrete scattered with dry leaves
You naked lying on the pavement
People are standing round with Lanny shoes
You can hardly move, you look sexy
All of a sudden, the streets are empty
You stand up, open your eye-lids
You in a trench coat, it's french, you look stylish
You walk in the silence, not sure what the time is
It's totally twilight, the sky is violet
An abandoned house, look ahead you see
Some open the door, yes it's me
With the meanest penis you ever seen
You on your period, with no tampon
You kneel down and get with the vibe
Your period blood has crystallized
You offer me the red crystal, it's ill
Grab hold of the mic tight, tonight's the night
The vibe is live, pump up the base
I got tentacles coming out my face
I rise into the air cut myself open
Warm blood pours down all round
I speak from the deep cut in between my thighs
You covered in blood rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
Rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
Rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
Rubbing your boobs, feeling nice
She's covered in blood rubbing your boobs, feeling nice

A chick on the floor on all fours, totally nude
In high heels, the vibes ill
She's hand-cuffed, ankle cuffed, steel collar
With a long lease attached to the ceiling
The scene's appealing, revealing weird feelings
Make you forget about what you believing
Another chick chilling against the wall
Flashing her boobs, legs spread with a nice vagina
And a long stick, there's a nice big
Painting above her head, expensive!
You check another chick on all fours
Chilling next to another chick lying on the floor
Legs spread in the middle of the corridor
Close shave, don't touch what you can't afford
The next-room's a bed room, you become two
What I mean is, you plus another you
You get down with yourself while I watch
Body buzzing like a bed of a billion bees
You kneel down in front of the other you
Time to learn something new
The one kneeling is a slave
Kneel for the master
Feel the warm hand on the back of your head
You got a tattoo on the back of your neck
An infinity sign that represents your past
Your master touches you on your tattoo
And removes your tattoo, now you brand new

There's nothing you not allowed to do here
Listen to me, the infinity tattoo is a key

Look around, the new room is fancy
Remove your fur coat, remove your panties
I'm rocking a suit and a black face mask
I ejaculate in champagne glass
Your precious flesh is so mysterious
Pierce your nipples with two long needles
Like a crucifix, take you to another level
While I get my freak on, the vibe is mental
Transcendental, we somewhere else now
Still rocking a mask, but I've taken off my suit
You rocking a mask too, shaking your nice boobs
I tell you I like you, you feel my piel
We start french kissing with flippin' long tongues
We somewhere else now, you dressed conservative
I transform into a big black god
Feel the realness, my dick's lank hard

As big as your arm, we somewhere else now

Lot of guys chilling behind you, blasts from the past
All rocking a mask, penises out
Drop your panties for the surgeon
I'm not a virgin, it's not a problem

You got two nice boobs and a penis too

Gryp the surgeon's milky butt-cheeks

Ripping and vipping your pip
Flip it inside-out

The real you won't see you denied
You got crazy sex appeal, all tied up
Kneeling on the pavement, you can't say shit
Your mouth is gagged, you surrounded by
A thousand guys totally under your spell
They all totally scared of the power you hold
You can changed the rules of the game and devour their souls
Now's the time girl
Let's head back into the outside world
The world of others, it's time to go back
The doors are stuck shut but the walls are beginning to crack
Uh! Now the walls are bleeding
It's all deceiving, you soaking wet
With no regrets, feel your body sweat blood
Peel off your old skin, time to get love

You arrive at the cemetery in time for the ceremony
I give you a hot kiss, grab hold of your ass cheeks
How'd you like to get laid on this
Tomb stone in the middle of the rain forest
My gaze puts you in a daze, I'm loving your long tongue
Look at your beautiful face, covered in hot come
Spread my wings block out the sun
Lie on my back, scope out your bum
My penis stays hard, you breathing heavily
I penetrate you, the feelings heavenly
Now bounce girl, you know it's hot
Bounce, bounce girl like, oh my god!
Totally freaky deaky phunky
Wad:e make you leave your body
Transport you to another dimension
You alone in the desert, totally nude
The silence is violent
You floating above the ground

Invisible energies penetrate
Every hole in your body while you levitate
You start coming apart, shape-shifting

Glued to the ninja like a red beam all night
After the show ninja gets rushed by a bunch of poppies
I tell miranda, here's some money go buy yourself a doppie

'Cause I was high all the time, stoned out of my little fucking mind
Misunderstood, lost and confused looking for a sign
All the popular kids at school were always super mean to me and made me cry
I never knew what I should do so I just walked away and said ""Fuck off and die""
They said that I'm weird, that I'm ugly, and that I suck
I knew that one day all of those kids would grow up to be boring as fuck

Die Apokalyptischen Reiter,"Geh nur gehe, gehe alle Wege
Führt mancher auch nur zu Sumpfesstege
Doch Weisheit oft lässt sich nur durch Schmerz erringen
Auf felsigem Grunde wirst du Opfer bringen

Per Aspera Ad Astra
Durch Ungemach muss jeder gehen
Um irgendwann die Sterne zu sehen

Aus Steinen, Holz, Moos sollst du etwas bauen
Kannst leider, musst nur dir selbst vertrauen
Ein Hindernis so einstweil’ schnell verschwunden
Als durch Müßiggang in dunklen Stunden

Wege führen nur zum Ziel am Ende
Gehst du viele, macht Erfahrung behände
Einfach kann, schwer wird’s wohl sein
Doch Lohn erntet so manche Pein",Per Aspera Ad Astra,2006
Die Apokalyptischen Reiter,"I am a rocket I am a gun
I am always on the run
I am possessed by a beautiful sickness

Give me money for life and action and
I bring the good vibes to your nation
I guarantee you satisfaction
I am the only real attraction

Rock n roll means soul
Rock n roll is god’s tool
Rock n roll is what you need
Rock n roll is what we preach

Hide your wives, I know they can’t resist
If we come to your town at next
To bring you what the gods made us for
Rock n roll the revelation

Come on baby feel the ecstasy
Don’t let your body rest, make you free
We give you a new religion

Die Apokalyptischen Reiter,"Roll roll roll roll my heart
A never ending story
Roll roll roll roll my heart
Over all the seas
Roll roll roll roll me heart
Til the end comes to me

I'm the man who will know every town
Every country, every crowd
A serious business (that) I call me own
I play for you holy tunes

I carry no weapons I'm armed with dreams
Just listen if you have to know what it means
Maybe I can give you hope if you need some
A musicman is giving love to you

The drug I shot now in your brain
Is the taste of freedom, check your leader
I don't wanna see anyone in chains
Let me be your dealer

Die Apokalyptischen Reiter,"Der Teufel trat an meine Wiege
Und stillte mich mit schwarzer Milch.
Der Teufel war auch an deinem Horte
Und gab dir etwas mit.

Er gab dir eine Seele,
Sammt den Sinnen und Verstand
Nun zahlst do dafÃ¼r ein Leben lang
Den bitteren Pfand.

Die gÃ¼ldene Sonne bringt Leben und Wonne
Die Finsternis weicht
Der Morgen sich zeiget, die RÃ¶te aufsteiget
Der Monde verbleicht.

Auch Hoffnung tat er in den faulig Brei
Auf das dein Flehen ihm zum VergnÃ¼gen sei
Sehnsuht, Gier und Neid nagen nun an dir
Durch tiefschwarze Nacht schallt's nun ewig
Komm geh mit mir.

Die Apokalyptischen Reiter,"Jemand hat die Feuer brennen lassen

Hat dabei nicht lange nachgedacht

Blutig rot hinauf ins All
Und wie Glas zerspringt der Himmel
Sterne fallen überall

Der Mond ist rot vom Sternenblut
Und auch in mir ist Fieberglut
Es glüht das ganze Firmament
Das kommt weil meine Seele brennt

Jemand hat den Himmel angezündet
Hat dabei die Nacht zum Tag gemacht
Ich bin von diesem Glanz erblindet
Dieses Licht hat mich entfacht
Bis ich ausgebrannt verlösche
Werd ich brennen diese Nacht

Der Mond ist rot vom Sternenblut
Und auch in mir ist Fieberglut
Es glüht das ganze Firmament
Das kommt weil meine Seele brennt

Doch aus Glut und weißer Asche
So ist es mir zugedacht
Werd ich heute neu geboren
Auferstehen diese Nacht

Es glüht das ganze Firmament
Das kommt weil meine Seele brennt

Micha reitet schon seit Wochen, von der Sonne tief gebräunt
Seit er seine Braut verließ, ist sein Pferd sein einziger Freund

Dann hab' ich sie nach Haus gebracht
Und dann vor ihrer Tür bekam ich einen Kuss dafür

Wir waren verliebt doch alles das ist jetzt vorbei
Denn sie liebt dich und darum gebe ich sie frei

Du warst mit ihm essen, natürlich im Ritz
Bei mir gab's nur Currywurst mit Pommes Frites

Er kriegt das, was ich nicht hab
Ich hasse ihn, wenn es das gibt

Ich hielt sie fest im Arm, denn es war sehr kalt 
Auf einer Lichtung blieben Wir stehen 
Sie gab mir einen Kuss, und alles war schön

Neben uns landete ein UFO im Gras 
Ich dachte „Vorsicht Kamera, Verstehen sie Spaß?"" 
Doch dann ging eine Klappe auf und sie sprangen raus
Kleine grüne Männchen, und sie sahen böse aus

Mein ganzes Leben hab ich nicht an sie geglaubt 
Außerirdische haben mein Mädchen geraubt

Mein ganzes Leben hab ich nicht an sie geglaubt

Ich rief bei ihren Eltern an, doch sie war nicht zuhaus' 
Das ganze sah verteufelt nach Entführung aus

Jetzt sitz' ich jeden Abend an der Stelle, wo es geschah,
Ich warte auf mein Mädchen, doch sie ist nicht mehr da
Neulich kam ein Brief, ich glaube er war von ihr
""Schönen Gruß, mir geht's gut, und ich glaub ich bleibe hier""

Als ich neulich durch den Canyon ritt
Da folgten mir Indianer, und sie waren zu dritt
Ich gab meinem Hengst die Sporen
Doch sie kriegten mich, und ich war verloren
Zwei hatten Pfeil und Bogen, einer ein Beil, und ich wusste:
Die waren auf meine Kopfhaut geil

Sie sagten, du kannst gehn, aber deine Kopfhaut bleibt hier
Du kannst gehn, aber deine Kopfhaut bleibt hier
Wir kamen in ihr Dorf, und da sagten sie zu mir, sie sagten
Du kannst gehn, aber deine Kopfhaut bleibt hier

Und ich sagte, meine Herren, dies ist ein freies Land
Sie können das gern mit meinem Anwalt ausmachen
Da fingen die Rothäute an zu lachen
Sie erklärten, meine Meinung wäre ihnen scheißegal
Und sie banden mich an den Marterpfahl

Du kannst gehn', aber deine Kopfhaut bleibt hier

Sie gaben mir noch ein Ultimatum bis um vier, sie sagten

Diese Fluchtmöglichkeit ließ ich mir nicht entgehn'
Ich zerbiss meine Fesseln und ich rannte los

Ein Indianer warf sich auf mich, so dass ich fiel
Es ging zu wie bei einem Rugbyspiel

Du kannst gehn', aber deine Kopfhaut bleibt hier
Er kämpfte wie ein Tiger in seiner Gier
Er sagte, du kannst gehn', aber deine Kopfhaut bleibt hier

Mal geht es dir schlecht, dann gehts dir wieder gut
Ich jedenfalls trag jetzt immer einen Hut

Gabi trägt gern enge Röcke,

Was ist IN und was ist OUT,
Denke nach, denn das ist wichtig

Machst du irgendwas nicht richtig (Machst du irgendwas verkehrt)

Reumütig sagt Gabi: Ich lieb dich, wie du bist

Ihr Mädchen, ihr Aachener Mädchen
Es sind doch Mädchen hier heute Abend
Okay, ganz cool, ganz easy
Stellt euch vor 
Ihr habt euch gerade mit eurer besten Freundin in 'ner Deta getroffen
Und ihr habt ein bisschen diskutiert 
Und seid dann mit dem Schluss ""neue Männer braucht das Land"" auseinander gegangen
Und ihr seid allein auf dem Heimweg
Ihr seid allein auf dem Heimweg in einem Dunklem Park
Und plötzlich kommt er:
Schwarzes Bauch, Schwarzes Füß, Schwarzes Gesicht
Über und über hässlich, hässlich, ein Neandertaler, ein echter Neandertaler 
Und ihm steht die Lust ins Gesicht geschrieben, sie sticht ihm aus den Augen
Und er geht hin und er geht hin zu euch und sagt:
""Hey Baby, ich will bumsen und zwar jetzt und zwar sofort und zwar hier auf der Stelle.""

Okay
Und dann holt ihr eine Nagelfeile raus
Dann holt ihr aus eurer Handtasche
Weil schließlich seid ihr ja gewiefte Frauen
Junge Frauen
Eine ein meter lange Heckenschere 
Und ihr nehmt die Heckenschere und klappt sie auf
Und dann sagt ihr zu dem Unholt (das bin ich)
Zwei worte ihr sagt eins zwei drei vier:

Schwanz ab Schwanz ab runter mit der Männlichkeit 
Zwei Wörter
Schwanz ab Schwanz ab (nur die Mädchen)
Schwanz ab Schwanz ab
Schwanz ab Schwanz ab

Okay
Also so geht das natürlich nicht
Ich meine, ich in meiner Rolle als Vergewaltiger nicht wahr davor hab ich keine Angst
Ich meine Mädchen der will euch an die Wäsche
Das muss schon ein bischen gewaltiger kommen,
Ein bischen Männerverachtender
Ungefär so laut wie ihrs jetzt macht

Schwanz ab Schwanz ab
Lauter
Schwanz ab Schwanz ab
Schleudert ihm die Verachtung für die Jahrtausende Patriotische Art ins Gesicht
Schwanz ab Schwanz ab
Das klingt richtig gut

Okay
Liebe Mädchen merkt euch das
Komm wir nun
Zu den
Jungs (Jubeln)
Hi Jungs

Ihr wisst ja wie das ist,
Ihr wart den ganzen Abend mit den Kollegen saufen,
Weil Deutschland schon wieder in der Europameisterschaft verloren hat
Ich meine ihr hättet das doch viel besser gemacht klar klar
Aber jetzt, jetzt wollt ihr auch mal ""einlochen"" (dreckiges Lachen)
Nicht umsonst ist in Müllermilch jede menge EIWEIß drin
Und das muss man ja auch irgendwie wieder loswerden (hehehe)
Und das war das Geheimrezept von Casanova
Ihr lauft da und ihr merkt, das eure Jeans eure Karotten-Jeans 
Doch ein bisschen eng ist in der Leistengegend
Und da steht sie mit den Maßen 104-105-104
Aber wer wird er kritisch sein 
Und ihr denkt euch ""Baby du bist es""
Und dann sagt ihr es auch:
""Baby, du bist es""
Aber leider leider leider
Kennt das Mädchen

A) Die Ärzte
Und B) hat sie 7 Jahre lang eine Gärtnerschule besucht
Und sie hat zufällig die alte rostige Heckenschere dabei (hehe)
Und ihr denkt oh man ich und mein großes Maul

Und sie sagt:""Junge jetzt drehen wir den Spieß mal um
Zeig mir deine 5 Zentimeter""
Und du sagst:""Nein es sind 6""
""Nein es sind 5, 4, 3, 2""
Und ihr habt Angst

Und nun ruft das Mädchen die beiden verheerenden Worte Schwanz ab und gibt ihr alles
Und ihr müsst versuchen einen Dialog mit ihr anzufangen
Ihr müsst zu schein auf sie eingehen (um sie nachher in der Bude richtig scharf zu machen)
Denn merke: wer auf Frauen eingehen kann, der kann auch einlochen

""Schwanz ab Schwanz ab"" und jetzt kommt euer Auftritt:
""Runter mit der Männlichkeit""

Die Jungs:
Runter mit der Männlichkeit

Ey Jungs, die will euch an den Zipfel, ja was macht ihr denn
Ihr müßt singen:

Runter mit der Männlichkeitswahn
Runter mit der Männlichkeitswahn
Lauter
Runter mit der Männlichkeitswahn
Lauter
Runter mit der Männlichkeitswahn

Okay alles klar

Jungs ihr habt's begriffen, wie nicht anders zu erwarten
Und jetzt der Fruchtbare Dialog: 
Bela erläutre die Spielregeln:
Also die Mädchen wie gesagt 
In der irrigen Annahme sie können nochmal irgendwas verhindern 
Schleudern ihren Kampfruf ""Schwanz ab"" dem imaginären Vergewaltiger entgegen

Der imaginäre Vergewaltiger seines Zeichens Psychologie-Student im 10. Semester 
Weiß natürlich ganz genau wie er mit euch umgehen muss (Verbal)
Und dann gibt's n' Dialog, was dann später zum Monolog wird, 
Und irgendwann wird's dann ein Baby (oder gar Langweilig)

Die Atzen,"Was ist los?
Es ist Party angesagt!

Die Saison ist eröffnet,
Es ist ein wahres Spektakel,
Denn alle komm'n weil es abgeht.
Das ist 'ne riesengroße Party.

Reißt die Arme in den Himmel
Und schwenkt sie über den Kopf.
Mann, wir sind erst am Ziel,
Wenn der Schweiß von der Decke tropft.

Die Wände schwitzen, alle springen,
Alles was wir lieben!
Wir lassen uns das gottverdammte Feiern nicht verbieten.
Wie ein kranker Haufen
Raufen wir uns, Atzen lasst es krachen.
Die Spießer sind geschockt
Und packen ganz schnell ihre Sachen.

Wir lassen uns nicht verarschen.
Wir tanzen und wir toben.
Hebt die Hände nach oben
Und dann lasst uns Disco Pogen!!

Werd's dir erklären, doch dann mach erst den Beat, Digga
Das ist der Bass und die Snare schießt ein Loch durch die Stirn
Durch dein Ohr dringt der Beat, dein Gehirn zum Erfrieren
Doch Hausmarke von den vieren wird dich auftauen
Bist du dann unten mit mir werd' ich zu dir aufschauen
Das ist der Weg und das Ziel ist das gleiche
Erreiche was du willst, meine Skills kriegst du nur über meine Leiche
Braucht keine Sau, Mann, das kannst knicken
Hier kommt der Plan, Hausmarke geht jetzt picknicken

Ich bin der Picknicker

Ich bin der Picknicker

Kein Scheiß, Mann, jeder weiß, Mann
Ich bin der Picknicker

Props an die Massiven, an die Kopfnicker
Ich bin der Picknicker, klicker klicker
Ist der Groschen jetzt gefallen?
Nein, dann werd' ich weiter lallen bis es alle schnallen
Fein, wer mich also noch nicht kennt rennt vehement inkompetent
Durch die Welt, weil er mich für etwas hält, was mir nicht gefällt
Denn so ein Picknick mit Familie im Freien
Ist mir in diesem Fall 'ne Nummer zu klein
Fein, meine Familie muss größer sein
Die Partypeople, die zu Hip Hop Musik tanzen und schreien
Die lad ich ein und wir feiern permanent
Das nur als Argument warum man mich den Picknicker nennt

Ladi dadi wie slick Rick
Mag ich die Party, doch ich nenn' sie Picknick
Also spar dir die Kritik und verstrick dich nicht
Weil es kein falsch oder richtig gibt was wichtig ist
Ist nicht das wie sondern das wann und das wo
Es gibt kein Contra nur Pro
Denn du kommst sowieso auf Grund des hohen Niveaus
Wir geben Gas und haben Spaß wie Markus
Doch nicht im Maserati, sondern mit Benz und Ford Taunus
Fahren wir raus auf irgend 'ne Wiese im Stadtpark zu feiern
Das hieße nur Stress mit den Spießern
Denn die können nicht verstehen wie Leute abgehen
Die vor 'nem Soundsystem mit fünfzigtausend Watt stehen

Ich bin der Picknicker
Kein Scheiß, Mann, jeder weiß, Mann

Und wer jetzt immer noch nichts von meinem Picknick mitkriegt
Drück ich 'nen Knopf an seinem Kopf wie beim Tippkick
Dann tritt er Schritt für Schritt hinein in meinen Trip
Und ich nehm' ihn mit bis er mitwippt
Und hier wippt 'ne ganze Menge, seh' ich ins Gedränge
Hänge ich mit meinem Blick an der Enge ihrer T-shirts fest
Wenn ich dann Beats hör', lässt mich das los
Lästig ist dann bloß, dass ich nicht mehr weiß wie ich heiß
Rede Scheiß, mir wird heiß
Und der Schweiß auf der Stirn ist nicht nur vom Tanzen
Doch im großen und ganzen wieder gute Aktion
Das war das letzte Wort der Picknicker Party Fraktion

Macht alles Sinn du weißt genau
Du stehst nicht im du bist der Stau

Schieb dir die Schuld in die Schuhe oder schüttel sie ab

Also gebt uns ruhig die Schuld für eure Stimmung

Mein Bewusstsein öffnet sich den geistigen Wahrheiten
Und ich profitiere davon zu jeder Zeit

(Hallo hallo hallo hallo hallo hallo hallo hallo)
(holla holla holla holla)

Hallo!
Smu D-O mein Name,
""Mach dich frei"" der Titel meiner Sprechgesangsbestandsaufnahme.
Wie viele Menschen bin auch ich neuen Reizen ausgesetzt
Und manches Dogma hat sich dabei schon in mein Gehirn geätzt.

Doch warum neigt der Mensch zur Stabilität,
Zu Rivalität, die Individualität verschmäht?
Den Geist auf Diät gesetzt
Aufgebläht mit Vorurteilen fern der Realität,

Seine Kapazität liegt in der Kreativität
Seine Qualität liegt in der Virtuosität,
Vitalität, Originalität, Genialität,
Intensität, mit der er deine Seele berät.

Unkompliziert expandiert dein Geist unisoliert
Das heißt wenn du ihn befreist von dem
Was ihn drangsaliert mit dem er kollidiert
Was ihn infiziert und ihn dann blockiert
Egal was passiert dein Geist wird niemals pensioniert

Mach dich frei

OK, Weisheit ist der Schlüssel, doch wo ist das Schloss?
Ich weiß, du willst bis ganz nach oben,
Doch du musst durchs Erdgeschoss
Dein Geist braucht Energie und Erregung und Bewegung
Denn Erfahrung ist Ernährung und Wissen ist Vermehrung
Ich erkenn's
Und trainiere meinen Geist doch ich ergänz',
Dass Intelligenz nicht in Konkurrenz steht
Die Konsequenz ist sich nicht ans Limit zu bewegen und sich aufzuputschen
Denn es ist so leicht auf dem Lebensglatteis auszurutschen.

Gehasst geliebt gesiegt versiebt
Du bist ein Teil von dir
Und ein Teil von dem was dich umgibt
Die Sucht nach Anerkennung und die Sucht nach Harmonie
Treiben in die Flucht und in Gedankenbürokratie

Und mitten im Konsum
Kommt dann die Isolierung
Was ist Illegalität, was ist Legalisierung?
Klopf klopf drück auf den Knopf! Mach ihn auf den Topf!
Stopf' und gieße Anarchie in deinen Kopf, Tropf!

Hör' mir das Tape nochmal an, weil ich's zurückspul'
Denn das ist meine Mucke alter die geht ab sag ich dir
Komm mit zum Vorverkaufsschalter Mann und schnapp' sie dir
Die Karten die auf dich warten
Gekauft von dem gesparten Geld
Durch die ganze Welt für meine Fahrten
Weil es mir gefällt
Die Band zu erleben
Die Ideen, die sie mir geben zu leben
Mich den Liedern hinzugeben
Mit Postern zu umkleben
Die T-shirts gut zu pflegen
Die Platten aufzulegen
Meine Eltern überreden
Bis sie sagen meinetwegen
Wenn sie mich fragen weswegen
Dann fällt mir das überlegen nicht schwer
Denn sie sind gut und deshalb populär

Sie stehen an jeder Ecke, aber nicht bei mir
Denn das gedudel dieser Säcke steht mir echt bis hier
Denn jede Sau kennt sie aus dem TV
Und aus dem Radio und so
Dringt ihr Gelall ihre Show
Kurz überall umgeben sie dich umzingeln dich
Berieseln und umringeln dich
Die alten Sachen fand ich ja ganz gut die neuen nicht
Mit ihren miesen Tricks könn', die mich nicht locken
Weil ich weiß, die können nichts nur Kohle abzocken
Im Moment ham sie wohl genug in ihrer Band davon
Trend ist auch ein Argument, weil meine Schwester kennt sie schon
Doch irgendwann sind sie dran und dann kennt sie keiner mehr
Gestern niemand morgen tot und dazwischen was

Lass die andren dran
Hau mich an und dann nimm mein Bild von deiner Wand
Und schau mich an
Und dann nimm mein Wort aus dein Verstand
Und hör' mich an
Und dann gib mir deine Hand und mach dich locker
Und sei kein Oberstübchenhocker

Dann hast du vergessen dass die Dinge hier ganz anders laufen

Denn jeder Tag ist gleich lang, doch unterschiedlich breit
Sagenhafter Rhythmus, meine Stimme ein Genuss
Und es gibt 'n Haufen Dinge, die ich tun muss
Ich muss morgens aufstehen, den Wecker erst mal ausdrehen
Ins Badezimmer laufen und dann in den Spiegel sehen
Muss dann erst mal duschen, den Rasierer nehmen
Denn ich kann es auf den Tod nicht ab wenn Schnurrbartstoppeln stehen
Dann muss ich Frühstück machen, viele gute Sachen,
Schalt das Radio ein und dann muss ich furchtbar lachen
Denn diese scheiß Popmusik kann man besser machen
Spül' den Kaffee runter durch die Kehle durch den Rachen
Rein in die Klamotten, von Reebok mir gestellt

Willste mich mal sprechen sage ich, tut mir leid
Denn ich haben jetzt beim besten Willen keine Zeit

Tausend Mark gehen noch, mehr nicht
Kann ich locker machen, wirklich, ehrlich
Was, so wenig? Leg' noch dreihundert drauf
Und er sagt ja und er macht die Kasse auf
Dann muss ich mich beeilen und muss noch platten kaufen
Dann muss ich noch zur Post und zum Studio laufen
Dann muss ich wieder weiter, muss im Stau stehen
Und muss dann mit dem Bärchen noch 'n kleines Ding drehen
Dann muss ich das probieren, muss auch noch promovieren
Aber anschließend muss ich noch telefonieren
Irgend noch 'was essen darf ich nicht vergessen
Aber irgendwie ist die Zeit zu knapp bemessen
Muss den ganzen Tag mit dem Auto rumrauschen
Muss mich mit jenem treffen und Adressen tauschen
Willste mich mal sprechen sage ich, tut mir leid
Denn ich habe jetzt beim besten Willen keine zeit

Geld verdienen und wieder ausgeben
Musste machen, Mann, damit musste leben
Auf der Bank immer hin und her buchen
Und dann muss ich noch nach den Auszügen suchen
Muss noch steuern zahlen, dann muss ich zu den Wahlen
Wie das dann ausgeht kann ich mir jetzt schon ausmalen
Doch ist mir egal, was die da oben treiben
Denn ich muss noch zurück und noch 'n Text schreiben
Doch halt, keine Zeit, muss das Date rauskicken
Und muss stattdessen paar Demos verschicken
Dann muss ich weiter fahren, muss dann noch zur Tanke
Dreißig Liter, Büchse Coke, hier die Mücken, danke

Es ist schon wieder Freitag, es ist wieder diese Bar
Und ich muss dir jetzt erzählen, was mir widerfahren ist
Jetzt seh' ich die Zukunft positiv denn ich bin Optimist
Moment was geht, ich sag's dir ganz konkret
Am Wochenende hab ich mir den Kopf verdreht
Ich traf eine junge Frau die hat mir ganz gut gefallen
Und am Samstag in der Diskothek ließ ich die Korken knallen
Sie stand dann so dabei und wir ham uns unterhalten
Und ich hab sie eingeladen denn sie hat sich so verhalten
Wir ham viel Spaß gehabt viel gelacht und was ausgemacht
Ham uns nochmal getroffen und den Nachmittag zusammen verbracht
Wir gingen mal ins Kino hatten noch ein Rendezvous
Und hast du sie ausgeführt? He gehört ja wohl dazu
Sie ist so elegant, sie hat auch allerhand
Du solltest sie wirklich mal treffen denn ich find' sie sehr charmant

Ist es die da? die da am Eingang steht
Oder die da? die dir den Kopf verdreht
Ist es die da? die mit 'm dicken Pulli an Mann
Nein es ist die Frau die Freitags nicht kann

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, oder die da?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Oder die da? Nein, Freitags ist sie nie da

Herzlichen Glückwunsch Smudo, toi toi toi
Du kannst dir sicher sein, dass ich mich für dich freu
Ich selber bin auch froh, und falls es dich interessiert
Mir ist am Wochenende was ganz ähnliches passiert
Es war Sonntag, und ich trinke Tee in 'nem Kaffee
Als ich dieses schöne Wesen an dem Tresen stehen seh
Gesell ich mich dazu und habe'n Tee für sie bestellt
Na ja, ich gebe zu, ich hab getan, als hätt ich Geld
Doch alles lief wie geschmiert was mache ich mir Sorgen?
Denn wir reden und verabreden uns für Übermorgen
Und ich wollt mit ihr ins Kino gehen, stattdessen waren wir essen
Denn sie hatte den Film schon gesehen, ich hielt's für angemessen
Sie ins Restaurant zu führen, Separé mit Kerzenlicht
(Und hat sie die Rechnung bezahlt?) Natürlich nicht
Doch sie sagte zu mir noch, dass wir jetzt miteinander gehen
Und seitdem wart ich darauf, sie wiederzusehen
(Hey, ist es die da, die da am Eingang steht?
Oder die da, die dir den Kopf verdreht?
Ist es die da, die mit'm dicken Pulli an, Mann?)
Nein es ist die Frau, die freitags nicht kann

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, oder die da?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Oder die da? Nein, Freitags ist sie nie da

(Wer ist sie?)
(Wer ist sie?)
(Wer ist sie?)
(Wer ist sie?)

Tja, Thomas (tja) da haben wir beide viel gemeinsam
Seit letztem Wochenende sind wir beide nicht mehr einsam
(Gehst du mit ihr zusammen? Äh, ich hab mir vorgenommen
Möglichst bald mit ihr zusammen zu kommen)
Viel Spaß damit (Danke!) Doch eins gibt mir zu denken
Warum muss ich ihr die ganze Zeit nur Geschenke schenken?
(Wem sagst du das? Ich bin schon wieder blank
Doch dafür hat meine jetzt neue Klamotten im Schrank)
Hey, bei mir kam 'se neulich mit 'nem neuen Teil an
Und dabei hab ich mich noch gefragt, wie sie sich das leisten kann
Und ich hab frei am Freitag und sie ist nicht da
(Äh, Moment mal Smudo, da ist meine ja)
Wo? (Es ist die da, die da am Eingang steht)
Was? Das ist die da, um die es sich doch bei mir dreht
(Was? Die da? Und wer ist dieser Mann?)
Ich glaub, das ist der Grund, warum sie freitags nicht kann!

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die
Ist es die da, die da, die da, genau die da!

Warum hat sie das und woher hat sie die Adresse
Fragen dies fragen das und die Vier du sagst was

Du bist doch der der sagt das er alles unter Kontrolle hat

Doch als einen Mensch der tat kenn' ich dich leider nicht
Ich höre deine Worte und ich sehe was passiert
Doch das Chaos ist der König der das Land regiert
Woran liegt's das die Dummheit wieder aufmarschiert
Und der Bürger seinen Blick für die Realität verliert

Zwischendurch manchmal Urlaub denn ich bin ja schon fast dreißig
Ist die Stimme dann im Eimer keine Kippen warme Suppen
Ich hab schon mal geraucht aber das waren keine Fluppen
Ich sag immer locker bleiben das ist unsere Devise
Sich um jeden Scheiß kümmern man da kriegt man doch 'ne Krise
Definieren was ich mach das kann ich eindeutig nicht
Inne Schublade stecken machen andere für mich
Denn ich bin du der Smudo 
Der Mikrofonverbraucher-Koffeinjunkieexmariechenkettenraucher
Käm' ich zu was bin ich wär' mein Kreuz nicht angestellt
Denn ich ist ganz einfach bin zu geil für diese Welt
Das Leben ist so einfach du brauchst nur die Energie
Doch das gehört nicht hier hin das ist Philosophie
Jeden morgen geh ich duschen das ist gut für die Hygiene
Fresse auf Wasser rein dann putz' ich mir die Zähne
Du hast doch nichts dagegen",Smudo Schweigt Aus,1993
Die Fantastischen Vier,"Der Tag fängt an und dann fragst du dich wo geht's lang
Was will ich was mach ich jetzt wie fang' ich's an und voller Tatendrang
Machst du die Augen auf mach sie auf mach die Augen auf und dann
Sagst du „Mann, oh Mann, was ich machen kann“
Kann ich machen du wirst lachen so einfach sind die Sachen
Zu betrachten und ich weiß dass du weißt du kannst es machen
Denn die vierundzwanzig Stunden sind die Zeit die du hast
In der befreit vom Ballast du die Zufriedenheit verprasst
An wen egal wen was den nein egal an wen
Was dir ist's egal wenn sich die Leute auf die Nerven gehen
Denn du bist locker cool wie 'ne Beruhigungstablette
Und nicht wie der Typ der hupt weil du nicht fährst wie er's gern hatte
Die Musik ist ihm zu laut weil er aus dem Fenster schaut
Doch dieser Tag ist deine Party, die dir kein Nachbar versaut
Du bist der Chef auf deinem Fest, du bist der Boss, du bist der Held
Was kümmert dich der Rest du bist zu geil für diese Welt

Die Nacht ist um und stumm denkst du dir was kommt rum
Wenn ich rumhäng' wenn ich abhäng' frage nehm' ich mir das krumm
Du machst die Augen auf, mach sie auf, mach die Augen auf
Und dann fragst du „Mann o Mann ob ich das auch so machen kann“
Kann ich sein wie die andern, muss ich wie die andern sein?
Oder muss ich alleine wandern, gibt es eine Antwort, nein
Du schaust in dich allein hinein und plötzlich wird es still
Hey, ich weiß was ich bin und ich muss machen was ich will
Wann jetzt Mann wann jetzt richtig denn du sagst ich kann
Alles andre ist nicht wichtig jetzt kommt es auf dich an
Denn du brauchst nicht zu vergleichen denn was gibst schon zu erreichen
Lass die Zeit deines Lebens nicht nur einfach so verstreichen
Sonst verschwindet sie ist weg kommt nicht wieder ist ums Eck
Ohne Sinn und ohne Zweck, Dreck wie ein ungedeckter Scheck
Egal was der Mensch von gegenüber von dir hält
Da stehst du drüber warum du bist zu geil für diese Welt

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Hallo Thomas (Hallo, alles klar?)
Klar. Es ist schon wieder Freitag, es ist wieder diese Bar
Und ich muss dir jetzt erzählen, was mir widerfahren ist
Jetzt seh ich die Zukunft positiv, denn ich bin Optimist
(Äh, Moment, was geht?) Ich sags dir ganz konkret
(Aha) Am Wochenende hab ich mir den Kopf verdreht
Ich traf eine junge Frau, die hat mir ganz gut gefallen
Und am Samstag in der Diskothek ließ ich die Korken knallen
Sie stand dann so dabei und wir ham' uns unterhalten
Und ich hab sie eingeladen, denn sie hat sich so verhalten
Wir haben viel Spaß gehabt, viel gelacht und was ausgemacht
Haben uns nochmal getroffen und den Nachmittag zusammen verbracht
Wir gingen mal ins Kino, hatten noch ein Rendezvous
(Und hast du sie ausgeführt?) Hey, gehört ja wohl dazu
Sie ist so elegant, sie hat auch allerhand
Solltest sie wirklich mal treffen, denn ich find sie sehr charmant
(Hey ist es die da, die da am Eingang steht?
Oder die da, die dir den Kopf verdreht?
Ist es die da, die mit'm dicken Pulli an, Mann?)
Nein es ist die Frau, die freitags nicht kann

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, oder die da
Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
oder die da? Nein, freitags ist sie nie da

Herzlichen Glückwunsch Smudo, toi toi toi
Du kannst dir sicher sein, dass ich mich für dich freu
Ich selber bin auch froh, und falls es dich interessiert
Mir ist am Wochenende was ganz ähnliches passiert
Es war Sonntag, und ich trinke Tee in 'nem Kaffee
Als ich dieses schöne Wesen an dem Tresen stehen seh
Gesell ich mich dazu und hab'n Tee für sie bestellt
Na ja, ich gebe zu, ich hab getan, als hätt ich Geld
Doch alles lief wie geschmiert - was mache ich mir Sorgen?
Denn wir reden und verabreden uns für Übermorgen
Ich wollt mit ihr ins Kino gehen, stattdessen waren wir essen
Denn sie hatte den Film schon gesehen, ich hielt's für angemessen
Sie ins Restaurant zu führen, Separé mit Kerzenlicht
(Und hat sie die Rechnung bezahlt?) - Natürlich nicht
Doch sie sagte zu mir noch, dass wir jetzt miteinander gehen
Und seitdem wart ich darauf, sie wiederzusehen
(Hey, ist es die da, die da am Eingang steht?
Oder die da, die dir den Kopf verdreht?
Ist es die da, die mit'm dicken Pulli an, Mann?)
Nein es ist die Frau, die freitags nicht kann

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, oder die da?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
oder die da? Nein, freitags ist sie nie da

Tja, Thomas (tja) da haben wir beide viel gemeinsam
Seit letztem Wochenende sind wir beide nicht mehr einsam
(Gehst du mit ihr zusammen? Äh, ich hab mir vorgenommen
Möglichst bald mit ihr zusammen zu kommen)
Viel Spaß damit (Danke!) Doch eins gibt mir zu denken
Warum muss ich ihr die ganze Zeit nur Geschenke schenken?
(Wem sagst du das? Ich bin schon wieder blank
Doch dafür hat meine jetzt neue Klamotten im Schrank)
Hey, bei mir kam 'se neulich mit 'nem neuen Teil an
Und dabei hab ich mich noch gefragt, wie sie sich das leisten kann
Und ich hab frei am Freitag und sie ist nicht da
(Äh, Moment mal Smudo, da ist meine ja)
Wo? (Es ist die da, die da am Eingang steht)
Was? Das ist die da, um die es sich doch bei mir dreht
(Was? Die da? Und wer ist dieser Mann?)
Ich glaub, das ist der Grund, warum sie freitags nicht kann!

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die
Ist es die da, die da, die da, genau die da!
Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die
Es ist die da, hey freitags ist sie nie da

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die

Ich steh' am Mikro, weil mein Dee Jot kratzt

Mit der Nadel auf der Platte an dem Finger an der Hand
Durch den Arm in den Kopf kratzt er ganz ohne Verstand
Aber mit Soul Mann find' ich cool Mann hast du kapiert
Er gibt sich nicht so hart wie du, weil es nicht funktioniert
Denn es ist echt typisch Deutsch dass du so ordentlich bist
Und versuchst korrekt und sauber nachzumachen was von drüben ist
Deine Ghetto-romantik braucht da drüben keiner
Schreib' einen Ghetto-roman schick werf' ihn in den Eimer
Ohne Soul und Swing kommst du nur Pseudokrass

Ich bin der Smu nana nana
Und war vor dir

Deine Hand angrabbel' für ein Ei und einen Appel
Brauchen wir nicht diskutieren oder dumm gestikulieren
Kabbeln will ich mich nicht klauen läuft nicht bei den Vieren
Tja kommen sie und hören sie die Qualität
Vergleichen sie und fragen einen guten Freund was er ihnen rät
Dann werden sie sich denken was ich brauch muss ich besorgen
Holen sich heute noch die vier legenden von morgen
Und der Hip Hop Importeur mit immer gleichen Interessen
Kriegt einen Anzug und Krawatte ist für Spießer angemessen

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Der Krieger erwacht er wurde über Nacht zum Krieger gemacht
Macht sich bereit hat sich gedacht
Wir haben die längste Zeit Zeit mit warten verbracht
Zeit mit Worten verbracht es uns bequem gemacht
Doch jetzt macht sich Zeitlosigkeit breit
Der Schläfer erwacht und ist bereit
Und befreit vom Raum lebt er in der Vision
Durchschreitet Deinen Traum in geheimer Mission
Und er kämpft um die anderen aus ihrem Traum zu wecken
Weil er weiß dass in ihnen viele kleine Krieger stecken
Und dennoch sagt er nicht komm mit mir
Er fragt nach Deinem Traum fragt warum bist Du hier
Er hat die Macht der Magie im Fluss der Zeit wird ihm klar
Er nimmt mit allen seinen Sinnen seine Zukunft war
Erweitert das jetzt durch sein Bewusstsein und erfüllt vom Augenblick
Geht er den nächsten Schritt und weiß jetzt gibt es kein zurück
Denn jetzt wacht er auf doch sein Traum geht weiter weil der Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf und sein Traum geht weiter weil sein Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf sein Traum geht noch weiter als der Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf und weiß es

Er wacht auf aus dem Traum den das Kollektiv träumt
Hat mit seinen alten Vorstellungen endlich aufgeräumt
Ersetzt die Isolation und setzt an ihre Stelle
Die Vision das wir eins sind auf einer Welle
Denn das Leben ist ein Fluss der fließen muss lass ihn fließen
Und der Krieger sagt entschieden es wird Zeit Dich zu entschließen
Wer Du bist wohin Du gehst auf welcher Seite Du stehst
Es wird Zeit dass Du verstehst dass Du am Rad der Zeit drehst
Wir führen einen Fight die Meisten tragen ihn im Stillen aus
Nur das Ergebnis quillt aus ihnen raus

Und er kann es sehn als Krieger fühlt er es ist existent
Jetzt da er das Geheimnis kennt spürt er im
Rhythmus den Zauber der Monotonie
Und Energie wie noch nie ersetzt die Theorie
Und ihm wird klar Harmonie bringt die Kraft
Sein Traum wird wahr er hat es geschafft
Jetzt wacht er auf doch sein Traum geht weiter weil der Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf doch sein Traum geht weiter weil sein Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf sein Traum geht noch weiter als der Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf
Er wacht auf doch sein Traum geht weiter weil der Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf doch sein Traum geht weiter weil sein Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf sein Traum geht viel weiter als der Zauber wirkt
Er wacht auf und weiß es

Der Zauber der Musik gibt auch Dir die Kraft
Geh den nächsten Schritt dann hast Dus geschafft
Der Krieger zeigt Dir ein Stück freies Land einen Platz
In Deinem Kopf den er fand und gibt Dir seine Hand
Die Du berührst und Du spürst ihr seid eins es geschieht
Ihr habt dieselbe Vision jetzt siehst Du was er sieht
Und ihr seht Krieger überall und alle sind Dir bekannt
Jedes Gesicht jede Geschichte ist mit Dir verwandt
Sie kämpfen für das Leben Krieger sind deswegen hier
Leben für den Traum und alle sind ein Teil von Dir und geben Dir
Ein Gefühl wie ein Schild Du hast es lange vermisst
Das so lange Du kämpfst Du nicht alleine bist
Tritt in den Kreis und mach wahr was Du weißt
Und die Erkenntnis bringt die Kraft mit der Du Dich befreist
Und dabei frei von Angst ganz gelöst
Erlöst was in Dir döst

Denn dann wachst Du auf und Dein Traum geht weiter weil Dein Zauber wirkt
Du wachst auf doch dein Traum geht weiter weil der Zauber wirkt
Du wachst auf doch geht Dein Traum weiter als der Zauber wirkt
Wachst du auf und weißt es
Du wachst auf und Dein Traum geht weiter weil der Zauber wirkt
Du wachst auf und Dein Traum geht weiter weil der Zauber wirkt
Du wachst auf doch geht Dein Traum weiter als der Zauber wirkt

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Ich schneide eine schneise durch die scheisse
Entscheide auf der reise wie ich heisse
Entgleise stelienweise aber weise
Verweise hier I'm kreis auf die beweise
Geh ich spazieren mit einem kanten in der tasche
Weil ich I'm wald am sonntagnachmittag gern hasche
Belaste ich die umwelt schliesslich nur mit asche
Würde ich trinken hätte ich eine leere flasche
Und asche brauch ich wieder in der zivilisation
Wo ich herkomm wo ich wohn ohne balkon
Dafür mit nachbarn und auf krach fahrn die nicht ab
Da ich stereo hab hör ich dub und hip hop
Mit bass satt mach diesen spack platt
Doch da mich der aufgrund des mieterrechts am sack hat
Ist er ziemlich schnell dabei mit der schutzpolizei
Und die stoppen dann mein sogenanntes urwaldgeschrei
Alles klar denk ich mir und ruf meinen mann thomas d an
Frag ob ich bei ihm vorbeikommen kann
Bring die schallplatenteller In seinen schallgeschützten keller
Denn da läuft das mit dem sound und dem bauen schon reeller
Zwei drei stunden machen wir das mit und dann qualmen uns die ohren
Und den letzten krümel shit haben wir verloren
Raus um die ecken wo die jungs sich verstecken
Ist der man dann gefunden heisst es zähne blecken
Ha do spacksack wenn ich guten tag sag
Brauch ich etwas tabak ich sack hab die zigzag I'm hipbag
Denn ich beck ich rauch jetzt dein weed weg
In diesem lied track genannt geht das klar
Wunderbar meint der typ doch das ist kein lied umfasst mein glied
Der bandit doch bevor er mich in die nische zieht
Sah ich thomas hinter ihm mit einer strange dynamit und er flieht
Ist nicht drin mann ich spinn wusste nicht mit wem ich in einer band bin
Schau nochmal hin und sehe thomas der das ding anzündet
Und verkündet er hätte dem typ die tasche geplündert
Und während meinem streit hatte er zeit nicht nur seinen
Shit zu klaun sondern damit zu baun
Und ich sollte mir diese riesentüte anschauen
Moment tüte dynamit äh
Hey jetzt wird mir endlich klar was geschieht
Das ist wieder ein beweis dass das zeug nicht nur plättet
Sondern hin und wieder auch einmal ein leben rettet
Ich sag thomas das war ganz weit vorn und wir stossen ins horn
Wenn do weisst was ich mein wenn nicht verlorn
Wenig später ist es endgültig um uns geschehn
Und es ist wohl besser lassen wir das auto stehn
Um zur s-bahn zu gehn und eine runde zu drehn
Vielleicht mit der zehn ja genau
Gut gesagt getan und dann kommt die bahn
Um uns stress zu sparn steigen wir ein und fahrn
Richtung innenstadt ich satz mich hin und zack
Steht jemand neben mir das ist kein passagier
Zeigt mir ein stück papier und sagt ich kontrollier
Hier ihre fahrausweise wir denken noch oh scheisse
Mann so eine kacke grief in meine jacke wo ich kohle hatte
Doch anstatt der patte find ich unsere platte auf cd
Ha da kommt mir die idee und ich sag nee
Fahrausweise haben wir leider nicht am start
Doch haben sie eine ahnung wen ihr durch die gegend karrt
Neben mir das ist hausmeister thomas d
Und in meiner hand unsere neue cd
Wär die sache mit einem autogramm für sie ok
Kaum hab ich ausgepackt da sagt dar sack
Das hast do dir schön ausgedacht do fuck
Typen wie ihr zieht doch den rap in den dreck
Und müsst weg
Das hat man nun davon schenkt man so einem kontrolleur sein gehör
Und ich schwör dieser typ wär nicht mehr hier wären wir
Rapper nach seiner manier bekäme dieser tropf
Statt einem fahrschein eine kugel in seinem kopf
Doch hier ist nicht l.a. sondern stuggitown
Und anstatt diesem clown das leben zu klaun
Reicht es schon thomas breite fresse anzuschaun
Und an der nächsten haltestelle abzuhaun
Also raus strasse hoch und zur bushaltestelle
Doch den bus nehmen wir nicht denn das wär nicht helle
Während wir noch grübeln was man jetzt wohl anstelle
Klickt um unser handgelenk schon die handachelle
Als ich an die wand prelle habe ich ein bild in der pupille
Von einem kravattierten bullen mit einer spiegelsonnenbrille
Und dann schubst uns die bazille in einen fensterlosen wagen
Mit einer scheibe hinter dem fahrer und so können wir nicht mal fragen
Was hier abgeht welchen abgefahrenen film dieser spack dreht
Und als er dann nach längerer fahrt den motor abdreht
Wird die tür aufgerissen und wir werden rausgezerrt
In einen raum reingeschmissen wo man nur eine stimme hört
Die sagt haben wir euch endlich erwischt ihr miesen schwaben
Ihr seid angeklagt unser system zu untergraben
Unsere jugend zu verführen thc zu konsumieren
Deshalb werden wir an euch ein exempel statuieren
Unseren neuen elektrischen stuhl ausprobieren
Und euch hier und jetzt an ort und stelle exekutieren
Und wir werden festgeschnallt von offiziellen vollgeschwallt
Ob wir was zu sagen hätten bevor man uns verstrahlt
Der ganze mist von sünde reue und dem restlichen kitsch
Ja sage ich

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Komm ein bisschen näher komm näher hör mir zu
Mach dich locker entspann dich so wie ich es tu
Und dann spürst du wie der Rhythmus in dich eindringt und dich einnimmt
Vielleicht werd' ich dir erzählen was du sehen willst hören willst
Oder fühlen willst erleben willst was du spüren willst
Vielleicht nichts von dem denn ich kann nicht sehen wie du bist
Weil was ich denk' nur in meinem Kopf ist
Nur in meinem Kopf seh' ich dich so wie ich dich seh'
Nur in meinem Kopf die Dinge die nur ich versteh'
Nur in meinem Kopf läuft das ab was mich betrifft
Doch betrifft es dich und wirkt wie Gift für dich
Dann ist es wahr, dass ich mich verschätzt hab
Als ich dich versetzt hab dich dadurch verletzt hab, ich weiß
Tief in mir drin bestreit ich nicht die Wichtigkeit unserer Zweisamkeit
Es tut mir Leid es ist nur in meinem Kopf

Was ist mit mir los was geht hier ab
Liegt es an den Dingen, die du hast die ich nicht hab
Kenn ich denn das Maß mit dem du mißt, bin ich der Egoist
Und damit das Problem der Natur die du bist
Ich weiß es nicht ich begreif' es nicht schau in dein Gesicht
Und stelle fest etwas stört dein Gleichgewicht
Und ich fürchte, das bin ich und all die andern um dich rum
Versuchen zu verstehen und fragen sich warum
Ist es nur in deinem Kopf, dass es kein gut und böse gibt
Nur in deinem Kopf, dass jeder von dir alles kriegt
Nur in deinem Kopf ist Frieden grenzenlos schrankenlos
Gedankenlos was mach ich bloß
Es ist nur in deinem Kopf

Dieses Spiel ist so alt so alt wie du und ich
Wobei ich es bin der dich braucht doch du mich nicht
Warum bin ich nicht der einzige in deinem Leben, muss es denn die andern geben
Muss ich dich deswegen jetzt aufgeben, nein
Ich will es nicht ich kann es nicht ich glaube nicht mal, dass das geht
Weil ohne dich sich nichts mehr hier dreht
Obwohl wir uns so ähnlich sind scheint der Geist grundverschieden
Ich frage mich wo ist er nur geblieben ist er denn in keinem
Kopf in keinem Kopf in keinem kopf in keinem
Der weg des großen Plans, ich weiß er ist in deinem
Du zeigst es mir so oft doch ich hör' schlecht auf dem Ohr
Nur ab und zu versteh' ich dich und es kommt selten genug vor
Weil dann das meer rauscht und ich kann deinen atem spüren

Warum mich all diese Gefühle plagen die ich nicht 
Kannte oder nur vom hörensagen 
Denn bisher rannte ich durch meine Welt und war der König 
Doch alles was mir gefällt ist mir jetzt zu wenig 
Alles was mich kickte von dem ich nie genug kriegte 
Lass ich lieber sein denn ich fühl mich allein

Ich raff' es nicht ab, was ist daran schlimm 
Dass ich jetzt nicht mehr der man für sie bin 
Da sitz' ich und kack' mich zu und beginn 
Zu denken dass ich keine andere find' 

Die eine ist weg, na und 
War sie für dich nicht nur Mittel zum Zweck und Grund 
Sich hinter ihr zu verstecken, andere abzuchecken war tabu 
Und jetzt kommst du 

Hm wie gesagt es ist krass, dass ich dachte ich verpass' 
Was wenn ich die Finger von den andern lass 
Was ich machte denn ich dachte diesen Spaß 
Gibst du dir wenn du die eine nicht mehr hast und jetzt was

War was immer ich machte für mich irgendwie

Sorgenfrei an ihr vorbei 
Schätze bin ein bisschen hochgeflogen ungelogen 
Und hab sie dabei mit mir selbst betrogen 

Kluge Worte was hinterher, weiß man immer mehr 
Doch so sehr ich mich auch dagegen wehr'
Bleibt es schwer aber wahr 
Ich bin leer denn sie ist nicht da klar 

Jaja, wunderbar tolle rede Mann 
Hört ich dich nicht mal sagen dich lässt jede ran 
Und jetzt schau dich an wo bist du hingekommen

Das gehemnis wie ihr eure zukunft lenkt und wer erkennt
Das wenn die schwingung nicht stimmt die stimmung sinkt
Der beginnt zu erkennen wie wir drauf sind und das es nichts bringt
Dieses egospiel denn alle ziehn energie
Und wollen viel zu viel und geben ist theorie
Erst wer das spiel durchschaut hat es in der hand und hört auf
Der andere setzt verliert den verstand und geht drauf
Doch wie oft macht man den selben fehler wann wird man klug
Macht eigener schaden froh ist genug nicht genug
Ich hab es satt neue generationen zu sehn
Deren leben sich noch immer um die alten regeln drehn
Die unsere vorfahren vor jahren aufgestellt für eine welt
Die heute nicht mehr zählt doch wer sich dennoch daran hält
Der blieb zu lang auf der einen seite stehn kann zwar zur anderen sehn
Doch hat nicht mehr den mut um rüber zu gehn
Sieht wie die anderen durch ihr leben wandern während er steht
Sie treffen aufeinander wo bei ihm nichts geht
Er ist frustriert aufgrund von dem was ihm passiert
Und hat doch nicht kapiert wie das spiel funktioniert und fragt sich immer
Warum ich warum immer ich ha so ein mist
Es passiert dir doch nur deshalb weil do bist wie do bist
Und deshalb leuchtet mir auch nur noch eine frage ein
Wer bin ich und wer will ich sein
Wer braucht regeln und wer hat sie geschrieben
Wieviel ist mir eingetrichtert worden was ist geblieben
Was ist wahr während der suche wird mir klar
Auch ich bin nicht mehr der selbe der ich vorher war
Und ich seh ein nichts und niemand sieht hier oben rein oh nein
Ich bin mit meinem kopf die ganze zeit allein
Doch was ist da los ich frag mich mit was word ich gross
Ja was ist da drin was macht mich zu dem der ich bin
Und ich besinn mich und erinnere mich an was wesentlich
Und endlich zieh ich kraft aus meinem leben und verinnerlich
Dann alle diese augenblicke in denen ich einfach nur da war
I'm jetzt und hier war ganz klar war
Tief in mir war und wie wunderbar
Ich das leben nahm wie es kam und es kam
Rein in vollen zügen nahm ichs an und lebte allein
Nur mir genügend kam ich dann vom haben zum sein
Und ohne lügen tauchte ich ein
Erfuhr gedankenlose freiheit wie noch nie
Und wurde eins mit meiner philosophie
Meine philosophie
Ich muss bewahren was ich weiss und ich weiss dass kaum ein kind noch ein
Greis
Heute noch weiss was es heisst am leben zu sein
Doch was seit jahren in mir reift das beweist
Mir wer wir sind und verheisst mir wie der wind
Am schweben zu sein und ich lebe allein
Bin ausser mir so tief in mir zu sein
Und dann komm ich drauf irgendwann hörte ich auf
Mich von mir zu entfernen hab umgedreht und angefangen mich kennenzulernen
Und jetzt stehen meine beiden beine fest auf dem boden
Und mein kopf ist in den sternen

Locker bleiben die Fantastischen Vier bloß
Du sagst der ganze Hip hop Quatsch, haut einfach nicht hin
He alter mach die Ohren auf und hör mal zu, ich bin
S.M.U.D.O.
Das ist kein Witz, Mann, das spricht man auch so
Ich hab Mücken auf der Bank, Klamotten im Schrank
Ich mache gerne Party doch ich mache niemals krank
Lauf' nicht auf Gras, hab Spaß, verstehst'e was ich mein?
Dreh' auf, gib Gas und blas' mir unsern Sound hinein
Mit diesem und jenem, und manchmal ein ausgeben
Da mach ich mir nichts draus, Mann, so ist das leben eben
Ja wie denn? ja was denn? Ja wie machste das denn?
Hey, ganz einfach, mich tut nichts belasten
Frag mich nicht warum, frag mich nicht wieso
frag mich nicht so viel, Mann, ich bin halt so

S.M.U.D.O. ich tu nicht so, ich bin halt so
Bin immer gut dabei, bin nicht homo, sondern hetero
Ich spreche ziemlich schnell, schneller als die meisten Leute
Und mach mein Ding nicht morgen, nein ich mach es lieber heute
Nicht hü, nicht hott, nicht langsam, sondern flott
Und geht das Ding nicht schnell genug dann mach ich noch bankrott
Verstehste, in meiner Stimme ist ein ganz bestimmter klang
Denn ich sabbel' und babbel' und mache geilen Sprechgesang
Zu viert, kapiert? Das läuft ja wie geschmiert
Kannst du 'fantastisch' schreiben, wenn man's dir buchstabiert
Das drumherum muss Stimmen, sonst ist alles null und nichtig
Das Image ist sehr wichtig richtig? richtig!
Kein Image macht viel Sinn, bist du nicht richtig drin

Ich mach einen dicken Schuh zieh' nicht an dem Kabel, weil da steh' ich drauf
Und halt mal kurz den Rand und hör' mir zu

Schau' dich an und sag mir dann was du denkst was du da machst
Wenn du in der Glotze laberst von dem Ding von dem du glaubst, dass du es
Bewachst

Lästiger Querulant lächerlicher Repräsentant
Doch die Gestik die Sprüche Attitüde, die ihr glaubt
Die ist geklaut geklaut geklaut geklaut geklaut
Weiße Mittelstandskids aus dem Ghetto was ein Witz
Du bist doch weg alter du brauchst Bewegung und sonst nichts
Weil dann kommst du vielleicht auf den Trichter wie das wär'
Ohne Betonkopf auf dem Hals fällt die Coolness nicht so schwer
Weil dann machst du dich locker so wie ich es tu

Ich bin der S M U das D und das O

Ich bin der S M U das D und das O genau das bin ich
Mache jahrelang schon blablabla jetzt denk' ich spinn' ich
Hör' ich alte Schule neue schule Hip Hop hurra
Die hohe Schule heißt Smu und der ist immer da
Denn die vier ist im Platz und du weißt was das heißt mein Schatz
Ich steh' am Mikro, weil mein Dee Jot kratzt

Mit der Nadel auf der Platte an dem Finger an der Hand
Durch den Arm in den Kopf kratzt er ganz ohne Verstand
Aber mit Soul Mann find' ich cool Mann hast du kapiert
Er gibt sich nicht so hart wie du, weil es nicht funktioniert
Denn es ist echt typisch Deutsch dass du so ordentlich bist
Und versuchst korrekt und sauber nachzumachen was von drüben ist
Deine Ghetto-romantik braucht da drüben keiner
Schreib' einen Ghetto-roman schick werf' ihn in den Eimer
Ohne Soul und Swing kommst du nur Pseudokrass
Das sagt dir Smu-de-o-was

Ich bin der S, M, U das D und das O

How do you do aha
Ich bin der Smu nana nana
Und war vor dir
Schon superlangelange da
Denn ich sabbel' und babbel wenn ich am Mikrofon zappel
Deine Hand angrabbel' für ein Ei und einen Appel
Brauchen wir nicht diskutieren oder dumm gestikulieren
Kabbeln will ich mich nicht klauen läuft nicht bei den Vieren
Tja kommen sie und hören sie die Qualität
Vergleichen sie und fragen einen guten Freund was er ihnen rät
Dann werden sie sich denken was ich brauch muss ich besorgen
Holen sich heute noch die vier legenden von morgen
Und der Hip Hop Importeur mit immer gleichen Interessen
Kriegt einen Anzug und Krawatte ist für Spießer angemessen
Doch ich bin der SMUDO uh-oh-oh

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Manchmal denk' ich ich tick' nicht richtig
Und alle um mich gehen andere Wege als ich
Ich steh' in einer Menge Menschen und bin allein
Fühl' mich frei und kann doch nicht frei sein
Dann seh' ich mir die andern an und denk' wo wollen sie hin
Was ist der Sinn und was kommt dann und warum bin ich mittendrin
Umgeben von Menschen mit geschminkten Masken an
Versteckt und zugemacht damit sie niemand sehen kann
Die haben sich verloren kommen nich' mehr an sich ran
Die warten auf Veränderungen und wären schon lange dran
Haben aufgegeben zu leben, weil es sie bedrückt
Und das scheint ganz normal und genau das macht mich verrückt

Aber etwas läuft falsch aber nich' in mir
Nein, ich bin nicht verrückt nein ich bin nicht verrückt

Und dabei möcht' ich doch nur ich selbst sein
Und ich weiß, ich steh' mit diesem Wunsch nun wirklich nicht allein
Doch viel zu viele bleiben auf der Strecke lassen sich hängen
Geben auf und lassen sich in eine Ecke drängen
Wir retten die Welt sag ich und werd' ausgelacht
Doch wenn das alle denken würden hätten wir's schon längst gemacht
Wir ham das Leben unser leben in der Hand und ich für meinen Teil
Find's ziemlich geil
Und dadurch wird dann plötzlich klar was bisher noch so verschwommen
Und ich weiß von diesem Trip möcht' ich nicht mehr runterkommen
Und ich rate euch macht mit doch ihr habt immer die Wahl
Geht her und nennt mich verrückt und sagt mir ihr wärt normal

Ist es normal nur, weil alle es tun, ist es normal, nur weil alle es tun

Okay dann lass mich der sein der dir Leben bringt
Wirfst du die Vorurteile weg dann weiß ich, dass es mir gelingt
Ich bin der ohne böses im Sinn sehen wir es abstrakt
Steh' ich in der Ecke auf 'ner Kiste und bin praktisch nackt
Ich bring Vränderungen die verändern mich noch mehr zu mir
Ins jetzt und hier nur ist das dann vielleicht noch weiter weg von dir
Du willst zu mir sein wie die Vier und fragst was kostet mich das
Die Antwort ist es bringt dir jede menge Spaß
Durch Emotionen Vibrationen ey verdammt ich bin am leben
Und das ist für mich Grund genug jede Menge Gas zu geben
Was ich da spür' ist Leben meiner Wahl
Hört sich abgefahren an doch ist für mich ganz normal

Ist es normal nur, weil alle es tun, ist es normal, nur weil alle es tun
Ist es normal nur, weil alle es tun, ist es normal, nur weil alle es tun

Doch ich bin nicht hier um ganz vorne anzufangen
Du solltest mir vertrauen, denn ich bin dein Freund
Und ich bin überall wo man glaubt, dass man was versäumt
Vergiss nicht wir sind zusammen aufgewachsen
Wie gutes Gras zu Hause doch sind wir schon erwachsen
Hey wir haben doch Spaß am Leben oder
Komm mit mir gib Gas sollen die andern doch vermodern
Komm ich seh' du traust mir nicht so ganz oder
Weil innerlich gehst du ein bisschen auf Distanz oder
Lass alles fallen mein Freund die Neugier ist die Macht
Und die Vernunft in deinem Kopf wird ausgelacht
Ich lad' dich ein auf meine Party die das Leben ist
Drum mach dir heute keine Sorgen wann du mit mir eben bist
Ich hab das Ticket für dich und deine Lust mein Sohn
Frag nicht wie ich heiße denn das weißt du schon

Ganz genau ich sehe deine Seele weil ich schau in deine
Augen mein Freund und was ich seh' ist grau
Wie damals als sie von dir ging
Und hinter deinem Rücken über dich zu reden anfing
Du hast gesucht nach einem Freund der dir die Hand reicht
Doch Einsamkeit ist kalt wenn sie sich anschleicht
In dieser Zeit warst du nichts als ein Außenseiter
Warst bald bereit für mich und wurdest mein Begleiter
Wir ham ein draufgemacht die ganze Nacht
Dieses Fest war so ein Rausch wir sind nicht aufgewacht
Denn dieser Rausch war viel dichter als die Reue von dir
Überall die lachenden Gesichter alles Freunde von mir
Drum hör nicht auf die andern wie sie Ratschläge geben
Vom Überleben durch bewegen reden
Die kochen doch nur hoch was schon vergessen ist
Komm zu mir und bleibe wie du bist

Ja pass' nur auf dich auf und gib acht
Und klink' dich ruhig aus wenn du glaubst, dass es keinen Sinn mehr macht
Doch ich kenne deine Vorstellung von Glück ganz egal
Wie wir uns trennen sicher ist du kommst zurück
Denn die Versuchung ist groß und ich bin es auch ich
Konsum gebraucht von dir verbrauch dich
Der Weg zu mir ist kurz und bequem
Nur du und ich und das System
Denn du kannst zwar machen was du willst aber nicht wollen was du willst
Die Unfreiheit des Willens ist ein Pilz der wuchert
Und wächst über Dein Gehirn reagiert mit deinem
Komplex und ich Konsum düng' dieses Gewächs
Sie ist löslich diese Angst die sich in dir staut
In dem Nebel von dem Kraut in dem Getränk von mir gebraut
Und in allem was du magst was ist dir lieber schhh
Sag es nicht wir sehen uns morgen wieder",Konsum,1996
Die Fantastischen Vier,"Zack, was geht ab? Ich bin S.M.U.D.O., ha
Kaum hab ich die Sprüche aus dem Sack gepackt, da
Komm' die Leute auf mich zu und fragen mich 
„Was willst denn du mit Hip-Hop-Musik, mit deutschem Sprechgesang immerzu?“
Dann sag ich 
„Ja, schau ins Publikum, schau dich an und schau dich um""
Leute schwoofen wie die doofen, obenrum und untenrum
Packen ihre Zettel aus, schrauben Schreiberminen raus
Bekommen Autogramme, schlagen ihre Zelte auf vor meinem Haus
Will ich dann raus, schau ich links und rechts
Und dann ab durch die Mitte schneller als jeder Reflex
Doch die Fans mir hinterher gegen jede Fairneßregel
Und ich drück' den Knopf, mit dem das Öl tropft
Und der Hebel für die Nägel wird gezogen, das Blech wird verbogen
Der Rahmen ist verzogen und die Fans beschreiben einen Bogen
Unterdessen vergessen die Herren von der Presse
Ich hab kein Interesse am Gespräch, während ich esse
Macht euch weg von meinem Besteck ihr zwei beiden
„Und was sollen wir dann schreiben?“ Ich sag, immer locker bleiben

von Bau-Know-How und außerdem Bediener zweier Plattenspieler
Es ist Dee Jot Hausmarke, der schneller als ich ausparke
Mit Tellern aus dem Hause geht und rauchen geht und außerdem
Hat D. Thomas, Hausmeister betitelt, eine feine
Drei bis vier Zimmer Diskothek vermittelt
Doch noch läuft Trance und Dance, he, mach das weg aber flott
Dich selber auch, wir hören die Bands vom, Plattenspielergott
Denn das ist besser so, Alter, denn der Smu mit dem O
Steht auf Musik mit Kick und er tut nicht nur so
Wie die meisten von euch denken, sich verrenken, bis sie glühen,
Weil sie den ganzen Tag zitieren und alte Klischees bemühen
Und sie wundern sich und fragen sich bei Nacht und auch bei Tageslicht
Charts breaken, Hip Hop Beats, geht das doch? Ich mag es nicht
Müßig zu erörtern und mit Wörtern zu beschreiben
Weil, es einfach ist

Immer locker bleiben, sag ich, immer locker bleiben

Und wenn's euch nicht gefällt dann spart euch den Applaus
Doch was in meinem Bauch erwacht hat sich in mir Vertausendfacht
Mich über Nacht zu dem gemacht was ich jetzt zu Papier gebracht
Und hätt' ich länger drüber nachgedacht dann
Wäre sicher wieder was entfacht was man Vernunft nennen kann
Doch das hier Regel ich allein ich will nicht mehr vernünftig sein
Ich sag mir immer wieder laut und deutlich nein
Thomas nein ihr kriegt mich nicht mehr
Thomas raus aus meinem Kopf raus denn ist er leer
Weiß ich endlich wieder wer ich bin wer wir alles sind
Doch kommt mein Ego zurück dann werd' ich wieder blind
Stumm taub doch ich glaub ich hab mich durchschaut
Ich hab auf Sand gebaut dem Verstand vertraut
Und dabei ist es unbeschreiblich was mich aufwühlt
Doch hör zu ich zeig dir wie sich's anfühlt
Schön was doch wieder sind wir mittendrin
Auf der suche nach dem Sinn durch die Frage wer ich bin
Und kaum das ich beginn schon kommen die Beschwerden
Denn alles was ich sage kann gegen mich verwendet werden
Alles was ich Frage ist wenn leben Liebe ist
Wie kann es sein, dass ihr das noch nicht wisst
Eins wurde mir bewusst eins weiß ich jetzt eins
Ist mir klar auch wenn es euch entsetzt

Love sucks die Liebe stinkt mein Freund die Liebe stinkt
Ich will dich sicher nicht schockieren mein Kind
Doch du musst wissen dass es nicht immer so ist wie in der Zeitung steht
Und das es nach dem Happy End im wahren Leben weitergeht
Und erst wenn ihr versteht, dass sich die liebe nicht beschränken lässt
Und sich euer leben nicht nur durch das denken lenken lässt
Könnt ihr verstehen warum mich das Wort liebe stört
Weil sich die liebe anders anhört eher so
Ich habe es gespürt es ist unbeschreiblich

Find 'more similar lyrics on, steht vor den Gedanken und so langsam begreif' ich
Dass egal wie wir es wenden oder drehen
Wir uns die meiste Zeit doch selber im Weg stehen
Du musst damit beginnen dich auf dich zu besinnen
Denn der wahre Feind kommt von innen
Darum erkenne den Feind bevor du ihn zerstörst
Auch wenn du darauf schwörst dass du nur dir gehörst
Geh' ich hin und Zack unterteile dich in über-ich und unter-ich
Und zwischendrin befindet sich dann irgendwo dein wahres ich
Doch alle spielen rollen alle sind sie dabei
Arthur Blankesop eins und Arthur Blankesop zwei
Und Arthur Blankensop drei und Arthur Biankensop vier
Doch alle sind wir wegen einem hier und es ist

Es ist so schwer zu sagen was man wirklich fühlt
Noch schwerer zu beschreiben wenn man danach wühlt
Doch ich weiß und deshalb ist es wichtig
Ich lieb In diesem Punkt verdammt richtig
Deshalb bleibt mir doch weg mit eurer Schubladenliebe
Ist die liebe ein Geschäft seid ihr Ladendiebe
Bin ich Gerhard Ficker und dann müsst ihr mir vertrauen
Denn ich kenne euch ihr wollt alle nur klauen
Los gib mir mehr gib mir mehr immer mehr gib es her
Das Ego schreit ich will was mir zusteht hey das wär' doch fair
Deine liebe gegen meine außer mir da liebste keine
Wir sind beide an der Leine du verstehst doch was ich meine
Doch ich haha haha haha haha
Haha lach mich schlapp und hau ab
Weil ich es satt hab ich hab genug von deinen Lügen
Frage dich hast du das Zeug dazu dir selbst zu genügen
Wenn ja schhhhh mach mal keine Wellen

Hallo!
Smu D-O mein Name,
""Mach dich frei"" der Titel meiner Sprechgesangsbestandsaufnahme.
Wie viele Menschen bin auch ich neuen Reizen ausgesetzt
Und manches Dogma hat sich dabei schon in mein Gehirn geätzt.

Doch warum neigt der Mensch zur Stabilität,
Zu Rivalität, die Individualität verschmäht?
Den Geist auf Diät gesetzt
Aufgebläht mit Vorurteilen fern der Realität,

Seine Kapazität liegt in der Kreativität
Seine Qualität liegt in der Virtuosität,
Vitalität, Originalität, Genialität,
Intensität, mit der er deine Seele berät.

Unkompliziert expandiert dein Geist unisoliert
Das heißt wenn du ihn befreist von dem
Was ihn drangsaliert mit dem er kollidiert
Was ihn infiziert und ihn dann blockiert
Egal was passiert dein Geist wird niemals pensioniert

Mach dich frei

OK, Weisheit ist der Schlüssel, doch wo ist das Schloss?
Ich weiß, du willst bis ganz nach oben,
Doch du musst durchs Erdgeschoss
Dein Geist braucht Energie und Erregung und Bewegung
Denn Erfahrung ist Ernährung und Wissen ist Vermehrung
Ich erkenn's
Und trainiere meinen Geist doch ich ergänz',
Dass Intelligenz nicht in Konkurrenz steht
Die Konsequenz ist sich nicht ans Limit zu bewegen und sich aufzuputschen
Denn es ist so leicht auf dem Lebensglatteis auszurutschen.

Gehasst geliebt gesiegt versiebt
Du bist ein Teil von dir
Und ein Teil von dem was dich umgibt
Die Sucht nach Anerkennung und die Sucht nach Harmonie
Treiben in die Flucht und in Gedankenbürokratie

Und mitten im Konsum
Kommt dann die Isolierung
Was ist Illegalität, was ist Legalisierung?
Klopf klopf drück auf den Knopf! Mach ihn auf den Topf!
Stopf' und gieße Anarchie in deinen Kopf, Tropf!

Es verschwindet die Zeit
Darauf du in ihr
Wolken schlagen Salti

Und darin kennst du dich aus

Du bist am Leben

Bist du es Leid, wie ich leider nicht zu zweit zu sein?

Wo die Grenzen zwischen Toleranz und Liebe sind
Warum hab ich das Gefühl, dass du dich nicht bemühst um mich
Nicht viel fühlst für mich
Wenn du dich bewegen willst, weshalb rührst du dich dann nicht
Wenn du eine Beziehung willst, weshalb führst du sie nicht
Warum hörst du nie zu
Warum bist du nicht bei mir
Warum gehör' ich nicht dazu
Warum bist du noch bei mir
Warum nimmt die Zeit den Reiz der Zweisamkeit
Und warum bleibt der Schmerz der Angst vor Einsamkeit
Warum tut es mir Leid, den Fragen ausgewichen zu sein
Die mir mein Geist gestellt hat, um ausgeglichen zu sein

Doch ich weiß Image ist nichts und scheiß auf alle die bekannt sind
Im Land sind zu viele Promis die nicht bei Verstand sind
Zu viele Homies die noch nicht am Strand sind am Rand sind
Zu viele Gaffer deren Augenblicke so leer sie wollen noch mehr Helden fallen sehen 
Alle Denker allen sehen
Ich seh' sie schon als Wanker in Museenhallen stehen
Sie werden kommen und gehen alles nur Gesichter
Im Zeitgeschehen der Club der toten Dichter stimmt mich nicht versöhnlich
Ich werde weitergehen und lebe lieber ungewöhnlich
Denn das hier geht alle unsere Widersacher Wichtigmacher
Cocksucker Motherfucker Hosenkacker
Aalglatte nimmersatte Jammerlappen die wie Ratten in Kloaken
Darauf warten über unsere Platten zu beraten ha
Ihr ganzen Abklemmer Flachwanker Spartendenker
Wir sind eure Rattenfänger autonome Einzelgänger
Weil wir länger halten als der Typ im Sarkophag
Während ihr Idioten euer eigenes Grab grabt

Dieses Haus ist besetzt
Denn wenn ich dir in deiner Welt nichts sagen kann
Wozu dann all diese Fragen Mann
Anscheinend interessiert es dich ja doch was der Typ so treibt
Und wem er was macht und wo er bleibt
Das so was Mitgefühl ist glaub ich kaum
Ich fürchte fast ich bin dein lebender Alptraum
Müll-redender Abschaum der dich ständig disst
Und dabei sag ich doch nur was du für mich bist
Die ganze Pisse die dein Leben durch meine Venen spült
Verursacht Risse und mein Herz unterkühlt
Doch da meine Liebe wasserdicht und meine Seele kugelsicher
Macht ihr Stricher bei mir keinen Stich mehr
Ich bin euer Richter und Henker ihr Wanker und nach mir kommt nichts mehr
Denn das hier geht

Dieses Haus ist besetzt
Staubige Hände mit zerknitterten Karten
Von draußen kommen Fremde die auf´s Ende des Gewitters warten
Vom Piano klingt dasselbe Lied wie immer
Und Frauen verkaufen Liebe auf dem Zimmer
Dichter Rauch macht Luft zum Schneiden dick
Mit einem Seitenblick erkenn' dich im Dämmerlicht
Und was ich seh' ist jämmerlich falscher Platz falsche Zeit
Diese Stadt ist zu klein für uns zwei
Der Himmel weint kein Mensch weit und breit
Zwanzig Schritte entfernt trennt dich von mir die Ewigkeit
Während ich dir in die Augen schaue merke ich du ziehst
Höre wie du schießt bleib noch stehen und sehe dir zu
Wie du sie dann für immer schließt

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Schau dich hier um und dann in dich hinein
Denn jeder brauch 'nen Platz zum glücklich sein
Wir laden dich und deine Leute ein, um heute da zu sein wo man sich liebt

In der Stadt, die es nicht gibt
Geht der Beat ab und schiebt an und zu
Durch die Straßen in denen jeder Ahnung auf diesem Gebiet hat
Allen voran dieser Mann der in Groovefragen
Jedem und auf alles eine Antwort geben kann
Denn im Kampf gegen wack Beats hat der Bürgermeister
Jede Kurve schon gekriegt und Jede Hürde schon gemeistert
In der City ist kein Platz für shitty Mucke, die nicht klingt
Weil in der Stadt die's nicht gibt jeder swingt Baby
Weil alle ohne Ende grooven stylen oder rocken
Wenn sie in der Zone moven und in Häuserzeilen rocken
Dieser Mob kämpft unerschrocken gegen Pop wie gegen Pocken
Gegen Schlagerstreptokokken und ähnlichen Schrott yeah
Ich weiß ihr seid Genossen packt euch an die Flossen
Denn jedes Mal haben Freaks wie ihr die da oben weggeschossen
Denn alle Kids Chicks Knacker Macker Style Spacker Babies
Machen diesen Traum wahr weil's dafür nie zu spät ist (ah, yeah weil's dafür nie zu spät ist, Baby)

Und alle gehen wieder ab und bleiben wach die ganze Nacht lang
Weil wir mal wieder die Nacht zum Tag gemacht haben
Und ohne Gruppen oder Sachzwang Alter
Tanzen die Puppen sogar bei den Nachbarn also
Hier geht mal nix vor Nachmittags macht dir klar
Dass letzte Nacht ne dicke Party in der Stadt war
Und alle waren dabei bunt wie Smarties
Halten ihren Kopf gesund durch Parties
Halten ihre Seelen sauber durch Soulmusik rollen Spliffs
Morgens gibt's statt Brot frische Beats auf'n Tisch
Und dann bebt die Stadt lebt anstatt stets nur platt
Fett und satt zu machen was sonst jeder macht
Jeder lacht hier in der Straßenbahn
Denn anstatt zu zahlen wird hier schwarzgefahren
Und anstatt zu sparen wird hier rausgetan
Damit auch noch was da ist für die Armen Amen

Wir rappen zu Beats checken die Cheats smacken den Kiez
Kidnappen die Freaks und die Chics um in geheimen 
Und ganz intimer Geheimlaboren auch mit ihnen nach den Formeln zu bohren 
Die schon verloren schienen, ja dealen mit den geilste Styles im kleinsten Kreis
Testen die besten Vibes die höchsten Heights
Größtenteils durch das Erlebnis des Ergebnis in Fahrt
Ist hier die Party am Start auf die die Stadt gewartet hat
Doch warte mal denn es war allemal 'ne harte Wahl
Die Masken fielen wie nach Karneval
Die meisten liefen aus dem Tal der tiefen Superdepressionen heraus
Und über Schall ins Licht und überall war neues Land in Sicht
Alle verstanden sich and Babylon did fall und alle wandten sich
Gegen die Lügen der Betrügenden, die uns nicht mehr genügen
Denn sie blocken und schocken uns und sind scheinbar nicht zu zügeln
Wenn die Welt ihre Welle nicht am leben hält
Sich unserem Vibe in der Zukunft nichts entgegenstellt
Erreichen wir die Innenwelt und wenden das Blatt

Die Fantastischen Vier,"OK ich kam zu der Beziehung genau wie die Zahl zur Ziehung,
Der Lottozahlen oder wie Stars zu Bravo-Otto-Wahlen,
Bei der Misswahl meines Lebens ist sie die Nummer Eins,
Nenn' es Schicksal oder Zufall oder nenn's vom beiden keins,
Sie ist die Frau die mir den Atem raubt mir die Sprache klaut,
Mir auf den Magen haut mir letztenendes die Moral versaut,
Mein letztes Hemd ist mir egal ich spend's für ihr Geständnis,
Wenn sie lacht die Erkenntnis, dass die Gegenwart geschenkt ist,
Die Zeit mit ihr ist kurz auch wenn sie lang ist und wenn sie lang ist,
Dann nur weil sie mal kurz nach nebenan ist,
Bekanntlich suchen manche lebenslang nach so was amtlichen wie ihr,
Doch der Mangel an Massel vermasselt's,
Du puzzelst und puzzelst suchst den Weg aus dem Schlamassel,
Suchst im ganzen nach dem Sinn des Lebens,
Zwei gute Gründe findest du wenn du in ihre Augen schaust,
Sie ist einmalig und sie sieht gut aus,

Sie ist der Hammer,

Ja Mann das Leben spielt wie es eben will,
Jedenfalls kommt es eher anders als man plant oder erahnt,
Und dann trifft's dich ohne Rücksicht ob du willst oder nicht,
Machst du plötzlich 'nen Glücksgriff und dann,
Hebst du ab und schwebst bist so high dabei,
Als ob du über den Wolken lebst wie Reinhard Mey,
Keine Zeit mehr für gar nichts denn seitdem sie da ist,
Bin ich noch süchtiger nach ihr als'n Hippie nach Cannabis,
Und ich schwitz' jedes mal wenn sie den Raum betritt,
Als ob ich mit 'ner Daunenjacke in der Sauna sitz',
Kein Witz denn ich dreh' durch wie'n Reifen im Schnee,
Wenn ich neben ihr steh und sie mir anseh',
Die Bombe die alles um sich rum in die Luft jagt,
Und jeden anderen in meinem Leben unsichtbar macht,
Jeder Tag mit ihr zusammen ist wie vier Wochen Urlaub,
Immer viel zu schnell vorbei weil ich nie auf die Uhr schau,
Alles andere verpasse meine Freunde mich hassen,
Und drei Typen mir drohen mich aus der Band zu entlassen,
Doch ich kann nichts machen weil ich nun mal an ihr kleb',
Wie der Scheiß an meinem Schuh wenn ich in Kaugummi tret',
Drum komm ich immerzu spät und alles dauert etwas länger,
Aber bitte versteht mich
Das Baby ist der Hammer

Baby Baby geh nie weg von mir,
Baby Baby bleib bei mir,

Sie ist meine Traumfrau und kaum schau ich ihr in die Augen,
Lockert sie mir die Schrauben lässt mich unentwegt an Wunder glauben,
Mitunter rauben mir Duft und ihre Stimme meine Sinne,
Und ich erinnere mich kaum was vor diesem Traum war,
Bevor ich sie das allererste Mal sah,
Da hatte ich schon die sieben Seen durchkämmt nur stand sie an Land,
Ich war durch Wüsten gewandert aber sie lag am Strand,
Als ich sie endlich fand wussten alle Bescheid,
Wir war'n ein Paar wie Bonny und Clyde,
Wir machten Kino wie Tarantino und ich war stylisch,
Wie Robert de Niro in Casino und, weil ich ‚
N dicken Schuh fuhr wie'n Superstar,
Gab ich ungern zu, dass ich bei ihr nur Groupie war,
Doch obwohl ohne Zweifel jeder Zweite um ihre Hand Schlange stand,
War klar wir beide sind das Paar,
Denn seitdem ich sie sah wollt ich nie mehr wieder solo sein,
Lieber allein mit'm Logo der Vier mitten in Rödelheim,
Sie meint's ernst es war kein Spaß mehr,
Wo ihre Liebe hinfällt wächst kein Gras mehr,
Kaum schau ich auf die Uhr ist mein Glas leer klar war's schwer,
Mich selbst zu überreden ab jetzt nicht nur ihretwegen,
Mehr auf diesem Planeten zu sein doch wenn sie will,
Dann wird die ganze Welt still wie das Schweigen der Lämmer,
Denn,

Das Baby ist der Hammer",Hammer,1999
Die Fantastischen Vier,"Mir ist nicht gut
Ich häng' den ganzen Tag rum und mach, was man so tut
wenn man alleine ist, viel zu früh schon auf den Beinen ist
Kein Auge zugetan hat, weil man mit nichts im Reinen ist
Keinem ist klar, wie's gelaufen war
Ist auch egal, wo im Endeffekt der Anfang vom Ende steckt
Tatsache ist, dass nichts süß wie Rache ist
Sie über alle Berge und mir alles andere als zum lachen ist
Doch wo nichts zu machen ist, scheint es mir
Fangen alle an zu schweigen, keiner bleibt mehr hier
Sie haben Angst vor mir und das kann ich gut verstehen
Betrachtet auf Distanz, ist mein Problem gerade noch bequem genug
Dieser Betrug ist so alt wie die Welt, in der wir beide sind.
Es ist bestimmt 'ne ganze Weile her
Als wir uns das letzte mal so trafen
Doch jetzt bist du hier und ich kann endlich wieder schlafen

Weck' mich auf, dass ich schlafen kann
Komm halt mich fest, dass ich laufen kann
Bleib bei mir heute Nacht, gib mir Kraft, dass ich glauben kann
Weck' mich auf, dass ich schlafen kann
Komm halt mich fest, dass ich laufen kann
Bleib bei mir heute Nacht, gib mir Kraft, dass ich wieder glauben kann

Es ist nicht schwer
Dem Weltschmerz zu verfallen, als wenn's die große Liebe wär'
Doch seit sie weg ist, ist jedes Glas halb leer
Jede Nacht viel zu kurz und jeder Tag nagt ein bisschen mehr an mir
Als wäre man ein Fisch in seinem Glas
Auf einem Tisch von einem Mensch, der ein' verlassen hat
Was massenhaft passiert, doch im Moment nicht interessiert,
wenn man stumm vor Entsetzen blind durch ein Glas nach draußen stiert
Man wundert sich, warum man langsam immer müder wird
Während das Wasser immer trüber wird
Und man dreht sich im Kreis, quälend vor Leid
Während dem Leib das Leben entweicht
Doch bevor man an der Oberfläche treibt
Tauchst du auf und es ist Licht
Die Dinge ändern sich und zeigen sich aus einer Sicht
Die ich verleugnet hab. Ich vergaß was sie bedeutet hat
Doch du erinnerst mich daran und das ist gut

Im Augenblick ist jeder Schritt zu viel
Nimm mich mit das letzte Stück zum Ziel
Diesen Weg kann ich nur gehen, wenn Du bei mir bist
Alles wär' verloren, wenn Du gehst

Weck' mich auf, dass ich schlafen kann
Komm halt mich fest, dass ich laufen kann
Bleib bei mir heute Nacht, gib mir Kraft, dass ich glauben kann
Weck' mich auf, dass ich schlafen kann
Komm halt mich fest, dass ich laufen kann
Bleib bei mir heute Nacht, gib mir Kraft, dass ich wieder glauben kann 

Weck' mich auf, dass ich schlafen kann
Komm halt mich fest, dass ich laufen kann
Bleib bei mir heute Nacht, gib mir Kraft, dass ich glauben kann
Weck' mich auf, dass ich schlafen kann
Komm halt mich fest, dass ich laufen kann
Bleib bei mir heute Nacht, gib mir Kraft, dass ich wieder glauben kann 

Weck' mich auf, dass ich schlafen kann
Komm halt mich fest, dass ich laufen kann
Bleib bei mir heute Nacht, gib mir Kraft, dass ich glauben kann
Weck' mich auf, dass ich schlafen kann
Komm halt mich fest, dass ich laufen kann
Bleib bei mir heute Nacht, gib mir Kraft, dass ich wieder glauben kann

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Ich weiß echt nicht wie es soweit kommen konnte
Wo doch alles so perfekt lief und ich in meinem Leben immer an der Sonne wohnte
Oben thronte
Zu viert im Popstar-Olymp mit einem Label das sich lohnt, weil es Millionen verdient
O.K. vielleicht war es ein bisschen übertrieben auf Tournee
Im eigenen Bus zu reisen und die dicksten Suiten zu mieten
Meinetwegen auch ein wenig zu vermessen
Für mein neues Chefbüro ein ganzes Stockwerk unseres Hauses zu besetzen
Dennoch war's ein überraschend harter Schicksalsschlag
Als man mir offenbarte, dass ich nicht mehr mitmachen darf
Tritt in' Arsch von meiner Band abruptes Ende
Kurz darauf bekam ich Hausverbot auf unserem Gelände
Mein gesamtes Hab und Gut wurde verpfändet
Und zur Tilgung meiner Schulden verwendet
Mein guter Ruf in 'n Schmutz gezogen und geschändet
Wenig später unvermeidlich Ärger mit dem Vermieter, weil ich
Kein Geld mehr hatte für die 500 Quadratmeter
Penthouse-Etage nach 'nem Monat ohne Gage
Saß ich direkt auf der Straße schade
Denn das Leben dort macht auch nur Spaß solang du'n Auto hast
Doch ohne Cash auf Täsch ziemlich blank kassierten es als letzte Sicherheit
Die Stricher von der Bank vielen Dank
Keinen Job mehr keine Wohnung keinen Wagen oder um es wie Thomas zu sagen
Hast du kein Auto und hast du kein Haus
Dann hast du keine Frau und so sieht's aus
Ja ja genau so lief's bei mir als ich vor ihrer Tür stand
Und statt Liebe und Trost nur noch'n Zettel von ihr fand
Es wär' nicht wegen mir doch sie sei weg um mit jemand anderem zusammen zu sein
Und ich war wieder allein allein

Michi Beck in hell

Und dann kam es wie es kommen musste vom Leben aus-gehustet
Glückssträhne abgerissen und nicht mehr verkrustet
Ausgeblutet abgebrannt an den Rand verbannt
Abgestellt und trocken gelegt wie'n Fisch an Land
Wieder mal 'ne grausige Nacht verbracht wo ich jetzt wohnen
In meiner lausigen Nachbarschaft um mich herum
Der Krach der Stadt und unter mir die Parkbank
Auf der ich mich flach gemacht hab
Endlich 'n Platz an der Sonne
Zwar ohne Dach dafür Nachts mit einer brennenden Tonne
Hab schon immer gesagt das Leben ist wirklich ungesund
Bist du bei Tag und Nacht real Untergrund
Um mich herum stehen leere Flaschen billiger Sprit
Kein Pfennig in den Taschen und es regnet doch zum Glück
Hab ich mich mit einer Zeitung zugedeckt auf der die Schlagzeile steht
Dass die neue der Fantastischen Drei
Mal wieder Nummer Eins in den deutschen Charts belegt
Von wegen hart aber gerecht ich war am Arsch
Echt unten tief gesunken auf die knie gezwungen
Hab es nie überwunden bis ich dann
Irgendwann meine neue Liebe gefunden hab
Und davon viel getrunken hab
Sie hieß Lambrusco und gab's an der Tanke in der Magnumflasche
Jede Mark in meiner Tasche ging für sie drauf
War jeden Tag noch mehr am Arsch es hörte nie auf
Bis es endlich eines Nachts soweit war
Die Straße leer und nasskalt
Längst kein Verkehr mehr und ich lag fast nackt auf dem Asphalt
Der letzte Rest meiner Sachen durchnässt und zerfetzt
Ich dachte ich könnt's schaffen bis zuletzt
Doch am Ende meiner Kräfte im eigenen Erbrochenen
Hörte mein Herz schließlich auf zu pochen denn
Erst war der Schmerz weg dann ging alles sehr schnell
Stille

Michi Beck in hell

Um mich herum brannte die Luft sengende Hitze
Schwefelgeruch brennende Blitze
Lodernde Flammen ein ständiges Donnern und Dröhnen
Unendliches Jammern und stöhnen aus zahllosen Kehlen
Grässliche Schreie verlorener Seelen
Die sich ewig lang in Unendlichkeit quälen
Ein Wimmern und Flehen erschütternde Szenen
Und ich stand mit zitternden Knien mittendrin
Bis er erschien Satan war da
Ab da war mir klar was geschah und ich sah
Wo ich war als er lachte und sprach
Herzlich willkommen am Arsch
Das hier wird ab jetzt für immer dein neues Zuhause sein
Doch wie jedem der hier landete räum' ich auch dir eine letzte Chance ein
Lächerlich klein denn bisher konnte es noch niemand schaffen
Mich in irgendwas zu schlagen also wähle deine Waffen
Die Entscheidung war einfach gegen meine Geheimwaffe konnte er einpacken
Als ich Reime brachte die die seinen kurz und klein hackten
Mich mit dem Mikrofon zu seinem bittersten Feind machte
Und meine Worte wie Gewitter über ihn herein-brachen
Ich spuckte 666 Styles binnen kürzester Zeit
Legte ihn aufs Kreuz in höllischer Geschwindigkeit
Pumpte Reim für Reim wie Blei in ihn hinein
Mit jeder Punchline verschwand sein Widerstand wie von allein
Ein letzter Schrei schwarzer Rauch bevor er im nichts verschwand
Gleißend helles Licht und, dann als sei nichts passiert
Stand ich wieder bei uns Vier vor der Studiotür",Michi Beck in Hell,1999

Mit dem Wissen aller Weisen dieser Welt beschütz' ich dich
Wo ich bin stehen sie und wo ich geh' geh'n sie

Erlebten Lebensstromschnellen, machten uns bereit

Wir zwei war'n die Augen des Sturms
Wurden Herrscher der Schwingung und das als Nichtschwimmer
Denn wir hatten es und halten es noch immer

Wir waren Liebende, die ab und zu vor Liebe blind
Um einander trieben, waren zu verschieden
Als dass es hätte langweilig werden können
War'n zwei echt gute Spinner, absolute Beginner
Wir hatten es und halten es noch immer
Streiften alle Ketten ab, die sonst die Leichtigkeit besiegen
Konnten fliegen, ohne Flügel fliegen

Ich hab' Millionen Legionen hinter mir
Du hast Millionen Legionen hinter dir

Es war die Nacht der Vampire in der Stadt der wilden Tiere
Sie ziehen mich zu sich, wenn ich das Gleichgewicht verliere
Geh' ich unter und verschmelz' mit dieser Masse von Mutanten
Seelenloser Wanderer und deren Artverwandten
Und ich ringe zum Himmel, dass die Stimmung hier umschwingt
Heb' die Hände zu Gott, oder wer immer da rumhängt
Herrscher über mein Leben, dieser Trohn gehört mir
Ich wohn' und regier' hier
Und dann erheb' ich meine Feder zum Schutz gegen den Schmerz
Der vom Schlachtfeld der Liebe zu mir rüber dringt
Obwohl es scheint, als ob hier jeder trübe Lieder singt
Wasch' ich mich rein und betrete neues Land
Dieser Junge steht am Rand und mit nichts in der Hand
Ohne Angst in den Augen, mit dem Rücken zur Wand

Und dann ruft er alle Superhelden, alle großen Meister
Alle Highlander, alle Krieger, alle guten Geister
Alle Superfreaks, Auserwählten und er ruft mich

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Was, was geht ab bei dir?
Was, was, ey, was machst du hier, was hä?
Was, was geht ab bei mir?
Ey, was machst du hier, du Schmock, hä?

Ach komm, lass mich in Ruh, halt die Fresse, mach dich weg hier
Die alte Tour von dir hat doch keinen Zweck mehr
Seit ich denken kann, funkst du mir dazwischen
Dass ich mir das schenken kann und dies von der Backe wischen
Die Tour hemmt mich, lenkt mich ab
Bremst mich aus bei meinem Plan, den ich noch längst nicht hab
Du kennst mich ja und weißt genau, wie du mich kriegst
Wie du mein Ego wie Lego auseinander-ziehst
Doch als Betrüger und Brüder im Geist gegenüber
Auf der Suche nach uns selbst werden wir nicht klüger
Ich schau in deine Augen, schau durch sie hindurch, sehe mich
Hör mich mit deiner Stimme reden und versteh' mich nicht
Doch Heuchler wandern selten auf dem Weg zu anderen Welten
Weil ihnen der Weg des Zieles schon zu viel ist
Dein irres Ringen nach den Dingen hat doch keinen Zweck
Mach dich weg, mach dich weg, mach dich weg!

Was, was geht ab bei dir?

Ja ja, fang' bloß nicht wieder mit der gleichen Scheiße an
Ist klar, du kommst genau, wenn ich nicht weiter weiß und dann
„Blabla,“ gibst du mir deinen Text, das übliche Programm
„Haha,“ und denkst, der Rest erübrigt sich dann irgendwann
Doch wer bin ich, verdammt nochmal, und wer bin ich nicht
Je mehr ich nach mir suche, desto mehr find' ich dich
Woher nimmst du das Recht, zu wissen was richtig ist?
So sehr das jetzt noch schmerzt, du bist nicht wichtig für mich
Denn du bist nichts ohne mich und hast mich trotzdem im Griff
Du zeigst mir nie dein Gesicht und trotzdem kenne ich dich
Verstehe nicht, warum gerade du es immer bist, der mir die Meinung sagt
Die meistens die von anderen ist, weil du selber keine Peilung hast
Also was, lass deine Finger von mir
Du kannst doch eh nur verlieren, also was willst du noch hier
Na klar, du machst mich zum Star, nur sonderbar
Ich wollte nie 'ne Rolle haben in 'ner Soap Opera
Doch ich war schneller Darsteller der's nur noch brachte
Wenn das Drehbuch von dir war und mich unsichtbar machte
Jetzt schreib' ich auf Papier, was ich schon immer dachte
Dass ich dich am allermeisten an mir was

Was, was geht ab bei dir?
Was, was, ey, was machst du hier, was hä?
Was, was geht ab bei mir?
Ey, was machst du hier, du Schmock, hä?
Was, was geht ab bei dir?
Was, was, ey, was machst du hier, was hä?

Wir hatten das Vergnügen, wie oft in diesem Jahr
Standen wir uns gegenüber und ich war mir klar
Du warst hinüber, hattest einen über alle Maßen abenteuerlichen
Abend verbracht, das Sagen gehabt
An keinen Rahmen gedacht und dir 'n Namen gemacht
Als Mister Cool-Motherfucker warst der Star dieser Nacht
Der Macker auf'm Powertrip, suchst den nächsten Dauerkick
Bist dabei überall verteilt, nur nicht im Augenblick
Du blubberst Blasen in die Luft, die dir den Sauerstoff rauben
Bist am Saugen, ist ja kaum zu glauben
Wie kann man ohne Pause alle Nase lang auf Toilette gehen
Und zwischen drin die selbst-gebauten Zigaretten drehen?
Nur um dann neben mir zu stehen, ich weiß jedes Mal
Ich lieb im Leben nicht jeden, doch du bist mir egal
Und deshalb werd' ich mir vergeben und lass dich ziehen

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Das hier geht an alle (was?)
Ungeduldigen ich muss mich noch entschuldigen
Wegen dem Mangel an Gelegenheiten mich zu huldigen
Vergesst alle die hippen kultigen Bands
Die und deren Fans sind die wahren Schuldigen für die Misere
Dass die Ehre guter Sprechgesangsmusik
Leider im Mittelmaß versinkt weil´s zu wenig davon gibt
Keine Angst ich kümmer' mich darum zertrümmer diesen Trend

Alles in Butter Zucker bin nur der Mucker
Mit dem F4-def-Beat-Smu-Soulfutter Mutter
Wie immer auf´m Zimmer hörst du das Geflimmer
Deiner Lautsprecherboxen dreh sie auf bis sie kotzen
Doch die Hausmeister motzen drohen mit dem Finger
Glauben allen Ernstes wir Vier verrohen die jungen Dinger
Viel schlimmer ist, dass ohne blassen Schimmer
Diese Spinner nicht checken, dass wir es sind die diese Welt retten
Denn ich rat' nichts anderes als ich selber tu
Denn dein Leben ist ein Film ich mach Musik dazu
Denn mein Image wasserfest wie dein Tattoo
Denn ich bin gut wie für dein Auto ASU
Die kreischenden Horden fragen nach dem Namen
Des fleischgewordenen MC Messias des Groove
Sie fragen Smudodododo

Beats voll der Hammer vom Kiez bis an die Ammer
Gib mir liebe sag´n die Mädchen ich glaub das kann man machen
Alle lachen machen sich nackig fühlen sich fantastisch
Aus dem Häuschen wie auf Haschisch das Päuschen hat ein Ende
Leute toben Hände geh´n nach oben oben ohne alle
Ist Smu im Haus wackeln die Wände jeder Halle
Alle atmen Tanzvergnügen in vollen ganzen Zügen
Weil nur meine Jungs und ich über frische Beats verfügen
Hartgesottene Experten rätseln und verhärten
Ihr Gehirn auf den Konzerten sind doch auf falschen Fährten
Weil sie trotz vermehrten Recherchen niemals merken
Dass es etwas mehr Bedarf um Hip Hop zu verwerten
Außer bunten Clips mit schicken Tricks und hippen Schnitten
In denen Mietcliquen zum Beatnicken böse Blicken
Unsere Fans aber wippen mit´m Schwänz ihre Mädels gehen fremd
Denn sie lieben uns als Band

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Unter meinem Kopfkissen schlummert das Wissen und die Erfahrung
Von Milliarden von Jahren die zu bewahren waren
Doch es lag brach, keiner fragte danach
Bis zu dem Tag an dem wir kamen, es uns nahmen um abzufahren
Ab da waren die Segel gesetzt, die Regeln verletzt
Neue Wege betreten und Ideen vernetzt
Jetzt setzt's 'n Satz heiße Ohren
Denn wir sind so weit vorn
Dass wir dich immer wieder überholen
Immer wieder holen wir uns Stoff für neue Lieder
Was für Bodybuilder Anabolika, oder Bier für Alkoholiker
War für und mit jedem Atemzug das Leben hart genug
Das es alleine schon die Hammer-Droge war

War ja wohl klar, dass so was eh nicht ewig geht
Wenn sich zu wenig bewegt und sich dein Lebensweg nur gegen dich dreht
Hast du zu wenig gelebt denn eine Regel besteht
Dass wenn du festsitzt wo du jetzt bist immer weniger geht
Und deshalb nahmen wir das Steuer in die Hand
Brachen auf in neues Land und entfachten Feuer wo man uns fand
Was heute jedem bekannt und da zu leben begann
Bedeutete den Neuanfang für ein paar Leute mit Sachverstand

Doch verstanden wir schnell das Verstehen
Nur zum Teil durch Verstand entsteht und es auch anders geht
Haben Grenzen überwunden und am Rand gelebt
Und so gefunden was den Stift in der Hand bewegt
Doch wir rauben deinen Glauben, brechen jedes Versprechen
Jede Sicherheit wird sich ganz sicher bitter an dir rächen
Jeder falsche Prophet im Land macht sich stark
Doch bei uns gibt's die Erleuchtung für 30 Mark
Und die Erwachten verbrachten",Und Täglich Grüßen Fanta Vier/Romantic Fighters,1999
Die Fantastischen Vier,"Was verlangst du von dir? Hast du Angst
Vor dem, was du kannst, was noch kommt
Was du dir verdankst und ob du noch taugst?
Vergiss nicht, du bist was du brauchst

Es war mein Wille, mich durch die Stille selbst zu finden
Neu zu definieren, um mich zu überwinden
Mich zu verlieren, um meinen Mittelpunkt zu treiben
Um dann verschwommen zu mir zu kommen und hier zu bleiben
Der Ort ohne Zeit schmeckt nach mehr und ich wehr' mich nicht
Mein Geist schreit „Befrei' mich doch! Verehr' mich nicht!""
Ich hing am Tropf meines Lebens, doch mein Kopf bleibt leer
Der Deal ist fair wie damals am Meer
Er lässt mich gehen, ohne zu laufen, ohne einen Trümmerhaufen hinter mir
Ohne Ziel im Visier und ohne Rahmen
Frei, voll Hoffnung und mit neuem Namen werde ich gehen
Doch es stehen meinen sieben Sünden um mich im Kreis
Die Freiheit hat ihren Preis und ich bezahl' mit meinem Leben
Und weiß, jede Verneinung birgt Leiden
Und auch meine Erscheinung wird die Zeit vertreiben
Doch ich werd' Zeilen schreiben, die bleiben

Gerade wenn man bedenkt, dass Gedanken einschränken
Wie Schranken, wie Wände, warum verschwende ich dann
Zeit ohne Ende mich selbst zu blenden, abzulenken
Platt zu denken, glaub' zu kennen, was wir können
Doch ich renne auf der Stelle, kenne nicht die Quelle meiner Qual
Wie bei Wählern ohne Wahl bleiben am Ende nur noch Zahlen
Also prelle ich die Zeche, wähle Planverlust
Denn meine Sicherheit ist künstlich wie 'n Darmverschluss
Darum muss erstmal alles raus, was hier nicht reingehört
Alles was mein Sein im Keim zerstört, wird zum Feind erklärt
Und ich erklär' mir den Krieg um den Frieden mit mir selbst
Ziehe in die Schlacht gegen mein eigenes Spiegelbild
Tret' die Tür ein, lass mich fallen, um dann ungebremst
In allem weiter zu gelangen. Weiter als du denkst

Was verlangst du von dir? Hast du Angst
Vor dem, was du kannst, was noch kommt
Was du dir verdankst und ob du noch taugst?
Vergiss nicht, du bist was du brauchst

Fühlst du dich als Greis, dessen Geist um sich kreist?
Wärst du gerne wieder blind, wie ein Kind, das nicht weiß
Was es heißt, dass wir alle älter werden
Dass wir alle kälter werden?
Oder sind das flüchtende Gedanken, gezüchtet hinter Schranken
Die heute reif geworden sind und sich bei dir bedanken
dich verwirren und benebeln? Doch Glaube schafft Gesetze
Hinten stehen im Leben eben nicht die Logenplätze
Doch die Werte der Welt sind ihr fremd und du kennst das
Und irgendwie hemmt das
Und jede Nacht wachst du auf, denn die altbekannten Artverwandten
Geister deiner Seele warten auf neue Befehle
Und du spürst plötzlich deine Macht über sie und lachst über sie
Weil du zu dir kommst
Wenn du fühlst wie du hier alles lenkst kommst du weiter
Weiter als du denkst",Weiter Als du Denkst,1999
Die Fantastischen Vier,"Schau dich hier um und dann in dich hinein
Denn jeder brauch 'nen Platz zum glücklich sein
Wir laden dich und deine Leute ein, um heute da zu sein wo man sich liebt

In der Stadt, die es nicht gibt
Geht der Beat ab und schiebt an und zu
Durch die Straßen in denen jeder Ahnung auf diesem Gebiet hat
Allen voran dieser Mann der in Groovefragen
Jedem und auf alles eine Antwort geben kann
Denn im Kampf gegen wack Beats hat der Bürgermeister
Jede Kurve schon gekriegt und Jede Hürde schon gemeistert
In der City ist kein Platz für shitty Mucke, die nicht klingt
Weil in der Stadt die's nicht gibt jeder swingt Baby
Weil alle ohne Ende grooven stylen oder rocken
Wenn sie in der Zone moven und in Häuserzeilen rocken
Dieser Mob kämpft unerschrocken gegen Pop wie gegen Pocken
Gegen Schlagerstreptokokken und ähnlichen Schrott yeah
Ich weiß ihr seid Genossen packt euch an die Flossen
Denn jedes Mal haben Freaks wie ihr die da oben weggeschossen
Denn alle Kids Chicks Knacker Macker Style Spacker Babies
Machen diesen Traum wahr weil's dafür nie zu spät ist (ah, yeah weil's dafür nie zu spät ist, Baby)

Und alle gehen wieder ab und bleiben wach die ganze Nacht lang
Weil wir mal wieder die Nacht zum Tag gemacht haben
Und ohne Gruppen oder Sachzwang Alter
Tanzen die Puppen sogar bei den Nachbarn also
Hier geht mal nix vor Nachmittags macht dir klar
Dass letzte Nacht ne dicke Party in der Stadt war
Und alle waren dabei bunt wie Smarties
Halten ihren Kopf gesund durch Parties
Halten ihre Seelen sauber durch Soulmusik rollen Spliffs
Morgens gibt's statt Brot frische Beats auf'n Tisch
Und dann bebt die Stadt lebt anstatt stets nur platt
Fett und satt zu machen was sonst jeder macht
Jeder lacht hier in der Straßenbahn
Denn anstatt zu zahlen wird hier schwarzgefahren
Und anstatt zu sparen wird hier rausgetan
Damit auch noch was da ist für die Armen Amen

Schau dich hier um und dann in dich hinein
Denn jeder brauch 'nen Platz zum glücklich sein
Wir laden dich und deine Leute ein
Um heute da zu sein wo man sich liebt

Hat man kapiert dass hier die Liebe siegt
In der Stadt, die es nicht gibt 

Ja ja ja (yeah)
Ja ja ja (come on, komm doch zu ihrem Boy)

Wir rappen zu Beats checken die Cheats smacken den Kiez
Kidnappen die Freaks und die Chics um in geheimen 
Und ganz intimer Geheimlaboren auch mit ihnen nach den Formeln zu bohren 
Die schon verloren schienen, ja dealen mit den geilste Styles im kleinsten Kreis
Testen die besten Vibes die höchsten Heights
Größtenteils durch das Erlebnis des Ergebnis in Fahrt
Ist hier die Party am Start auf die die Stadt gewartet hat
Doch warte mal denn es war allemal 'ne harte Wahl
Die Masken fielen wie nach Karneval
Die meisten liefen aus dem Tal der tiefen Superdepressionen heraus
Und über Schall ins Licht und überall war neues Land in Sicht
Alle verstanden sich and Babylon did fall und alle wandten sich
Gegen die Lügen der Betrügenden, die uns nicht mehr genügen
Denn sie blocken und schocken uns und sind scheinbar nicht zu zügeln
Wenn die Welt ihre Welle nicht am leben hält
Sich unserem Vibe in der Zukunft nichts entgegenstellt
Erreichen wir die Innenwelt und wenden das Blatt
Wenn euch der Krach dann wachgemacht hat
Seid ihr willkommen in der Stadt

Welcome everybody, peace and happiness

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Die Sonne scheint der Tag ist wie neu,
kein Augenblick den ich bereuh,
das Gewitter ist weg und war wichtig für jeden,
die Luft ist noch feucht,
es riecht noch nach Regen,
ich hab Angst gehabt als es über mich hereinbrach,
mich gefragt ist das heute wirklich dein Tag,
mich gewagt mich den Wolken zu stellen,
hielt mich fest an momenten um mich noch zu erhelln,
doch ich war zu verschwommen in alledem,
mit Sicherheiten so angenehm,
dann word mein Leben leider zu bequem,
und überraschend wie´n schaltjahr war zahltag,
alle hattens kommen sehn,
ich stellte mich dumm,
hatte Angst zu versagen,
und das machte mich stumm,
jedoch mich nicht zu verschonen war richtig,
denn die Lektionen des Lebens warn wichtig.

Es ist klar, der Regen wäscht auf jeden fall,
weg was war, und es erscheint mir überall,
schenkt er auch neues Leben,
ne neue Chance für jeden,
wenn sonnenlicht durch wolken bricht,
wie nach nem sommerregen.

Der Sonnenschein der uns beiden gefiehl,
brachte alleine noch keinen ans ziel,
wir gingen zu zweit um uns zu begleiten,
mieden den streit suchten nur gute Zeiten,
doch die spannung bleibt, statt zusammen zu schweigen,
bedrückende stille zwischen uns beiden,
dann war es zu spät um sich zu begegnen,
mein Lebensweg baby sehnt sich nach regen,
doch wir mieden den Sturm,
blieben daheim,
wir alle bauen diesen Turm, schließen uns ein,
um sicher zu gehn, bleibt jeder allein,
und mit sicherheit gehn wir genau daran ein,
komm wir lehnen uns wieder gegen den wind,
und wir erleben I'm regen wessen wege es sind,
wenn wir schicksalsergeben uns I'm tal begegnen,
um tränen zu zählen I'm rinnsal des lebens.

Wer hat Euch denn hier reingelassen, sind die jetzt bescheuert?
Der Chabo an der Kasse ist gefeuert
Was heißt denn hier die Vier, da fehlt doch eine Fresse
Zeigt erstmal eure Pässe, ihr seid ja net mal Hesse

Ich will euch weder hier noch in den Charts wieder sehen
Schaut euch mal um ihr Loser, das is'n Hip Hop Laden
Kommt wieder wenn wir zu hab, Mittwoch Abend
Vergesst eure drei Bier der Vierte der macht's richtig
Ist erstens nicht hier und mach sich zweitens nicht so wichtig
Ihr seid schwanzlose Posers out wie Guns 'N Roses
Raus ich hol den Moses der zeigt euch dann was los is
Wobie der voll ausklinkt wenn der euch groß rausbringt
Wollt ihr dass der Abend so ausklingt?
Noch deutlicher jetzt euch wollen wir hier net
Also macht euch Weg mit eurem Stuttgart Dreck",Bring It Back,2004
Die Fantastischen Vier,"Wie lange ist das jetzt her? War das ein anderes Leben?
Denn ich weiß nichts mehr von dir, außer was wir erlebten.
Hab keine Ahnung was du machst oder wo du jetzt bist?
Weiß nicht wen du vermisst und war das jemals ich?
Hab noch irgendwo 'ne Nummer, doch was hilft mir die schon?
Das mit uns beiden war noch leider vor 'm Mobiltelefon.
Und selbst wär's noch die gleiche, ich glaub ich würd' es nie wagen.
Denn wenn ich dich erreiche, was soll ich dir denn sagen?

Dachte ehrlich, dass mit uns hätt'sich schon ewig erledigt.
Doch jetzt denk' ich mehr denn je an dich zurück und versteh' nicht
War es ein wenig zu viel oder war's nur viel zu wenig?
Sag mal geht das nur mir so oder geht es dir ähnlich?

Glaubst du nicht, dass das mit uns was ganz besonderes war
Und, dass wir beide nur zu jung waren um das schon zu erahnen?
Glaubst du nicht, das es mir leid tut, was ich alles gesagt hab?
Bitte dich um Verzeihung, selbst wenn du nicht drauf wartest
Würd' dir gern sagen, vieles damals konnt' ich noch nicht verstehen
Hab das Gefühl wir beide sollten uns wiedersehen
Hätt' noch so viel zum bereden, dann probier ich es eben

Diese nummer ist nicht vergeben.

Dachte ehrlich, dass mit uns hätt'sich schon ewig erledigt.
Doch jetzt denk' ich mehr denn je an dich zurück und versteh' nicht
War es ein wenig zu viel oder war's nur viel zu wenig?
Sag mal geht das nur mir so oder geht es dir ähnlich?

OK das war nichts entspann' dich
War klar, dass ich dich nicht auf Anhieb gleich drankrieg
Doch ich frag mich wirklich oft, wo du seit damals gelebt hast
Und kapiere nicht, wieso sind wir uns nie mehr begegnet?
War noch 'n paar Mal in dem Laden, in dem wir uns trafen
Gestern Abend nochmal in der Bar, in der wir oft saßen
Es war im Grunde wie früher nur 'n bisschen umdekoriert
Ich saß 'ne Stunde lang hier und hatt' die Nummer von dir
Der Vorwahl nach 'n Mobile, könntest überall sein
Wenn ich mich bei dir melden würde, führt das zu weit?
Doch ich fühl' mich allein und ich hoff' du verstehst mich
Sag mal geht das nur mir so oder geht es dir ähnlich?

Ruf sie an, Ruf sie an, Ruf sie schon an, Mann!

Doch jetzt denk' ich mehr denn je an dich zurück und versteh' nicht
War es ein wenig zu viel oder war's nur viel zu wenig?
Sag mal geht das nur mir so oder geht es dir ähnlich?

Natürlich warst du damals nur ein junger Typ.
Was hast du? nur geübt oder warst du verliebt?
Natürlich war sie für dich ja 'ne Hammerbraut
Und ihr habt lang geglaubt, dass ihr kein' anderen braucht
Doch dann kam alles anders, sie war zweite Wahl
Und alles, was ihr hattet war dir scheißegal
Du denkst wieder mal an damals, es ist keine mehr da
Was willst du mit ihr machen, ey, das gleiche nochmal?
Hast du wirklich dran geglaubt, das sie alles so schluckt
Drei Jahre Sex and the City, hast nicht einmal gekuckt
Sie hatte leider genug und du bist selber der Grund
Du bist zwar älter geworden aber nicht heller geworden
Und deshalb mach jetzt bitte mal halblang Kollege
Das ist echt nicht so unterhaltsam für jeden
Und du hast lange gebraucht, doch es gibt andere Frauen
Und wenn du endlich mal die Augen aufmachst, siehst du das auch

Wenn er endlich mal die Augen aufmacht, sieht er es auch

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Ich habe viele gesehen drauf kommen drauf gehen
Egal wie viele bestehen für welche Ziele sie stehen
Ob sie sich ducken und bücken, ich seh' sie Schnuppen und drücken
Ich seh' sie schlucken und spucken, um sich dann neu zu bestücken
Sie liegen unter Brücken in Regency Suiten
Bieten mir ihre Seelen an, die sie selbst verrieten
Hielten sich für die Größten und entblößten sich als Nieten
Um es wieder zu probieren und wieder zu verlieren
Und nie zu kapieren, wohin die Ziele zielen dieser Spiele, die sie spielen
Selbst auf den Knien merken viele noch nicht, dass sie fielen
Millionen Wege, dein Leben zu vergeben
Du kannst mir nicht entgehen, aber komm mir nicht entgegen

Hey Hey Hey

Hat sich gut ergeben, dein Leben, die ganzen Millionen
Die guten Geschäfte und Investitionen
Von allem das beste Haus und Balkon
Und rauschende Feste mit tausend Personen
Und du bist jedermanns Freund, nie 'nen Abend versäumt
Immer perfekt sonnengebräunt, wovon jeder träumt
Ist nicht die Frage, was du dir alles leisten kannst
Doch keine Träume zu haben macht dir am meisten Angst
Wie geisteskrank willst du dabei sein um jeden Preis
Scheint mir, dein Leben kreist ums High-sein von jedem Scheiß
Und keiner kann sehen, dass du zerbrechlich bist, weil es kein
Hässlich gibt, wenn selbst dein Spiegelbild bestechlich ist
Und die Jahre vergehen, du versuchst sie zu halten
Chirurgie und Chemie für eine Welt ohne Falten
Bist von außen geliftet, von innen vergiftet
Tut mir Leid, deine Zeit ist befristet - denn

Du weißt nicht, wie viel Zeit dir bleibt
Sei besser jederzeit bereit
Am Ende nehm' ich jedem das Leben
Du kannst mir nicht entgehen
Aber komm mir nicht entgegen

Du weißt nicht, wie viel Zeit dir bleibt
Sei besser jederzeit bereit
Am Ende nehm' ich jedem das Leben
Du kannst mir nicht entgehen
Aber komm mir nicht entgegen

Du hast wieder alles gegeben, hast alles genommen
Warst nich' nur daneben, hast dich auch so benommen
Bist wenigstens deinem Leben 'ne Nacht lang entkommen
Das Problem ist nur, eben hat es zu dämmern begonnen
Und jeder Sonnenstrahl trifft dich wie 'ne Kugel aus Stahl
Schießt Bilder in deinen Kopf, die dir vor Stunden egal
Und alte Wunden fangen wieder zu bluten an
Du starrst nur Löcher in die Luft hundert Minuten lang
Was tut man, wenn alles um einen rum wie hinter Nebel liegt?
Allein daheim und leere Stille knebelt dich
Die ganze Welt scheint, als sei sie irgendwie gegen dich
Und dann gelegentlich siehst du den Grund zu leben nicht mehr
Und eigentlich ist es dir egal, du hast es eh aufgegeben
Ist doch bloß schwieriger zu laufen als durchs Leben zu schweben
Genau deswegen scheint es nichts mehr zu geben, was dich hält
Doch dieses Mal schwebst du nicht mehr, du fällst

Du weißt nicht, wie viel Zeit dir bleibt
Sei besser jederzeit bereit
Am Ende nehm' ich jedem das Leben
Du kannst mir nicht entgehen

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Du kannst den Kack nicht mehr hören
Jedem geht's mehr schlecht als recht, alle sind abgeturnt
Und alle Jahre wieder ist's das gleiche Spiel
Von deinem hart verdienten bleibt nur halb so viel
Die paar Scheine sind anscheinend immer weniger wert
Mit deiner freien Entscheidung läuft's scheinbar ähnlich verkehrt
Alter was geht denn bei dir? Dein halbes Leben studiert
Nur um jetzt hin und wieder mal was nebenher zu verdienen
Wo sind denn jetzt die Jobs der neunziger Jahre geblieben
Mit Gute Laune Dot Com und Partyinsel im Süden?
Die ganzen Leute von früher irgendwie keiner mehr hier
Deine Flammen alle schwanger aber keine von dir
Langsam bröckelt das alles, aus dem Auge aus dem Sinn
Stell' dir vor es ist Klassentreff und keiner geht hin
Die fahren doch alle Kombi ham 'nen Hund und 'nen Ring am Finger

Bis jetzt hat's gereicht, denn die Woche ist noch lang?

Ja vielleicht brauch' ich nur ein bisschen Zeit für mich?
Ja vielleicht bin ich auch nur dauernd breit und dicht?
Ja vielleicht
Und jetzt ja vielleicht auch nicht
Eigentlich ist alles OK und eigentlich willst du nichts ändern
Solange es geht und eigentlich hast du doch
Alles im Griff und du weißt wer du bist
Nur die Scheiße ist, eigentlich reicht dir nicht
Du willst weiter und musst leider noch bleiben
Denn es ist keiner bereit dich zu begleiten
Die sind alle mehr so wieder mal sehen und früher war's schön
Und viel zu bequem um allein zu entscheiden
Jeder hat Schiss dass er auf der Strecke bleibt
Sein Leben lang wie 'ne Motte um das Licht an der Decke kreist
Deine Ideale werden dir egaler wenn du dein Gewissen
Besser zu verstecken weißt
Doch du fühlst dich nicht nach Zweisamkeit im Eigenheim
Versuchst dir treu zu bleiben, frei zu sein
Versuchst dabei zu reifen, high zu bleiben
Musst weiter reisen um daheim zu sein

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Ich senke mein Haupt,
Ich habe mir erlaubt, in mich zu kehren mich nicht zu wehren.
Es sei dir erlaubt,
Über mich hinweg zu sehen, doch willst du mich bekehren
Dann erheb' ich mein Haupt.
Du kannst in meinen Augen sehen, ich werd' zu meinem Glauben stehen
Und ganz egal, was du glaubst,
Du erfährst den Weg, den ich geh, gewählt durch mein Schwert.

Ich will nicht predigen, ich will mich jeder Regel entledigen.
Will, im Augenblick lebend, dir im Vertrauen begegnen.
Schau in die Augen von jedem und kann's nicht länger verneinen.
Was ich euch sage, wird uns trennen oder für immer vereinen.
Ich kann mich schützend vor euch stellen und unverletzt bleiben.
Euch 'nen Text schreiben, Kraft geben durch meine Zeilen
Um zu beschreiben, zu beschwören und es nie zu bereuen.
Ich bleibe jeder Zeile treu, ich schreibe jede Zeile neu,
Wenn die Wahrhaftigkeit des Wortes sich für jeden enthüllt,
Werden Gedanken ausgesprochen und mit Leben gefüllt
Aus reinem Herzen berichtet, nicht durch Lügen entehrt,
Wird jeder Zweifel vernichtet, denn das Wort ist ein Schwert,
Mein Schwert.

Du führst den Kampf dein Leben lang,
Nur leider führst du ihn nicht an.
Du schneidest dich ins eigene Fleisch
Und leidest still, weil du es weißt.
Du trennst dein Herz von deinem Verstand,
Du kennst den Schmerz, ist dir bekannt.
Denn das, was du nicht haben kannst,
Bleibt ewig das, was du verlangst.

Wen siehst du, wenn du dir im Spiegel gegenüber stehst?
Wen siehst du, wenn du keinen außer deinen Wegen gehst?
Wen siehst du, wenn du dich für niemand anderen hältst?
Niemand anderen als dich selbst.
Wen siehst du, wenn du dir im Spiegel gegenüber stehst?
Wen siehst du, wenn du keinen außer deinen Wegen gehst?
Wen siehst du, wenn du dich für niemand anderen hältst?
Niemand anderen als dich selbst.

Doch du gehst deinen Weg, allein unter allen,
Nicht um gemeinsam zu stehen, nur um einsam zu fallen.
Hast du früher noch gedacht, wir wären alle vereint,
Ziehst du heute in die Schlacht und hast jeden zum Feind.
Durch deinen Größenwahn vermessen, macht dein Ego sich breit.
Deine Besessenheit vergessend, sagst du jedem Bescheid.
Legst deine Freiheit in Fesseln bei jeder Gelegenheit,
Statt dich der Liebe zu ergeben in alle Ewigkeit.
Noch immer flieht dein Verstand, benommen, verirrt
Vergebens vor dem Augenblick, in dem ihm alles genommen wird.
Dein Leben wird beschwerlicher mit jedem Tag,
Dein Herz schlägt einmal weniger mit jedem Schlag.

Du führst den Kampf dein Leben lang,
Nur leider führst du ihn nicht an.
Du schneidest dich ins eigene Fleisch
Und leidest still, weil du es weißt.

Du bist gewillt, hier zu bestehen,
Mit Schwert und Schild deinen Weg zu gehen,
Vereinst dein Herz mit deinem Verstand.
Du kennst den Schmerz, ist dir bekannt,
Du schneidest nicht ins eigene Fleisch
Und leidest nicht mehr, weil du weißt,
Dass du dich von der Angst entfernst,
Wenn du dein Schwert zu führen lernst.

Ich bin die Liebe, gekommen um zu richten
über die, die uns in Kriege verstricken.
Ich leb' in Frieden, um alle Lügen zu vernichten,
Die sonst mich und meine Brüder vergiften.
Ich bin ein Krieger, steh' auf der Seite von jenen,
Die nicht nur über Bestimmungen reden.
Ich geb' mein Leben, um nach Vollkommenheit zu streben,
Zu verändern und mich weiter zu bewegen
Und da die Kraft meiner Seele mich stärkend führt
Und jede Waffe, die ich wähle mich im Herzen berührt,
Will ich keinen verletzen, ich will nur das ihr seht.

Gegenden den Pegel heben das waren unsre Lebensregeln
Als sie uns uns knebelten waren wir zuerst dagegen denn wir hatten eben noch was zu
Erledigen
Der größte Plan fiel unter Größenwahn
Ein ominöses Verfahren brachte die Lösung nach Jahren anstatt an Brösel zu sparen
Und sich wie Schnösel zu paaren verordnen wir ab morgen Orgien und lösen den Plan.

Kein Augenblick den ich bereuh',
Das Gewitter ist weg und war wichtig für jeden,
Die Luft ist noch feucht,
Es riecht noch nach Regen,
Ich hab Angst gehabt als es über mich hereinbrach,
Mich gefragt ist das heute wirklich dein Tag,
Mich gewagt mich den Wolken zu stellen,
Hielt mich fest an Momenten um mich noch zu erhellen,
Doch ich war zu verschwommen in alledem,
Mit Sicherheiten so angenehm,
Dann wird mein Leben leider zu bequem,
Und überraschend wie ´n Schaltjahr war Zahltag,
Alle hatten's kommen sehen,
Ich stellte mich dumm,
Hatte Angst zu versagen,
Und das machte mich stumm,
Jedoch mich nicht zu verschonen war richtig,
Denn die Lektionen des Lebens waren wichtig.

Es ist klar, der Regen wäscht auf jeden Fall,
Weg was war, und es erscheint mir überall,
Schenkt er auch neues Leben,
'Ne neue Chance für jeden,
Wenn Sonnenlicht durch Wolken bricht,
Wie nach 'nem Sommerregen.

Der Sonnenschein, der uns beiden gefiel,
Brachte alleine noch keinen ans ziel,
Wir gingen zu zweit um uns zu begleiten,
Mieden den Streit suchten nur gute Zeiten,
Doch die Spannung bleibt, statt zusammen zu schweigen,
Bedrückende Stille zwischen uns beiden,
Dann war es zu spät um sich zu begegnen,
Mein Lebensweg Baby sehnt sich nach Regen,
Doch wir mieden den Sturm,
Blieben daheim,
Wir alle bauen diesen Turm, schließen uns ein,
Um sicher zu gehen, bleibt jeder allein,
Und mit Sicherheit gehen wir genau daran ein,
Komm wir lehnen uns wieder gegen den Wind,
Und wir erleben im Regen wessen Wege es sind,
Wenn wir Schicksalsergeben uns im Tal begegnen,
Um Tränen zu zählen im Rinnsal des Lebens.

Du hattest schlechte Zeiten
Und wir waren auch dabei
Wir werden dich begleiten

Die Zeit war hart, kein High nur Low
Und immer wieder diese Popstar-Show
Bei keinem andern war es wieder so
Wie bei der coolen Band um Smu-D-O
Du hattest deinen Spaß von Date zu Date
Doch irgendwie hat irgendwo immer irgendwas gefehlt
Ey, spielt keine Rolle wie viel Zeit vergeht
Für wahre Liebe ist es nie zu spät
Du weißt, du und ich das war schon was
Wir rauchten Stash und Weed und Gras en masse
Ich hab dich vollgetextet, du hast zugehört
Wir hatten tollen Sex mit allem Zubehör
Ich frage, „was ist alt und rostet eh nicht?
Was hält jung und kostet wenig?“
Fan und Band, Girl und Boy, Siegfried und Roy

Wir kennen uns 'ne halbe Ewigkeit
Hatten zu jeder Zeit nur wenig Streit
Nur ab und zu gab's mal ein bisschen Knatsch
Durch all den Klatsch und Tratsch fühltest du dich verarscht
Aber es war nicht schwer dich wieder rumzukriegen
Diese vier Jungs sind zum Verlieben
Scheint, als wären wir immer jung geblieben
Waren nicht sehr verschwiegen, aber schwer verschieden
Mal brauchtest du jemand, eloquent und gelehrt
Der dir die Welt erklärt oder mit dir Rennen fährt
Mal wolltest du 'n bisschen tiefer gehen
Alternative Ideen zu unserm miesen System
Oder dir war mal eher so nach Luxus-Yacht
Und wir haben durchgemacht im coolsten Club der Stadt
Doch immer trafen wir den richtigen Ton
Machten dir nie was vor, hätte sich nicht gelohnt
Kaum 'ne Band im Land die dir troyer war
Bei der die CD dir nie zu teuer war
Musik ist Therapie, wir sind versteuerbar
Jetzt sag mir nochmal, du hast 'nen neuen Star, pah!
Ist schon OK, ich versteh' dich ja
Ja, ich find' ja auch, dass er mir ähnlich sah
Jetzt komm' mal her, die Warterei ist vorbei!
Wir sind wieder bei dir und wir bleiben dir troy!

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Dieses Haus ist besetzt ohne Pause bis jetzt
Denn wir kamen zuerst und wir gehen auch zuletzt
Buenos Dias Messias auch wenn's dir nicht paßt
Do bist nur Gast hier do faßt hier nichts an
Bei einigen leidigen Themen lehnen wir's Reden ab
Und leider gibt's nicht viel das noch nicht gesuckt hat
Nicht nach kurzem beknackt war wie der Pappstar der zu matt war
Um mehr zu sein als Jingle zu seinem Abziehbild
Oder ein paar Singles hinter'm Namensschild
Doch ich weiß Image ist nichts und scheiß auf alle die bekannt sind
I'm Land sind zu viele Promis die nicht bei Verstand sind
Zu viele Homies die noch nicht am Strand sind am Rand sind
Zu viele Gaffer deren Augenblicke so leersie wollen noch mehr Helden fallen sehen alle Denker lallen sehen
Ich seh sie schon als Wanker in Museenhallen stehn
Sie werden kommen und gehen alles nur Gesichter
I'm Zeitgeschehen der Club der toten Dichter stimmt mich nicht versöhnlich
Ich werde weitergehen und lebe lieber ungewöhnlich
Denn das hier geht alle unsere Widersacher Wichtigmacher
Cocksucker Motherfucker Hosenkacker
Aalglatte nimmersatte Jammerlappen die wie Ratten in Kloaken
Darauf warten über unsere Platten zu beraten ha
Ihr ganzen Abklemmer Flachwanker Spartendenker
Wir sind eure Rattenfänger autonome Einzelgänger
Weil wir länger halten als der Typ I'm Sarkophag
Während ihr Idioten euer eigenes Grab grabt
Dieses Haus ist besetzt...
Denn wenn ich dir in deiner Welt nichts sagen kann
Wozu dann all diese Fragen Mann
Anscheinend interessiert es dich ja doch was der Typ so treibt
Und wem er was macht und wo er bleibt
Das sowas Mitgefühl ist glaub ich kaum
Ich fürchte fast ich bin dein lebender Alptraum
Müllredender Abschaum der dich ständig disst
Und dabei sag ich doch nur was do für mich bist
Die ganze Pisse die dein Leben durch meine Venen spült
Verursacht Risse und mein Herz unterkühlt
Doch da meine Liebe wasserdicht und meine Seele kugelsicher
Macht ihr Stricher bei mir keinen Stich mehr
Ich bin euer Richter und Henker ihr Wanker und nach mir kommt nichts mehr
Denn das hier geht...
Dieses Haus ist besetzt...
Staubige Hände mit zerknitterten Karten
Von draußen kommen Fremde die auf's Ende des Gewitters warten
Vom Piano klingt dasselbe Lied wie immer
Und Frauen verkaufen Liebe auf dem Zimmer
Dichter Rauch macht Luft zum Schneiden dick
Mit einem Seitenblick erkenn dich I'm Dämmerlicht
Und was ich seh ist jämmerlich falscher Platz falsche Zeit
Diese Stadt ist zu klein für uns zwei
Der Himmel weint kein Mensch weit und breit
Zwanzig Schritte entfernt trennt dich von mir die Ewigkeit
Während ich dir in die Augen schaue merke ich do ziehst
Höre wie do schießt bleib noch stehen und sehe dir zu
Wie do sie dann für immer schließt
Dieses Haus ist besetzt...

Die Fantastischen Vier,"An alle Nixblicker ich bin der Picknicker
Werd's dir erklären doch dann mach erst den Beat Digga
Das ist der Bass und die Snare schießt ein Loch durch die Stirn
Durch dein Ohr dringt der Beat dein Gehirn zum erfrieren
Doch Hausmarke von den vieren wird dich auftauen
Bist du dann unten mit mir werd' ich zu dir aufschauen
Das ist der weg und das Ziel ist das gleiche
Erreiche was du willst meine Skills kriegst du nur über meine Leiche
Braucht keine sau man das kannst knicken
Hier kommt der Plan Hausmarke geht jetzt picknicken

Ich bin der Picknicker
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann
Ich bin der Picknicker
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann
Ich bin der Picknicker
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann

Props an die massiven an die Kopfnicker
Ich bin der picknicker klicker klicker
Ist der groschen jetzt gefallen
Nein dann werd' ich weiter lallen bis es alle schnallen
Fein wer mich also noch nicht kennt rennt vehement inkompetent
Durch die Welt weil er mich für etwas hält was mir nicht gefällt
Denn so ein Picknick mit Familie im freien
Ist mir in diesem Fall ne Nummer zu klein
Fein meine Familie muss größer sein
Die Partypeople die zu Hip Hop Musik tanzen und schreien
Die lad ich ein und wir feiern permanent
Das nur als Argument warum man mich den Picknicker nennt

Ich bin der Picknicker
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann
Ich bin der Picknicker
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann
Ich bin der Picknicker

Ladi dadi wie slick rick
Mag ich die Party doch ich nenn' sie Picknick
Also spar dir die Kritik und verstrick dich nicht
Weil es kein falsch oder richtig gibt was wichtig ist
Ist nicht das wie sondern das wann und das wo
Es gibt kein contra nur pro
Denn du kommst sowieso auf Grund des hohen Niveaus
Wir geben gas und haben Spaß wie markus
Doch nicht im Maserati sondern mit Benz und Ford Taunus
Fahren wir raus auf irgend ne Wiese im stadtpark zu feiern
Das hieße nur Stress mit den spießern
Denn die können nicht verstehen wie Leute abgehen
Die vor nem soundsystem mit fünfzigtausend watt stehen

Ich bin der Picknicker
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann

Und wer jetzt immer noch nichts von meinem Picknick mitkriegt
Drück ich nen Knopf an seinem Kopf wie beim tipp kick
Dann tritt er schritt für schritt hinein in meinen Trip
Und ich nehm' ihn mit bis er Mitwippt
Und hier wippt ne ganze menge seh' ich ins Gedränge
Hänge ich mit meinem blick an der enge ihrer T-shirts fest
Wenn ich dann Beats hör lässt mich das los
Lästig ist dann bloß dass ich nicht mehr weiß wie ich heiß
Rede scheiß mir wird heiß
Und der schweiß auf der stirn ist nicht nur vom tanzen
Doch im großen und ganzen wieder gute Aktion
Das war das letzte Wort der Picknicker Party Fraktion

Ich bin der Picknicker
Kein scheiß mann jeder weiß mann

Wie oft willst du mir noch erzählen wer der herr im hause ist
Wo du doch nur an deinen werten misst wie erfahren du bist
Und was du erreicht hast denn was du verpasst
Wird dann für mich zur last verstehst du das
Du hast nicht das recht dein leben auf mich zu projizieren
Um dann deine meinung in meinen kopf zu tätowieren
Jeder neue anlauf wird dich nur noch mehr frustrieren
Und dadurch wirst du mich verlieren

Nein nie wieder niemals nie mehr
Ich nehm mein leben in die hand ich geb es nicht mehr her
Nein nie wieder nie mehr
Ich sag nein genug ist genug und ab hier geh ich allein

Verdammt was soll ich von dir nehmen wenn du mir nichts gibst
Außer regeln die beweisen sollen das du mich liebst
Mich in deinen fußstapfen zu sehn würde dich freun
Ich würde es für den rest meines lebens bereun
Du lässt das nicht nur zu nein du willst es ja sogar
Was ist los was lässt du mit dir machen ist dir denn nicht klar
Das ist nicht gut für mich das tut mir weh das macht mich krank
Und dabei willst du nur mein bestes vielen dank
Doch ich lass mich nicht mehr von dir beschränken
Oh nein ich hab es satt so zu denken
Und ich lass mich nicht mehr von dir rum kommandiern
Hey du wirst mich einfach verliern

Doch das war dir egal
Es geht hier um mein leben
Und da hab ich die wahl
Und ich bin frei lass mich los lass mich gehn ich sag auf wiedersehn
Du willst und kannst es nicht verstehn ich werd es immer anders Sehn
Doch deine macht hört auf jetzt bin ich dran
Wenn ich jetzt nicht leben kann wann dann
Wann dann wann dann wann dann wann dann wann dann
Wenn nicht jetzt doch du guckst mich nur an
Ich sage dir was ich fühle und ich sage es laut
In mir kommt alles hoch alles was ich niemals verdaut
Bricht raus ich kotze alles aus
Du bist nicht herr in meinem haus ich will nicht mehr als nur hier Raus
Zwischen uns ist es aus weil du mir nichts gibst
Außer schlägen die beweisen sollen das du mich liebst
Hey dass ich nicht lache ist ja wohl klar denn da vergeht es mir
Die sache stinkt steht mir bis hier du hast mich im visier
Und ich hab angst ich kenne diese angst ich steh zu ihr
Und kriege noch mehr angst vor deiner angst in dir
Und es entgleitet mir ich sehe mich in dir warum ich existier
Und ich glaub ich verlier den verstand
Du hast dich nicht im griff und mich in der hand
Und du hast für die konfliktsituation
Natürlich die patentlösung schon
Du sagst zu mir ich tu das nicht weil ich dich hasse ich tu das weil Ich dich mag
Fass mich nicht an denn ich steh unter strom
Und tust du es doch kriegst du nen schlag

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Jetzt bist du da,
Ein Stück deiner Zukunft dabei
Es schon lange klar du
Fühlst dich frei
Wenn die Zukunft zur Gegenwart wird
Hast du es getan
Das Warten
War es wirklich dein Plan
Es verschwindet die Zeit
Darauf du in ihr
Wolken schlagen Salti
Du bist nicht mehr bei dir
Die Zeit kehrt zurück
Und nimmt sich mehr von sich
In ihr bist du schneller
Doch wer bewegt dich
Im Moment ist die Tat
Die du tust
Augenblick
Denn dein Auge erblickt
Was du tust und erschrickt
Vor dem Ding das du kennst
Weil es immer da war
Die Musik ist aus
Und ist immer noch da
Hast du das gewollt
Hast du Angst zu begehren
Jedoch jetzt ist alles anders
Denn wir sind mittendrin
Es dreht sich nur um uns
Und es ist nicht wie bisher
Es macht uns zu Brüdern
Mit dem Tag am Meer

Mit dem Tag am Meer

Du spürst das Gras
Hier und da bewegt sich was
Es macht dir Spaß
Nein es ist nicht nur das
Denn nach dem öffnen aller Türen
Steht am Ende der Trick des Endes
Der Suche durch das Finden im Augenblick
Du atmest ein du atmest aus
Dieser Körper ist dein Haus
Und darin kennst du dich aus
Du lebst
Du bist am Leben
Und das wird dir bewusst
Ohne nachzudenken
Nur aufgrund der eigenen Lebenslust
Das Gefühl das du fühlst
Sagt dir es ist soweit
Es ändern sich Zustand
Der Raum und die Zeit
Der Verstand kehrt zurück
Doch du setzt ihn nicht ein
jeder Schritt neues Land
wird das immer so sein
Du spürst die Lebensenergie
Die durch dich durchfließt
Das Leben wie noch nie in Harmonie und genießt
Es gibt nichts zu verbessern
Nichts was noch besser wär'
Außer dir im Jetzt und Hier
Und dem Tag am Meer

Doch Moment es wird Zeit für meinen Außenkorrespondent
Korrespondent Thomas D. meldet sich zu Wort
Ich bin hier live vor Ort und seh' in einem fort
Wie Menschen sich erheben ihre Körper sich bewegen
Und sie kommen uns entgegen halten Schilder in die Luft
Etwas scheint sie zu erregen, weil fast jeder etwas ruft
Und ich schwör' ich hör sie rufen nach der Vier
Deshalb sind sie hier und ich kapier'

Schau' zurück Mann schon ein paar Jahre her
Da war das Plattanfach mit Rap in deiner Sprache noch leer
Jetzt sag mir wer stand da als erstes drin
Wer hatte recht als er behauptete vier gewinnt
Das waren wir mein Kind und jetzt spitz' dein Ohr
Und setz' dich hin wir singen dir ein Lied vor
Über Schweine
Dann wir machen Reime um die sie uns beneiden Schweine
Und damit auch noch Scheine das können die nicht leiden
Ooh das war gemein ich sah' es ein es war nur wegen dem Reim
Nur Spaß ihr fallt doch darauf nicht mehr rein
Ich mein Ihr wisst doch was ich mein ich wollte auch nur foppen
Denn in Wirklichkeit will ich ""Schwester S"" poppen
Denn ich hab ein Haus ein kunterbuntes Haus

Du hörst die nasse Masse krabbeln wie Asseln
Und Lichter locken Horden von Motten ins Trockene
Sie kommen durch Rohre, bohren sich vor in dein Ohr
Und wohnen dort und fangen langsam zu verrotten an
Es klingt der Wind, als würden Kinder Lieder singen
Ihre Stimmen dringen nach drinnen und fassen dich an
Sie scheinen alle deinen Namen zu sagen
Die einen klagen und umpacken deinen Nacken wie Angst
Du spürst ein Zittern und Beben, sich durch das Zimmer bewegen
Kannst niemand sehen, doch du bist nicht allein
Du hörst das Pochen seit Wochen, fühlst es im Kopf, in den Knochen
Und tausend Stimmen reden nur auf dich ein

Das ist die Fornika
Das ist die Fornika
Das ist die Fornika
Das ist die Fornika

Erst flimmert und schimmert es
Dann vergammelt und schimmelt es
Erst verlockt es, dann vertrocknet es
All das Vibrieren und Klingeln umzingelt dich
Wird immer schlimmer, bis du innerlich gebrochen bist
Du hast seit Tagen nicht geschlafen, nachts da plagen dich Fragen
All die verdammten Gedanken jagen dich
Dir scheint, als würden all die Farben verblassen
All die fahlen Grimassen auf den Straßen sagen nichts
Ihre Leiber reiben sich und treiben dich weiter
Und wie versteinert kannst du ihnen nicht entfliehen
Und wie mit Blei in beiden Beinen, ohne weiter zu schreiten
Bietest du kreisenden Geiern leichtes Ziel
Siehst sie verschwommen im Nebel wie sie kommen und gehen
Du stehst benommen daneben und dir ist kalt
Bald ist da nur noch lähmende Leere
Die sich ewig quälenden Seelen
Die lebenden Toten und der Asphalt

Das ist die Fornika
Das ist die Fornika
Das ist die Fornika
Das ist die Fornika

Sie umgibt dich
Sie umschließt dich
Sie durchdringt dich
Und sie kriegt dich

Das ist die Fornika, sie umgibt dich
Das ist die Fornika, sie umschließt dich
Das ist die Fornika, sie durchdringt dich
Das ist die Fornika, und sie kriegt dich

Das ist die Fornika
Das ist die Fornika

Dunkelheit bricht übers Land
Die Zeiger sind zur 12 gewandt
Kreaturen der Hölle Brut
Ziehen aus und suchen Blut
Wer trotz Furcht und Schrecken bleibt
Und wessen Seele nicht befreit
Stellt sich der Unterwelten Wesen
Und wird verrotten und verwesen
In der Luft Fäulnisgestank
Von vierzig-tausend Jahren Fang

Vergleichen sie und fragen einen guten freund was er ihnen rät
Dann werden sie sich denken was ich brauch muss ich besorgen

Wir gingen mal ins Kino, hatten noch ein Rendezvous
(Und hast du sie ausgeführt?) Hey, gehört ja wohl dazu
Sie ist so elegant, sie hat auch allerhand
Solltest sie wirklich mal treffen, denn ich find sie sehr charmant
(Hey ist es die da, die da am Eingang steht?
Oder die da, die dir den Kopf verdreht?
Ist es die da, die mit'm dicken Pulli an, Mann?)
Nein es ist die Frau, die freitags nicht kann

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, oder die da?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Ist es die da? Nein, freitags ist sie nie da

Herzlichen Glückwunsch Smudo, toi toi toi
Du kannst dir sicher sein, dass ich mich für dich freu
Ich selber bin auch froh, und falls es dich interessiert
Mir ist am Wochenende was ganz ähnliches passiert
Es war Sonntag, und ich trinke Tee in 'nem Kaffee
Als ich dieses schöne Wesen an dem Tresen stehen seh
Gesell ich mich dazu und hab'n Tee für sie bestellt
Na ja, ich gebe zu, ich hab getan, als hätt ich Geld
Doch alles lief wie geschmiert - was mache ich mir Sorgen?
Denn wir reden und verabreden uns für Übermorgen
Ich wollt mit ihr ins Kino gehen, stattdessen waren wir essen
Denn sie hatte den Film schon gesehen, ich hielt's für angemessen
Sie ins Restaurant zu führen, Separé mit Kerzenlicht
(Und hat sie die Rechnung bezahlt?) - Natürlich nicht
Doch sie sagte zu mir noch, dass wir jetzt miteinander gehen
Und seitdem wart ich darauf, sie wiederzusehen
(Hey, ist es die da, die da am Eingang steht?
Oder die da, die dir den Kopf verdreht?
Ist es die da, die mit'm dicken Pulli an, Mann?)
Nein es ist die Frau, die freitags nicht kann

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, oder die da?
Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die?
Ist es die da? Nein, freitags ist sie nie da

Tja, Thomas (tja) da haben wir beide viel gemeinsam
Seit letztem Wochenende sind wir beide nicht mehr einsam
(Gehst du mit ihr zusammen? Äh, ich hab mir vorgenommen
Möglichst bald mit ihr zusammen zu kommen)
Viel Spaß damit (Danke!) Doch eins gibt mir zu denken
Warum muss ich ihr die ganze Zeit nur Geschenke schenken?
(Wem sagst du das? Ich bin schon wieder blank
Doch dafür hat meine jetzt neue Klamotten im Schrank)
Hey, bei mir kam 'se neulich mit 'nem neuen Teil an
Und dabei hab ich mich noch gefragt, wie sie sich das leisten kann
Und ich hab frei am Freitag und sie ist nicht da
(Äh, Moment mal Smudo, da ist meine ja)
Wo? (Es ist die da, die da am Eingang steht)
Was? Das ist die da, um die es sich doch bei mir dreht
(Was? Die da? Und wer ist dieser Mann?)
Ich glaub, das ist der Grund, warum sie freitags nicht kann!

Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die
Ist es die da, die da, die da, genau die da!
Ist es die da, die da, die da, die da, die
Es ist die da, hey freitags ist sie nie da",Die Da,2009

Es tut mir leid das war's ab in die Speisekammer 
Dann auf die Speisekarte denn du bist heiße Ware 
Du bist zum Teil gegahrt aber meist gebraten
Darf's noch Reis sein? Leichter Weißwein? Nein das Teil muss heiß sein

Es is wie Luis und Clark Kent
Wie Pott in Amsterdam

Also geh mir nich' auf'n Keks denn wir werden alt 
Und wir sind unterwegs und ham gestalten runter geht's 
Kleiner Scherz wir sind gar nich' angeschnallt 
Doch keiner merkt's erst als es zu Spät is seh' ich, dass da was im Weg is' 
Und wir heben ab Pech gehabt hat die alte echt mal recht gehabt

Du hast gesagt du holst mich später noch ab ich hab deswegen gedacht 
Ich nehm' noch eben 'nen Bad du hattest schon immer gegen den Bart 
Und endlich gebe ich nach und nehm' ihn nebenher ab 
Nur an mei'm Rasierer is' das Kabel geteilt 
Wodurch der ganze Apparat wie 'ne Parabel erscheint und

Und wenn du könntest würdest du uns wirklich gerne mal fragen,

Warten wir, wie du, hart am Ackern oder nur einfach gerissen?

Haben wir alle verarscht und dich am Ende beschissen?

Die einen streben nach Weltmacht, die anderen leben
Unter ´nem Zeltdach oder stehen unter ´nem Wellblechdach
Doch alle sehen was das Geld macht.

Und sind wir auch so wie die, dann bist du nicht wie wir,
Und wenn du so wärst wie wir, dann wärst du nicht so wie die,
Das könnte dir nicht passieren würdest du dir treu bleiben,
Würdest dich niemals verlieren und die Geschichte neu schreiben.

Ich hätt´ getroffen im Schlaf, oder besoffen bei Nacht,
Hätt´ ihn direkt angenommen und, zack, unter´s Dach.

Ich hätt' den Sack zugemacht und nicht so kläglich versagt,
Ich weiß echt nicht, wofür wird der Depp denn täglich bezahlt?
Das ist doch echt´n Skandal, denen ist doch alles egal
Und jede Wette hätte man mich halt mal vorher gefragt,

Dann hätten wir jetzt nicht verloren, sondern die da oben,
Es wird Zeit, dass wir uns unseren Teil wiederholen,
Tut mir leid, muss mich wiederholen,
Ich mach´s einfach wie Dieter Bohlen und verdien´ Millionen.

Denn hätte ich soviel Knete, wär´ selbst das Wetter perfekt
Und wenn es hin und wieder regnet, ja dann regnet es Schecks,
Würde nur endlich entdeckt welches Talent in mir steckt,
Dann blieb ich Leader of the Pack und ging nie wieder weg.

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Leg deine Waffen ab. Komm zu mir wie der Himmel dich geschaffen hat.
Das ist kein Hinterhalt und keiner plant hier ’n Attentat.
Ich will ’n paar Sachen sagen, hier und vor allen.
Aber wo soll ich anfangen, mein Kopf is' randvoll?
Was werd’ ich sagen und wie wird es wohl ankommen?
Ich lass es darauf ankommen und will alles aufschreiben,
Auf dass die Zeilen mir die Zweifel noch austreiben.
Dann werd' ich es laut sagen, das wird dann nicht ausbleiben
Und werdet Ihr auch fragen, sind das deine Aussagen?
Wie kann ich mich raushalten? Ich will es rausschreien.
Will dieser Stille meine Stimme leihen
Und doch bin ich Werkzeug und nicht von Bedeutung,
Nur ein kleiner Hinweis auf dem Weg der Erleuchtung.

Om Mani Padme Hum, Haleluja und Amen
Nada Brahma, die Welt ist Klang
Und diese Lied trägt deinen Namen.

Sobald ein Gedanke sich
Aus dem Einklang löst und zu Worten formt,
Erschaffen wir all diese Welten und Wege
Und geben dem Leben Bedeutung und Form.
Die Vorstellung bleibt unerschöpflich
Und aus ihr wird letztlich von jedem ein Bild definiert.
Doch wir finden in ihr auch den Inhalt,
Den Ursprung und Anfang von allem das existiert.
Diese Welt ist nicht mehr als ein Spiegel
Vom Verstand verpackt und versiegelt.
Doch solang wir nicht fragen „was kriegen wir wieder?“,
Sobald wir erliegen, erlischt die Begierde
Und dann finden wir inneren Frieden
Durch wahre Hingabe in Liebe.

Om Mani Padme Hum, Haleluja und Amen
Nada Brahma, die Welt ist Klang
Und diese Lied trägt deinen Namen.

An einem Morgen am Meer im Morgengrauen sang ein Mann,
Ein anderer Wanderer, ein Mantra am Strand,
Und nur der Klang seiner Stimme, die ich nicht verstand,
Trat aus einer Stille an mich heran
Und sie gab mir die Hand, hier entlang. Traust du dich?
Mach dir keine Gedanken, deine Angst brauchst du nicht,
Denn die Wahrheit, sie findet sich im Zauber des Augenblicks,
Der atemberaubend ist.
Hör' in dich hinein und hör auf zu denken
Und du hörst dich im Klang dieser Welt wieder selbst,
Denn du bist, und in dir spiegelt sich alles wider
Und aus diesem Grund sing ich dir diese Lieder.

Und diese Lied trägt deinen Namen.",Mantra,2010
Die Fantastischen Vier,"So. Und jetzt? Wie geht's jetzt weiter?
Hätt' mal, an jemanden fragen können, aber mich fragt ja keiner.
Du, ich bin halt jemand, der hinterfragt wer was lenkt, sagt was er denkt
Und mit „Du"" gerne jeden Satz anfängt.
Ich eck halt manchmal an und hör' mich gerne reden
Frag' aber nicht weswegen; typisch ich halt eben.
Dass es bei Fragen nach der Wahrheit unbequem wird, ist ja klar.
Hab ich kein Problem mit.
Doch was echt nicht okay ist, ist eigentlich nichts konkretes,
Nur so 'n Gefühl im Anus, dass es irgendwie zu spät ist
Und 'n büschen zu bequem ist, die Welt zu sehen, wie sie eh ist
Und ob die Welt wie sie ist wirklich so 'ne gute Idee ist.
Alle sind gehetzt, fühlen sich krank,
Wenn es so weitergeht, wie jetzt, fährt alles an die Wand, Boom.
Das Gemecker ist geblieben in der Frage „Wo geht's lang?“
Du, Geschmäcker sind verschieden, Gott sei Dank.

Kein Bock, wen juckt's? Hey, Schnauze.
Halt die Fresse. Red' kein Stuss, wenn du nicht musst.
Mein Gott, wen juckt's? Hey Schnauze.

Wohin man sieht, TV, Zeitung, jeden Tag.
Im Prinzip genau, was ich die ganze Zeit schon sag'.
Nämlich, große Gefühle in der Welt kannst du vergessen.
Es zählen nur die besten, doch Geld kann man nicht essen.
Man hat's nicht leicht, doch ich will wissen und verstehen
Und die Wahrhaftigkeit hinter den Kulissen sehen.
Wobei schon klar ist, wahr ist relativ, okay?
Denn „Wahrhaftig“ heißt immer noch „So wie ich das seh'“
Ey, wir sind alle gleich. Das ahnste gar nicht.
Wenn dir das nicht reicht, wir sind alle einzigartig
Mehr hab' ich nicht, womit ich mich wichtig machen kann,
Deshalb komm' ich halt immer mit den gleichen Geschichten an.
Mit ewigen „Die da oben manipulieren uns auf allen Sendern“,
Deinem steigen „Ja wieso denn? Wir können doch eh nichts verändern.“
Ach, und wenn schon; ist ja auch egal.
Denk halt mal drüber nach.

Keine Liveshows, Livespektakel!
Und wenn heute unser Name fällt,
Denkt kein Mensch mehr an Marvel Helden.

Frag nicht, was ihr für die Fantas tun könnt.
Nein nicht, Nur dastehen und zuhören.

Lass ich lieber sein, denn ich fühl' mich allein.

Du fühlst dich nicht nur allein, Mann, du bist es
Drum lass das Gejammer sein, denn so ist es
Nunmal auf dieser Welt. Auch wenn's dir nicht gefällt,
Schaust du deinen eigenen Film und bist dein eigener Held

Ja Mann, irgendwie hast du ja Recht.
Und trotzdem geht's mir schlecht,
Echt beschissen. Denn ich möchte mal wissen,
Welcher Film auf dieser Welt einen Oscar erhält,
In dem die weibliche Hauptrolle fehlt.
Denn

Sie ist weg, weg
Und ich bin wieder allein, allein
Sie ist weg weg
Davor war's schöner allein zu sein
Jetzt ist sie weg, weg
Und ich bin wieder allein, allein
Sie ist weg weg

Ich raff es nicht ab, was ist daran schlimm,
Dass ich jetzt nicht mehr der Man für sie bin?
Da sitz ich und kack mich zu
Und beginn zu denken, dass ich keine andere find

Die eine ist weg na und?
War sie für dich nicht nur Mittel zum Zweck und Grund,
Sich hinter ihr zu verstecken? Andere abzuchecken war tabu.
Und jetzt kommst du

Hmm, wie gesagt, das ist krass, dass ich dachte ich verpass was,
Wenn ich die Finger von den andern lass.
Was ich machte, denn ich dachte ""Diesen Spaß
Gibst du dir, wenn du die eine nicht mehr hast.""
Und jetzt — was?
Jetzt ist sie weg und ich versteck mich, kläglich.
Hab keine Lust auf andere, also leck mich!

Sie ist weg, weg
Und ich bin wieder allein, allein
Sie ist weg, weg
Davor war's schöner allein zu sein
Jetzt ist sie weg, weg
Und ich bin wieder allein, allein
Sie ist weg, weg

(Jetzt weinst du? Ach, das tut mir aber Leid)

Ich erinner mich, wir waren beide verdammt cool.
Doch innerlich raffte ich, Spinner ich, null.
Denn wann immer ich dachte, ich tu alles für sie,
War, was immer ich machte, für mich irgendwie.
Mit dieser Philosophie fuhr ich einwandfrei, sorgenfrei
An ihr vorbei.

Ich schätze, bin ein bisschen hochgeflogen, ungelogen,
Und hab sie dabei mit mir selbst betrogen.
Kluge Worte, was?
Hinterher weiß man immer mehr.
Doch so sehr ich mich auch dagegen wehr,
Bleibt es schwer aber wahr, ich bin leer,
Denn sie ist nicht da, klar?

Ja ja wunderbar, tolle Rede, Mann!
Hörte ich dich nicht mal sagen, dich lässt jede ran?
Und jetzt schau dich an!
Wo bist du hingekommen?  Ich sag's dir
Sie ist weg und hat mich mitgenommen (mitgenommen, mitgenommen)

Jetzt ist sie weg, weg
Und ich bin wieder allein, allein
Sie ist weg, weg
Davor war's schöner allein zu sein
Jetzt ist sie weg, weg
Und ich bin wieder allein, allein
Sie ist weg, weg
Weg
Weg

Hab keine Lust auf Smalltalk nur um jemand kennenzulernen
Ich brauch eine die mich, auch wenn ich nur zuhör, versteht
Sich nur um mich dreht, so um die dreiunddreißig wenn's geht

Und überhaupt, was soll das heißen, auf die Länge kommt's nich an

Ich schwimm hin, find was am Boden so blinkt
Ist nur der goldene Ring, der an deinem Finger noch hing
Als wir ein Paar war'n, damals intim und im Team
Mit'n paar Mark klar kamen, da warn wir am Ziel

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Das Leben war gut, atme durch, nimm noch'n Zug
Denn das Leben ist kurz, schwer und gefährlich genug
Ist'n echt alter Hut, es tut weh, aber du lernst dazu
Starte den nächsten Versuch, denn mehr kannst du nicht tun
Außer fall'n, wieder aufstehn und oben zu bleiben
Den Focus erweitern, den Globus bereisen
Den Tourbus besteigen, Gardroben zu schmeißen
Den Bonus zu feiern, bevor es vorbei ist
Von vorne beginnen, vergessen, vergeben
Im Lotto gewinnen, ein besseres Leben
Es locker zu nehmen, mal ein Wunder vollbringen
Nie nach unten sehen, einfach nur springen

Und los!
Wir woll'n ne Revolution oder ne schnelle Million
Im Moment fehlt die Vision, doch irgendwas findet sich schon
Und los!
Dann wird Geschichte geschrieb'n, oder mal richtig verdien'
Immer noch fehlt die Vision, doch irgendwas findet sich schon
Und los!

Wie fühlt sich das an? Mittendrin anstatt hinten am Rand?
Medizin, gegen den Rücken zur Wand
Wie Benzin, Komm wir zünden es an, Los!
Der nächste auf's Haus, lass einen springen, wir fangen ihn auf
Lass dich nicht geh'n, bring dich groß raus, komm, du willst es doch auch
Du musst nur auf dich hör'n, nicht telefonieren
Dein Handy zerstör'n, deine Stirn tätowieren
Einfach immer probier'n, die Welle zu nehmen
Anstatt nur frustriert auf der Stelle zu stehen
Oder noch besser wär' es, die Meere zu teilen
Die Massen zu heil'n, mach Wasser zu Wein
Rette die Welt oder gründ' nen Verein
Dir fällt schon was Passendes ein

Und los!
Wir woll'n ne Revolution oder ne schnelle Million
Im Moment fehlt die Vision, doch irgendwas findet sich schon
Und los!
Dann wird Geschichte geschrieb'n, oder mal richtig verdien'
Immer noch fehlt die Vision, doch irgendwas findet sich schon
Und los!

Irgendwas ist da und irgendwann finden wir's, denn es ist Schicksal
Und wir sind bestimmt dafür
Bringen euch Glück aus dem Reich der Ideen
Komm'n als Helden zurück, schon von weitem zu sehen
Auf Rücken von Pferden, die vorn ein Horn tragen
Pflücken wir Sterne in lodernden Farben, und Sonne zerbrechen
Die Strahlen so heiß sind, geronnen zu Bächen
Zu Strömen aus Eis und dann spielten wir endlich, doch spüren es nicht
Denn der Nebel, er senkt sich überall Licht
Und dann werden wir fliegen auf goldenen Schwingen
Durch Bögen von Regen und Chören, die singen

Los!

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Eigentlich geht es Dir gut, nur ab und zu fehlt Dir noch was
Als ob Du nach etwas suchst
Nach etwas mehr als nur Spass
Mehr als ‘ne gute Zeit
Noch mehr als nur sorgenfrei
Statt einer endlosen Nacht, etwas was Dir auch am Morgen noch bleibt
Doch allmählich wächst Deine Angst
steigert sich jeden Tag
Das, was Du vom Leben verlangst,
etwas mehr als es zu geben vermag
Etwas, das eh nur die Wenigstens haben
Dir seh’n es nur die Wenigstens an
Da scheinbar bei Dir alles passt
Nur dass Du das Eine nicht hast

Doch Du hattest kein Mut

Manchmal lädst Du Dir Leute ein
Ist doch gut, dass es Freunde gibt
Denn Du fühlst Dich gut bei Ihnen
Nur eben nicht geliebt
Doch alle sind da für Dich
nur was, wenn sie wieder gehen
Kannst Du Deinem Spiegelbild
Dann noch gegenüber stehen
Denn was es Dir ständig zeigt
Ist “Du hast es nicht geschafft”
Mal tust Du Dir selber leid

Mal kämpfst Du dagegen an

Du liegst wieder ewig wach
Zuwenig Schlaf gefunden
Deine Zweifel kreisen Dich
Von allen Seiten ein
Vielleicht bist Du ja einfach nicht dafür bestimmt zu zweit zu sein
Bestimmt gibt es da draussen Tausende, denen es genauso geht.
Wenn die auch so drauf sind, brauchst 
Du keinen von denen mit nach Hause zu nehmen.
Denn am Ende bleibt nur wieder dieses eine Gefühl
Nie zu kriegen, was man eigentlich will.

Einfachste hier einfach nicht raffen
Es wird nicht weiter gehen, wenn wir so weiter machen
Der nackte Kampf um's Überleben macht 'n Killer aus jedem
Und lässt uns Frieden schwerer finden, als Gorillas im Nebel
Bald geht hier jeder Homo Sapiens gegen jeden

Sind das normale animalische Instinkte in uns?
Denn jeder weiß im Monkey Business geht es nicht um Vernunft

Raubtiere mit Handwerkzeug, Faustkeile im Griff
Anstatt erhobenem Zeigefinger, Daumen hoch für den Knick

Als mich was ich da sah anlachte
Ich dachte „Zieh sie an!“
Denn sie zog mich an die Kleidung an sich fest
Klebte an mir fest
Die Karte in der Hand stand ich vor dem Schrank
So ein Funkeln kriegt man niemals nachgemacht in Asien
Tränen im Gesicht nehmen mir die Sicht
Ich schäme mich, benehme mich dämlich
Sonst bin ich eher nüchtern
„He, schau was ich an hab“ dachte ich verschüchtert
Ich fing an zu flüstern
„Muss ich haben, ganz egal was sie kostet“
So 'ne Katastrophe, das ging mächtig übers Budget
Mach mich lächerlich, doch er lächelte „Nimm sie trotzdem“

Und bis zum Tag an dem ich sterbe, und ich lebe noch
Halt ich sein Erbe hoch und ich führe die Legende fort
Repräsentiere hier diese Familie
Und finde Frieden in was sie mir hinterließen
Ein jeder Tag macht Sinn, wenn was man trägt
Einen für immer dran erinnert für was man steht
Meine Entstehung ist Ergebnis der Begegnung zweier Wesen
Im Versprechen ihrer Seelen bis zum Ende ihres Weges
Und so schenkten sie mir Leben, der Welt eine Familie
Und sie sahen in ihren Kindern einen Spiegel ihrer Liebe

Dad ist längst nicht mehr, ab jetzt hängt's an mir

Die Fantastischen Vier,"Hier ist ein Lied, falls du unten bist
Und die Hoffnung in dir fast verschwunden ist
Falls du am Boden zerstört nach oben gehörst
Verloren, verhöhnt, Gefühle hast, die echt verboten gehören
Verbohrt und verstört, schon gar nicht mehr spürst was da ist
Und dich fragst warum dir das nicht auch noch scheiß egal ist
Die Wahrheit ist, es brodelt in dir, ein tosendes Meer
Das ohne Unterlass dich runter nur ins Bodenlose führt
Nicht ohne ist ja schon das bloße Gefühl
Das große Ziel wär eh schon verspielt
Hat man sein Leben lang daneben gezielt
Und alle reden sie viel, doch alle sagen sie nichts
Und alle sehen sie weg, denn sie ertragen es nicht
Nicht alle werden hier alt, doch alle gehen wir hier drauf
Und deshalb bitt' ich dich, gibt dir n Tritt und steh auf
Und geh raus, und geh ab, denn wer außer dir hat
Schon hier draußen die Kraft, die du brauchst, du erschaffst
Ja du baust dieses Haus, doch verstaust unter'm Dach
Auch die tausenden Tonnen Ballast, die du hast
Und das Maß, es ist voll 
Wie ein Glas, in das fast nichts mehr passt
Und dein Kopf ist so voll, dass er platzt
Ja du hast es ein paar Mal fast schon geschafft
Hätt' nicht im letzten Augenblick noch Irgendeiner gesagt:

Geh und folg deiner Sehnsucht! (Yeah)
Deine Seele ist deswegen hier
Im Strom dieser Zeit
Der Wellengang formt jeden Stein
So vollkommen

Im Vertrauen gesagt, ich war auch mal am Arsch
Ja ich glaub ich war schon tausendmal da
Und auch das tausendste Mal war noch hart
Doch es gab auch die Aussicht
Auf alles was dich noch erwartet, falls du nicht aufgibst
Auch wenns nicht so aussieht, du wirst hier gebraucht
Ich würd' wetten du alleine schaffst es ohne uns auch nicht
Also nimm' sich nicht raus, sich aufgeben bringt's auch nicht
Du kannst nicht überleben was dich innerlich auffrisst
Es beißt und es schmerzt und zerreißt dir dein Herz
Und wer weiß, ob der Preis den Schmerz wert ist
Doch es heißt auch zuletzt bist du hier, bist du jetzt
Der Beweis, dass du hier nicht verkehrt bist
Egal wie lange die Nacht war, es wird wieder Tag
Und auch wenn du lange schwach warst, du wirst wieder stark
Hat dann ein anderer kaum Kraft und gerade versagt
Dann sag ihm bitte genau das, was ich dir grade sag

Geh und folg deiner Sehnsucht!
Deine Seele ist deswegen hier

Und bist du am Boden, dann mach' ich dir Mut
Denn denen da oben gehst auch nicht so gut
Ja diese Berg- und Talfahrt ist endlos
Leb' dein Leben in Demut, denn nur so erkennt du
Jedes Mal wenn es weh tut, dann lernst, dann lernst du dazu
Egal wie lange die Nacht war, es wird wieder Tag
Und auch wenn du lange schwach warst, du wirst wieder stark
Hat dann ein anderer kaum Kraft und gerade versagt
Dann sag ihm bitte genau das, was ich dir grade sag'

es gibt da etwas, weshalb die menschheit überlebt,
niemals aufgibt und immer weiter vorangeht,
wenn man schlecht drauf ist, weiß man es wird besser
will man Neuland finden geht es über große gewässer, also heuert bei mir an, mein schiff liegt im hafen vor anker, jeder kommt unter, vom yuppie bis zum punker, ein kleines volk auf der suche nach dem glück,angetrieben vom wind lassen wir alles zurück, mit an bord ein priester von niemandem beachtet,sieht man am Bug
wie er still den horizont betrachtet,
sowie der junge mißverstanden von mutter und vater,
zweimal in der woche termin beim psychiater,
dies sind nur wenige von vielen die uns folgen,
und auf ihren schultern tragen sie die last all ihre sorgen, für alle scheint die welt nicht mehr so ganz in ordnung,doch eines läßt sie leben: die hoffnung

(Chorus 2x)
ziehen vorbei am dreieck von bermuda, wir setzen die segel
und bewegen die ruder, fluten die kammern, schotten dicht
wir sind unterwegs und irgendwann ist land in sicht

im rap-submarine wie hagbard celine
an bord mein team, ich halt es wie moses, laß mein volk ziehen, spiel schach-partien im u-boot, wie unicef helfen wir menschen in der not, die armaturen leuchten rot, unser ziel: die weißen pyramiden, symbol für frieden, der ort wo unsere antworten liegen,
wir tauchen statt zu fliegen, jeder mensch trägt schwer, jeder such nach mehr, doch wieviel mehr gibt das leben noch her, wir halten alles in den händen, selbst kriege zu beenden, das blatt zu wenden, ich les` die botschaft an den wänden: sieh twelve monkeys das leben kann tough sein wie die new york police, sind die aussichten auch mies, wir gehn nach vorn, wie maschinen und motoren in dieser form geboren, nehmen kurs auf das zentrum des reichs landein durch vulkangestein, ganz gleich wie klein die hoffnung auch sei

(Chorus 2x)

ich geb` die hoffnung nicht auf wie tibetaner, indios und indianer,uns menschen eint das gleiche karma, keiner ist unnahbar, was dich betrifft, betrifft auch mich, also verlier` dein ziel nicht aus der sicht, unser weg führt nicht nach disneyland, vergiß den traumstrand,
dieser trip geht tief in deinen verstand, für die einen ist er kurz, für die anderen lang, jeder so wie er kann, hauptsache wir kommen an, unterwegs zum kap vorbei an cook und ahab und ahab, die gute nachricht vorab:
ey, wir kommen auch in deine stadt, statt zuzusehen könntest du mit daran teilnehmen, nicht nur dabeistehen und ständig kleinbeigeben, sicher die fahrt durch echolot, fürchten weder teufel noch tod, kommen ans ziel,

Anybody can find someone

To rev ?em up and turn ?em on

And baby it?s a lot of fun but then what

When a little time has past

You take off your Mardi Gras mask

That?s when you know if you really have the right stuff


Truly true love

It?s full on fightin? then kissin? all night even though I know I?m right and you?re wrong

Truly true love

Baby it?s the glue keeping me and you holding onto what we know that we couldn?t do on our own

Making love when we first wake up

That?s the icing on the cake but

Seeing me without my make- up

That?s truly truly


We?ve been down and up and down

Thought of throwing in the towel

And we?re far from perfect now but so what

?Cause it?s about the ride we take

And the memories we make

And the way the earth still quakes when we touch



Truly true love

It?s full on fightin? then kissin? all night even though I know I?m right and you?re wrong

Truly true love

Baby it?s the glue keeping me and you holding onto what we know that we couldn?t do on our own

Making love when we first wake up

That?s the icing on the cake but

Seeing me without my make- up

Ich hielt dich noch in meinem Arm
Wußte
Wenn die Sonne heute untergeht
Daß dann unser Abschied kam.
Einsam geh ich durch den Rosengarten
Und denk an uns're Zeit.
Schmetterlinge träumen nur I'm Sommerwind
Schmetterlinge sind genau wie do
Weil sie einfach wild und frei geboren sind
Fliegen sie dem Glanz der Sonne zu.
Es war I'm Frühlingswind
Ein kleiner Schmetterling erinnerte mich so an dich
Ich seh dein Bild vor mir I'm hellen Sonnenschein
Daß mir dabei das Herz zerbricht
Und für immer word' ich auf dich warten
Ein ganzes Leben lang.

Ich lerne Seiten an mir kennen, die kennen mich nicht
Draußen ist alles da, auch wenn es niemand bezahlt hat
Der Himmel ist so hoch wie ich ihn mit vier gemalt hab
Es ist Montag, jemand schiebt sein Sofa nach Hause
Nebenan auf dem Schulhof ist Pause

Seit ich dich kenne, hab ich keine Ruhe
Sag all deinen Freunden, am besten noch heute
Unsere Liebe wird aufgehen wie eine Blume
Wie eine Blume

Als ich dich traf, war ich alleine
Ich war erst dreimal verliebt
Ich war nicht sicher, ob es irgendwann ein viertes Mal gibt
Ich bin liegen geblieben, weil jeder sagt, das ist meins
Sich am anderen festhält und ihn zu Boden reißt
Dann bist du frisch wie ein Morgen, an dem ich ausgeschlafen bin
In mein Leben gestolpert, hast mir gesagt, wer wir sind
Ich kann noch sehen, wie du neben mir lagst
Wir wurden neu geboren und wurden unsichtbar

Seit ich dich kenne, hab ich keine Ruhe
Sag all deinen Freunden, am besten noch heute
Unsere Liebe wird aufgehen wie eine Blume
Wie eine Blume

Es ist so einfach wie Räuberleiter
Noch einen Sprung von der Mauer
Und wir sind weiter
Alles was sein kann, ist so einfach
Wenn du leicht bist
Nicht wenn du's dir leicht machst

Seit ich dich kenne, hab ich keine Ruhe
Sag all deinen Freunden, am besten noch heute
Unsere Liebe wird aufgehen wie eine Blume
Wie eine Blume

Seit ich dich kenne Ich lass dich nie wieder los
Nie wieder los
Seit ich dich kenne Ich lass dich nie wieder los
Nie wieder los
Seit ich dich kenne Ich lass dich nie wieder los
Nie wieder los
Seit ich dich kenne Ich lass dich nie wieder los
Nie wieder los",Blume,2016
Die H,"Früher hatte ich mal Arbeit
Jetzt lebe ich nur noch von dir
Ein Schlag hat den Verstand erwischt
Ich hatte Glück ihn zu verlieren

Es geht dir gut, wenn sie sagen, dass du gut bist
Es geht dir schlecht, wenn sie sagen, du bist schlecht
Du hörst nur zu, wenn du weißt, dass man dir zuhört
Es ist nur echt, wenn sie sagen es ist echt, wenn sie sagen
Es ist echt

Wenn sie sagen, dass es falsch, verlogen, erobert und geklaut ist
Und wir trauen uns nicht zu sagen, worauf das hier gebaut ist
Und wir kriegen, was wir nehmen und geben alles aus
Das Licht geht aus
Ich kann deine Umrisse sehen im Raum

Was ich nicht kenne, muss ich fürchten
Es könnte meine Rettung sein
Unter der Wolkendecke ist Platz für alle
Nur wenn es regnet, gehen nicht alle rein

Du kannst spielen, wenn du weißt, wie das Spiel geht
Du kannst dich fühlen, wenn du weißt, wie man sich fühlt
Und du hast Recht, wenn du weißt, dass du Recht hast
Es ist nur echt, wenn du sagst es ist echt, wenn du sagst
Es ist echt

Wenn sie sagen, dass es falsch, verlogen, erobert und geklaut ist
Und wir trauen uns nicht zu sagen, worauf das hier gebaut ist
Und wir kriegen, was wir nehmen und geben alles aus

Ich kann deine Umrisse sehen im Raum

Auf dem Bild, wo wir zwei sind
Mit drei seh' ich mich nur alleine
Und der Mann, der auf dem Gleis steht
Und winkt, tut es für sich alleine
Nimm die Stadt, zieh die Menschen von hier ab
Und du hast nur noch Steine
Alleine, alleine

Wenn sie sagen, dass es falsch, verlogen, erobert und geklaut ist

Ich heiße so und so
Und ich gehör zu dem und dem
Eine Hand streift mich, sicher nicht aus Versehen

Das sind gute Leute

Wir sind gute, gute Leute
Wir sehen nur schlecht aus heute

Von oben runter hast du die beste Sicht
Und nur wer drüber ist kommt noch mit
Draußen schlägt die Turmuhr
Es soll Sturm geben heute Nacht
Jemand hat Buchstabenwunderkerzen mitgebracht
Alle umarmen sich und stoßen an
Nur Tillmann weint und entschuldigt sich
Es ist heiß, wir sind dicht bis oben
Und erkennen nur noch verschwommen
Schwarzen Rauch, wie einen Geisterzug

Tillmann stolpert über die Boxenkabel
Und der Spuk ist vorbei

Um zwei Uhr nachts klingelt's, es ist die Polizei
Es waren die Nachbarn, Scheiße, die Party ist vorbei
Tillmann versucht es auf die ganz blöde Art
Vonwegen: ""Herr Wachtmeister, bleiben Sie docheinfach da!"" Der Bulle reagiert professionell:
""Haben Sie Bock auf eine Nacht in der Ausnüchterungszelle?""
Er nimmt Tillmann mit, der tut nicht mal entsetzt

Mit dir würd' ich immer wieder

Und ich kann jetzt mehr verstehen

Jetzt werd' nicht rot
Seit ich zwölf bin
Jetzt tu nicht so, ja, so lange schon

Neun und zehn für die Liebenden im Flur
Ihre Körper gefaltet wider die Natur
Eins für die Hoffnung
Zwei für die Angst
Drei für die Sachen, die du mir nicht sagen kannst
Vier für die Liebe, verdient und geschenkt
Fünf für jedes Lied, das mit Du anfängt
Sechs für die Dinge, die wir uns antun
Für die Fesseln an den Knöcheln und das Blei in den Schuhen Sieben, acht, neun, es ist leicht zu bereuen, aber schwer zu verstehen

Mit dem Aufzug in den Himmel fahren

Wer legt das Zeug in die Regale
Und woher weiß er, dass ich's kauf

Wer bereut andauernd
Wer denkt nie an Geld
Wer schüttelt solange den Kopf

Und gibt Pakete nicht mehr her

Wo kommen die hin, die sich verlieren

Wer vertraut dir nicht
Und das, obwohl er dich kennt
Wer zieht das Pech an
Als wäre es eine Hose oder ein Hemd
Und wer redet mit dir
