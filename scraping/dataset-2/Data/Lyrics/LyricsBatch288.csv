Game,"All eyes on ya
Ask you how your week been
Workin' always, let me
Work you out for the weekend
Baby, I'm a beast, uh-huh
Can you tame me?
I'm gon' let it out
Lay you down

Let's get to it
Let me lick you in places you never been licked before
Take you to places you never been before
Like London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside
We can share it, J and B without the marriage
Horse and carriage, se√±orita
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza
Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'ma bite into your peach
And um, I think about to massage your feet
And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep
And um, I must look amazing with you
'Cause every time you on my arm I got

All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck

'Member when you used to curve me, leave my text message unread?
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and

All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you

Lookin' at me like you love me
We can do it now or later
She wan' lick on party favorite
On my wave, tryna surf it up
Know we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up
Certified with the double-M pullin' up
Tooly got a room, we'll play ""Room Up In Here"", been here
Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up (You want me to say your name huh?)
But you know when we get together (Karrueche)

All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck

Ayo it's time for the function
Time to bring dinner to all of these niggas luncheon
This for 2Pac, Heron, Bountry
Halloween mask, carve one of you pumpkins
Empty the pills out, fire up the purp now
Game is back, lil niggas pull your skirt down
Flow ice cold, Max Julian on a ho
Used to run the rock, Jim Brown in the snow
Moncler bomber, armor Under Armour
.38 special 'cause I believe in karma
Double entendre holding your Aunt Sandra
Then we can talk the location, I left your mama
Lost on the ganja, letting my mind wander
Made for the drama like a fucking mixtape
Use a Phantom in a drive-by nigga and switch plates
Getting the bigger pool the only way to diss Drake

I'll smoke your lil mafia in front of you nigga
Left Aftermath 'cause I wanted to nigga
Still pull up on Dre and smoke a blunt or two, nigga
It's lit, came in the game like a red nose pit
You got business in LA? I dead your shit
Shut video shoots down, turn airplanes around
Knowledge in belly anonymous rounds
Tryna host AOD and niggas lying you down
Of course the wolves can smell when vagina in town
Turn these niggas inside out like Killa Cam back
Intercepted at the airport, nigga the Rams back
Flying Spur, top missing like Ginobili
Grill all gold, that's my motherfucking whoadie

Give these niggas awards and they still nobodies
I don't go to the Grammys, nigga I bag those
Fuck the BET awards, I done had those
Fuck a freestyle, nigga this a cash flow
Young Jay and I ain't never had a Jaz-O
Ask Kanye ""who the real asshole?""
Cuban links smoking a Cuban, Fidel Castro
Feet up at Mastero's, table full of models
I'mma fuck 'em all, right hand on the Bible
Head game crazy, mommy suicidal
Rubbing on my dick while she download Tidal
This the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
A product of gin and juice inside of my baby bottle

Game,"I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son
Rolling with this one and that one

(Red Wallabies) Buzzing with my Killa Beez
Chronic had my eyes chinky like Compton was the Philippines
Junior prom, red suit, Tasha in that limousine
Tryna suck the head off my dick like a guillotine
Came in her mouth, then gave her some Listerine
Put a condom on and let her grind it like a centipede
(Cash rules everything around me)
Before Dre found me, before my city crowned me
Bummy lil nigga, pussy niggas used to clown me
Had to wear my brother's clothes, them shits used to drown me
6 years passed now I'm banging in the county
Niggas that used to talk shit won't even come around me
Reciting Method Man while my celly just sit there
Niggas know I been on the Wu before Ric Flair
Came home through the hood, GX shining
Now these bitches think I'm Lex Diamonds

Jordan 12's sick as hell, Michael Jordan flu game
Glass jar, Pyrex, obsessed with the blue flame
Lexus coupe, rubbing on them titties boy, 2 Chainz
Top of the food chain, niggas wanna kill me
'Cause I turned into the plug, I'm where the chronic and the pills be
RZA with the rings, Ol' Dirty with the stainless
Five .38 revolvers, thirty-six chambers
Killah like Ghostface, as the Rollie rotate
Daytons on the S-Class equipped with the floor safe
And we had the stash spots with them red and blue tops
Chronic in the GLAAD lock, the dope spot padlocked
In the living room bagging shit up watching Matlock
Black Glock, crack rock bundled in my black socks
And my mama working late, skinny nigga serving weight
Let the chronic circulate the Purple Tape

Game,"It's a trap, it's a trap
Why they ain't tell us red and blue don't matter when you black?
Matter of fact we in blindfolds, bunch of lost souls
Kids shot dead in the streets now they eyes closed
How you call it angels when it's kings getting beat up
And Gil Garcetti in his office with his feet up
No way to dodge police brutality
Selling crack cocaine, making a teacher's salary
Mexicans hopping the borders in the thousands
Become cholos, one button Pendletons, they styling
Crips on the corner in Dodger blue with they gold chains
Bloods sporting corn rows and Chucks with the red strings
Sun going down so them Chevys about to roll out
Fiends scratching themselves, stumbling out the dope house
Niggas tying bandanas, 'bout to put the drum on
Kids tryna make it home 'fore street lights come on

So grab that gun, load that clip
Grab that torch, light that shit, grab that stick
Grab that brick, throw it
It's time to riot if you don't see black owned in the window
It's on fire, start here, end up over there
The smell of gun powder in the air
And just so we clear, this is pain and despair
We burn our own shit and we aware and don't care
Tell the National Guards to disappear
We got guns too and we ain't scared
So fuck the mayor, fuck the President Bush and his legislation
Shit gotta change and we ain't waiting, fuck patience
'Cause the government corrupt, I can prove it
Martin, Malcolm, Huey P. Newton
And that's why the whole city out here looting
How can we stand here and not do shit?
All this smoke over the hood looking like low clouds
Cars with no miles on fire, they broke down
White people wishing that they was at home
Asians fronting like they business is black owned
Far from stupid, we coming in the stores tripping
Running in swap meets for they Jordans and they Pippens
Crowbars, bats, anything that break glass
They fucked Rodney King up and now it's they ass
So it's bottle rockets through the window
Kids that was never smoking endo
Fiends kicking in doors, stealing Nintendos
Niggas robbing liquor stores with taped up ""Duck Hunt"" guns
City burning but it's fucked up fun
National Guards on the corner
They don't know the hood, they foreigners
We was busting at the cops before Chris Dorner
Ghetto birds flying over the hood, they see us
Showing the fuck out, cleaning them trucks out
Niggas mobbing down the streets pushing big screens and baskets
Staring straight into the cameras, no ski mask
Just pandemonium, niggas looting what they homies in
Running around with Scarface guns like they was Tony and them
Who, what, where, when, how the fuck they gon' stop us?
When the last 50 years we accustomed to window shopping
So we taking lighters to the tip of magazines
Dip 'em in gasoline and set this motherfucker on (Fire)

The whole world watching, Los Angeles is on (Fire)

Standing on the corner with a brick in my hand
When my mother told me sit in the van, nah fuck that
Foot Locker chained up, wire cutters cut that
Niggas Crip walking where Reginald Denny's truck at
Police cars, driving by niggas in slow mo
If you white don't stop at the light, 'cause that's a no-no
Running through the malls, give us everything polo
The first time niggas ain't have beef with the cholos
'92, fire lit the skyline, and why we loot?
To capture that forbidden truth 'cause Adam never ate the fruit
Fuck your blue suits, your badge, and them high beams
We out here selling chronic, we ain't have no Jimmy Iovines
Shit burning, you gon' need more than Visine
We making a movie better than anyone that I've seen
Should be on Showtime, HBO, Cinemax
Get a match, we gon' make sure that y'all remember that (Fire)

My daddy was from Nutty Blocc
My uncle was from Nutty Blocc
My mama was from Hoover, how she end up here cuttin' rock?
Four year old on her lap, that was my older sister
Photos of Tookie and my father, now you get the picture
Cutlass outside on D's, you think it wasn't
15 inches, had Computer Love, subbin'
My parents bout to see Rocky at the Compton Drive In
Halfway through the movie her stomach start throbbin'
My pops start panickin', moms in the passenger seat
Scared of contractions so she's stiff as a mannequin
Pops put the car in reverse and then skrt'd out
""Drive motherfucker"" them the words my mom skrt'd out
80 down Wilmington, pull up at Killer King
Rush my mama to her room and let the doctor do his thing
Was a whole lotta blood, yeah I was born in it

Fiends walkin' in and out my house in old Nikes
Pops used to tell me: ""Son, don't you ever be like me
The Bloods want to kill me, the cops'll never catch me
And when you gang bangin' life's shorter than Joe Pesci''
Then one night my pops came home off heroin
Shit changed, I'm glad my mama didn't marry him
Molested my sister that night cause she was scared
I was too young to help her and my brothers wasn't there
It was late night, 2AM, my mother at work
My sister came back up the stairs and it was blood on her shirt
Blood on her face, blood on her hands, blood on her legs

Watchin' '64s hop my nigga, no green screen
Walkin' from the Tanas to the Cedars with my eyes closed
Red bandanna in my pocket, how you hide those?

Couldn't cook, burnin' holes in my Dennis Rodman jersey
Then a nigga turned Pippen on these niggas
40 sippin' on these niggas
If you Crippin', we was trippin' on you nigga
But the Crips would never lay down

We thought it was ours so we would empty out the trey pounds

Say hi to the big time

White lace, bracelet charms and silent alarms

The murder goes on daily
Don't give me phobias walking the cable
We'll go when we're willing and stop when we're able
I wish these cards on no one's table
And when love is crowded out I'm a friend of the family

Ah, Miss Critical, might find you're minus one now
If there's someone you love now, tell them you love them right now
Have we been cheated of three of our seasons?
How could we break off for such practical reasons?
All the right reasons
Sleep young bride to be no more
Whatever we do now has been done before
I'm going to drive out to the end of the dirt road
To a place where no one living goes
I'm going to run on foot till I can't feel the cold

Make promises pay
Shame, will shake this house
Shame, will shake this house
Your dreams are not my life
These broken words are not my life
Your lies are none of my invention
Your promises were not plan
Now the party girls have gone
I hear the rattle of their heels
Before their footsteps fade

Shame, will shake this house
Shame, will shake this house

I had everything I wanted
Nothing I can't rise above

And all that I can do is cry

Only a haircut

That I am her true love
She loves a puppet
He's made of flesh and blood

A black man from the motherland
Speakin a language today most people don't understand
Where no one could bother me
Cause I had freedom, justice, and equality
But then one day it was tooken away
And I was shipped to the U.S.A.
A young brother, made into a slave
To harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins
Given a new name, new religion
No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision
I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out
The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about
They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa
And all the blacks there now are just scavengers
That's the way my mind was poisoned
To believe that in America blacks are inferior
A weak mind and a body of swine
Only adds up to being - deaf dumb and blind
Illiterate to who where what and why
So I ask myself: who am I?

A native New Yorker on the streets
Known for rockin' rhymes to real rough beats
That I found in the attic, noisy with static
A sound that made me, a hip-hop fanatic
I made a few songs that sold OK
Never top twenty or plenty airplay
I came out hardcore, flexin' cock diesel
Saw a little cash, and pop goes the weasel
I had to make that change and rearrange
My whole rap format, no hardcore rap
So now all the pop charts I rule
Over New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh
I thought I made it, then my song faded
And none of the black stations ever have played it
I tried to blame it on MTV
And say, ""Damn, they cold played me for Young MC""
But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame
Because I wanted the fame
Money is not only the root of all evil

No, we don't know the reason why, another day, tomorrow

But take a chance to see what you have to gain, 
Don't let your mind make you a shadow, 
To have your heart and soul - fade away.",Fade Away,1999
Gandalf,"A vision of mortality - all spirits reign supreme
Watched and controlled - these emotions are crucifying me

Who can you trust
When you are lost
Who'll show the way
When you're astray
Who tells the truth
To the world and the youth
Don't need an answer to this
''cause I'm in a sacred bliss

When you're a marionette
Locked by your lost emotions, dancing to images of clowns
When you're a puppet
Looking through the eyes of the dead, on your lost, burning soul

Who is the fool
Is it me or you
Do you know the way
When you are astray
Try to find out
What life is about
Don't hesitate
Before it's too late

You hail to the king
You know that he will win
But in the mirror you see
A puppet with a face of grief",Marionette,1999
Gandalf,"Emotions lost in oblivion, 
Getting open the gates of hell, 
With an open mind and open to die, 
Shivering creatures start their ride, 
The desire for the truth, 
Lives on and on and on, 
The ride for new dimensions of life, 
Go on until they are gone, 
The decay of man is true, 
When I watch me in the future, 
When I see the look in your face, 
I feel like a creature, 
Never I will tear your soul apart, 
Never I will make your heart bleed, 
Never - Again, 
Never I will leave you alone again, 
Never I will make you go insane, 
The painful memories of a forgotten world, 
Makes me cry, 
Locked up in a cell, 
With the horrors I created for myself, 
I take what's mine, 
And break it to pieces, 
Just believe my word, 
Never Again, 
Just make a prayer and wait for a miracle, 
From the sky, 
But what you see is a star, 
With new heights to find.",Never Again,1999

En 2 minutes hop, √ßa devient la guerre de Troie
Ils √©taient 4 ou 5 sous l‚Äôemprise du 666
Et de la weed oui, surtout d'la 8-6
Cette fois-ci stop, ce jeune homme voulait du neuf
S‚Äômarier avec sa meuf, bref avoir 10 enfants
Il en a marre des coups, avec ses zinc‚Äô c‚Äôest simple
Mais une chose qui est s√ªre, c‚Äôest pas pass√© 5 sur 5
Un d√Æner au chandelles, et tout se passe √† merveille
Il n√©gocie la main d'la fille en esp√©rant que sa m√®re veuille
C‚Äôest la soir√©e d'sa vie, depuis hier Samir veille
Il se dit qu‚Äôil veut de l‚Äôargent propre, qu‚Äôil en a marre d‚Äôsalir l‚Äôoseille
Il esquive m√™me son cousin qui lui demande de faire des coups
Des groupes de mecs le cherchent : ils voient sa t√™te, ils la d√©coupent
Du coup, Samir s‚Äôest rang√© tout √ßa gr√¢ce √† sa petite amie
Il passe une soir√©e parfaite en songeant √† sa petite famille
D‚Äôun coup des mecs √† l‚Äôentr√©e rentrent, giflent le videur
D√©boulent dans le resto √† 5 avec Samir dans l‚Äôviseur
Courent vers lui √† toute vitesse, coups d‚Äôbouteilles au futur gendre
Ils mettent des coups d'pression aux gens, des coups de couteaux aux jambes
Des couples go√ªtent aux insultes y a que le serveur que √ßa enchante
Ils mettent la go en sang, en plus elle est enceinte
Ils bousillent les tables les chaises et encha√Ænent le vacarme
Ils d√©branchent les c√¢bles, vident les caisses et d√©pouillent le placard
Ils profitent des femmes et d'leurs fesses
Traitent leurs mecs de b√¢tards (sale b√¢tard va)
Et ils mettent en flammes toute la pi√®ce c'est devenu un bazar

3h plus tard, tu connais les blacks
Mais bon y a le plein pour fuir si un keuf reconna√Æt la plaque

Sans cesse √† d√©battre sur le dernier X6

Mon bonheur co√ªte 30 euros,
Se balade dans le boule des gens
Je d√©pends d'elle comme si sans elle
C'√©tait mon c≈ìur qui foutait le camp
Je br√ªle ma drogue quotidiennement
Car ma vie c'est l'enfer
J'ai embrass√© ses charmes
Sans avoir vu ses dents de fer
Quand tu me vois dis pas meskine
Je cache la haine d'au moins 10 skins
Oui mes propres font mes skiffs
Car pour leur p√®re n'ont plus d'estime
Si je regarde toujours le sol
C'est que je suis tomb√© bien plus bas que terre
La coca√Øne dirige la rue
Et tous ces gueushs en subalterne
Elle m'apporte tellement de plaisir
Que j'aime mon dealer plus que ma m√®re
Et √† c√¥t√© de mon crack
Une jolie femme n'est que de la merde
Dans mon cr√¢ne j'ai une galette
Certains tox veulent ma t√™te
Car je connais pas le partage
Consomme tout seul ma qu√™te
L'argent n'a pas d'odeur
Car je cache ma came dans mon zen
On a tous le SIDA
Tout le monde s'√©carte quand on saigne
Ils me traitent de mort vivant
Car je marche seulement en oscillant
Mais ce mec qu'aime m'insulter
N'est qu'un dealer qui vaut ce qui vend
N'est qu'un dealer qui vaut ce qui vend

Mais passe-moi cette putain de galette, merde
Wesh t'es s√©rieux, l√†, vas-y casse toi, l√†
J'te ram√®ne l'argent demain
Vas-y vas-y casse-toi, rentre dans le parc
Mais je te le ram√®ne
Ah si ah si je m'en bats les couilles
Putain mais j'en ai besoin (Je m'en bats les couilles)

C'qui est s√ªr c'est que chaque paire de fesses qui passe c'est un souci 
Les p'tits peuvent pas arracher les c¬úurs ils sont pass√©s au keus 
Et si la nuit porte conseil, bah elle a zapp√© les geush 
En r√©sum√© crois pas que le temps ch√¥me 
Si le monde te sourit akhi saches qu'il a les dents jaunes 
J'aimerai effac√© le num√©ro de tout mes fr√®res √©crou√©s 
Mais dans c'monde rien n'est parfait akhi m√™me la lune est trou√©e 
J'ai les mains sur le c¬úur, les pieds au sol et la t√™te vers les cieux 
Donc d√Ætes aux travelos que j'les appellerai toujours Messieurs 

Paname est vivante mon quartier r√©side dans son zen 
Quand elle √©ternue, les bicraveurs tombent et prennent du ferme 
Le monde est subtile, saches que c'est pas la taille qui compte 
Car si le pr√©sident est un nain bah devant lui tu parais si p'tit 
Panam est un chien sans ma√Ætre donc fuck l'√©ducatrice 
Moi, j'suis n√© dans l'creux d'une cicatrice 
Akhi, tu veux des frissons ? touches moi 
Martin Luther King a fait un r√™ve et Ma√Ætre Gims a fait un cauchemar 
Tu trouves √ßa gore et alors ? 
Censurez moi √ßa changera rien comme un aveugle dans l'noir 
J'suis foutu, caract√®re de base t√™tu 
L'√™tre humain n'est que du sperme v√™tu 
Les m√©cr√©ants voudraient voir Dieu 
Essayes d'abord de regarder le soleil dans les yeux
J'me demande plus quand tout √ßa cessera 
Marre de m'battre pour un quartier qui porte le nom d'un ciste-ra 
Puis √ßa m'fait chier 
Donc si une meuf me pla√Æt de trop bah je l'imagine en train d'chier 
J'vise la t√™te j'ai plus le temps pour les essais 
Et si le monde t'ouvre ses bras bah saches
Qu'il fouette des aisselles
Fouette des aisselles, fouette des aisselles

Moi inch'Allah j'vais pas repartir comme j'suis arriver
En faisant souffrir la daronne encore pire la voir crier 
On ira tous au paradis n'est qu'une chanson d'Enfoir√©s 
Et tes et tes hassanets ils s'trouvent pas dans tes putains d'soir√©es
Rien ne marche depuis mes premiers pas
J'me l√®ve tout les jours du pied gauche comme si on m'avait amput√© du droit 
Les les qui √† dit qui au bled c'est la sant√© 
Quoi l'argent n'a pas d'odeur tu mens je l'ai senti 
Stop y'a ton gars s√ªr qui joue au con 
Dis lui qu'il est suivi du regard et que c'est pas celui de la Joconde 
Y'a celui qui mord la vie et celui qui vit la mort 
Dans les deux cas personne peut ves-qui son heure
La beaut√© de l'homme est dans sa poche 
Si t'es milliardaire t'as l'droit d'√™tre moche 
Religieux que quand √ßa t'chantes 
Mais les vrais religieux ne chante pas 
Comme d'hab ils diront que les kain-fry divaguent 
Eux ils lisent des livres alors qui y'en a qu'un qui dit vrai
Si l'argent tombait du ciel, ciel ciel ciel

Et quand je serai dans ma tombe personne me dira je te rejoins.

Mais cinq ans plus tard avec un autre elle parcourt la ville,
Quant au succ√®s il t'appartient pas, t'accroches ap,
Si tu loupes le co-ch, le public te fait un croche-pattes.
Tout ce qu'on t'a pr√™t√© tu le rends
M√™me ce que tu bouffes tu le rechies,
Dis-leur chut, l'argent est un fid√®le poto dealer de shit.

To stop and feel the need

Changing you, changing me

With a corncob pipe and a button nose 
And two eyes made out of coal

He was made of snow but the children know 
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic 
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head 
He began to dance around

Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play 
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun 
Now before I melt away

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square 
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler Stop
For Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day

What I've been saying won't say them again
My head's not empty, it's full with my brain

Like piss down a drain

And I feel like a beetle on its back
And there's no way for me to get up

And that's something I don't want to catch

Ought to control what I do to my mind
Nothing in there but sunshades for the blind
Only yesterday I said to myself
The things I'm doing are not good
For my health

""Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about,
cos most groups make most of their songs about falling in love
or how happy they are to be in love,
you occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time -
it's because these groups think there's something very special about it
either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has,
you know to burst into song you have to be inspired
and nothing inspires quite like love.

These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone
by singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love
or so they would have you believe anyway
but these groups seem to go along with what, the belief
that love is deep in everyone's personality.
I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love,
we just don't think that what goes on between two people
should be shrouded with mystery.""

But since the world‚Äôs dark and often inhumane
Relish our condition, come drinking in the rain
‚ÄòCause you remember when, after Paris
We all decided the best way to fight it was
Drink wine, dance here and pray
And make love that lasts with avengeance
So you can join the cowards all aboard the outrage train
You can stay afraid, or slit the throat of fear and be brave
And scratch the little itch

I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight

That I trialed and I failed and it‚Äôs good to let it go
Sometimes life sucks, everything is lame
Not everything‚Äôs as easy as making lemonade
And so dismembering our state of balance
With lust requited, a gaze undivided
With a cool mind and warmth in your face
A good heart, a grace under pressure
You give me a good reason to be heartsick again
To be here, to be strong, to be oddly and boldly estranged
From the loss and bitter years
I found myself descending into tedium and fear

Then go out and fall in love

Just put on some Whitesnake

In the weirdest of moments and the stupidest of ways
But hey, I‚Äôm still young and it‚Äôs gonna be okay
I got solipsism, baby, and I brought lemonade
I‚Äôll surrender then, all my balance
And be excited and drink to tonight
It‚Äôs not a, a bad time, time spent with you
There‚Äôs cool lights and songs with good lyrics
We never have to talk again, whatever, up to you
But since you‚Äôre putting up with me
Here‚Äôs another toast just to you
Let‚Äôs dance, off the beat
Then mosey out together and say goodbye on the street

You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and love someone
Don‚Äôt stop, don‚Äôt stop believing

Bounce on a Preme track like I bounce on a NARC
Keep playin, why'all niggaz will burn

Hot rhymes, spit a dime, hit a case beater
Flow is angry like I'm in your face with heaters
Chasin divas - nah, I don't ever have to do that
P.I. till I die and I laugh at you cats
You happy perhaps 'cause you got dough and bitches
But no love from streets only for moles and snitches
Only from the meatlapin, suckers won't see it happen
Cross that line, then it's time for the heat clappin
I do my thing like the whole planet depends on me
I got game to make Janet want to spend on me
Some say I'm trifflin and sometimes I'm rightfully am
Getcha man, I'll lay him right where he stand
[Chorus]",Rite Where U Stand,
Gang Starr,"[Verse One]
Other MCs in the place know I`m much too much
And I`ll bust `em all up without even cussing
All wannabe`s are never ever gonna be nothin`
Gang Starr`s in the house and we`re crushing
So suckers better be up on their p`s and q`s and
Competition come against me and you`re losing
I`ll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed 'cause you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin`
And never had no problems getting women
I`m like a catalyst causin` a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That`s why the people say that I`m much too much

[Chorus]
I`m much too much
I`m much too much
I`m much too much
I`m much too much

[Verse Two]
Check the G-you-are-you yes the brother who`s progressing
If beats are cake I`m frosting, if salad I`m dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
And kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I`m gettin` kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I`m due and it`s true 'cause you know
A rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch `em later
'cause I`m like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn`t matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape 'cause I`m much too much

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I walk in the room unload a boom that`s like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I`ve rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
'cause the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I`m swift like the breeze
I`ll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That`s the type of crap you know I`m not buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don`t apply and
That`s why I`ve come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I`m controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That`s why everybody knows that I`m much too much

To take my kindness, for weakness, cause they don`t seem to
Respect my generosity, and what it`s costin me
Is headaches, I don`t like fakes, or people bossin me around
You clown, it`s time I beat you down
You tried to play me betray me and slay me, and now you`ll drown
In the river, I`ll give ya, reasons you should shiver
Cause when I get to wreckin and deckin, I won`t forgive ya
You had the opportunity, for bein cool with me
You stabbed me in the back you duck, and now you`re soon to be
Disarmed, embalmed, I`ll break off all your arms
And then your legs, you`ll beg, I`ll crack you like a egg
And spill your yolk, you joke, I`ll duff you in the eye
And you`ll say, ""Why?"" And bleeding and pleading, you`ll start to cry
And I`ll reply with a confident sigh, ""There`ll be no more Mr. Nice Guy""

No More Mr. Nice Guy
No More Mr. Nice Guy

Yo ?, this is somethin that I want to tell to you, sell to you
And as I speak you girlies yell to your friends, ""Yo it`s him!
He`s shockin again!"" This is the season for breezin with reason
Because I`m in, charge of the attack on suckers who just rap on
Wack track that lack that snap, while I just mack on
Honies who look good and, they all want the wood in
They push up, to get up close, to serve me puddin
And I just tell em, ""Look here, I am not a crook there""
But I like to snatch em all, cause like a hook they`re stuck
Struck, they tried to press their luck
They want to tease me and skeeze me and please me, to squeeze the bucks
From my pocket that is bulging, I`m not indulging
In lame games with phony dames, too busy buildin my fortress
Score this, drink while I pour this
I`m livin and givin my rhymes, so I`ll ignore this
Garbage you are runnin, I am not the one and
You`ll never get to vamp me tramp cause I`ll be stunning your mind
I`ll sign, my name on your behind and cool you off
Like frost, I`m leary of the way you double cross
Get lost, I`ll tell you you are fly and say goodbye
And burning and yearing you`ll ask my why
And I`ll reply with a wink of an eye, ""There`ll be no more Mr. Nice Guy""

No More Mr. Nice Guy
No More Mr. Nice Guy

Oh sure, you`re, running back for me
I`ma great you defeat you and beat you, show you the door
Cause you ain`t really welcome, you know you`re seldom
Thinkin of your fellow man, but you still til them
You want to be a friend then, you keep pretendin
You`re two-faced, so you`ll taste, just what I`m sendin
POW, now, you`re shaken sayin WOW
You stare, you fear, my wrath is too severe
I never let up so get up I`m fed up, and I don`t care
I`ll duff you in the eye and you`ll say, ""Why?""
While you`re bleeding and pleading, you`ll start to cry
And I`ll reply, ""Either do or you die,
Cause there`ll be no more Mr. Nice Guy""

Gang Starr,"And I would like to play a
Little tune I just composed not so long ago
Ms. Billie Holiday
Byrd?
The music called Jazz

It's roots are in the sounds of the African
Or should I say the mother, bringin' us back again
From the drummin' on the Congo
We came with a strong flow and continue to grow

Feet move, to the beat of the t'balo
Now dig the story and follow
For then it landed, on American soil
Through the sweat, the blood and the toil

Hear, ""Praise the Lord,"" shouted on chain gangs
Pain they felt, but it helped them to maintain
Scott Joplin's rags, Bessie Smith's blues

St. Louis blues, they were all the news
Ringin' smooth in all the listener's ears
Fulfillin' the needs and plantin' the seeds of a jazz thing

King Oliver's group was a train comin' through
To Chicago, bringin' the New Orleans groove
And when Satchmo blew, the audience knew

Basil Street blues was the whole house tune
It was music, great to dance to
Great to romance to, with a lot to say to you
Relaying a message, revealing the essence of a jazz thing

Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music, jazz music

In the 40's came be-bop, the first be-bop
The real be-bop, so let me talk about
Diz' and Byrd, givin' the word
Defining how a beat could be so complete

Playing with ferocity, thinkin' with velocity
About ornithology, or anthropology
And even [Incomprehensible], and this is real history

Theolonious Monk, a melodious thunk
No mistakes were made with the notes he played
His conception, was [Incomprehensible]

A star glowing bright among dim lights
The critics did cite that he sounded alright
Charlie Mingus, such nimble fingers
Droppin' the bass, all over the place

And Max Roach, cymbals socking
Bass drum talking, snare drum rocking
Restructuring the metaphysics of a jazz thing

John Coltrane, a man supreme
He was the cream, he was the wise one
The impression of Afro Blue and of the promise
That was not kept, he was a giant step

And there was Ornette Coleman
He was another soul man
The original invisible, playing great music
I wonder why the Bangles couldn't use it

Now listen see, the real mystery is how music history
Created by white men or any other white man
That pretended he originated

And contended that he innovated a jazz thing
Of course we know who can really blow
Scheamin' on the meaning of a jazz thing

And this music ain't dead, so don't be misled
By those who said that jazz was on it's deathbed
'Cause when Betty Carter sings a song
Ain't nuttin' goin' on, but simply good music
And you won't refuse it

She's takin' her time, makin' the nuances rhyme
Sonny Rollins, tenor saxophone
With a big old tone, recitin' poems
With notes as words and haven't you heard
Next stop butter, right past Oleo

Now there's young cats blowin'
And more and more people, yes they will be knowin'
Jazz ain't the past, this music's gonna last
And as the facts unfold, remember who foretold

The 90's, will be the decade of a jazz thing
I love jazz music
A jazz thing
I love jazz music
A jazz thing
I love jazz music

I love jazz music
A jazz thing

I got my man Asu in the house
I got my man Gang Starr in the house
and to my brother Smooth B is in the house

So peep it

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
I got a shitload of story tales in my sack
Please come in, hang your coat on the rag
While you at it, make my coffee black
So I can get the monkey from off my back
15 cents minus 5 is a dime
Sexy young ladies, let's intertwine
Greg N-i-c-e ran it down the line-line

[ VERSE 2: Preacher Earl ]
I'm the P-r-e-a-c-h-e-r, uh
Preacher Earl and I'm considered a superstar
Pick up the microphone and I proceed to rock 'n roll
By the time I sweat I'm out of control
I'm like a locomotive goin express
My lyrics written in spraypaint on the wall (ssss...) def
I'm from Uptown, I'm a gangster from the projects
Either or, take it all, get much respect
Destined for fame when I'm goin for mine
This, this is how I run it down the line

[ VERSE 3: Melo T ]
Hey yo, beats, styles, mics I be flashin
If you step up step in a orderly fashion
See, I collect the dough for the show and then I'm dashin
House parties I'm crashin, pool parties I'm splashin
Eatin candy yams, drinkin Baby Sham, breakin down ( ? )
Got the masterplan, glance at the Melo stance
Arms are crisscrossed, posture rasta
When I wanna go to the mall, I need a helicopter
Rrrrring - I think that's my time
Yo, (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 4: Bass Blaster ]
The biggeda-Bass Blaster with a tongue-twistin rhyme
(This is how we run it down the line)
Yo, literally, literary literature
Six slippery Seals slippin silently ashore
Sally sold seashells down by the seashore
Sold two shells but couldn't see to sell no more
Beautiful babblin brooks bubba between blossom and banks
Brothers above the Brooks take a punch off the plank
A big black bug bit a big black bear, bit him on the rear
The bear was big but the bug didn't care, he had no fear
 
How much would could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Yo, I don't know, all I know is I say it good
Asu, you got the funky, funky rhymes
Yo my brother, run it down the line

[ VERSE 5: Asu ]
Yo, rhymes is rippin and the mic is passed to me
It was too young so they got me for statuatory
Don't take me for granted, punk, yeah, and think I'm worthless
Fuck movin mountains I move planets and you'll be earthless
You don't wanna battle Asu, all I leave is fossils
Lethal Weapons Die Harder cause the Mission's Impossible
And my rhymes is riper, I'm ready to come crisper
Old jacks know that so they go back and whisper
Takin surveys, gettin nervous, I'm just too worthy
They can't stand me and say, 'He can't be from Jersey'

[ VERSE 6: Guru ]
Mad, mad response I'm catchin just as soon as I step into the place
That's why a smile's on my face
I got styles that you trace with haste but I'm too deep
Lots of the ladies I meet, I must be sweet
So I say hold up and wait up and then listen here
My rhymes come crisp and clear, but beware
My format is all that, my concept's refined
The Gang to the S-t-a-double r shines
Chumps be losin it, abusin it, not gainin
So there my gain is they vanish while I'm remainin
And twice as Nice with a Smooth groove I end my rhyme
And yo (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 7: Smooth B ]
Yeah, lyrical, financial and spiritual
A dream of touchin my style would take a miracle
You didn't know how deadly was my flow as I grow
And bumrush and crush any foe
But I prefer to have a good time when I rhyme
But lately I have had to refine and be sublime
Cause sometimes some people don't understand
That I'm a man with ambitious plans and I stand to live grand
And they fight with all their money invested to hold me back
But now I'm featuring the mack pack
Smooth B, you know I'm feelin fine
(This is how we run it down the line)

Gang Starr,"Paragraphs, portraying my viewpoint
So stay attentive, cause this is a new joint
From the G-A-N-G with the info
Lyrical elements emerge from the intro
Forming a poetic mass over pathetic trash
Other writers are outclassed
Surpassed by the words and the wit
Rhymes fit and hit cause that's how we designed it
Page for page, we are the new age
Dope in the videos and dope when we're on stage
Commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
As I'm keeping them thinking
Narrating phrases of value, and I can see now you
Relate to what I create
From back in the days of my youth, I've looked for the truth
And yo my rhymes are the real proof
New heights and new realms have been reached
By use of my speech along with one of Premier's beats
So listen and we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A

Worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
So you can get this right
My oratory gift is abundant, so dazzling to minds
That you should come get
A glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work
The script is a mess and they dress like they're jerks
Beyond them, is where I'll be dwellin
The Guru will tell em, why their records ain't sellin
Placin my fingers on the tool, I runaway all fools
When I'm dispersin a verse
Think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
Cause this party I own it
The origin of this is on paper
Vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
I go with the flow as I show expertise
The powers increase as my voice hits the streets
Then gripping your soul with authority
I pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
And then I might bring another round
Watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
And keep aware, cause we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A",As I Read My S-A,1991
Gang Starr,"Expanding the depth of your brainpower
Ours is a better gift, not to be bragging nor lolligagging
I can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
Transmitting lyrics like teletype
Reacting to a beat in a whisper
And like a transistor, I'm sounding dope when I'm crisper
The shortest length between two points is a straight line
I've gotta take mine, I heard it through the grapevine
That some can't find hype lines (hype lines...)
And so I'm smothering, over my prey I am hovering
Suckers I'm shoving at the same time covering
You with the blanket of some language that's distinguished
How swift can I get? You ask and I'll tell
For I can excel real well like a gazelle
Past your head, I'm grabbin abstract thought
Like some gain glory, while others get no part
I feel for the hurt ones, the victims of wrong deeds
Awareness is key, our people have strong needs
Science, math, history theology
Philosophy psychology english and biology
Et cetera, and all of these have a purpose
But genocide makes me nervous
So many questions, many opinions to mention
And damn (damn) this jam's beyond comprehension

Like planets in orbit, we ride the life cycle
Some take a rifle on the street cause it seems neat
Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin
I'd rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
Than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
For a person to just flip, so a brother may
Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song that's beyond comprehension",Beyond Comprehension,1991
Gang Starr,"You puny protozoa, you`re so minute you didn`t know the
Gang has been watchin but instead of just squashin you
I`m scoopin you up out of the muck you wallow in
Like a chief chemist, other scientists are followin
Plannin to examine you, on a petrie dish
Sticking you and frickin you, just a teenie bit
I`m clever, with science, but never relyin
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin
Insistin they come off, I let `em get some off
Then come back wit drum tracks, their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin, like makin love, i`ll never stop thrustin
Into your system, so just listen
I`m like a neurosurgeon, operatin wit a purer version
I write prescriptions, of words that fit in
The thought gets prescribed, as I kick it live
Cause it`s more that a style, it`s conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is, to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak
Check the technique

I`m rushin you like a defensive end as I recommend
That you comprehend, I could stomp you in
A battle, contest, or war, what will occur
Will be the forfeiture, of your immature
Insecure for sure, meek, weak visions of grandeur
To rudely awaken you, and then`ll be breakin you
Taxin without askin and trackin and snakin you
Makin you succumb to the drums of gangstarr
By far we are, truly gifted ones son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin
You`ll be dyin, tryin to face the fate of your delusions
Cause miscalculation, is all you`re statin
So i`m chumpin, puntin punks just like footballs
Cause I want to put y`all, back in the messhall
To clean up the slop, and stop all the bullcrap
Your rap`s crazy wack, so don`t try to pull that
You`re lackin the vernacular, i`m slappin ya and cappin ya
And closin your jaw, cause you can`t mess with gangstarr
The guru and premier always dope with the blessed beats
Dance your ass off hobbes, check the technique

""Bon voyage"", ""sayanora"", ""arriva derci""
Your ass gets busted doodoo mustard, you tried to work me
You irked me - because you copy and falsify
And I don`t care how many step up, cause you all can try
To wish and fish for a style, here`s a fishin rod
These rhymes are hittin hard, constantly i`m gettin large
Inevitably, I readily kick a slew
Of lyrics so deep, so don`t sleep, but just peep me
Puttin methods on records and spinning for each millisecond
33 rpm`s displays the art of men
And as my rhymin builds you see my time it`s chill
And then I look upon weak ones
I`m teachin each one so they become redone
Essays are relayed to twist you up like french braids
Or tied up like corn braids, cause I got a strong way
Force like police raids to never be delayed
I once was the least paid but I made the grade
Cause this ain`t a slave sale and I ain`t the same stale
Rapper, no, i`m not a phony microphonist wit no blaster
No type of real appeal or real - talent
And it makes me violent man
To see all of these peewee bee mc wannabees
Makin g`s for some dumb companies
And lots of money but no idea what is rap and what is dope
So check out what the guru wrote
Cause I will prevail, give you tales as I unveil
Have enough braincells so I can stay paid well

He was my right hand man, but he betrayed me
I let him chill at my crib, cause we were down and
I went to work everyday while he was loungin
He tried to backstab, he kept on jokin
He didn't know he could've got his back broken
I had to cut homeboy off for even tryin that
His game was mad weak, know what I'm sayin black?
Stepped to him quietly, he copped a plea
Told him to fix it or I'd have to catch a body
In this society, there's many snakes
Don't be too eager when you're seeking a break
Cause chumps will exploit, use you to benefit
So just be keen and, learn all the ins of it
I've had my share, of dealing with fake men
I left them squealing, ""It was I who did the taking""

I foiled the scheme cause it seemed I was that man

Call me the Guru, known as a spiritual teacher
I'll reach you deftly, directly, correctly so select me
Elect me as your prophet and we'll praise him as I drop it

I'll wreck the set and grab a big chunk
Known to be a wise one, known to be a seeker

Take a taste of the bass put your perspective in place
Get real, deep, so you can keep involved
Revolve and solve, so you can make the calls

Way to display similar actions in a kind of mockery

You to get advancement, while you're on the dance tip
And don't you know the transcript will make you shake hips
Or chill at will, and with skill, you'll learn some etiquette

Up to this level or should I say caliber
Because I`m hype that the company`s selling me
Because they`ll take a dud, talk some crud and then push him
But in the next year, someone new will just squoosh him

So jet to the rear and you better just follow
`Cause what`s here today maybe gone tomorrow

Here and gone in a flash, some made cash
While other suckers go broke real fast
Some never make any money but still they act funny
LIke they`re thinking they`re running

Then listen to their rhymes when we rather take valiums
`Cause swiftness and skills they are lacking

Want to do a dance or two

They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claimin' respect, just to get a rep

Ten brothers in a circle
Had the kid trapped, the one wit the hood, he said, ""we'll hurt you""
If you don't run out your dues and pay
Give up the rolex watch or you won't see another day
See, they were on the attack
And one said, ""yo, you want to make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""now"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep",Just to Get a Rep,1991
Gang Starr,"The meaning of the name GangStarr, well I'll tell ya
It means How far my mind can excel to
A greater type of thought, brought by the things that I've been taught
In relation to things that I rebel to divine and combine
With a sense of confidence
Accomplishments, are achieved on floppy disc
But slopiness, I could never tolerate it
Not the Guru nor Premier you don't know how long we've waited
While other groups have faded, just like haircuts
We use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain
To expose every vain
Cause you sound plain, insane, and mundane, it's a shame
You've got no beats, so you get no seats
At this table, you ain't stable with the mic cable
Cain and Abel, jealous brothers
And I knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
But back to the act of developing the GangStarr track
It means that nothing can be wack
The music is picked right, the mic is gripped tight
The lyrics I kick right to a beat like Kryptonite power
Not withstood by any mortal or immortal
To make you get on the floor til
Another dope jam we slam with precision
Bringing beams of light, like the colors in a prism
Or reflections, through a spectrum
And all the soft silly suckers I'mma wet them
In other words destroy boy, and then claim my fame...
This is the meaning of the name

GangStarr, it means a lot to me
It means I'm free to bust rhymes sporadically
Gang represents my boys or a posse
So just back up off me
And the Starr symbolizes the power
Making the suckers and weak brothers cower
We got strong, intelligent minds with a street sense
Crazy offense, and stupid defense
Now, have I made myself clear?
Or do I have to call on DJ Premier?
For he and I make up the songs that you long for
Meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door
Waiting for a call or for the doors to open
Cause they're hoping, that they'll get chosen
But to be chosen is indeed our gift
You better get a job quick
See you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak
You oughta take a peak and check out the technique
Seek, and you shall find
GangStarr stands for mastermind
Simple and plain and yo this ain't no game lame
This is the meaning of the name",The Meaning of the Name,1991
Gang Starr,"[Guru]
The DJ`s name is Premier, and I`m the Guru *echoes*
(repeat 2X)

*music fades*
*sound of a large crowd cheering*
Will you please!
Will you please, take your seats and clear the aisles?!

*rapping sound, three times*",Name Tag (Premier & the Guru),1991
Gang Starr,"[Guru]
My subject matter and context are blessed
Vocal inflection connects, it`s a slugfest
Ladies approach to hear quotes from the spokesman
Thoughts are like oceans for my lyrics to float in

I`m absolutely astute so salute
You try to be cute, and you get tossed like a crap shoot
Don`t misinterpret or slander
Just get with the words and the way I command ya

'Cause you`re in the right place, and luckily it`s the right time
And since I`m inclined, I`ll kick precisely the right rhymes

[Guru]
Listen listen listen I`ll tell ya
My rhymes are like shelter, or rather like an umbrella
Protecting you from the weak stuff you heard from those creampuffs
About the schemes that they dreamed of

About the way they slayed this one or that one
But won`t step to me, cause they know the last one
Who tried to match the panache of the Guru
Received a curse that was much worse than voodoo

'Cause the effect of my voice is immense
It would make more sense if suckers hide in the basement
But yo I don`t look for hassles, my rhymes are like castles
I got much flavor and class too

I know you`ve notice I`m a writer of hype lines
Because I`m inclined, to kick precisely the right rhymes

[Guru]
Precisely the right rhymes, simplistic but packed
With power and punch, and yo you might want to step back
But stay close as your host serves hors d`oeveurs
Satisfying your cravings, and calming your nerves

See I have an interest, in giving you more than the next man
'Cause my style is pure and
If you are sane and remain in your right mind
You`ll see I`m inclined, to kick precisely the right rhymes",Precisely the Right Rhymes,1991
Gang Starr,"So many things will happen that one can`t explain
You find yourself saying ""who me"", time and again
They say what goes around, comes around
Ahun, so think about it while you`re messing up clown
A mother`s love and a father`s concern
Here is the reason you should listen and learn
`Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
`Cause after all the highs, you`re gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
`Cause if you don`t have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit
`Cause every second, another dream is destroyed wit
The systematic plan devised to erase us
And straight to hell is where they`re trying to take us
But never fold and hold back your fears
Have a strong mind and try to say your prayers",Say Your Prayers,1991
Gang Starr,"Once you step in the arena, cheater, you`re gonna be a-
Mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to find a cause, I won`t pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I`m like claws
That`ll rip `cause your gift, is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you, would give it a rest
But if you don`t, I`ll unsheath my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet ya challenger
A true hero, while you`re a through zero
Gettin beat to a pulp so that you can`t run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat, cause you hope that I`ll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check out how I mellowed into it
Face to feet to defeat, you can tell I`m into it
As I`m pullin out my lance, to kill you and advance to
The winner`s throne, cause I own you once you step in the arena

In the arenak, or rather coliseum
There`s people gatherin by multitudes to see one
Perpetrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born wit the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up, makes GangStarr want to snatch up
One or two phrases from the new book with new pages
Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it, to the battle set
If a beat was a princess, I would marry it
But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorius, glorious, understand now
Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, cause you`d rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed or
Struck by a blow, from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
Cause rhymin is serious, I`m strong, I`m like Hercules
You`ll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet cause I wreck once you step in the arena

In the arena or forum, weak MC`s I will floor `em
Causin' mayhem, I`ll slay them, and the blood`ll be pourin'
Furthermore I implore, that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean but none`ll be
Tryin' to toy wit a destroyer of many
You shitted your pants cause you can`t figure any
Foe that can step to this concept so
You better sit again citizen, weak MC`s I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions, cause they didn`t listen
And tried goin' up against a hungry killer who`s itchin
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena",Step in the Arena,1991
Gang Starr,"Presenting you with alternative music
'Cause, yo, the struggle is tough, and we must learn to live through it
Pleasure and pain, pain and pleasure
We gotta maintain a balance to obtain the treasure

Not really preaching or teaching but just reaching
Out to a brother or sister who is keeping
The faith and trying hard to get straight
The time is crucial so I think we must congregate

Let's have a meeting of the minds
Before we all fall and get left far behind
Finding a way is important
Map out a plan, take a stand, you can work it

The future's all in your hands and
So of yourself, yea, you should be demanding
We're all responsible for whatever outcome
That's why I speak over beats for my income

Knowledge is key and if you ask what it is, G
It's just a form of my style of street ministry
Street ministry",Street Ministry,1991
Gang Starr,"Well goodness gracious, let me just take this
Time out to pull a rhyme out, and update this
For you and yours, simply because
Some MC's have luck but suck
So I pluck em like feathers on the back of a chicken
Cause I'm mad like a pit when my man says, ""sick 'em""
Positive is the mindstate, but it could still mean that
I will kick a ill, malicious like mean rap
Suckers they forced me, to knock em all out and
They think they know things, like what I'm about and
They try to analyze criticize scandalize
The outcome is death, don't ask me to sympathize
Realize, that I'm not to be played with
I'll flip so fast, you won't know I'm the same kid
I'm tired and fed, with all the weak stuff said
All the phony-baloney, that went out like Pro-Keds
You've got no leads, so you shoot blanks
It's me the crowd thanks as I step to the top ranks
Bankin my money, and investin it wisely
Snatchin up chumps when they try to sneak by me
I'm the dominant one, call me the prominent one
And as I'm speakin I'll be bombin the dumb
Deaf and blind cause I was born with a sharp mind
Eatin MC's with ease like it's lunchtime
Or crunchtime, when they get done without warning
I'll bust that butt from nighttime til morning
Your song's boring, and so I'm scoring
Much points cause when it's time to throw joints
I cause havoc, the mic I grab is like savage
I invade the stage, and make you get off
The force is like a three-eight, blowin your head off
And that's just in case you might be wearin a vest
Cause you're simply a pest in this mess I suggest you

Don't ever sleep son, peep one or two of these lines here
Arranged by a great brain, delivering rhymes clear
And concise with a nice dope voice and
Killin the fakes like a taste of some poison
Punks are thinkin they're alla that, their voices are all flat
They're findin their names, in a Wack Rapper's Almanac
Me follow that hollow crap, no way Jose
I'll seek out a better sound, to somethin Premier plays
Days will go by, and soon you'll know why
MC's like me will rise like the Enterprise
Starship, headin straight for the target
Destination, a place where no perpetration
Is permitted, the Guru is with it to explain
How some MC's are scared to ride on a Four train
Or any other train in the city, for that matter
Playin a role that they stole like a batter
But I know they ain't so I'll paint the real picture
My vocals go solo and like a bolo I'll hitcha
Square in your face I'll crack your ribs and your chest
Cause you thought your off-brand jam was the best
You fessed cause you guessed people would be impressed
I'm gonna bust that bubble on the double ""take a rest""

Sit back and reflect, ponder and chill out
Rhymes like daggers make blood spill out
But you can't blame me, for bringin disaster
With all these ducks, claimin that they're the masters
Only thing they mastered, is how to get wacker
As I roll uphill, they roll downhill faster
Now they're wondering how they lost their touch
Wanna buy my rhymes but mine cost too much
I'm the innovative one, call me the creative one
And I won't stop til the job is done
All the slobs just run when I come to get some
Cause they know better, than to challenge this go-getter
They get bust you can trust cause I won't let a
Booty-ass rapper get wins against me?
I guarantee that I won't act friendly
Cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on
Their girls get kissed on, while they get flipped on
I slaughter and slay, or slap em up quick
Cause the lyrics they kick make me seriously sick
No substance, no value, but nevertheless
They're gettin daytime play but I still say they should ""take a rest""",Take a Rest,1991
Gang Starr,"""Who's this? Juanita? Fatima? Solika? Oh, it's Freda?
Look, I have a question, just what is it that you need
A man, a lover, maybe someone to talk to?
Or could it be you're schemin'? Oh, not you!
Well listen, I got this phone installed for business
And who gave you our number? Seriously, what is this?
The new fad? Now you wanna kick it to a rapper
DJ or dancer? Well I don't have the
Time for no stunts, no hookers and no games
Our name and our fame is for the long way we came
The struggle, the hassle, the hustle, the fight
And you're asking me if you can see me tonight?
Don't you know the Guru's not the type to be out skeezin'
The reason is because I do believe in
Havin' the right to choose the one I want
And, if I had a girl, why would I front?
You're only gonna get your feelings hurt, miss
And truthfully I really don't wanna have to diss
My music means everything to me, it's my life
So make like a camper, and go take a hike
You can't mess with my mind, and don't tie up my line
You called yesterday, so what you want this time?""

""A-yo Premier (Yeah?) Who's that knockin' at the door?
(Yo man, it's Vicky) Vicky? Are you sure?
The one from down the block who was actin' all hot
She stops me all the time and says she likes me a lot?
How does she know where we live, I didn't tell her
And word is bond, duke, I'm not the fella
No matter what I say this young lady's persistent
For instance, she watches me from a distance
And if I walk by and I forget to say hi
She pushes up on me and rubs me with her thigh
I told her I was taken, but she doesn't care
A-yo, do me a favour, tell her I'm not here
Forget it, I think she heard my voice already
You can let her in, but I'm tryna cook spaghetti
Oh, hello, how you doin'? Who me? I'm fine
I don't mean to be rude, but, what you want this time?""",What You Want This Time?,1991
Gang Starr,"I was raised like a Muslim
Prayin' to the East
Nature of my life relates rhymes I release
Like a cannon
Cuz I been plannin' to be rammin' what I wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as I suggest we take a good look
At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes pow
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin'
'Cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin'
And many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, cuz now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?

The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less travelled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible
That's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?",Who's Gonna Take the Weight?,1991
Gang Starr,"I'm 2 deep and yes much too complicated
My lines when stated are quite often underrated
So consider it a privilege to hear this
Those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
Whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
'Cause you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowing that hard is something you can`t be
So you front but you could never call my bluff
'Cause you`ll catch hell you`ll get dealt with

[Chorus]
I never sleep
I always peep
Rhymes creep
I`m 2 Deep
I`m 2 Deep....

I forgive you sike I`m takin` your life
'Cause you continue to disrespect so I`ma get trife
But then again I think I`ll spare ya
'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
See I`m the holder of the key 
Don`t ask me if I`m Muslim don`t say nothin` to me 
I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins 
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted I almost missed it
The chance yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me
And the nation of Islam has my support 
'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps
To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean 
Say what I mean and I`m out
Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout

[Chorus]

For right now yo my religion is rhyming
Perfect timing test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Sheite, Jihad
All must regard the times are hard
Unite or perish
Is the message I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we`re all black why have so many divisions
Superficial factors are drawing us apart 
Don`t let it happen
Let`s put some respect back in
So before I act I think 'cause it`s the brink of destruction
Word corruption what`s up son your gun is just one
And I just might have one 
Or two or maybe even three or four
And plus an army of 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice

Mad chicks be jockin' when the g starr's talking
And that's because my word is bond
I get much fan mail and I always respond
So tell your hon to write me too
Make sure she puts attention mr. guru
Brothers know the flow is unique
I got 100 wild styles in my black valise
Mc's wanna be me so they keep askin
For me to teach 'em methods both slow and fast
And others wanna act as if they're better
But they only got one style which ain't all that clever
I'm cooler than wind, harder than cold steel
I get the ladies with more than just sex appeal
A mystic psychic scanning all your thoughts
I'll touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
When my rapture traps ya and makes you mine
You'll submit to the gift and to the lyrical lines
So suckers realize that the size is too large
When I come through I'm pullin' whole crews cards
I be wreckin' correct and on the gangster tip
Mc's who front: imma' gonna bust your shit

I wonder do you love it enough
I'm steppin' rugged and tough, never to front or to bluff
I got the fresh cut baldy, the brothers call me
Guru the man yes with all the
J-a-z-z-y type essence, street type lessons manifesting
The one who make the fly ladies feel pleasant
Never forgettin' that to myself I'm true
Do what you want to but watch yourself though ""duke""
I don't wanna hear all of that loud mouthing
Try to pull yours out when nothing comes out
Then you'll see why you can't compete with me
The notorious guru of the gang you see
Starr stands for power like I said before
I'm like the doctors cure slicker than roger moore
I slide up to a crab mc like this
Tap 'em in the head with my mic like this
I'll be revealing that you're weak to the world if you wish
And I insist that if you persist
Then you get creamed, 'cause imma' get real steamed
So don't you try to flex and try to look all mean
Heyo check it that's dead that's it
'cause all you phony ass rappers imma' bust your shit

Now when you see me on the set you know I may unleash
A lyric like a mad dog barking through the speaker
Step off unless you wanna get torn up
Your raps worn out burned out fucked up
You lucked up or maybe you lucked out
'cause at the battle last time you snuck out
But now I'm rolling over you full blast
I'm here to let you know no longer will the bull last

Keep on fakin' moves and imma'",B.Y.S.,1992
Gang Starr,"You can't tell me life was meant to be like this
A black man in a world dominated by whiteness
Ever since the declaration of independence
We've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence
It goes: all men are created equal
That's why corrupt governments kill innocent people
With chemical warfare they created crack and aids
Got the public thinking these were things that black folks made
And every time there's violence shown in the media
Usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya
To a world full of ignorance, hatred, and prejudice
Tv and the news for years they have fed you this
Foolish notion that blacks are all criminals
Violent, low lifes, and then even animals
I'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me
But I must do my part to combat the conspiracy

The S.A.T. is not geared for the lower class
So why waste time even trying to pass
The educational system presumes you to fail
The next place is the corner then after that jail
You've got to understand that this has all been conspired
To put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired
It even exists when you go to your church
'Cause up on the wall a white jesus lurks
They use your subconscious to control your will
They've done it for a while and developed the skill
To make you want to kill your own brother man
Black against black you see it's part of their plan
They want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
What they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
Genocide is for real and I hope that you're hearing me
You must be aware to combat the conspiracy

Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold
Now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
'Cause they have no regard for real hip-hop
They'll compare you to others and say: ""but yo, he sells""
And you know in your heart that he's weak as hell
So you say: ""I ain't doing that corny stuff""
But they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
Sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
And when they break 'em then your mama says
""son you're making records but that guy seems shady""
It could be too late and your career could be played gee
I hope you listen to the things that I'm sharing see
We all have a job to combat the conspiracy",Conspiracy,1992
Gang Starr,"You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my beema goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Bow I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field cuz I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with a grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm on with the next girl

She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near cuz of my svoir faire
The time we shared was brief cuz I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad
Yo but she'd tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm straight with the next girl

You saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how's my sister then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father cuz you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darlin' was fly and this was the problem
Cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
Went home to see mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? nah I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl out",Ex Girl to Next Girl,1992
Gang Starr,"Brave is the knave who steps up to be slayed
By the one who forgave him for his first mistakes
He'd best behave, or I`ma send him a wave
Of some shocking volts, he doesn`t know what he`s talkin about
He's kickin a bunch of crap so I`ll be the judge of that
The boy lacks artistry but still he tries hard to be
An entertainer, but instead he`s a waste of
My time and your time so I`ll kick the pure rhymes
Whenever you`re looking for rap that`s exceptional
And credible, straight to the G`s you better go
Cause GangStarr`s known to be prone to be
Masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
But still be a cold day in Hell when you hear that
Guru or Premier ever tell suckers get sales
But they fail in the long run that kid who went gold yo
That was the wrong one but tonight the spotlight is all on me
I`m the Guru, of the G-A-N-G
Taking out scrubs cause they rub me the wrong way
And I`ll say, that they`ve still got a long way to go
To show they can flow like a real pro
So gimme that loot catch the boot from my steel toe
I`m changing the scenery as I make em uncomfortable
Cause most MC`s ain`t really got no pull
Watch me stifle em quick with the gift and the wit
Make em quit all that riff as I flip the script

[Chorus]

Fool listen, I know that you`ve been missing
All this and so my rhymes are gonna gleem and glisten
Like a gem, and if you are the fake MC type
I`ll shine so bright I`ll be blinding your eyesight
Your capabilities fall short so I`ma treat you like a dwarf
On a basketball court still you try to rap
And even claim you got new styles but
Rolling your tongue`s been playe dout for a while
And you don`t sound fly so why are you doing that?
You had a dope track but you`re wack so you ruined that
I couldn`t make out what you were saying your diction
Is jumbled where as me I`m conveying clear thoughts
To a crowd that`s most critical
Booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
I bet you couldn`t name more than one pioneer
Cause you didn`t pay dues and you got on on outta nowhere
But that`s OK cause I`m peeping your card
If rap was my house you`d be sweeping the yard
As I recline I`ll find more chores to give ya
Like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
So don`t even trip or run off with the lip
Cause as soon as you slip you know I`ll flip the script

[Chorus]

So as I kick a bit flip with script without a skip
Butter roll MC`s get dissed like this
You`ll never got none son because I`ll become troublesome
You rap like a simpleton
And I hate scum yo I can easily deflect your threats
Cause they`re idle my recital will break you down
Just a fight til the end cause I can take ten at a time
Give em all a fair shot to see if any can rhyme
And even if one is decent, I`ll still get props
I`ll kick the slick lines til the last one drops
As my powerful skills are unveiled I`m tippin the scales
And weighing much more than your tall tales
Stop the exaggeration perpetration observe
And make simple notation
Nobody no where no way no how
Is taking me out cause I can throw so you know now
Can you feel it, I bust raps so lay off
Before I steal that so called title that you gave yourself
But you really ain`t jack so yo you played yourself
And now you look from a distance as you sweat my tip
You know I`ll whip you swift when I flip the script",Flip the Script,1992
Gang Starr,"Now I got you looking stiff you numbskull, you`re at a stand still
Still faking that you`re hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
So I`ll easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
Send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
Then if you want you can go call your people
You`re gonna need a mob against me cause I`m lethal
Not that I`m a violent brother to the contrary
My vocals carry, and then I bury
MC`s in holes that they dug for themselves
Couldn`t be themselves so they sold themselves
To a company exec who doesn`t have respect
For real rap music so he wants to get an MC
That starts out street to crossover
But not me, cause I`m the hardcore composer

You ain`t a writer nor a fighter you`re just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite
Of the reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you`re really a crab
So I`ll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
And back to trace my flow but don`t waste your time bro
It only takes a minute a second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick cause I can kick plenty styles
Rhymes stretch many miles
I`m the authentic yes the lyric unloader
The truth exposer, the hardcore composer

All you delirious curious suckers
You better act like you`ve been known I mack
And hold my own with a mike just to stagger
A bragger, retire a lair and very easily
I`m pass by ya cause you didn`t want to give the credit
Where it was due, yeah it was you, uh huh it was you
And your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost and plus you oughta
Find another type of life and yes another source of income
And here`s some advice you can`t rap this nice
I broke ya over and over I told ya
I would mold ya why? Because I`m bound
To give original sound and as your ears pound
Bringing pleasure and pain
As brains start to gain from musical measures
Forming mystical questions never typical inventions
Developed by my Gifted Unlimited mind
Suckers want to rhyme cause they`re eager to find
The secret behind the way that I stomp all comp
Just like a Timberland it`s the Guru and Premier
It`s them again droppin the fly tracks
And taking things over and never selling out
Cause I`m the hardcore composer",Hardcore Composer,1992
Gang Starr,"I say people people come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
[what's your name?] call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
Slander the name and with-hold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going no where
'Cause my strret style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
Mc's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggaz better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm bout to blow the fuck up because I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
Yeah me and the crew think its about that time
But on the DL you know that Gangstarr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My nautica, asking for a hookup
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate
Before I get irate
And I'll kick your can
From here to Japan
With force you can't withstand
'Cause I'm the muthafuckin' man

Yo right now I got my man Lil' Dap from the Group home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, muthafucka just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip
Lil' Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick
So all you punks hear this
Everytime you riff
The more fame that we get
Muthafuckas act hard
Thinking that they are God
Niggaz just don't understand
Let me be my own man
Did everything on my own
And everyplace wasn't home
Everywhere that I'd rest
I had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind
Brothers doin' mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime
As we're rippin' the lines
Brothers just don't know
How shit got to go
'Cause I was told
To never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto
Dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound
Then I walk with a frown
Another minute
Another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close that's why the Group Home is thick
So everytime you riff the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next
Because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said
Yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around
Tryin' to get down
Niggaz just don't understand
I'm the mutha fuckin' man

And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

I'll tap your jaw
You probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore with more
Dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef
The chief ambassador
Niggaz get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot
Don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before
I tap jaws
Snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars
Vic a style you said was yours
Money grip want to flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us
When we rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lot's of friends, lot's of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, kreeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
I'm a get mines 'cause the crew'll get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands
You know the program I'm the mutha fuckin' man",I'm the Man,1992
Gang Starr,"[Chorus:]
Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it`s time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check

I`m one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don`t understand, see I`m a grown man
And I stand 5`8"" and 3 quarters
Giving orders to my sqaudron 'cause I`m like the sergeant 
Or general but let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
And like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought
Remembering the brothers who are gone now
I will make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall
Flat to the ground as I astound come around
I`ll put you down about the brothers who think they`re the boss
Think they`re getting large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain`t the way to go out
Even take their boys with `em cause they know their boys will go out
But when it comes to facing some time
They`re like crying like weeping, want to call mom Dukes
But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
But who`s to judge when you`re trying to survive
The one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
So when you think you`re hard and dominating the set
Just remember the illest brother claims respect!

Like I said I`m an ill kid, so never dare test me
They want to arrest me 'cause i`m causing a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay but Imma` tell it anyway
Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
An example of hard times
'cause to make it out the trap in your mind it`s a hard climb
But even if you change and come right and exact
There`s another brother scheming so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a down fall
He`d pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn`t give a damn if he killed somebody
'cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
There`d be no hesitation he`d just shoot
It`s like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
Except it`s reality and you don`t see it on TV
Brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed 
To keep you from having peace of mind
I know an old man, he`s got a rifle to stifle 
Any young punk, he hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who`s been to jail
And he told me that the system had failed him
So now he`s out the joint and he`s like flippin` on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin` their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there`s a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I`m meaning
'cause rather than being the herb, vic, or chump
You can be just like my man cold holding the pump
But living like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life, sometimes will make you uptight
I`m like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
All fakes, all snakes
And ones who try to break the rules and regulations
Stipulations made by the GangStarr
You try to flex muscle but you know you can`t hang ha
You`re making me vexed but yeah you can go next
Just remember the illest brother claims respect

[Chorus:]  repeat
Yo money don`t front you know you blew your chance
And now it`s my turn so Imma` take command
'cause I`m like the one who`s got all the juice
I always get loose I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I`m like the ill kid the psycho man yo
'cause now I`m past the point and I ain`t gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain`t really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I`m living day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways.
I get my attitude from living and I never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!",The Illest Brother,1992
Gang Starr,"Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their p's and q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed cuz you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Check the G-U-R-U yes the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
And kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true cuz you know
A rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
Cuz I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape cuz I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
Cuz the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm not buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Gang Starr,"As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I`m dead up serious so don`t be getting too curious
Motherfuckers always want to know what makes me tick
I`ll pull a phrase out quick 'cause I`m dipped and I`m slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty`s
It shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact
In fact I`ll have you open like a hookers gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC`s are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
Save the talk 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hitting city to city but I make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I`ll diss you if you`re pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin` all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you`re scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don`t even think about it 'cause ain`t no shame in my game

No shame in my game
Stick to the subject I ain`t afraid to be real
A lot of MC`s fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don`t like the prankster crap
So I get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain`t no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don`t use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain`t toys but kids got `em today
And if they`re ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
I try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I`ll climb
But what the hell`s success if the mess ain`t changing
50`s still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin`
Stick up kids still stickin` nasty hookers still trickin`
All the pimps still pimpin` and all the crackheads trippin`
While the dealers still sellin` so I`ll refrain from the yellin`
And the preachin` 'cause who the fuck would I reach man
Niggaz don`t want to stop that, they want to live fat
Who`d want to clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
They live for the minute and they`re all wrapped up in it
It`s an unfortunate state for many it`s too late
Now death stalks the streets and it`s right at your gate
So bug, lose your mind but I ain`t goin` insane
I`ll kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain`t no shame in my game

No shame in my game
Life`s a bitch so who are we to judge each other
I know I got faults I ain`t the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn`t too cool you know
Like how you smoke wools and that your girl`s a ho
But I don`t listen to shit unless the story`s legit
Knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be riding the dilsnick
But I`ll be taking care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhyming you know I`m hitting hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you`ll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain`t no shame in my game",No Shame in My Game,1992

New York, New york is where we live and we`re thorough
Never taking shorts 'cause Brooklyn`s the borough
Peace to Uptown, to queens and the Bronx
Long Island and Jersey get as fly as they want
Where we rest is no joke
So let me break it down to sections for you slowpokes
Fort Green, Bedsty, Flatbush, Brownsville
Crown Heights and East New York will be down till
Medina takes respect for the style`s we bring
'cause in Brooklyn, we be into our own thing
Alantic terminals, Redhook Bushwick
Come to Brooklyn frontin, and you`ll get mushed quick
We ain`t just know for flipping and turning out parties
But also for the take no bullshit hotties
On the subject of blackness, well let me share this
Brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
So in all fairness, you can never compare this
Some good, some bad. little hope for the weak
Dangerous streets and Coney Island Beach
All this included when you go for a tour
Some can get scandolous and outright raw
When you step, step correct and watch where you move
We pay dues so we ain`t trying to lose
Here in Brooklyn
The home of the black and the beautiful
For a ruffrap sound, ain`t a place more suitable
Other cities claim this, and others claim that
But let me give some props to the place where we be at

I came in for a visit and ever since then
I`ve been incorporated with select personnel

Peace to Boston, Philly, Connecticut, DC
All the east coast cities are fly to me
Peace to everybody down south and out west
But for me, Brooklyn, New York is the best
Don`t be afraid to venture over the bridge
Although you may run in to some wild ass kids
Take the j train, the d or the a if you dare
And the 2,3,4,5 also comes here
There`s so much to see 'cause Brooklyn`s historic
Fools act jealous but you have to ignore it

Gang Starr,"5 carloads deep, time to go do a show
Got a massive crew and we`re ready to roll
So I grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
Premier he`s got the fly dope system inside
But my shit cranks too and we`ve got mad tapes
Of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
Off into the New York night we go
Dre large got the camera biggest, Gord`s got three rolls of film
So we can take the macked out photos
Tommy Hill, The Damaja and my man Gunsmoke
Corey and Smurf and Lil Dap`s got a forty
My man Gary and Shiz and the nutcracker Shorty
Mike Rhone, chillin` like Capone
Robinhood, Known as Mel with the clientelle
Mo, JT, Mega, can`t forget black
They`re rockin` sincere, yes the posse`s fat
Out loud pulls up plus there`s Sid and OC
Big Mel from strong island H.L. the one and only
O. Delicious, Ely, Bazz and Eon
And the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
And to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
And you know who`s who, so let me not prolong
For this was a night to remember
I had on the beige Tims with the two tone leather
So we get to the jam, the gig, the venue
Then we circled around and then drove in through
The front the place was packed the line was long
I was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
I turned it down then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waist
A riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wiling tryna` snatch kids jewels
After that 50 came and turned the party out
And then the ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn`t even get all the equipment out
And we didn`t even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it`s really fucked up
So I`ll ask you to your face homeboy what`s up
Did you come to see my show or the stupid nigga playoffs
Killing you and killing me it`s the soliloquy of chaos

And if you live in the cities where streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere bot you go for yours there
You`ll find it doesn`t pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you`ll want to retaliate, regroup and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you die or kill them, it`s another brother dead
But I know you`ll never get that through your head
'Cause we`re mislead and misfed facts, we`re way off
Killing you and killing me, it`s the soliloquy of chaos",Soliloquy of Chaos,1992
Gang Starr,"Get with this get with this 
Get with this 'cause you got no choice
Rappers sometimes you`ll find make dough 
But yo you know they`ve got no voice
Get him off the podium he ain`t no speaker
Yes he`s just a phony and look at his sneakers
Played out of style out of rhymes
He`s out his mind
Lost his way lost his pay
I`m takin` his props so call the cops
You can call `em but I know `em
Sweet MCs I think I`ll ho `em
'Cause they front so very hard and big or small
I`ll break `em all
Ain`t gotta say that I`m the best
My skills will show I passed the test
When it comes to beats and rhymes
We come correctly everytime
And stay tuned

[Chorus]
Stay tuned...

With information like the CNN
I can take you there and then
The rest is up to you to choose
The bottom line is win or lose
Suckers suckers suckers don`t be listening
So I can`t be waitin` on `em
I ain`t got no time to play, do you?
Look at the state of things and tell me true
In the city any city life`s a paradox of good and evil
Many fall into the vicious cycle
Living by the gun or by the rifle
Think they got a reason that ain`t really sure
The death toll rises more
It`s trife the way some live life
I love rap, I like the city
But for a fool I have no pity
There`stoo much suffering too much struggle
Too much injustice and don`t it bug you
Enough for you to press on harder
Against the odds the wayn our forefathers
Made away but foolishly we go astray
Think about it and stay tuned

[Chorus]

What you really oughta do is lay back smooth
As my vocals compliment the slow fat groove
Just for you to blast around the way
Play it nice and loud and hear me say
Gang Starr is hitting `92 and on
Showing how to make a dope rap song
Doing this while some disperse
Then dissolve like specs of dirt
Our music pertains to those who remain
Down with the real not wealth or the fame
Peace out, we`ll be back, stay tuned...

Please stay tuned",Stay Tuned,1992
Gang Starr,"I never thought that you would crab me
Undermine me, and backstab me
But I can see clearly now the rain is gone
The pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
There was a few times I needed your support
But you tried to play me like an indoor sport
Like racquetball, tennis, fool, whatever
All I know is you attempted to be clever
Nevertheless, cleverness can`t impress
Cause now you`ve been expose like a person undressed
Cause I see through you, I`m the Guru
Now what you gonna do when I step to you
And when I pay you back I`ll be hurting you
This ain`t no threat so take it personal

Rap is an art you can`t own no loops
It`s how you hook em up and the rhyme style troop
So don`t even think you could say someone bit
Off your weak beat come on you need to quit
I flip lines and kick rhymes that never sound like yours
There oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows from in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the
Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can`t think as quick
So Premier drops a beat, for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper then take it personal

Don`t be mad cause I don`t come around the way
Like I used to, I don`t have time these days
I`m keeping busy making power moves
Don`t try to say I don`t remember you
You shouldn`t let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by, cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don`t even know
You`re like a daytime talk show, and that`s low
So you can tell everyone, that I`m jerking you
And if you don`t like it kid, take it personal",Take It Personal,1992
Gang Starr,"Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

Take two and pass so we can all get blunted
Don't smoke ciggarettes so my growth ain't stunted
We got at least five head so I rolled a white owl
It's the break of dawn and we're awake like night owls
Phillies are cool but they burn much quicker...
Hey yo come on pass that shit nigga
We lounge to the sounds as we leave from uptown
It's time to go downtown and make some more rounds
This city never sleeps that what sinatra sang
For that fat fat blunt you know I got this thing
So hand it over cause I want to get charred
I'm in love with mary jane she keeps me large
So don't hog it let's get it moving real fast
Everybody just chill and take like two pulls and pass

Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

The club is crowded everyone's up in here
Heyo premier what's that you got there?
It looks like a nice plump blunt in your hand
I just know you're gonna share it with me cause I'm your man
So bust it, I got one too and if you spark up yours
I'll light up mine when it's through
Oh shit, there goes my man the fat mack
We used to get blazed I know he's got a fat sack
Let's go upstairs grab a chair and unwind
So the la la can enhance our minds
The system booming let the bass increase
I find me a seat so I can peep the chic
Ladies and maybe get my homeboys some ass
All you gotta do is take two pulls and pass

Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

Even in the morning like the flavor of juice
A blunt adds spice and a blunt can spruce
Up your day but I'm not advertising just telling
Of aspect a part of our lives
And around the way there ain't no shame in our game
Cause the fame is no thing we get together and hang
And since you know I got dash and class
Then I'm after you so take two pulls and pass",Take Two and Pass,1992
Gang Starr,"Strangely enough I've been struck
Affected by her smile
And yo, her style is worthwhile
And knowing that I'm deep like a river
I feel I should give her
Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished
It seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity
My boys they try schoolin' me
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine
This honey is so fine
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy
She mad like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said ""I know the stuff we had planned
But please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man""
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her
She said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things
And she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting
I said, ""Hey baby, please calm down
Cuz I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on?
You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?""
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm lovesick

Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning cuz I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out
So she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few
Some girls that I knew
Stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said ""Hey love, just wait for a second
And won't you just check it?
It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry
So listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed
About havin' trust?
What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey don't you turn your back like that
Come on, this is wack
You're heated up like a thermostat""
Then she stepped off in a whirlwind
And I don't know when
Or if I'm gonna see her again
I coulda sworn she was the right one to pick
But now man I'm just lovesick",Love Sick,1992

Too gold, too bold, too fly for them to stop
The man to respect 'cause I'm ripping up blocks
I gotta get the dough, gotta run the show
I'm flipping like a kilo, stash a million or so
Go for what you feel and deal wit this
'Cause I'm dangerous, I come real wit this
And packing and strapping, it goes along wit the rapping
By any means necessary, you can't get buried

And I've been out here and yes, I've seen you

Feelings of stone to the bone, I'm a rock
No regrets for doing shit I had to do
I was hard headed and yea, I still am too
But you know I got things under control
So you should slow your roll that's my advice to you bro
A street veteran, sometimes I'm trife as a juvenile
I'll beep your style, you can't fuck wit the golden child
That's why you're riffing but you know you're just ass kissing
You wanna meet'cha maker, I'm a take ya
Or else let the man command
'Cause I'll be ready to get you open, ain't no joking, I jam
So if you wanna know who's really boss
Then try your game, lamb, and end up taking a big loss
If  I don't get my way, you're history
To you, I'm a mystery, you never understand me

I came to get what's due to me 'cause I got clout
I make the moves, I'm never faking

The loot is for the taking

I'm sinister, I'm selling no wolf tickets here
Rolling correct to get my point across clear
Sights in the city make me bitter
And I ain't taking no shit from no sucker nigga
I move swift, always looking for the money to make
I need the cash flow, I got a lot at stake
And I could never go out like a crab
So shut the hell up and put the money in a big bag
Hand it over smooth like
I need fat dough, I got things to do tonight
I'm always on my job, ain't no time to be caught short
And those outta line, pay a fine or get knocked off
It's my turn to clock the duckets
Being broke, nah, I can't fuck wit it
I'm making moves, never faking

Gang Starr,"The music started in the hearts and drums, from another land
Played for everyone, by sons, of the motherland
Sendin out a message of peace, to everybody and
Came across the oceans in chains and shame
Easing the pain, and it was without name
Until some men in New Orleans on Rampart Street
Put out the sounds, and then they gave it a beat
I`m talkin' 'bout Jelly Roll, King, and Satch
I`m talkin' 'bout the music that had no match
Yes the music, and it was born down there
We`re gonna use it, so make the horn sound clear
It`s jazz music...jazz music

Yo, the music that Pops, and other cats made
It stayed, cause people love when they played
To the North, it took a riverboat shuffle
To the big cities, with lots of hustle and bustle
To Chicago, and to the Apple too
This was a scene, that our forefathers knew
Go get your crew, I know they`ll get into
The jazz music... jazz music

The music called jazz had the razzamatazz
It had the flavor, and a lot of pizazz
The big band beat was very neat and unique
The swing was king, it made you tap your feet
There was Benny and Duke and of course the Count Basie
The melody was smooth and yes, very taste
There was Hap, The Prez, and Lady Day and
Dizzy Bird and Miles, they were all playin'
They brought it to the people of the foreign lands
Back across the oceans and the desert sands
Where it echoes in the distant sounds of drums
And it rises with the sun on days begun
This is the music, that we give tribute to
They gave it to us, that`s why we give it to you
The jazz music, the jazz music

I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot

No way, bullshit
I told ya before we come back wit more hits

Give a nigga pain, like displasure
But close your hips in, nigga you can't win
I walk around, with a scowl and a grin
Parties try to rock me, chicks try to clock me
Niggaz try to block me, but they can't stop me
I'm a bad man, understand where I come from
Treatin niggaz dumb, as I drink my rum
I'm a mad man, I get respect with the Tec
Put punks in check, Shug's on the set
I'm the one with the game, the twelve round
CRACK to the concrete, from the underground
I'm a bad nigga, how do you figure to take me
You cannot break me, so don't mistake me
for your brother, I'm not a punk motherfucker see
I did my time, and now I'm FREE
I'm a dope one, ready to rip and wreck shop
I will not stop, I won't be dropped by the cops
I'm bad, understand me with the game I kick
I got crazy bitches like a Trojan on my dick

Yo Hobb we got more rep than Lucky Luciano
Suckers we wet to the sound of the dope piano
This is something you can't handle, here's one example
I got your head as a trophy up on the mantle
Each and every sect we wreck, the crowd's electrified
Mystified, you get dissed, when you try, you die
Fish niggaz, they get fried upon my skillet
I kill it, fuck it, my shit is on hit
and hittin you blaow (BLAOW) so what you wanna do now?
You stepped up, I whacked ya, you crept up, I smacked ya
Got infinite length, with the strength of a real master
If you don't bow down now you'll get plowed down now
You know, like POW

Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die

Word to Mike Tyson, hit you quick like lightnin
Swing my left jab first, and then come in with the right
Cold deck ya, nah I could never respect a
punk like you, you get dropped like one two
and you're out son, just like a one round bout son
The outcome, is that you'll get that ass hung
Easily, swiftly, you'ew stupid you can't get with me

Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die 
Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die 
I said Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die

Fumin!  HEAHHH, I'm boomin down on niggaz

They don't know, so I don't never give em a clue
That's you and you and you, and oh yeah you
You can't get with this or take me down
I'm always laughin HA HA cause you punks are clowns
Since I'm passin emcees, with my skill
I'm up on the hill, and I force them dudes to chill
Rippin up shit as I do, because I'm violent
That's why when I walk in the room, punks are silent
My name is Shug, as if you didn't know
I'm pimpin hard, and punks are just a hoe

Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die 
Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die 
I said you Fuck Around, Lay Around, do or die

Yea yea that's Shug for ninety-three

Showin motherfuckers where we're truly at

Gang Starr,"No way you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I break kids
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfuckin posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills nag you can't compare me
And no we don't make wack tracks
and all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin real facts
I represent set up shit like a tent boy
You're paranoid cause you're my son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

Oh yes I'm greater than all MC's when I breeeze give me room please
I be like fascinatin when I be updatin
Cuttin off wack kids, pullin their trump cards
I thump hard, and mak eem say that I'm God
Niggaz be pretendin they hardcore
Never know the meaning of [real hardcore]
But I get props like a slogan and no man
Could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
No double checking vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to I go all out with no mic
Yeah that's right cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
Cause suckers be like playin themselves to have mass appeal

I know I'm dope but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks but now I'm makin greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop
of pure bomb, just like the seashore I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond I go on and on
For you it's tragic I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I betcha
Those who kick dirt and do time I'm gonna get cha
Cause I be kickin the real

You'll never have the skills like mine
I write the ill type rhymes
Now I'm reaching my prime
360 dunk in your face
You can't compete, you're just a basket case
Let's separate the men from the boys
And put your money where your mouth is
No time for toys
Your game is weak, get it, so don't sleep
'cause I'll be checking and wrecking ya
When I start to creep
Through the backdoor
I know I caught you out there
You got no clout here
And I doubt there
Is anyway that you can stop the beat down
You better play the background
And sit back down
Chumps like you, I gotta keep'em in line
So prepare to suffer boy, 'cause now you're mine

I'll fake you left and go right
Straight down the lane
Here's one in your eye
You feel pain, you strain
To put together some strategy
But you're raggedy, and I'll be glad to see
The frown on your grill when i drill and thrill
Set out my offense, commence to kill
I'll be leading from beginning to end
And after I guard ya
You're gonna want to make friends
And make amends for the silly trash you were talking
Take a walk and your shots I'm swatting
With ease, and the ladies are swooning
Clocking my swiftness, why you drooling?
You ought ta practice up and get your game with mine
I been waiting to guard you, and now you're mine

Hurry up, sucker
Go ahead and pick your squad
Try to play hard, but I'ma rob
You of your crazy notions to defeat me
Your weak see
I rock all courts
And even get down to give you a rematch
After I wax and tax that butt
When I slam the alley oop
You can rally troops
But I play the awesome defense
I'll pick your pocket
And send you to the bench
With tears in your eyes as you realize
The prize is for me
Yes all the money
Son, my flow is too nice
My handle's precise
I'll fake you right and go left

Gang Starr,"Boom bash dash, I had to break, I had to getaway
Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a Monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So I'ma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move Troop
But I ain't even tryin to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So fuck the bullshit I'm audi
I'm on a mission, cause if I stay I'll go crazy
I'm gonna make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
They never fake it just slam it
Out in B-R-O-O-K-Lyn, The Planet

Crash boom bang I used to hang at Four Corners
And all the spots in Beantown where niggaz carry burners
But I was more turned on by the micraphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin blunts on ?
Or workin in a mail room Uptown, feelin sick and
tired, of payin all these fucked up dues
I wasn't tryin to lose -- I refused
Had a chick Uptown, one in Queens and one in Jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East New York is no joke kid
And peace to my man Hass doin his bad
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
and like the sayin goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But fuckit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin
See I'ma make it god damnit
Out in B-R-double-O-K-Lyn, The Planet
I'll never fake it just slam it

And you can, walk the walk talk the talk but don't flaunt
Cause little shorty's scheamin on your rings and fronts
but don't sweat it, cause that's the life out here
A lot of niggaz, be livin real trife out here
I got my own place in Bed-Stuy
Known to many others, as Do or Die
Malcolm X Boulevard and Gates Avenue
Smokin up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to Fort Greene
on Myrtle Ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go Uptown
and check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with Tommy, Hill and Gunsmoke
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night
But I'ma be aight still
Cause I'ma keep writin shit and perfectin my skills
I'm gonna make it god damnit

But now like chicks they all be up on me
and me so horny, I hit em like a groupie
Snatch off my hat wash my dick and keep it movin
Showing and proving on a day to day basis
I rip New York and a million different places
State to state country to country
My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out

Yo you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Flavors do get deep when you're walking the east
A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it til the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that?  Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet i just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it

Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
and all the honies be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa fuck your girl and I'll drop her
cause she be working on my nerves
and yo I got more gang than the bitch got curves
I'm like gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
and I know, I break your back with my rap like smack
because I'm all that

Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
or we'll start the wettin up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia

Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools

They wantin to shut us down but the home team's here
What? You act like you're sweet or something
This ain't no Desert Storm bullshit war, we all dumpin

Wit six clips of teflon, suited in camoflagued
Got kevlar helmets wit masses
Wearin mob gear in cause they try to infumigate us wit gases

First Family will gradually, lift that ass up like gravity
And turn your body frame into a cavity

Sparkin wit the same marksman
Known for gunnin and runnin and bombin 
Wit the lyrics squeeze of my gun barkin, YA HEARD!!

""So what you gonna do since you know now""
""There's a war goin on outside"" ""It's impossible to stop"" 

This world's a twisted maze, but I got the swiftest blades
My swords they can slice and dice precise ways
Those who come against me, can get blazed, sprayed and laid
No trace, just a glimpse of my face, hittin the shade
You look up, there's a full moon in the sky
And all my would-be enemies, yeah they're soon to die
Livin in this warzone, we frequent fly at home
Many of us grow violent prone, ain't tryin to be dyin alone
So I'ma take the competition wit me, Lord forgive me
But a whole bunch, of blood-suckin punks, is out to get me
In a flash of a moment, I slash vital components
Tryin to scheme on me and my team bitch, you know we own this
We can scrap, wit guns, knives, chains and bats
Whatever baby, erase that ass quick fast off the map
Plus they better bring, medical attention after I swing my weapon
Won't be no recovery, no divine intervention
No prevention, from gettin hung in the streets where I'm from
'Nuff blood shed, this war's just begun

Hands off, lay em down NOW

When I'm bringin the storm, I'm all in
Yes I done stepped in the chest of many men
THEN AGAIN, it's a part of my persona like puff stumps and marijuana
IIAAAH, scratch em out,  FIRE
From all angles, that's how we was trained
Either slay or be slain, it's in the game for my soul
To be as cold as the blood in my vein
Knowin my name, help niggas perform abnorm

Just keep in mind I'm a marksman, I'm sensitive about that there
So you better watch what you say to me, hear?
PLAY WIT EM fierce, know where to run
So I post and defend, forgive me Father I may sin
And thou shall remember the code of the street

Word to grimy niggas, they want to stick up the place
Word to hiphop, plus a crib that's laced

Yet, still, I be at the around-the-way spots
Near where niggas be slinging innocent get hit by straight shots
And brave cops, protect the community

While corrupt cops, be harassing you and me
Pullin me over, in front of the crib, in front of my neighbors
Askin for favors, here's a cassette and why you 
Question my behavior?

Dumped off my first clip at a house party

But fuck the parties, my nigga, I lost a brother there
Only if I'm gettin paid (That's right)

I self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
with a force that can't be compared
to any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwake, causes vessels to circulate
like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
and watch another C-Cypher pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words; it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine, over the frontline
The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred -- triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds

And to expand from the days of goin hand to hand

and turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
Release a fistful, of rhymes for the fiscal year

They stuck with the tear, for fear they foresake a brother's love

Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him doe
and taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle,fam and all that

he took him to Meadowlands racetrack

So now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleedin
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back

You totin in jeans, don't even know the true envy
The man I'm pickin apart, and plus they both were friends to me
Past trivial pursuits like East and West coast feuds
Come against me on the mic, many and most will lose
Like most dudes, I love this hip-hop, and this rap stuff
But I don't like the shows, where the ignorant act up
While some'll be rippin it, they be in the crowd wildin
Flippin on kids, for the chains and medallions
Or the kid they don't like, from a beef from way back
And decide that's the night, perfect time for payback
It's wack for the group, plus the others who came
to see a fat ass show, instead there's bullets aflame

While they devise our demise, we grow wise
Upset the set up, the element of surprise
IT'Z A SET UP
It's time to upset the set up

Still waters run deep this is leagues in depth
Quiet as kept they slept we crept
Society puts the squeeze on MC's like iron grips of death
From here on in peace and blessings long cherish your breath
Gifted and Rhyme you now how we do, stay true
Follow through lay down the law, cause it's probable and overdue
All systems overdue, my guns know me
I only hold a few my nigga for only a few hold me
Never forget the ones before me, my momma told me
sacrifice for the ones behind me leadin the seeds
Blind leads, black on black, crime to me
Inclined to refine my creed I eat thinkin lead
Conceive to make the beast bleed, enhance thoughts
like tossed trees 'cross the Earth three-fourths
Let my offspring feed all three, corpus delectis cost me
Lost and found on enemy ground, quoted although
they don't know how we get down at sound speed we breed
Mo more confined to blind greed and self destructive deeds
Heed my freedom war cry, of course I'm N.Y.
Hug my peeps that died, the loved ones alive
Reinforce and fly high as I lie so shall I
from New I to Cali next plateau U.N.I.versal
Unleash the black rain
Show em who in control, electro-magnetic
pull on the hole, ill as toters bang out
Til we sittin on swole the strongest way to grow

Gang Starr,"Yo 
Yo Premier? 
Yeah whassup G? 
That trip to L.A.  may be delayed 
Why whassup I'm on my way to the airport now 
Yeah well your boy Guru got knocked 
What? 
I don't know what this is about  sounds crazy man 
Somethin' about a gun 
""The court calls Keith Elam to the stand. 
Please approach the bench."" 

Yo they got me handcuffed  I'm down in central booking 
Things are fucked up  the way my future's looking 
But I'm too fly, I'ma change this scenario 
Make some power moves and tighten up my bankroll 
Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat 
I'm like the black Dutch Schultz when you get me upset 
Five-oh makes me want to flip, Larry Davis style 
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaitin' trial 
It's OK though, cause from grey skies comes blue 
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the Guru 
And this I certify we all should be alerted by 
the traps within the system, our youth is gettin' murdered by 
the D.A. says they got me on a felony 
I'm tryin' to live my life, so what the fuck is you tellin' me? 
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for 
And I take the weight as I did before 
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio 
A rapper arrested, suckers showin' me on video 
Of course I know, that I'm a role model 
But yo this rap life is real life sometimes it's full throttle 
Right now I gotta think about me fuck the industry 
You gets no love, except those who support me 
What's the story, what happened when I went to L.A.? 
Mixin' shit up, no not there I got family 
Nothin' happened, mind your business yo step 
You know we connect, JFK 2 LAX 

They want to lock us all up, and throw away the key 
Don't want to see us come up, don't want to see us makin' G's 
Long as we know this is the key to our destruction 
Let's make moves no discussion 

Peace to my man Hass, and Orange Man payin the cost 
All the twenty-five to lifers all my brothers gettin' tossed 
into the system, supposed to rehabilitate 
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate 
Read, study lessons and build your inner power 
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards 
For example, I know this rich Nigerian 
Powerful American that's proud to be an African 
He asked me why do all us brothers be gettin' trapped 
I told him I'd explain it broke it down in a rap 
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair 
Without esteem for yourself nigga, you goin' nowhere 
And you can swagger like you rule this; Josey Wales 
unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails 
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers 
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more 
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best 
Our rhyme as live as it gets, JFK 2 LAX 
They're always makin' trouble yo, against the righteous 
Killin' us in cold blood, those beats those vipers 
And as I sit feelin' the pain in my wrist 
I vow to myself that I'ma change this shit 
Or at least I gotta try, or part of me will die 
And only by action will any ideas solidify 
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder 
This grown man will make mistakes no longer 
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim 
to their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em 
And so I rip facts to dope tracks I caress 
You're gonna hear about it, from JFK 2 LAX",JFK 2 LAX,1998
Gang Starr,"First and foremost, some rappers are sweet like fructose
When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven, twenty-one, eighteen, twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone
Straight out the late nights of Bed-Stuy
Steppin' up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial, like saccarhin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lackin' in
Concepts you bite, 'cause your identity ain't tight
Tryin' to be somethin' you're not, like pullin' a knife at a gunfight
I'm troopin' on night air, like flight number 1-0-6,
And gettin' all up in your fuckin' mix
You get me upset, and I got you uptight
'Cause my committee's in your city tonight, a'ight?
We got seventeen million of us, plus two million Indians
That makes nineteen mil, lightin' shit up, like Wild Bill
I be the supreme father, plus the ill kid, with drama
My karma, creates the teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit, before you walk to me, or talk to me
Steppin' to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearin' tracks out the frame
You know my fuckin' name, I rule all game
I'm universal, on all planes, what's your claim?

Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous tropper, verbal nigga, with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer, then I blast ya
Slice precise, like Benihanas, when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the God
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep, in my backyard,
I laugh hard, while your mental, I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror, to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks want to enter this rap scene
Kickin' Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion; the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief, plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fuckin' barber
So what, you made some dough, you best keep on scramblin'
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handlin'
Demandin' that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday

I see myself as the black Rap Messiah
Colossal, spreadin' my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom, Dick, and Jerry, slippin' like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Somethin' ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love but few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal, like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut, I got to stay Noyd-ed
'Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black, talkin' 'bout how much his Mac spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes bein' made
No wack shit bein' played, no fake macks gettin' paid
No Versace MC's, with a mouth full of Mo'
Soundin' like a ho, spittin' that old-fashioned show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap, through a Maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Goin' deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with interpretive robe and sandals, like Moses
Travellin' high sands and Eastern lands, for the answers
Ignorance is spreadin' through the streets, like it was cancer
Too many drinkin' not thinkin', when behind that trigger
A thirty-eight escalate the murder rate, for us niggaz
It's like, microphone roulette, 'cause nowadays MC's is gettin' wet
Over someone else's fake gangsta rep",Make 'Em Pay,1998

Yo what the deal cousin, gave him a pound now we huggin
In the mall thugging, bugging, spent a few hundred
Shorties must be loving, shit, jigg to my Wallow's
They watch like Movado so I floss like I'm lotto
You ain't lounging, til you've been counting by the thousands
Profiling, pushing more weight than your medallion
We be wilding, locking blocks down just like the Island
Dough piling, we keeps it in the family like Italians
Balling, cop some Charles Jordan and some icebergs
Ice herbs, nice curves, girlfriend with the white fur
Pushed up, feel her like some shots of Tequila
Said her man's a dealer, with all these bags from Antilla
He got to be, but you hot to me, you under lock and key?
Laid it down properly, this cat at Stern's watching me
Moved on me sloppily, prepare for the fallout
With gats to blow the wall out, clear the mall out

Yo, don't be mad at me, I used to be
King Raggedy, fiends nagging me, shit I had to breathe
Gradually, rocked casually, Sha passed the leave
Vaseline slick shit, green stick shit
Honey got some mean lipstick, my knot's this thick
And I cop the meanest shit, still ride DISCUS
But cops frisk us, the block whispers
Theft need to stop, how we cop
But you can Guess like them jeans you rock
For now I'm rolling right, cause I had four faces
Fighting four cases in ?North face? of Dolomite
So if he's here I ace the toners out my holding tight
Shorty looking innocent there, in Benetton gear
Nothing innocent here, this henneson gear
Give us a year, to really see clear, through these Cartiers
And do it party yea is what I'll probably hear
Sharkskin is what I'll probably wear, designed by Pierre, trust me
And look lovely with it
Cop a 4.2 and get ugly with it, snugly fitted, ruggedly hitting
Fitted in my Coogi knitted, compliments on the doobie did it
Got the movie rented if the crew be with it yo

Make money money, go shopping!
Take money money, go shopping!
No matter what the weather, winter spring or fall
We'll be doin it, ""at the mall""

Most times I'm casual, but easily I switch
To some fly shit, like some silk suits by Paul Smith
And purchase some kicks by Kenneth Cole
Cop a Hilfiger, or Polo goose, for when it's cold
Armani, and Gaultier specs cover my eyes
The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
At the mall, I'm bagging up, much more than gear
Victoria, be whispering mad Secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy, I see em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent, the fresh scent is ?seemiyaka?
All the way from Green Acre's to the Beverly Center
Heads turn, and I'm the main concern when I enter
At Albee Square, niggas wouldn't even dare
With that fake thuggish ruggish when them Brooklyn kids be in there
Saw newriqi L and then a sweet for my girl
Styling, on the cell phone smilin, it's my world
Can't forget the Avorex, pocket for the royalty checks
My crew be showing loyalty, plus utmost respect
Yo son, go pioneer them bimbos, while I get some Timbo's
Later on that night you'll find them nymphos

""It's the real... it's the (militia)""

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
or we'll start the wettin up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel

Gang Starr,"No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth baby

They say it's lonely at the top, in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

The same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up, nigga peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although mc's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize, what I have done up to this point
So I'mma get more guys, to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate, or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shining, some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks, will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
Cause they love it, to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is coming to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth

Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

Sometimes you gotta dig deep, when problems come near
Don't fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen, to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin, is mad amazin
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin in my bedroom pacin
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin
Suicide? nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinking, or even gettin high
Cause all that's gonna do really, is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit, before
So I oughta be able, to withstand some more
But I'm sweating though, my eyes are turning red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife, and take the bullets out my nine
My only crime, was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect, that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, remembering the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth

""You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!""

Yo I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one, is pointed at your weak ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger, on these fully loaded lines
You're gonna wish I woulda pulled a black nine, I mack dimes
Crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin triflin niggas, and the studio pranksters
Yo lookin at the situation plainly: will you remain g?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator, with the greater data
Revolvin on the tascam much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle, tricky metaphors
I explore more, to expose the core
A lot of emcees, act stupid to me
And we have yet to see, if they can match our longevity
But anyway it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Styles, smooth but rugged -- you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin your hideout, blockin out your sunlight
Your image and your business, were truly not done right
Throw up your he-allah-i now, divine saviors
You got no hand skills there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop, to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
Cause you must meet your moment of truth

You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth",Moment of Truth,1998

Yo, whassup, son?
Yo, man, you know what I mean? I need this money, man
Get up, out in these, in these streets, man
Yo, so what's the deal, god?
I'm sayin', what you need though?
Yo, let me have like, two or three, three g's, man
I'm sayin', I'm sayin' son, man
You know what happened last time, though?
I gotta do what I gotta do, man.  I gotta eat, man
Whassup man? Oh, your baby momma stressin' you?
Way past the days of the deuce, me and you stays a crew
Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight, from Crenshaw to Castlegate
Like Pete and C.L., I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York, and all the ways
For certain niggaz to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
'Cause some nights I got so wild, yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't tryin' to hear it, 'cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga, Havoc, said, sometimes you gott
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
'Cause no matter the weather, niggaz be needin' cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond, to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man, Baby Pop, you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you
You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked
Doin' your thing, sewin' shit up on the block?
You need to stop, 'fore you get caught, again
Or you get shot, and I lose another friend
""Any man with the plan, is precise with his life
Think twice""
My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lightin' a fuse, whether it's sneakers or shoes
'Cause somebody always want to step up, to start a feud
It's like settin' it off, but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women, forget floozies and the groupies
'Cause they spell mad problems, from Watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop, 'long as the world's revolvin'
And I recall when niggaz knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry-ass was gettin' kicked out
And they was seein' if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple, and double, with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear 'em in my heart, like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin' dope, coke, or dust
It's killin us; let's take our people, and make a exodus
Annhilation, inhilation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams, and drug schemes of mad cream

Calm down, listen to a brother who knows
Cause the rappers out here come up with mad different types of flows
Switch-up, change-up, yo pull the range up
So we can build on this shit, for real that's how we came up
Used to ride the subway trains back and forth
Now I push an E-Class, four-two-zero of course
Still material gains, make one more aware
Of all the madness and the civil unrest that's out here
I doubt there, is anyplace more complex
You can get lost in the sauce, New York'll have you vexed
Who's next to get served, herbs'll get knocked off
Burning flammable rappers, is how I get my rocks off
I pop your top off as if you were the bottle

But the competition keeps me on point
That's why I lamp in the studio composin fresh new joints
From the streets, Medina, Manhattan, Staten, P-Lawn
The struggle continues, everybody wants to be on
The rat race, makes this lifestyle fast paced
I've loved it since the days of fat shoelace
Screwface me all you want, but I'm used to it
I'll never give up rep in New York, I'm true to it
From forty-deuce to Queens, back to East New Yi
We takin no shorts, and plus we showin no pity
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York, we get the money all day everyday

You get bent up, sent up creek, without a paddle
You want to battle? Well I live in New York
So think twice blink twice now your Roley and Lincoln's gone
Don't come into this rap game if you don't belong
You won't be on but for a minute anyway
You're just a scavenger, you don't live this life everyday
Rap is regional, so you can check the demographics
Everybody represent where they live, cause shit is drastic
Confusion, while I'm givin rappers contusions
And people don't realize that real hip-hop is losing
They want to shut us down, and I say, ""Shut up clown!""
Cause New York is too corrupt and too tough to lay down
And just quit, cause MC's out here kick serious lyrics
And I come to you, with my infinite spirit
Not takin nothin from your hood or your set
But GangStarr could be a threat, in New York we rep
That's where it comes from, that's why you're feelin it
So why suppress it, I'd rather be revealin it
Bright lights, big city and dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday

Gang Starr,"Word is bond, these cats been on the mic fantasizing a LOT
So called MC's, wannabe rappers and all that, whatever
You get your knot rocked kid, yo

You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time

So just perhaps, you wanna challenge my style of rap
Talkin bout you bust caps, we know that's just a pile of crap
The underground is where I dwell at
It's where I find my heaven, and where you find your hell at
You're in my clutches now, you get slit up and lit up
just like some Dutches now, see I'm hard to define
My mind travels far, from ghettoes to galaxies
representin GangStarr -- The street life
The reason why my mic ignites, I bring more ruckus
than a nightclub fight, or bar brawl
I'm swingin lyrics like broken glass palm to skull y'all
Hold your head, cause all that weak shit is dead
See the times are changin, and me and my peeps is gettin crazy fed
So remember when you writing your rhymes
Stop fantasizing, and bring some real shit next time
Yeah, bring some real shit, yo

You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time

Yo, I do what I have to do to master you and capture you
Until you recognize, what my rapture can do
You thought I wouldn't step up, to keep my rep up
I ain't them other kids, I don't need to play no catchup
I got too much pride for this, I know some niggaz
that'll ride for this, with me it's do or die for this
Street knowledge, intellect and spirituality
My survival package, as I deal with reality
I'm like Fishburne in Hoodlum when I come to do em
Chew em up, spit em out, the most respected no doubt
You seen me in action so act you been knowin
The G-U-R-U, of the Gang, I've been flowing
just like the river Niger all the way to the Hudson
Had so many lyrics stashed, and I couldn't wait to bust some
Lately, I've watched this game evolve and elevate
So now I push my music like drug dealers push weight
Straight like that, straight out the gate
Cause it's never too late, to set this fuckin record straight
But it is too late, for you and your crew son
You had the audacity to come against me, the gifted one?
And Primo with the tracks, to inspire my next line
You've got no wins here, so better luck next time

Yeah yeah
Better luck next time

Gang Starr,"You do your first bid and dirt to get your name known
You never talk too much to get your spot blown
Now you`re no longer just a face in the crowd
You`re gettin so much respect that niggaz might as well bow
And movin up with your hustle like you planned it
Rakin dough like the world`s greatest bandit
Always got one eye open, for the stick-up kids postin
So much cream chumps they can`t understand it
Ladies flock to your jock like it`s golden
Curious, to test the weight you be holdin
but you ain`t got no time, to be chasin felines
If she`s the chick that you pick then she gets chosen
People treat you like you`re ghetto royalty
And all your staff shows you utmost loyalty
You paid your dues, refuse to lose in this scenario
The rep grows bigga, you`re a legend and a hero

Your fame has gotten larger than your life
You`ve got a harem of bitches and killer niggaz that`s hype
They got your back, but you so fly you don`t need em
You shit what you`re eatin so you don`t peep the proceedings
They start schemeing, feeling that you`re too swollen
and that`s the reason why your cash and stash gets stolen
You start perspiring, because you`re paranoid
Still another confrontation that you couldn`t avoid
Prepare for drama, as if you were a stunt man
Back in the days you was a forty and a blunt man
Today you`re a Willie, now the weather`s too chilly
New York City ain`t the place to be frontin
Over your shoulders day and night`s where you look
Your so-called fam ran a scam, and you got shook
Go back to square one, better go talk to your son
See reps grow bigga in the life of a crook

Years ago, we were new jacks to this scene
Showed some effort, made fat records, but still saw no green
Know what I mean? They tried to stifle us
Nigga you could not believe how really ill and trife it was
Fed up so we headed on a serious mission
Wishin, that we could better our position
Two businessmen, Guru and Prim`, we enterprised
Too strong to be stepped on, creatively wise
The dedicated ministers of underground sound
When we`re doin our thing, you know we don`t fuck around
No matter how bizarre and different you think you are
your team wouldn`t dream of competeing with GangStarr
Premier in the rear with the beats and cuts
And Guru with the mic ready to tear shit up
Take us out the game nigga? How you figure?

Bout to make some dead presidents, macking a million G
The money though, it's got people actin funny yo

Or you be puffing lye, out in the back hallway
Or whether you being schooled, or in the library

After work she greets me, and treats me like royalty
Works with me, giving herself, by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame, or my ride
A lot of ladies out there, be lookin lovely
But they don't got no control of the their life, inside they're ugly

K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breaking hearts
While we're takin part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me

Yo, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it

She knows what she wants
Yeah, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it

She knows what she wants, she's bold so she flaunts
Her hourglass jewels to mad clientele
Rejected oh well, she ain't goin to no hotel
Not the frantic freak type, but if you speak right
You get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
Weekends, she wants to spend your ends
Her shopping spree is colossal, attitude semi-hostile
Mack diva senorita, no reefer, no pizza, just
Shrimp and lobsters, champagne and mobsters
Suckin up the cream like a vac to a carpet
Strictly black market now you're her next target
Watch out, cause yo she knows what she wants

Yo, she knows what she wants
She knows what she wants and just how to get it

Her looks are a lullaby, to pass us by, she's too fly
Never gunshy, hair is blown dry
She craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify
So when you say, ""Yo baby,"" she ain't gotta say hi to ya
Cause prior to this, he put rocks on her neck and wrist
Plus a fat joint on her finger
You best to have a batch of scratch and treats to bring her
And if you happen to luck up and get in
You'll find yourself another jealous trick-ass boyfriend
And furthermore the mink she's donning is stunning

Two: She said she didn't like my crew
Three: She never ever cooked for me
Four: She was my cheri amore -- YEAH RIGHT
It was all hype, I needed more insight
In retrospect, I know I slept from the first night
She did a split and that was it
Gave up my pimp license, and flipped my whole friggin script
But now I'm back like the Isley's moving wisely
Sizing up the situation, keeping honies waiting
Cause I got more to do, than to be sucked dry

Some people go to places where they don't belong
Whether wrong or right, a lot of people fight
But I'm here to bless this mic, aight?

I take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
I'm type crashin', down like a meteorite
I'm Bogart-ing, mics and whole stages
Destroying MC's dreams, from words to whole pages
Their rapbooks, look more like scrapbooks
With their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin'
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin'
There's been mad signs, for this brother to heed
And while some choose greed, I choose to plant seeds
For your mental, spirit and physical temple
Bob your head to it, there's the water you've been lead to it
Bathe in it, a long time you've been cravin' it
Prance to it, use your third eye and glance through it
Your state of being, becoming advanced through it
While others rhyme with no reason I be breezin
Their mics I seize them, then I try em for treason
I used to always like to hang out
Now I lounge in the rest writin' bombs while tracks bang out
I know you peeped me in the club then
But now I'm in your speaker, with the voice that you're lovin'

It's the message in the song that makes you rock on
Some people go to places where they don't belong
Whether wrong or right, a lot of people fight
But I'm here to bless this mic, aight?

Peace to the young ladies, who wanna bone me much
And peace to my nigga Premier, with the golden touch
I never fall off point, like DeNiro in Casino
Peace to Black Gambinos and all my peoples
Dig the steelo I'm fightin' wars you know
As in the Jihad, most humble, most merciful
That's because I be God, I trog through fogs, puffing logs
MC's muttering menial madness, they get mobbed
Scarred and barred, and then, banished from my fuckin' kingdom
You got a fly one bring one, or else I come to fling some
Exquisite exotic exciting type shit
Enough to make the real heads wake up and get hype quick
I'm type slick, known as the God Universal
Kick rhymes without rehearsal, I cross the burnin' sands
Now I stand here with virtue, of course I could hurt you
Simply with my point of view, and I knew
That many would come, that's why I've chosen
To cut off pathways, and there's no runways or doorways open
For the jokers who ain't focused
And all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
Nothing's blurry, fuck it I got no worries
Hearts and minds, shine bright light with insight
Yeah sense my birthright to set up cyphers with power
Cause mad shit ain't right, like punks in the spotlight

Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whup ass
Droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics

searching for false lift, I'm here with the skills you've missed

I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade

Some MC's are into stickiness
But I'm sayin' this, from experience, I'm furious
I didn't get this far overnight, and there's nothin' like
The real thing, the real swing right? (real swing right?)
(""On and on..."") I'm takin' things that are true
So won't you give the credit y'all where it is due

[Guru]
So yo I'm fed, cause people like to talk too much
They're misled, and yo they like to squawk too much
But let me tell you baby you can't front on this
Twenty-for track mix, with the deep-ass kick
The objective, is to surely demolish
The chances of the wack takin' all the dollars
Support the brothers who are truly gifted
This way, the odds, could never be shifted
Like my man, you know he works real hard
He's good at what he does and now he lives real large
So why envy him, or anyone in his crew
Just sit back and give the credit y'all where it is due
Give the credit... Where it's due
Give the credit y'all... where it is due
Give the credit... where it's due
Just give the credit y'all... where it is due",Credit Is Due,1999

Yo.. just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
Just because I'm whylin don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby, and I use it a lot
People, here's somethin that you should be considerin
Things could turn bitter when, you don't use discipline
You might wake up the next day, upset and in fear
Buggin out, yappin bout, ""How the fuck did I get here?
Who the hell is this stranger, starin all in my face?""
Now you wishin you hadn't positioned yourself, in that place
Think just in case you shoulda took more precaution
A good time can become a nightmare so often
Like this nigga I know, that met these chicks on tour
They rocked him to sleep, robbed his ass for cash galore
Skated off in the night, without a trace or a hint
Scheamin tantalizin him, dressed up in lace and shit
Caught that kid out there, all high and dumbfounded
Made him think he was gettin some pussy
He just knew he was gonna pound it
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Baby won't you take the time (take the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Tycoon thug, he made a ten thousand dollar investment
Now he's not to be messed with, makes the girls get undressed quick
He's on some big muscled chest shit, posted by the exit
That's my man, he's the owner, yeah he be on some next shit
Said we'll make a few million by the next millenium
Told me to keep droppin jewels like a triggerman, puttin lead in him
Like Flavor said, I tell these hoes to, kill the noise
You know your Pops told you, watch them New York boys
All night, the ladies be like up in my mug
Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug
Fly honies, they hold me down like always
The same cat that used to get blunted down in the hallways
I love the cutie pies, never the zootie pies
I got discipline, I want the crew to rise
Situations like this'll make you think twice
Instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Baby won't you take the time (uh-huh)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Ladies, here's somethin that we should be considerin
Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline
Imaginin yourself livin lavish and plush
Hangin with the cat who be spendin cabbage and buyin stuff
However, don't be too clever with your endeavor
And don't let too many men, receive your treasure
Most cats, be thinkin with they bozack
I admit in the past I was tryin to break these hoes backs
Escape, without givin up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin time
Coppin me some Timberland with a jacket to match it
Girls nowadays wanna pigeon for chickenscratch
And I ain't givin up nathan
long as my game expands, it's my discipline to hate 'em
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
And just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good, it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
And just because I'm whylin, don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby whether you do or not

Baby won't you take the time (the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right

Fresh out the gate again, time to raise the stakes again
Fatten my plate again, y'all cats know we always play to win
G-A-N-G to the Starr son
Haters took this shit too far son
So that's all for you, I'm wiping out your whole team
I'll splatter your dreams with lyrics to shatter your schemes
The badder you seem, the more lies you tell
The more lies you sell, and by surprise you fell
Into my deathtrap, right into my clutches
Stupid, you know the God must bless every single mic he touches
I've suffered, just so I could return harder
Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr
I make ya famous, turn around and make ya nameless
Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is
Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one
Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one

So if you stand in my way, I'm gonna have to spray
Learn that if you come against me son you're gonna have to pray
Since back in the day I held the weight and kept my head up
They wanna see the God catch an L it's all a set up
I give no man or thing power over me
Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour, over me?
I'm bolder G, I'm like impossible to stop
I'm like that nigga in the ring with you, impossible to drop
I'm like two magazines fully loaded to your one
Plus I ain't gonna quit spitting til you're done
Plus, more than ever I got my whole shit together
More than a decade of hits that'll live forever
Catching rep off my name, you're bound to fry
Know how many niggas that I know is down to die
We never fail, and we ain't never been frail
You niggas talk crime, but you scared of jail

Attacking like a slick Apache, lyrics are trigger happy
Blowing back your wig piece just for the way you're looking at me
Cock back, blaow, I hit you up right now
I don't know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow
Face the consequence of your childish nonsense
I could make your head explode just by my lyrical content
Get you in my scope and metaphorically snipe ya
I never liked ya, I gas that ass and then ignite ya
The flame thrower, make your peeps afraid to know ya
How many times I told ya, play your position small soldier
My heart is colder, makes me wanna resort to violence
Stop beating me in the head son, nah, I'm not buying it
I'm ready to blast, ready to surpass and harass
I'm ready to flip, yeah I'm ready to dip with all the cash
I hold my chrome steady, with a tight grip
So watch your dome already cause this one might hit",Full Clip,1999
Gang Starr,"So wassup?  You know we can't be havin that
Son there's rules you're supposed to go by, and this is my habitat
You say you're R-E-P-R-E, S-E-N-T-I-N-G
You're fronting boy, come against me
You're crazy soft while I come off with credibility
You're living in a fantasy world kid, you're killing me
I start to work out, you start to merk out
My shit be crazy raw, and out here, I got more clout
I'm right in your streets, like I'm Urban Outreach
I don't mean to preach but I'll impeach your phony form of speech
Rhyme perfection, injecting like the surgeon
While you be in the club posing, trickin always splurgin
Whatever you got, I'm gettin more
See you're insecure, and you can catch my verbal four-four
Now you're facing me, I'm your ultimate challenger
It's the Avenger, your fate is on my calender
Notice the spirit I posess is more than holy
I'm Gifted, Unlimited, ahh fuck the rest you know niggaz know me
My lines illuminate your whole spectrum
Crush your dome section, punks I wreck em, mics I bless em
I don't know why, MC's would want to test the man so fly
Master of self gaining wealth
Cause I'm a mastermind, I stack my rhymes
Just for the rainy day, and you can pour out your forty
for all the rappers I slay, I bring the bounty back
I got more game than the Mack, when I procees to feed the masses
I come right and exact, and all those null and voids
They shall be destroyed, so don't be stickin our your hand
Cause you ain't my fuckin homeboy
I celebrate after each duck I eliminate
This rap game they desecrate, I'm back to set it straight
I'm self-made and self-taught
You're style you bought, plus
I got the fundamentals handed down from my pops
Hobbes your mission, is worthless
Your style's mad nervous, let's strecth out all our lyrics
and let's see whose go the furthest, word cause
It's puzzling how trifling you be
You're faking making people think that you're a true MC
You best flee, because I've come with the science
I'm gonna melt down your lies and unmask your phony alliance
Extreme house winds, will bring electrical shockwaves
Knocking you out the box kid, is something I crave
You were gassed from the beginning so your bubble must bust
I've been laying in the cut, to tear your bitch ass up
So wassup?!",So Wassup?!,1999
Gang Starr,"That makes me know that, we we we we're doin
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus, and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
with the times, and everything y'know
And and so.. y'know
The rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated
but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

""The real... hip-hop""
""MCing, and DJing.. from your own mind, ya know?""
""I, I guess right now we should start the show""

Who's the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whup ass
Droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this; so many people
searching for false lift, I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez...

""You know my steez"" 
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""
""To the beat y'all""

The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
(""You know my steez"" --> Method Man) 
You know my steez...

""Let em know, do your thing y'all""   
""Keep it live""

On the microphone you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin to be fly, ridin high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn he flipped""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick -- why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's, pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond... you know my steez

Yo, you suckers is playin' a role
You niggaz is out of control
This world could swallow you whole
The evil could snatch your soul


Yo nigga put the gun away, or you get done away
If not today there'll be a bullet for you one day
The gun play used to be the forte
As a youth, bustin' shots off the roof for horseplay
But once you get a glimpse of the shots, flyin' at you
You think about the possibility of dying and that's true
You won't be stressin' the gun my son
You'll be askin' the Lord for a chance, just one
Trials and tribulations, critical situations
Read it in revelations, check the configuration
They poison our population no matter your occupation
No matter your congregation, this is a troubled nation

[Chorus x2] 

I've seen the worst of the worst, I've seen the best of the best
Seems like the weight of the world is ridin' on my chest
A universal pain, my soul has absorbed
Don't respect no phonies, don't pay attention to frauds
The Lord only knows the depths of my sorrow
And some don't follow because their brains are hollow
So swallow these words and observe the signs
Yo turbulent times, are disturbin' the minds
of the youth, and ghetto life, is the proof
The only skills that's taught, is how to cock and to shoot
Poverty crack guns, hustlers stack ones
Take money is the motto cause we all lack funds

[Chorus x2] 

Nobody owes you nuttin' so you better get yours
My desire flows like sweat, from my open pores
My sores heal, but still the scars remain
A lot of niggaz gonna feel, much more pain
But yo I guess that's life, it don't make things right
Been through a lot of fights, cause ignorance makes me uptight
And cats be thinkin', that us rappers ain't real
And other cats be thinkin' street life is all about steel
Some of this may be, but yo, look in my face
Cause can't none of why'all bitches ever stand in my place
Pop the Remi, some for L, Tah, 'Pac and Biggie
Really? Niggaz want to stop the jiggy?
Fuck a willie, still you know you gots to dig me
The city, rotten to the core, no pity
The crowds roar, scavengers are out to get me
I want to live, I'm tryin' hard to stay positive

But ready to pull out, and back 'em all the fuck out
And my guardian angel, is always there to protect
And my supreme nature, keeps all them savages in check
How the hell did everything get so twisted
They say be careful what you pray for, so I guess now it's this shit

They will never know - what I do to get by
And them many times I almost died
They will never know - all the reasons why I flip
And now I gotta keep an extra clip
They will never know - what this stress is like
And why I'm on point, ready to fight
They will never know - all the pressure and pain

The emotions that one goes thourgh, over a loss of a loved one
Or friend then, knowing the cost of rebuilding and carrying on
It gets so damn hard in this modern day Babylon
And disease runs rampant, so many men carry arm
So many have a lonely painful road to travel on
Mothers losing sons, improper use of guns
Children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
I used to run with the illest guys
Thourgh the realest eyes
I seen the realest and the illest die
The cycle continues, so many times the good ones
The young ones
So many misunderstood ones

I show love cause it's a terrible thing to hate
Of course I want money, but I won't compromise
Y'all don't realize, think I won't bomb you guys?

Too many wakes and funerals, that's the proof nigga
Our hood's in danger, kids need guidance
You keep lyin, still the young keep dyin
As I walk through the valley I fear none, yes I'm the chairman
Here with my nigga premier son
And we came to change the game
We represent the pain that's real talk, what's y'all claim to fame?
Rappers simply tracin flows and chasin hoes
Frontin mad hard, that shit's amazin yo
Producers makin tinkerbell beats for them to rhyme on
Their ass if they get on the same stage that I'm on

Make the wrong move stupid then you lose your seat
Cats be buyin up SoundScans to beef up sales
Niggas wanna crossover, wanna be upscale
Fuck that, that ain't hip-hop, that's somethin else
You're better off back on the ave doin somethin else
All you suckers claimin that you are, thug or gangsta
You disrespect the game by dry-snitchin you prankster
I thank y'all for makin more room for us, uhh
Ashes to dust you wonder who's to trust
My sense of self, and my mental health
Is much more powerful, than any hint of wealth
A lot of niggas get cash, and collect Mercedes
But neglect their ladies, and forget their babies
Then the chicks turn and act like dudes
Cause they reflect our light, so yo act right fool
And this is just a piece of my mind, a thesis of mine
I'mma make moves and I'mma leave you behind
At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in

And Ronnie's self-interests had him livin in a different world

Smokin mad wools all day, with Caesar's change
Not to mention he pushed up on Caesar's wifey

It`s how you hook em up and the rhyme style troop
So don`t even think you could say someone bit
Off your weak beat come on you need to quit

I flip lines and kick rhymes that never sound like yours
There oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows from in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the

Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can`t think as quick
So Premier drops a beat, for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper then take it personal

Don`t be mad cause I don`t come around the way
Like I used to, I don`t have time these days
I`m keeping busy making power moves
Don`t try to say I don`t remember you

You shouldn`t let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by, cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don`t even know

Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South

To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun

There should be love and affection, not rejection,
Love is the key I'm sure, to open every door.
But when love goes away, there's no foundation,
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above
Just another crazy scene, just another nightmare dream,

And it all falls down like a house of cards
And it all falls down like a house of cards

So stop those angry words, they don't prove a thing.
Just look around, and see the mess we're in

I need the kind of love I can believe in
But when love goes astray, there's no foundation
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above

I keep a picture of you on my wall
Exactly why it's there I can't recall
I think I keep it to remind myself

That what we had was never very clear
I often wondered what it was I feared
But now I hardly think of you at all

Oh no but I climbed the walls
And kept alive
In spite of love
There was no reflection
The sun it was hidden
Behind the belief
That the world had stopped turning

And when the lovers meet as lovers do
These days I rarely even think of you
I turn the TV off and go to bed

Oh no but I climbed the walls
And kept alive
In spite of love
The summer was colder
By half than the winter
And only the calendar
Called it a liar

And kept alive
In spite of love
There was no reflection
The sun it was hidden

That the world had stopped turning

Has spawned a cruel history, lets hope that luck don't last
It came with the longships and from across the Irish sea
The endless tides of fighting men bought the Ard ris to their knees
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

Then came the English with their reforming ways
The luck of the Irish bore ample fruit in those days
The land was replanted with the winners of English wars
And the only crops harvested were famine and plague and the odd lost cause
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

One day things will change and then you know you will see
Just how lucky they can all really be
When the orange and the green meet on the white in between
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

The luck of the Irish still hangs around their heels
As bombers stop the cities hearts and blood is spilt in the greenest fields
And the orangemen remember, the old horse is yearly shod
To ride again with long dead men and kill or be killed for the one same god.
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

Is it history repeating itself?
Is it science, biology or something else?
That leads me down familiar streets
Ignoring warnings and the danger signs that I see
Maybe I'm intentionally blind
Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

You tell me you're good for me
And believe me there's no other place I'd rather be

And then the fires come, and burn the water
It's a sight to be seen

The men in slouch hats reap the harvest
Brown sticks they place in cages

And then the trains hiss, they carry bounty
From the furnace to the mill

Stick men silhouettes bend against the flame,
Shout above the crackle crunch.

Watch as the ground spits at the sky
A yellow-orange spit from a mouth that will never die

The silent garden in which can be found the tree of love
Every night you can find me there with sweating palms and matted hair
And drops of blood dot the sand everywhere under the tree of love

And you can hear them whispering under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every saint and every sinner
As they paw the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Some nights there are many there and murmurs fill the desert air
Odd and evens trying to make a pair under the tree of love
On and on as the darkness falls the wistful sound of the searchers calls
Are heard within and without the walls around the tree of love

And you can hear them talking under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every heel and every hero
As they scour the desert sands for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Last night, before the end, I found myself under the tree again
The branches break as the bones they bend under the tree of love

And you can hear them shouting under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every saint and every sinner
As they search the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

GANGgajang,"Well it's happening again, like I always thought it would

Madmen dancing in the street and fires rage.
And it's a strange infatuation taking off across the nations
Crazy dialling confrontation 'cause it's one more move and it's all over

Gimme some lovin', it's what I need
Gimme little lovin', makes me feel right
Gimme some lovin' that's the way
Gimme little lovin' makes me say

It's spreading everywhere, showing here and growing there
There's no time for condemnation ,just to wait.
And it's an eerie indication of things that's turning out to be
Destruction to distraction,
'Cause it's one more move and it's goodbye,
You know why we've got to say, just

Gimme some lovin' it's what I need
Gimme little lovin' makes me feel right
Gimme some lovin' that's the way
Gimme litlle lovin' makes me feel like

They fall, again, on the streets tonight.

And we're wakin' up every day , looking this way looking that way
Wondering who will come and end this game
Of one more move and it's all over

And the moon was there for all to see
And the beat goes on across a 100 languages
And the sun is the same, yeah, one and the same for you and me
They had many words with the same meaning
And one voice with which they sang

In Hundreds of Languages speak to me
In Hundreds of Languages speak to me

But its all been said about a hundred times before
But it's only words, it's only words
They had stories, that spanned the generations
Handed from one to one on down the line

I hear a voice and it seems to speak to everyone
I hear a voice and it's callin' me

GANGgajang,"Is it nature or nurture that makes me walk this way?
Is it you or is it me that's saying the things I say?
You say you're looking at me but all I see is you
And I can only wonder at all the things you do
Get it right sometime, get it right sometime
Someday in an ordinary world

We've seen Mother Nature; we've seen her lost and found
Still hanging on her apron strings she spins us all around
So high, so low sometimes so twisted we can't see
I think I'm looking at you but all I see is me
Get it right sometime, get it right sometime
Someday in an ordinary world

Is it rhyme or reason that makes me thinks this way?
We think we're really living, we're just living for today
We don't seem to know too much our heads are underground
And the future keeps on looming regardless of what we've found
We have found solid gold can be extracted from the earth
With gaudy specks of dead stars we count our worth
Someday in an ordinary world
We just live in an ordinary world
We can do all the ordinary things
We will live in an ordinary world
Ordinary world

GANGgajang,"I think I hear the sounds of then, 
And people talking, 
The scenes recalled, by minute movement, 
And songs they fall, from the backing tape. 
That certain texture,that certain smell, 

To lie in sweat, on familiar sheets, 
In brick veneer on financed beds. 
In a room, of silent hardiflex 
That certain texture, that certain smell, 
Brings home the heavy days, 
Brings home the the night time swell, 

Out on the patio we'd sit, 
And the humidity we'd breathe, 
We'd watch the lightning crack over canefields 
Laugh and think, this is Australia. 

The block is awkward - it faces west, 
With long diagonals, sloping too. 
And in the distance, through the heat haze, 
In convoys of silence the cattle graze. 
That certain texture, that certain beat, 
Brings forth the night time heat. 

Out on the patio we'd sit, 
And the humidity we'd breathe, 
We'd watch the lightning crack over canefields 
Laugh and think that this is Australia. 

To lie in sweat, on familiar sheets, 
In brick veneer on financed beds.

I ain't been sleeping and I ain't been dreaming, feel like I'm on the run
Every night I wait for you, It's not hard to understand why
Cause when you're near I feel no fear and you whisper what I want to hear

Talk to me baby, every night. Talk to me baby and I'll feel alright
Oh yeah angel I feel so free when you come and talk to me

I feel so down when you ain't been around, feel like I'm lost for words
Stumbling around all the places that you've been, chasing echoes that I've heard
Every night and every day there's only this confusion
But when you're near I feel no fear and you tell me what I want to hear

Talk to me baby, every night. Talk to me baby and I'll feel alright
Oh yeah angel I feel so free when you come and talk to me

Here I am again baby waiting for you to show and tell me secrets you know
A little inspiration will improve my situation baby, I won't feel so low
Every night I know it's true, I feel so much better when I'm getting through

Life in a northern town
You've lost that lovin feeling
Like a virgin,
She's leaving home
Like a rolling stone
I know what boys like,
I send a message
This is not a love song
Love cats
Get it on
Love street
I've got you
Skin deep
I'm stranded
Before too long

Don't stop till you
Get enough

50 ways to leave your lover
What you need,
When the war is over
Turn up your radio
I'll be gone The day you come
Flame trees, Distant sun
Where the wild roses grow

Do you see what I see
I want to break free
I won't get fooled again
The power and the passion
The age of reason
It's all in the game


Please don't let me be misunderstood
If I walk on by one fine day
I say a little prayer for you
I can't stand the rain chain reaction
A fraction too much friction
Science fiction
Uptown girl downtown jive talking
Walking in the rain stayin' alive
Freak out


We can work it out,
All you need is love,
Across the universe,
And your bird can sing,
Anytime at all,
I'll keep you satisfied,

Of broken eagles, they fly
Play it cool

Strumming the notes on the guitar
While I'm rocking my leather Mercedez coat like the R in the cut
Licking my wounds and soaking my scars
Crib full of empty bottles of liquor, broken cigars
On a table, going Ninja ? on the cable
When that dance make my stance unstable
Hem the bottom of my pants with staples
I split 'em with symmetry like a bagel
Play tic-tac-toe on your cheek with the razor cut up your facial
Sprinkle the magic dust on the reefer
Gutter creature, rap pornographic snuff double feature
I'm bubbling something up in the beaker
The night creeper, motivational mic speaker
Wallet ring like a Motorolla device beeper
Light sleeper, leave em shook with a light seizure

It's nothing to you sending threats, I'm rushing to you
Have the little homie run it to you, then run into you
Like an intersection, and now you been intercepted
I end a session when the weed's all gone
Like a gardener, just working the hose on the lawn
But I'm a king to a pawn on the chess board
That stresses scores stuck in a square, just press 4
I'm sitting with the best, throwin' the game, picture the picture
In the the same frame of mind, Tarantino official
Couple cameras in the building, the body of work
Mentally a work out, your brain, your body will hurt

And any cars, don't never cross
Don't never get involved
Be the next mystery that's unsolved

Ain't my wife when the light drizzle tap on the pain
I'm inside with them
When the sky clear up, still inside tripping
You can see I ain't been sleeping in my eyes, nigga
In the mirror throwing hands, I don't toss fights
I'm heavyweight, get a load of these light niggas
Looking washed online like light linen drying
I'm through trying with niggas
I'm gifted cause my eyes work in different
And I be seeing straight through the skies as my nigga
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these bitches

No more of thinkin' my talents gone be insured for a mil

No more of dealin' with hoes, I'd rather have me a bitch
'Cause she ain't shit from the start, just keep her slick with the dick

No more of hard-head grindin' that shit round the trunk
Too used to gettin' what I want, so I'm gone keep this shit blunt
No more of layin' in the road, for you to walk over mud

Graduated and made it from the college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well
How the hell you been since I had no job
Hum, why don't you give me some
Cause you know I flow and run for Suave
Nah, all of that was on the couch
No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin' in gold
It's cold ""On The Outside Lookin' In"" (Br!)
You'd besta make yourself worthy
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their Johnson very dirty
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit
Ain't this a bitch
I remember when you would not give me shit
Now you down for them habits
Put your numbers on them natural
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks
Niggas in love
Can't stay out the club
All in the hoe's face
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased
I see him in the back
Countin' up that chedder
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd
I think I know one
I remember you, oh yes I do
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo
What time the club close, at 3
What's up, you comin' with me
We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees
You want some cheese
Hoes don't stay at the suave house
Hoes around my nuts like knats
Real dogs don't pay for cats, dats
For real baby
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sho' 'nough

Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe
Wants to get close to me
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow
Lookin for, confidants, and tickets to my next show
Check yo' bitch
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses
Oh yes it's very true
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do
Let her loose or let her remain
Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame
A bigger name
Look, this thang with bigger game
And she claim she ain't heard my music
Tryin' to trick me
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsly
She still hit me
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I
Really just don't plan on takin it out cause I

We got just a lil' time left/ If I'm not mistaken, the year is '99/ But we don't
Really know when we gon' die/ Shit, most
Niggas don't know how they still alive on this unmerciful, wicked planet/ If you
Can't pay for your life, you're gonna vanish...

She got arthritis/ My neighbor caught hepatitis
From a simple yawn/ They say it's airborne/ We ain't got no street lights; they
All broken; just take a trip throu Vallejo
Richmond, and Oakland, and everyday it's a funeral/ He was my numero uno, but I
Can't bring him back/ All I know is he was
Stressin', takin' anti-depressants (What they do') They found him dead in the
Trunk of his Cadillac/ And I'm so withdrawalled
All I could think about is revenge/ Always check up, always pullin' licks, and
Doin' dirty work for dividends
He took the bullet for me/ I'm the one that really robbed the place/ Boy, I've
Been tryin' to paper-chase

They got down the road
But in the meantime, you make your money/ Even if you strike it rich, you better
Hustle like you hungry for your paper...
These days only ways that pays can save you/ Livin' your life is like a task, if
You ain't got the cash/ Nigga, mad at the world
As I put my mask over my face, and I grabbed the magnum pistol with the stash in
The bag/ I'm doin' a pop pop, so drop

On the floor, watchin' the door
This no-win situation of tryin' to stay alive until we die/ And anyway you go,
We won't make it/ No way to shake your fate
You better take advantage of your life while you can; get rich, kick back,
Relax, spend your money, man/ I'm all about paper
Sorry, no party tonight, the year is 1999/ Last year to get your money, right

Gangsta Boo,"I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just won't pop up over, out the blue
No after you

Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre
But you can call me Possum Allawishes Jenkins
Andre 3000 for short
And no I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
And I will pause for your cause

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just won't pop up over, out the blue
No after you

I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul
And then I'm a get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just won't pop up over, out the blue
No after you

Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady
Wit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy
What ya mean dog, telling a play like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking you for fun
Join the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars
Hitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends my truly blew me
Bitch

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just won't pop up over, out the blue
No after you

Nigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cut shot white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to idle wishes
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too

I won't just won't pop up over, out the blue

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

This is dedicated to all of my ladies in relations
Peep this out

[Verse 1]
I'm a lady who be keepin it real, you don't care
Take time out, see how I feel
When I be riding in the SUV, I'm thinking of you
When I be rolling up a fat one, boy I'm thinking of you
You got me going like uh
I'm feelin the rush, I like to fuck
Let's get buck in the back of the truck, so boy what's up?
It's whatever when it comes down to you
Well it was, until you made it clear that I ain't for you
You just abandoned me, you left me strandedly
Heart broke, constantly
Hearing love songs on the radio, that remind me of you
They say a gangsta ain't 'posed to cry
But I'm shedding tears and I'm a gangsta until I die
I'm telling you boy, they say no pain then no gain
Now they call me player because you teaching me all yo game
I say I ain't change, but then again just peep me out

Hey yo, I don't think this shit is gonna work...
I'm ready to leave you, get out

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Just be a man about it, you don't have to lie to me
Nigga leave my house, you can get the fuck away from me
Take yo' fucking car keys, get yo' fucking clothes too
Nigga this my credit card, hold up that's my bank book
Why you out here cheating on me, I'm getting my own creeping on
Hey girl, why you ain't answer that god damn phone?
Uhh why nigga, I was gone
Nigga bout my ? hes, pay my own light bill
I don't need you, got my own fingers for my sex thrill
Shit, I'm a mack, player you ain't heard my real name?
Mrs. Pimping Thing, pussy power to the fucking brain
If you want to play, get in the shower stroke yourself
I ain't the one to be messed with, pimping to my death
Slip in and slip out, remember how that used to be?
I would get so wet when you put yo' love inside of me
But that's the past now, no more freaky tail nights
No more popping X, or sex asshole tight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I ain't trying get caught up in yo games
Personally, I think that shit is lame
What you doing err' now and then when you want to hit
I ain't giving yo ass shit, you'll be just another trick
On my list of busta's, diamond clusters
Rings, old game used to be so not told
With yo' frozen heart, boy you tore my soul apart
My XX plot, about a nigga from the ?
With yo' seven inch cock, give it to me don't you stop
I keep falling for you, hypnotized doubt you get my props
But now I'm single, pussy bad tight
I ain't fucking with no giggalos, niggas ain't right
They want to cut now, they want to cut later
They ain't call yo ass then, they ain't call yo ass later
That's how it goes, I'm out the door, holla back
Hit me on my 2 Way when you ready
That's that on that

Hello toots, you look so eloquent, that's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kickin' my seat
And I'm tryin' to the tell the cashier what I want!
They say I act like an asshole, when I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an appli-cation, throw it back in her face an'
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her
In the head with a Whopper that I bought from BK
You expect me to be proper?
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately, slut, ho Skidda dee da da
Prada? Not a chance, I was thinkin' about buyin' you some clothes
But Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart, but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know, they didn't carry a size eight in hoes!
Oh! This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you motherfuckin' ho bags
What a trailer trash pioneer, I am here, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea!
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two
'Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you
So we don't gotta scream at you!
Ow! I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
I went to go tell 'em all to go get bucked!

Turnt than a motherfucker
Bought that ho a shot cause you wanna cuff her
All these other motherfuckers think they stuntin'
But they spot is 'bout to close
And they ain't pullin' nothin'
Walls smell like pussy when it's wet
Snort it to the face, but the club wet
Trying to get a taste, baby wanna flex
Sick of pushin' weight in an alley with a mind full of sex
She walk to the floor, leave the bar stool soakin'
Drop it down low, make it wade like the ocean
And every man up in here wanna see her bust it open
But you ain't gonna get it if you so soft-spoken
Flashing lights, molly dreams, face down low
DJ screaming ""last call"", that liquor dark, that dick gone hard
With visions of her legs up in the air over your face under her ass
And breaking lamps from beating pussy purple cause she like it fast
Wha-wha-wha-what's your fantasy? Ass like Trina, face like Beyonce
And tell your story, try to whip her fine ass free
Cause she's probably used to ballers and ballin' you may not be
But shit, this spot's about to close and you still ain't pulled you a freak?

It's the last song of the night
Don't forget to tip the bartender
You got fucked up, that's alright
That's not the only thing you came to do
Cause there's bad ones all around
And you ain't pulled your one yet
If you ain't locked it down by now
Then it's time to figure out who fuckin' tonight
Who fucking tonight, who fuckin' tonight, who fuckin' tonight

I'm drunker than I ever been, higher than I ever been
Don't you want to take me to the bar to get a shot again?
Don't you want to take me home? Don't you want to see me roam?
Music beatin', twerkin' to the sound, I'm all up in my zone
Lookin' for a victim, caught him slippin', I just want some sex
Nothing else to do when I leave the club so that's the best thing next
Here, just take my number, when you leave be sure to send a text
I'll be at the Waffle House waitin', baby fuck the rest
If you at the club and you feel trashed and it about to close
Make sure you have a freak that knows how to bend and touch her toes
Make sure that that boy know, he gotta play when he weighin' that soul(?)
He get to see me do dances and shit, doin' a split and I'm killin' this shit

It's the last song of the night
Don't forget to tip the bartender
You got fucked up, that's alright
That's not the only thing you came to do

Tab on the bank card, molly on the gums
Last shot dark, brain, 808 bass drums
Laser in the eyeball, callous on the feet

Stumble up a staircase, floor missing boards
Hands fumbling through (?) keys, keys open doors
Tumble to the futon, teeth into soft skin
Fists full of weave, rip, lick, suck, coughin'
Acrylic on the spine, hand prints on the hips
Rug burn on the knees, salt on the lips
Beat it up, spread it out, bust it open, take it down
Eyes rolling, bones shaking, lungs weak, breathing in somebody else's breath
Shit, hold up, what's your name, what's up with that breakfast?

Gangsta Pat,"[Verse 1]
Put me off in any hood, I bet chu' I'ma survive
365 reasons to stay alive
In this jungle, lies be the king of these streets
But even the lies be runnin' from the crooked police
It ain't no peace cause they got the hood split up in sections
Violate the wronge set and they comin' with techs
There ain't no questions be asked, no bullies gettin' mad
Just killers on a task, and units bein' blast
With no remorse, I done seen it plenty of times
So I take it to my room and write plenty of rhymes
About the dirty game, thangs ain't the same no mo'
They try to stick together, just ain't what they claim no mo'
So hit the floor when they hit the door, give up them sacks
Everybody's got a posse so they robbin' in packs
On the attack and they keep gun runnin' like wood
And respect is something that chu' gotta earn in the hood

[Hook]
It's all good in my neighborhood
We out hustlin' doin' thangs y'all wish y'all could
We in this game, gettin' money and we livin' good
Stayin' real to the end like we know we should
It's all good

[Verse 2]
It's all about the money, gettin' paid is an every day job
And we connected, makin' moves like a heavyweight mob
And well respected, the hood is gonna make you or break you
And livin' and learnin' through all the drama that it'll take you
Keep you focused on reality, deep in the thoughts
Tryin' to count for every penny that you keep in the vault
So keep your yoks and still watch ya back
Cause in the hood your own friends will be the one to jack
Knowin' crosses is comin' throughout my whole nature
Takin' losses and dealin' with all this play hation
Steady chasin' that cheese and hangin' out with G's
Fuck what cha' sayin' bout gankin' and doin' robberies
I'm just tryin' to survive and keep myself alive
See I'm all about hustlin' can't work no 9 to 5
I'm stay thuggish not ruggish off in that hood
Steady tryin' to maintain and keep the paper good

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
You gotta watch ya back cause them killers be havin' jacks
They travel in packs and they quick to pull them gats
Ain't no time for negotiatin'
Just give up for good, look at the occupation
I run in numbers before the drama even kicks off
Duckin' and dodgin' from all them shots they done let off
I see it all the time in my neighborhood
Robbin' murder and madness but still the paper's good
I keep my mind on money and block out the pain
Ya see depression, deprivin' can drive ya mind insane
I'm trapped in this game and it ain't one way out
I strugglin' and strivin' to keep my pockets stout
See I'm tryin' to stay Southern, ain't no love for cowards
On the block steady hustlin' and don't cha' doubt us
I'm always down for my hood like I know I should
Gettin' plenty of money like I knew I could

Cooked it and we split it

Sick in the head, bloodshed in a ant bed
You want a new leg? Give me some needle and thread
So I can sew you one - 'cause I'm in it to win it
My horoscope said I'ma die in 20 minutes
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm worse than Freddie
You can't kill me 'cause I'm dead already
Egypt E is the motherfucking shrink(Damn right!)
After 12 o'clock my blood turns hot pink
Nah, you weak-ass hoes can't [???]
A thousand dead cut-up elephants in my luggage
Fuck with a psycho, you end up dead
Those who didn't live, drowned in a turtle's head
A twelve gauge is my only protection
Every bullet shot has a different infection
Woke up this morning with a dead dog on me
So I thought, ""Huh - baloney!""
If a nigga run up I don't care if he pushes
Fuck around and find his ass somewhere dead in some sticker bushes
Mess with N-I-P you must be tired of livin
Cut off your head - mmm, Thanksgiving
If you want to live, your ass better beg

Don't run up - 'cause I kick like Bruce
I want to and I'm gonna trade heads with a moose

Some say I'm insane 'cause I married a dead horse

Kill a nigga for a measly-ass nickel
Frozen blood on a stick, equals strawberry popsicles
Fuck up and watch your Black neck bend
Dead men, making rounds cutting throats with a violin
I ain't gon' lie I feel like killin' my niece
A bird's leg woke up dead with his head in some fish grease
Ten died yesterday, ten just died
Ten died today - now this football's on layaway
You said I was weak, yeah, point blank told me
Tied a needle to my dick then my grandmother rode me
It ain't another nigga in this world can match this
I feel like swimmin' in rat piss
Fuck with N-I-P - I ain't no actor
My twelve daughters died from talking shit to a tractor
I'm getting pissed from the blood I threw up
Barely snapped my fingers and Jupiter blew up!
Hoes, they love me, they say I'm a pleaser
I woke up dead in a cat's leg screaming ""Caesar!""
Quick to break your motherfuckin' spine
A dead goat got pregnant and said it was mine
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm down with the Mob
Cuttin' off heads was my last year's Summer job
Blame it on TV - then put it on the map
This is a horror movie rap

A tisket, a tasket, you ain't gon' believe me
It ain't N-I-P's fault that he got crazy thoughts
Blame it on the TV

If you don't like what I write, you can suck my di-ick

So wet them motherfuckers 'cause they do talk shit
We been gettin' slaughtered, so Rodney King whaddant new bitch
Devil, watch the Psych get nifty
Make no mistake it was a reflection of the sixties
That when niggas got beat down in the slavery days
But now in '96 we call it bravery days, check it out
So many motherfuckin' murders and jacks and
So many motherfuckin' burglars with gats man

Nigga hide that banana clip to the AK you know it's fed time
If you shoot a devil, would you keep steppin?
They couldn't convit you if they couldn't find the murder weapon
A stolen car, plus the music is gone
Dark black 'Lac tight white interior, car phone
Drop top bumper kid plus fifth wheel grill
Surround by sound wasn't handy Randy sing a song his ass got killed
So make the devil respect us
The same thing that happened in L.A. is gonna happen in Texas
Punk nigga let me start this shit
Flip the script, psycho NIP, conjur Moses here to part this bitch
Against the psych situation is no win
Peter Jennings, have you ever had a nigga kick yo door in
Schools in white hoods, are so so big
But schools in the black hoods, man look what they did
But in reality I'm really goin' crazy

I heard the cops been actin' a fool around the way
Jump out boys hit seven houses in one day
In South Park we keep they ass in suspense
Time you see 5-O you time another nigga hittin' the fence
Back in the days she gave the busta' spark
Stupid motherfucker didn't know he robbed Rosa Parks
Check game devil, what is you hawkin' about
Harriet Tubman freed the slaves so what the fuck is you talkin' 'bout
Psychotic rapper let me show you how to be
It's beats like this that bring the psych shit outta me
Shit, peep ya boy as I come from the heart
David Copperfield could not perform the bullshit tricks in South Park

Blow a sweet when it's over, I'll go kill downtown
Cops don't understand, they thought he was bluffin'
They say the officer went crazy when he murdered a dozen
Other cops and didn't ? 'cause life ain't fair
They put his body in the chair, but his mind wasn't there

If you don't join, then you'll meet the children of death

Jim Jones did it, why the psych can't do it?

Charles Manson did it, why the psych can't do it?
David Koresh did it, why the psych can't do it?
Ted Bundy did it, why the psych can't do it?

Smoke a dip, flip the script, ball and chain and the whip
The fleas, flies, different bugs devoured the body by strips
Pit bulls come, claimin' all the pieces that's left
Whatever parts that they don't eat, the fire ants feel wealth
Then they throw a party, now they on their feet
But that rival ant gang, they want that meat
Now it's an ant war, fire ants cannot be beat
Now that's the same type a shit that you see on the street
Hit the sweet, move somethin', then grab your Glocks
Cuz niggas listen to my music then they go kill cops
They in a trance, hypnotically they do what I say
See, I got the hook up spot where you can buy an A-K
Then go out, straight murderin', and start you a spree
And don't come back until a thousand nine hundred seventy three
Bodies drop, inside the freezer, with ziplock tags
And leave the corpses all tied up in ziplock bags
A blow torch is now needed, they'll turn into crust
Cuz with the fire, then immortals turn slowly to dust
Psycho NIP, mad scientist, I'll crush up them bones
Cuz I'll catch you, I'll keep you, I'll kill you in the Psych

Bumblebees, grasshopers, spiders, they do hit the spot
Check nuts, now what, see Mr Snake's on the block
Insect war ground, see I can face it now
For my reality is body parts, I can taste it now
Crushed ice cubes keeps it all frozen stiff
A chainsaw pursues much blood, they ready to rip
What you want? You bloody shit, when the wrists get slit
A thumbtack takes out the eyeballs, they bust real quick

And a wardrobe to shock Mrs. Asters pet horse
Making merry music with the one that I love
We're a perfect duet

If I got it, I ain't gon' hide it - I show mine
I know you gon' respect it, I know you gon' let me shine
I know you ain't gon' step, I know you know I tote iron
Quick to bust, and I know you don' wan' die

You'll want to keep it right, look

Bring em to your house, then walk around in they bad clothes
You sneaking to the club with em, when I be on the map, that's cold
But its cool, cause my mama never raised no fool
We was in school, you had a nigga when I played on you
I should've seen it, but I was too caught up on the grind
In the blind, you knew I stayed with other shit on my mind
But all it did was take time, to show me the light
No I can't put this one behind, so you can go head and kite
So tell them hoes that there, and see what they say
They can't fuck you, but I can knock them off any day
So get your hand out my face, 'fore I bat you in yours
You should of, stayed in your place now the tables done turned
And everything I gave you, bitch I struggled to earn
Get your purse you gotta skate, you lucky you don't get burned

Girl don't play dumb, you know who made you
Everything you want you get, everything you got I gave you
I took you from hard times and saved you
In the best of everything I laced you
Made it where no one could fade you, sometimes I hate you
I love you to death, but the way you act
I know that's not the way, that Lil B. Gizzle raised you
I'm on the verge, about to shake you, don't forget
I'm a paid nigga getting sick of you trying to be slicker
Tripping, trying to build fake cases, a house
Your clothes, your feature and supplied transportation
And that's how you gonna' do a nigga, mentally abuse a nigga
You gonna' regret trying to use a nigga, you this close from bout to lose this nigga

Chill gun on my waist, with a blunt in my hand
We spending a grand on Bubbly, round for round
That's how the Chopper City mob, get down
Hydro in the bottle, with the yellow wrapper
And you players better, hold your broads
Cause these boys, will snatch her

I know you know of me, Sniper playa baby
I hold it down full of Mo' and Crown, it make the kid move
Quick, too much Vodka make me nervous bad
I'm popping bottles every hour, making Erkles mad
I left the scene, swerved past in a purple Jag
You heard of trap, ladies love me you perverted fags
I rock the house like it's church, yeah I love the Lord
Play with my team, Chopper City it's goin' be murder mass you heard me
Know you love the way that gangstas play it, we drank and blazing
Till ancient ages, this ain't for babies
So ease your nerves, play your girl like she easing surf
Cause chill what's beneath my shirt, have you bleeding syrup
I ain't tripping if you need that work, Sniper pull up in a Viper
With a rifle, that'll mean your smirk
Flows make my people lean, and twerk
I hit the track and beat it up like Ike and Tina Turner, it's Chopper City man

And you know, where I'm found in here
Last week they had a body, left found in here
And with the drank getting smoked, the bottles is popping
We ain't even make it to the party, and girls jocking
It's Hakizzle, you know the name girl
Just write your number down, and I'll give you a ring girl
I don't mean, to snatch your chicks player
But the bar need chips player, look at my wrist player
The hood call me, Young Neno
Cause I'm quick to snatch your senorita, or hit the block with a kilo
Calm down homeboy, you messing up my groove
Yeah iight you smoking, give me a cool
We stunt round year, ride in convertibles

Me and my click at the scene, straight tearing it down
Ball till we fall, believe we laying it down

Thugging popping bottles, until the sun rise
It's going down, it's going dizzle, it's going diggity
We from Uptown, off the hizzle off the higgity

Gar,"I was born 1980 September 3rd
That's the day checks come out and vics gets served
So you know I got the blood of a hustla in my vain
My daddy had 3 brother that all gave me some game
They was raised in the projects I was born in the hood
I was raised on the block my mom did what she could
Always got what I need sometimes I got a lil mo
But I grew up watching g's on the set gettin dough
I made be	's n see's up in to 5th grade
It went to d's n f's 'cause I didn't want to behave
I was the class clown Christopher raise hair
I show my dick to them hoes and I get expelled
Yeah I get punished I was supposed to be inside
I snuck out the back round the school fo lunch time
The police spotted me id break out and run
Make em run behind me that was my way of having fun
Somewhere in 87 might of been 88
I knew of Baby and Slim we was from round the same way
They moved a lot of weight but I ain't gone tell it all *shhh*
I¬¥m a cut this boy short 'cause my moms was involved

You can put it together it was what it wasn't
Nah cakes to be baked but she had cakes in the owen
She told me if I touch it that id fuck it up
If I knew what I know now I would of took it n cut it up
92 roll round that's when it got real
My daddy got set up kidnapped robbed and killed
Cash Money Records was started that same year
That's when my thuggin started I was gettin it how I live
My moma needed help I was outta control
The streets took me under I was on a dead end row
The hood barber stand knew Baby and hit him up
Told him I had skills he needed to peep me up
He did that snatch me him Slim and Fresh was feelin me
Took me to studio from that we made history

In the mid east of that I was doin my thang
And I met this four foot hustla they called him Lil Wayne
That was my lil nigga called my lil brotha
Baby drew a cross between us but I still love him
Universal up to deal we went to get mills
That's when nigga decided to not keep it real
I had a idea I didn't want to believe it
I wouldn't thought of it in a million years he'll do that to Geezy
I had a dope habbit and markie was on my back
So he turned his back but look how I shookback
You know how it go you get up when you fall
The streets all over they rooted for the underdog
I got Kizzle I got Snipe I got Gar on my team
And I got click of niggas ready for war on my team
From Detroit to Atlanta Texas and Nashville

Women, over here come listen, tell em
If you ain't been with a nigga, its too late

You'll want to keep it right, look
A real nigga is hard to come by, believe it

Girl I can't believe you, how you gone

You don't want to be careful, why should I try to keep you
Nigga gon fuck, then he gone in a week or two

Behind your back, run and tell me, each and everything you do
You better wake up, and pay attention
Realize your partners want to ask you out, to get to your position
I guarantee they got they man cuffed, if he say no that mean no
They can't go there, ain't gonna' huff and puff

With them knuckle head, fucking give head hoes
Bring em to your house, then walk around in they bad clothes
You sneaking to the club with em, when I be on the map, that's cold
But its cool, cause my mama never raised no fool
We was in school, you had a nigga when I played on you
I should've seen it, but I was too caught up on the grind
In the blind, you knew I stayed with other shit on my mind
But all it did was take time, to show me the light
No I can't put this one behind, so you can go head and kite
So tell them hoes that there, and see what they say
They can't fuck you, but I can knock them off any day
So get your hand out my face, 'fore I bat you in yours
You should of, stayed in your place now the tables done turned
And everything I gave you, bitch I struggled to earn
Get your purse you gotta skate, you lucky you don't get burned

Them hoes be acting up
They gonna' make a nigga bat 'em up
I'm sorry bitch, but I done had enough
Man I'ma leave this bitch in handcuffs
I say you hoes be acting up
You gonna' make a nigga bat you up
I'm sorry bitch, but we done had enough
We gonna' fuck around
And leave this bitch in handcuffs

Girl don't play dumb, you know who made you
Everything you want you get, everything you got I gave you
I took you from hard times and saved you
In the best of everything I laced you
Made it where no one could fade you, sometimes I hate you
I love you to death, but the way you act
I know that's not the way, that Lil B. Gizzle raised you
I'm on the verge, about to shake you, don't forget
I'm a paid nigga getting sick of you trying to be slicker
Tripping, trying to build fake cases, a house
Your clothes, your feature and supplied transportation
And that's how you gonna' do a nigga, mentally abuse a nigga
You gonna' regret trying to use a nigga, you this close from bout to lose this nigga
Man they got hoes all over the world, that wish they knew this nigga
See one time threw with you, I'm threw with you
Ain't nothing that I could do with you, but try to be cool with you

Them hoes be acting up
They gonna' make a nigga bat 'em up
I'm sorry bitch, but I done had enough

To call up my old friend
She said she had a
Poem for me
And did I hear that
She was thinking of leaving
I said I will miss you
And then
I played her my new song
We laughed and cried
We never said goodbye
And when I called again
She was gone
Here and now
Ready and willing
Touch my heart it is open
Kiss my soul if you're willing
I am ready to be living
Here and now
Today I made a dollar and
I'm feeling very rich
I earned it with my labor
Yes I dug my ditch
I'm free from all my worries
And I cast away my doubts
I am living in this moment
And tomorrow's gonna
Work itself out
Here and now
Ready and willing
Touch my heart it is open
Kiss my soul if you're willing
I am ready to be living
Here and now

My mind is set to consume you
And when the world comes down on you
Don't come to me to shed your tears

Something to live for

To flow around in here

You've crossed yours
You have crossed the breaking point

And shed your tears

To flow around

To draw the line

Gardens & Villa,"All through the night 
I was a redwood before your door
So I don't die realize who was here before
Sunlight through the blinds
Black hills white nights
Oh and you know native bones mixed in the walls
Adobe bricks can make us scented wind and red clouds
Sunlight through the blinds
Black hills white nights
Up on the mountain we climb
Watch the seas rise so high
We will be baptized just like before

Gardens of Gehenna,"[lyrics by Birgit Lages]

born from illusions, bread by dreams
No one can follow us.
We were gone before we came, alone, eternal
Dark and damned

don't ever try to understand
No consolation
And when we reach what we came for
It won't be a victory,

it's just the beginning of another end

the mechanism masochism
You have given back hell to me
And I will keep it now and forever
My mechanism masochism

as long as you sit calm and small
You'll never feel the chains
And then we'll create ourselves a god
Without whom we cannot live.
At night like a big black beast
With scars and blood dark floods

there's the beginning of another end

the mechanism masochism
You have given hell back to me
And I will keep it now and forever
My mechanism masochism





",Blood Dark Floods,2006
Gardens of Gehenna,"[lyrics by Birgit Lages]

and yes, we are mortal
Now that we've left Eden.
The raven's calling for my soul.
Come, dark angel, strengthen me.

ablaze my rage, come, dark angel,
Tear open my wounds, let me bleed.
Keep me free of indifference,
Drink my sorrows, gorge my grief.

help me to shine in godlike anger,
Help me never to forget,
Let me hate and let me live,
Let me remember that we've met

and that you've cast your spell on me.
Far off lies the universe,
Sunk in ashes, mud and tears,
Far off lies reality.

and yes, we are vulnerable,
Vulnerable and earth tied.
But it doesn't matter any more.
Come, dark angel, be my guide.

before I slip into the damnation
Of obedience and apathy
In a cloud of dust and blood
Come, dark anger, rescue me.





",Dark Angel,2006
Gardens of Gehenna,"There is something going on
And it's rough
And it's cruel
And it's deeply satisfying

There is something from inside
That is huge, that is cruel
That is something
That you'll never understand

Somewhere beyond the far horizon
The Gods of gloom and gore arise
Where from an everlasting wound
Bleeding are the western skies

The darkness talks if you do listen
The silence will dance at times
If you don't live within this world
You'll never know about the fight

That's fought within myself so often
You'll never know what demons dream
How wolves became a part of me
How crows and ravens rule the night

Watch me rise
As I celebrate your decay
Watch me grow
As I fall and pray
",Gods of Gloom,2006
Gardens of Gehenna,"[lyrics by Birgit Lages / Uli Bauer]

l'ombra della notte
Circonda la materia della terra
I corvi fanni grandi cerchi
Sapra dimenticati nell'passato.

posti, dore fuerrieri sono diventati eroi
E la spade diventano rossi dall'sangue.

cold shadows arise
From the darkness within
Like ravens they glide
Above times that have been

at places where once
Delusion and lies
Turned into death

'cause sometimes they lie
And in oceans of blood
They drown the truth
Sometimes we die.

un tempo, dore la rabbia era forte
E nessuno sapera chi era buono o male
Che l'ora della vendetta riarrivera,
E la povere creature spariscono
Nella palude dell'eternita

sometimes satan takes a fancy
To assume the shape of man
And walk among the mortals
To learn about their desires
To open wide the portals
For his coming from the other side

Watching the sky for a hint of a spark
Sailing further towards the unknown
Melting down our hearts of stone
Lift our happy hands from the cold

Gucci shoes, the look of Caviar
They all know exactly who you are
And they all wanna get next to you

See your face in every magazine
Staring out from every movie screen
Your body is as best there's ever been
But they'll never get next to you

And I got your pictures all over my wall
But I've got the greatest secret of all

Because you're absolutely mine
That's why I'm lying here next to you
Absolutely fine
That's why they fall in love with you

No one knows the danger you do to me
What they dream about I get for free
I'm living everybody's fantasy
And they all wanna get next to you

And the reason for their breaking hearts
Is that you don't even know who they are
Everybody knows that you're a star
And they all wanna get next to you

And I've got your pictures all over my wall
But I've got the greatest secret of all

Because you're absolutely mine
That's why I'm lying here next to you

Came every day with the sunrise
It's been that way as long as you've been gone
I thought the day would start
Same as the others falling apart
I thought I barely would be hanging on

Something has changed, feel so strange
Swimming through a notion of games
Then suddenly is the sun

[Chorus]
Maybe I had enough of you,
Maybe I been tired to dream of you
Maybe I gotta know your goodbye bye now
Baby I couldn't live without you
Now when I think about you
My eyes are dried somehow
Baby I'm all cried out
All cried out

I don't know what it is
Why I'm not longer missing your kiss
It feels mysterious and so damn good

Something is changed, feel so strange
Swimming true a notion of games
Then suddenly is the sun

It's gone from the scene of the crime
It's finally found the perfect place
Leaving it far behind
Baby maybe I

I don't complain about the life I live
And I appreciate the lovin' that your showin' me
I believe what you give is what you get

All my life I always dreamt of this
So you know I'm embracing it

To get a glimpse of the life I lead
If you wanna see, if I'm down
There's enough of me, to go around

You might see me as a superstar
But I don't even drive a fancy car
Keepin' both feet, on the ground
There's enough of me to go around

I never hesitate if you want an autograph
I'll go and sign my name across your heart
So quote me wrong all day the only thing I'll do is laugh
You write the script you know I'll play the part

What's the use in holding back I've only got one life to live
I'm gonna make the best of all I have
And share myself in every way that I can

Wherever I am, I will hold on through the night
I will pray each day a safe return, will look now to the light
Light up the darkness, my wondrous star
Our hopes and dreams, my heart and yours, forever shining far
Light up the darkness, my prince of peace
May the stars shine all around you may your courage never cease

Ah

May your courage never cease",Wherever You Are,2012
Gareth Valentine,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Gareth Williams,"If on every ocean the ship is a throne 
And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown 
Then I could believe that I`m bound to find 
A better life than I left behind 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold 

So I had to leave from my country of birth 
As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam 
There`s a thousand miles of the long journey home 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold",Main Theme,2002

Is there anybody out there trying to get through?

Garibay,"In the palace of Versailles, before the fall
We were wild, we were so debauched
Extravagance was practically a law
If we ever got bored, we said ""Let's throw a ball""

And you'd chase me naked through the palace garden
Before we dove into a sparkling champagne fountain
Eating cake with a little golden butter
They never even knew that I got here from the gutter

With an orchestra to drown out all the violence

Now's the time to come out from your tomb.
You look so sad,
With a face of stone,
With a hunchback's eye you live.

A gypsy woman that you love so much.

You're cured,
You're free at last.

And the old black cat is gone,
Like a memory faded from your past.
