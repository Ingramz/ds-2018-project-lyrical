Game,"All eyes on ya
Ask you how your week been
Workin' always, let me
Work you out for the weekend
Baby, I'm a beast, uh-huh
Can you tame me?
I'm gon' let it out
Lay you down

Let's get to it
Let me lick you in places you never been licked before
Take you to places you never been before
Like London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside
We can share it, J and B without the marriage
Horse and carriage, señorita
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza
Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'ma bite into your peach
And um, I think about to massage your feet
And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep
And um, I must look amazing with you
'Cause every time you on my arm I got

All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck

'Member when you used to curve me, leave my text message unread?
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and

All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you

Lookin' at me like you love me
We can do it now or later
She wan' lick on party favorite
On my wave, tryna surf it up
Know we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up
Certified with the double-M pullin' up
Tooly got a room, we'll play ""Room Up In Here"", been here
Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up (You want me to say your name huh?)
But you know when we get together (Karrueche)

All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck

Ayo it's time for the function
Time to bring dinner to all of these niggas luncheon
This for 2Pac, Heron, Bountry
Halloween mask, carve one of you pumpkins
Empty the pills out, fire up the purp now
Game is back, lil niggas pull your skirt down
Flow ice cold, Max Julian on a ho
Used to run the rock, Jim Brown in the snow
Moncler bomber, armor Under Armour
.38 special 'cause I believe in karma
Double entendre holding your Aunt Sandra
Then we can talk the location, I left your mama
Lost on the ganja, letting my mind wander
Made for the drama like a fucking mixtape
Use a Phantom in a drive-by nigga and switch plates
Getting the bigger pool the only way to diss Drake

I'll smoke your lil mafia in front of you nigga
Left Aftermath 'cause I wanted to nigga
Still pull up on Dre and smoke a blunt or two, nigga
It's lit, came in the game like a red nose pit
You got business in LA? I dead your shit
Shut video shoots down, turn airplanes around
Knowledge in belly anonymous rounds
Tryna host AOD and niggas lying you down
Of course the wolves can smell when vagina in town
Turn these niggas inside out like Killa Cam back
Intercepted at the airport, nigga the Rams back
Flying Spur, top missing like Ginobili
Grill all gold, that's my motherfucking whoadie

Give these niggas awards and they still nobodies
I don't go to the Grammys, nigga I bag those
Fuck the BET awards, I done had those
Fuck a freestyle, nigga this a cash flow
Young Jay and I ain't never had a Jaz-O
Ask Kanye ""who the real asshole?""
Cuban links smoking a Cuban, Fidel Castro
Feet up at Mastero's, table full of models
I'mma fuck 'em all, right hand on the Bible
Head game crazy, mommy suicidal
Rubbing on my dick while she download Tidal
This the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
A product of gin and juice inside of my baby bottle

Game,"I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son
Rolling with this one and that one

(Red Wallabies) Buzzing with my Killa Beez
Chronic had my eyes chinky like Compton was the Philippines
Junior prom, red suit, Tasha in that limousine
Tryna suck the head off my dick like a guillotine
Came in her mouth, then gave her some Listerine
Put a condom on and let her grind it like a centipede
(Cash rules everything around me)
Before Dre found me, before my city crowned me
Bummy lil nigga, pussy niggas used to clown me
Had to wear my brother's clothes, them shits used to drown me
6 years passed now I'm banging in the county
Niggas that used to talk shit won't even come around me
Reciting Method Man while my celly just sit there
Niggas know I been on the Wu before Ric Flair
Came home through the hood, GX shining
Now these bitches think I'm Lex Diamonds

Jordan 12's sick as hell, Michael Jordan flu game
Glass jar, Pyrex, obsessed with the blue flame
Lexus coupe, rubbing on them titties boy, 2 Chainz
Top of the food chain, niggas wanna kill me
'Cause I turned into the plug, I'm where the chronic and the pills be
RZA with the rings, Ol' Dirty with the stainless
Five .38 revolvers, thirty-six chambers
Killah like Ghostface, as the Rollie rotate
Daytons on the S-Class equipped with the floor safe
And we had the stash spots with them red and blue tops
Chronic in the GLAAD lock, the dope spot padlocked
In the living room bagging shit up watching Matlock
Black Glock, crack rock bundled in my black socks
And my mama working late, skinny nigga serving weight
Let the chronic circulate the Purple Tape

Game,"It's a trap, it's a trap
Why they ain't tell us red and blue don't matter when you black?
Matter of fact we in blindfolds, bunch of lost souls
Kids shot dead in the streets now they eyes closed
How you call it angels when it's kings getting beat up
And Gil Garcetti in his office with his feet up
No way to dodge police brutality
Selling crack cocaine, making a teacher's salary
Mexicans hopping the borders in the thousands
Become cholos, one button Pendletons, they styling
Crips on the corner in Dodger blue with they gold chains
Bloods sporting corn rows and Chucks with the red strings
Sun going down so them Chevys about to roll out
Fiends scratching themselves, stumbling out the dope house
Niggas tying bandanas, 'bout to put the drum on
Kids tryna make it home 'fore street lights come on

So grab that gun, load that clip
Grab that torch, light that shit, grab that stick
Grab that brick, throw it
It's time to riot if you don't see black owned in the window
It's on fire, start here, end up over there
The smell of gun powder in the air
And just so we clear, this is pain and despair
We burn our own shit and we aware and don't care
Tell the National Guards to disappear
We got guns too and we ain't scared
So fuck the mayor, fuck the President Bush and his legislation
Shit gotta change and we ain't waiting, fuck patience
'Cause the government corrupt, I can prove it
Martin, Malcolm, Huey P. Newton
And that's why the whole city out here looting
How can we stand here and not do shit?
All this smoke over the hood looking like low clouds
Cars with no miles on fire, they broke down
White people wishing that they was at home
Asians fronting like they business is black owned
Far from stupid, we coming in the stores tripping
Running in swap meets for they Jordans and they Pippens
Crowbars, bats, anything that break glass
They fucked Rodney King up and now it's they ass
So it's bottle rockets through the window
Kids that was never smoking endo
Fiends kicking in doors, stealing Nintendos
Niggas robbing liquor stores with taped up ""Duck Hunt"" guns
City burning but it's fucked up fun
National Guards on the corner
They don't know the hood, they foreigners
We was busting at the cops before Chris Dorner
Ghetto birds flying over the hood, they see us
Showing the fuck out, cleaning them trucks out
Niggas mobbing down the streets pushing big screens and baskets
Staring straight into the cameras, no ski mask
Just pandemonium, niggas looting what they homies in
Running around with Scarface guns like they was Tony and them
Who, what, where, when, how the fuck they gon' stop us?
When the last 50 years we accustomed to window shopping
So we taking lighters to the tip of magazines
Dip 'em in gasoline and set this motherfucker on (Fire)

The whole world watching, Los Angeles is on (Fire)

Standing on the corner with a brick in my hand
When my mother told me sit in the van, nah fuck that
Foot Locker chained up, wire cutters cut that
Niggas Crip walking where Reginald Denny's truck at
Police cars, driving by niggas in slow mo
If you white don't stop at the light, 'cause that's a no-no
Running through the malls, give us everything polo
The first time niggas ain't have beef with the cholos
'92, fire lit the skyline, and why we loot?
To capture that forbidden truth 'cause Adam never ate the fruit
Fuck your blue suits, your badge, and them high beams
We out here selling chronic, we ain't have no Jimmy Iovines
Shit burning, you gon' need more than Visine
We making a movie better than anyone that I've seen
Should be on Showtime, HBO, Cinemax
Get a match, we gon' make sure that y'all remember that (Fire)

My daddy was from Nutty Blocc
My uncle was from Nutty Blocc
My mama was from Hoover, how she end up here cuttin' rock?
Four year old on her lap, that was my older sister
Photos of Tookie and my father, now you get the picture
Cutlass outside on D's, you think it wasn't
15 inches, had Computer Love, subbin'
My parents bout to see Rocky at the Compton Drive In
Halfway through the movie her stomach start throbbin'
My pops start panickin', moms in the passenger seat
Scared of contractions so she's stiff as a mannequin
Pops put the car in reverse and then skrt'd out
""Drive motherfucker"" them the words my mom skrt'd out
80 down Wilmington, pull up at Killer King
Rush my mama to her room and let the doctor do his thing
Was a whole lotta blood, yeah I was born in it

Cousin's loadin' Louie Vuitton duffles in the Station Wagon
Fiends walkin' in and out my house in old Nikes
Pops used to tell me: ""Son, don't you ever be like me
The Bloods want to kill me, the cops'll never catch me
And when you gang bangin' life's shorter than Joe Pesci''
Then one night my pops came home off heroin
Shit changed, I'm glad my mama didn't marry him
Molested my sister that night cause she was scared
I was too young to help her and my brothers wasn't there
It was late night, 2AM, my mother at work
My sister came back up the stairs and it was blood on her shirt
Blood on her face, blood on her hands, blood on her legs

Playin' with the birds like Magic, we was the dream team
Posted up on the block, I had that Hakeem lean
Watchin' '64s hop my nigga, no green screen
Walkin' from the Tanas to the Cedars with my eyes closed
Red bandanna in my pocket, how you hide those?

Couldn't cook, burnin' holes in my Dennis Rodman jersey
Then a nigga turned Pippen on these niggas
40 sippin' on these niggas
If you Crippin', we was trippin' on you nigga
But the Crips would never lay down

We thought it was ours so we would empty out the trey pounds

In a 2000 cab I had never performed

I tell 'em there is no need for the glitz
I don't need sparklers, they know that I'm lit
I'm on top of the world, fuck all these girls
I prefer momma to play with my curls

Cock strong since them old Doc songs
Like an old Pac song, outta my mind
The lights on, but I'm not home
Something is wrong with me
I done brought six strippers from Vegas home with me
Trees By Game they getting blown with me
FaceTime with Karrueche, they on the phone with me
Tell K good night, I'm hype, I might ignite

Who's weed I'm stealing and who's bong is this

Now they out of breath, try to speak good

Every publicist who thought that I was mocking hood
Look who tryna to stop him jerk
Look who tryna to rap now

And if it's fucking done, come on how dumb is you?

So it's making you march, wanna yell at me
When I react they call up Penelope's
Bitch ass, trick ass, sniff ass, ho

Go get a sick pass and a bitch badge 'cause you get mad, bro

You know, it spoke right to me
Sweet cream dream girl
Too much, it's just like candy
I won't forget it quickly
Blind ride on highway 80
And I think it's time you learn how to drive
Say hi to the big time
Bright lemon lime memories that rhyme
White lace, bracelet charms and silent alarms
You and I work in factories
We run the big machinery
The will to try leaves slowly
The murder goes on daily
Don't give me phobias walking the cable
We'll go when we're willing and stop when we're able
I wish these cards on no one's table
And when love is crowded out I'm a friend of the family
At the funeral of our love just a friend of the family
Ah, Miss Critical, might find you're minus one now
If there's someone you love now, tell them you love them right now
Have we been cheated of three of our seasons?
How could we break off for such practical reasons?
All the right reasons
Sleep young bride to be no more
Whatever we do now has been done before
I'm going to drive out to the end of the dirt road
To a place where no one living goes
I'm going to run on foot till I can't feel the cold
And find a sunrise so beautiful
It would capture your soul
And shoot it full of holes

And all that I can do is cry

Only a haircut

That I am her true love
She loves a puppet
He's made of flesh and blood

A black man from the motherland
Speakin a language today most people don't understand
Where no one could bother me
Cause I had freedom, justice, and equality
But then one day it was tooken away
And I was shipped to the U.S.A.
A young brother, made into a slave
To harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins
Given a new name, new religion
No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision
I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out
The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about
They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa
And all the blacks there now are just scavengers
That's the way my mind was poisoned
To believe that in America blacks are inferior
A weak mind and a body of swine
Only adds up to being - deaf dumb and blind
Illiterate to who where what and why
So I ask myself: who am I?

A native New Yorker on the streets
Known for rockin' rhymes to real rough beats
That I found in the attic, noisy with static
A sound that made me, a hip-hop fanatic
I made a few songs that sold OK
Never top twenty or plenty airplay
I came out hardcore, flexin' cock diesel
Saw a little cash, and pop goes the weasel
I had to make that change and rearrange
My whole rap format, no hardcore rap
So now all the pop charts I rule
Over New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh
I thought I made it, then my song faded
And none of the black stations ever have played it
I tried to blame it on MTV
And say, ""Damn, they cold played me for Young MC""
But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame
Because I wanted the fame
Money is not only the root of all evil
It's also the destruction of black people, so

There's a need to unwind, that's never been defind
Somewhere deep within, there's another bveing
You are somehow avbusing, by the person you're using

Closer than ever before

The legend of mystery from the beginning of time

We can return to the land of the good and the kind

Why don't you come to our party and open your minds

In another place, there's a newer face
Like an unfinished painting, your creator is waiting
The brush and pen describe, what it is inside
That will set your mind thinking, while the others are sinking

Moonlight night after moonlight night
Side by, side they will se us ride
But if they cared to look, than they would see
It's just our return to fantasy, fantasy, fantasy, oh yeah

Out in a journey, on a mission for the human race
Terrified. I had to realize that I've been takin' to the goods of fire
I got nowhere to stand, 'cause I'm a running man, to get away

All that I see is the years, somewhere out in space
And it's time for deliverance

Tomorrow, I'll see it, another day's rise, right before my eyes
Been sinking in sorrow, but now I'm gonna rise
No more reasons why

I'm a watcher in the dark, I'm so cold inside my heart
I'm a temple in the storm, and I'm bound to be reborn

Take me down to the underground, let me see the gods of fire
'Cause I'm know where they live and I know where they stand,
Another reason there to leave
Take me down, take me down, take me to the underground
I want to meet the gods of fire
And all of their intention is the center of it all

All that I see is the years ... somewhere out in space
and it's time for deliverance
Now that I know I've got to get away
Time for deliverance now

And as the sun appeared, up in the sky
I saw another day,that's drifting by
I saw my people cry, a million tears
Into eternity they disappeared

Now it's time to say goodbye, or we will sink in sorrow
No, we don't know the reason why, another day, tomorrow

Oh, thank you for giving me hope
Oh, follow me into a new life

Dot in the darkness, I am going mad

Endless tortures and pain, millenniums have gone by

Lifeless body, he has no strength to break

Gallops through the sky to break the chains

The chains are broken, silence fills the place

Go on until they are gone, 
The decay of man is true, 
When I watch me in the future, 
When I see the look in your face, 
I feel like a creature, 
Never I will tear your soul apart, 
Never I will make your heart bleed, 
Never - Again, 
Never I will leave you alone again, 
Never I will make you go insane, 
The painful memories of a forgotten world, 
Makes me cry, 
Locked up in a cell, 
With the horrors I created for myself, 
I take what's mine, 
And break it to pieces, 
Just believe my word, 
Never Again, 
Just make a prayer and wait for a miracle, 
From the sky, 
But what you see is a star, 
With new heights to find.",Never Again,1999

Sachez que parfois l’ambiance peut changer
Les coups s’échangent et tu passes du calme au danger
Échoué, le plan a échoué
Tu peux passer du blanc au noir, du bien au mal

1, la soirée se passe ils jouent leur avenir à 2
En 2 minutes hop, ça devient la guerre de Troie
Ils étaient 4 ou 5 sous l’emprise du 666
Et de la weed oui, surtout d'la 8-6
Cette fois-ci stop, ce jeune homme voulait du neuf
S’marier avec sa meuf, bref avoir 10 enfants
Il en a marre des coups, avec ses zinc’ c’est simple
Mais une chose qui est sûre, c’est pas passé 5 sur 5
Un dîner au chandelles, et tout se passe à merveille
Il négocie la main d'la fille en espérant que sa mère veuille
C’est la soirée d'sa vie, depuis hier Samir veille
Il se dit qu’il veut de l’argent propre, qu’il en a marre d’salir l’oseille
Il esquive même son cousin qui lui demande de faire des coups
Des groupes de mecs le cherchent : ils voient sa tête, ils la découpent
Du coup, Samir s’est rangé tout ça grâce à sa petite amie
Il passe une soirée parfaite en songeant à sa petite famille
D’un coup des mecs à l’entrée rentrent, giflent le videur
Déboulent dans le resto à 5 avec Samir dans l’viseur
Courent vers lui à toute vitesse, coups d’bouteilles au futur gendre
Ils mettent des coups d'pression aux gens, des coups de couteaux aux jambes
Des couples goûtent aux insultes y a que le serveur que ça enchante
Ils mettent la go en sang, en plus elle est enceinte
Ils bousillent les tables les chaises et enchaînent le vacarme
Ils débranchent les câbles, vident les caisses et dépouillent le placard
Ils profitent des femmes et d'leurs fesses
Traitent leurs mecs de bâtards (sale bâtard va)
Et ils mettent en flammes toute la pièce c'est devenu un bazar
Changement d’ambiance que d’la peur, personne pour l'dire aux keufs
Belek ici en 10 minutes tu peux passer du rire aux pleurs

Ok 5, re-noi dans une caisse immatriculée Neuf-Quatre
Sur un fond sonore du Prototype 3
Fonçaient vers la capitale quand l’un d'eux
Sortit l’flash de rhum pour se mettre bi-en
Il est minuit 6 quand ça part en cette-su
La caisse fait des loopings, ça devient le grand 8
Dire qu’ils s’étaient mis yes, p'tites vestes, jeans neufs
C’est l’histoire d’un cauchemar hiver 2010
- Allô?
- C’est ""un tel"", bien ou quoi mon gars sûr? J’ai la caisse, ce soir on sort?
- Si si bien vu t’assures!
- Préviens les autres on s’capte au café qui fait l’angle
Ce soir on s’fait pas recal' : j’ai 4 tickets d’entrée
- Ok!
3h plus tard, tu connais les blacks
Mais bon y a le plein pour fuir si un keuf reconnaît la plaque
Du Sexion à fond, direction la capitale
Ça va clasher du tiek’son jusqu’à Pigalle
Flash de rhum pour s’mettre en condition
Mauvaise idée, car maintenant ""un tel"" conduit saoûl
Il serre un peu trop près le taxi devant
Un radar, le taxi pile et c’est l’accident
Le passager devant s’cogne contre le tableau d’bord
Sa boîte crânienne se fracture, un morceau d’cerveau sort
La carrosserie s’écrase comme une canette
C’est maintenant qu’il pense à Dieu et l'appelle à l'aide
Mais c’est trop tard :
Les vitres explosent les bouts de verre s’enfoncent dans les corps
La caisse part en tonneau et fonce dans l’décor
""Un tel"" sort, et voit les gens en ang-s
Voilà ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance

Échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)
Le plan a échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)

Vu l’ambiance, valait mieux décal’ wesh on était pas plus de 7
Debout comme à l’armée à s’esquinter les vertèbres
Faya sous cool-al mais ce coup-ci c’était whisky
Sans cesse à débattre sur le dernier X6
Ce soir c’était nuit blanche des clopes j’en avais plus que 5
4€ d’nnaie-mo pour aller graille' s’mettre ien-b
3 képis qui rodaient en camtar' en moins d’2
Les mains contre le mur au bord des nerfs mais je m’abstiens
Y avait d’la se-ti du pilon c’qu’il faut pour sm’ettre ien-b
La ptite équipe d’élite 2-3 tits-pe qui s’trouvaient dans l’coin
Tout s'passait pour le mieux, mis à part un peu d’boucan
Un contrôle inopiné ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance
A la base, ils étaient venus nous demander d’bouger
Refus d’obtempérer, contrôle d’identité
Comme d’habitude, faut toujours qu’y en ait un qui s'branle qui jacte
Comme chez nous, faut toujours qu’y en ait un pour les ficha
Ce soir là, y’avait l’poto qui dormait dans sa caisse
Réveillé pour donner sa pièce, contrôle alcootest
Il avait bu, il avait mal garé son 307
Brutalisé sous l’me-seu du capitaine et ses collègues
Manque de pot la mif est grande, y’avait 2 d’ses frelons
Ça part en couilles de tous les tés-cô, outrage et rébellion
Strangulations, balayettes, patates dans la mâchoire
Dispersion on s’revoit main-de, là faut vé-squi l’tier-quar

Sourire aux lèvres quand l’ennemie frappe
Comme si j’avais déjà connu ça
Bellek un p’tit gab' peut te steaker tah Tony Jaa
Hum!
Trop violent pour qu’on m’back
Le titre celui qui l’a ramené le nous faut qu’on l’frappe
Ils s’disent qu’après L’Ecrasement y’aura pas d’come back
Hum!
T’en verras pas deux comme Black M
Bériz tu verras des coups semblables à Ong Bak
Des coups du sang des huh!
Wati-B cousin on blague ap

Ok, vas-y descend du ring
Sur la tête de oim c’est ce qu'ils risquent
Ça couche des geuchs des gabarits
Sexion dans l’game ça paralyse
Chez nous ça bé-ton pour bagarre
Chavo tah une prise de K-1
Wati-B sa déboîte connard
Un coup d’tibias t’es dans l’coma
Ça met des gifles avec les ieps
Des coups d’te-tê dans les vre-lé
Ça frôle la nuque et les oreilles
Ça fêle des côtes et casse des zens
Fractures et mises à l’amande
Niveaux KO c’est pas c’qui manque
Une manchette pour finir
Sexion D’Assaut la miff ça casse des membres

Que j’plaise ou non j’peux pas dire «aimez moi»
C’est l’Wati-B pas MMA
Dans le même mois j’écris des textes de barge
J’en ai même les mains moites (Maître Gîms!)
J’vois que ça tourne de l’Ouest a l’Est
Faut que ça pète j’fais mon job comme Abdallah l’coupeur De têtes
(Akhi) On est àl
Nique sa mère si ça merde
J’veux faire mal autant qu’un manchot voudrait embrasser sa mère
On veut des bêtes de clips avec de bêtes de néons
Trop d’choses à dire j’suis encore plein comme le stylo d’un fainéant

A.K.A la silhouette furtive
J’ai enfilé les gants d’boxe ça va s’ressentir sur l’beat
T’as négligé bâtard
Faudra qu’tu t’fasses à l’idée
Désormais j’me déplacerais que pour des fatalities
Fuck you niggas
T’as vu le flow qu’on aiguise
Y’a pas de fond qu’on déguise
Ça c’est pour les faux qui médisent
T’as senti l’impact
Ma haine est compacte
Derrière mes hommes back
On fait foirer ton come back

On dit qu’les chiens font pas des chats
Pourtant trop d’chattes sont des chiennes
L’amour a sharklé la haine
Ton quartier chaque saison saigne
Prend pas trop ta vie à cœur si tu veux pas dead d’un infarctus
Si l’monde est un os ma vie réside dans une fracture
J’fais des dégâts comme un sniper
Atteint par Parkinson
Tu vois flou normal mon rap
N’est qu’une patate qui t’sonne
La vie de quartier est plutôt cool c’est les médias qui rendent sa glauque
Et si ça met des pages de pub c’est pour qu’Fogiel puisse prendre sa coke

Ma vie c’est pas shit chatte chicha chichi
On s’applique sur chaque titre et j’sais ap si ça suffit
J’veux pas non plus être chic

Suicide, soucis sous shit
C’est pire quand ça s’associe (A.D.)
Le énième fils de femme de ménage (Akhi)
J’aimerais savoir quand c’est qu’la hess déménage (Akhi)
J’suis l’homme aux mille lyrics
Mais j’ai qu’une parole
Je t'invite à grailler dans notre plat regarde bien y’a aucune carotte

Poto c’est chaud c’qui s’passe y’a des os qui s’cassent
Dis à tes gosses qu’y s’cassent
Y’a des coups d’genoux des coups d’coudes dans nos couplets
Puis des coups d’têtes
Des coups d’bouteilles et beaucoup d’plaies

Gandhi Djuna,"Les nymphos aiment faire les courses parce qu'il y'a souvent une queue immense 
J'vis dans une monde où certains hommes prennent la mort pour délivrance 
C'est pas en faisant tourner les joints que cette putain d'roue va tourner 
Oukhty (ma soeur), respecte ton vagin car c'est par là qu'on est tous né 
Si on jette pas de fleurs au Darfour, c'est que là-bas c'est la sécheresse 
Les députés ont des langues de putes car beaucoup d'eux sont des lèches-fesses 
Celle que t'aime dévoile la haine dans un miroir fissuré 
Si l'occident pouvait se salir c'est sur l'Afrique qu'il s'essuierait 
J'comprend pas qu'des riches soient gros vu qu'y'a pas d'fric sans suer 
Et comment ils en sont arrivés à trouver une petite fille sensuelle 
Ils doivent se faire monter en l'air pour mieux redescendre sur terre 
On veut tous reposer en paix, pour ça que tout l'monde est en guerre 
Et si la coke est claire c'est qu'elle doit s'prendre dans la nuit noire 
Et si mes pensées sont claires c'est qu'elle est pas encore venue m'voir 
J'avais grave des idéaux, j'ai vu trop d'choses donc j'ai dis « oh » 
J'serais pas l'idiot qui s'baisse chaque jour pour chier et qui s'dit oh 
J'ai pas d'sous et plein d'soucis, une envie fou de s'mettre sous weed 
Bien que la rue soit en béton elle construit pas de mecs solides 
Si l'temps était de l'argent les clochards seraient pressés 
Plus j'prend conscience de la mort plus mon avenir rétréci

J'suis cultivé mais pour la France analphabète 
JR Ochrome a.k.a. la dernière lettre de l'alphabet 
Décevant comme mon statut social 
Délinquant donc pas très fréquentable 
J'guette mon affaire les yeux plissés sur une jambe 
Jongle avec les flammes Rindek (Attention) à pas glisser sur d'l'essence 
Akhi j'suis aussi noir que le tié-quar que j'fréquente 
Si j'te disais que son bitume est cagoulé qu'est-ce que t'en penses ? 
Réfléchis vite quand une bande déboule 
Infériorité numérique ça tue ou ça s'mange des coups 
La rue c'est réaliste en gros c'est crue ter les gars d'chez nous 
Si j'me définissais moi j'serais l'enclume dans un gant d'velours 
Postiché comme des C.R.S. 
On s'fait la guerre on s'fait la gueule quand c'est la hass 
J'cogite régulièrement pour mailler y'a pas d'magie 
Le ghetto t'joue des tours à la David Copperfield 
Paris Centre 75 plus d'une fois j'ai bu la tasse 
Chez moi ça marche rabbate à reculons dans une impasse 
Moi j'reviens d'loin, des keufs des shayatine (diables) sur les côtes 
Avec un p'tit arrière gout d'sucre sur le dos

T'as les poches pleines tu crois p'tet que ton cake sent le Givenchy 
Mais saches que même sur les plus beaux monuments les pigeons chient 
Ce monde est éphémère tout ce qui s'y trouve péri 
Et si t'aimes tant la vie c'est parce qu'elle te camoufle ses rides 
On m'a dit « jettes toi à l'eau » j'ai bu la tasse 
J'ai voulu remonter à bord y'avait plus la place 
Là j'ai compris qu'ici souvent c'est chacun pour soi 
Limite on t'dit « si t'es pas venu pour m'faire un chèque pousses toi » 
J'ai trop ché-mar j'ai des fourmis dans les iepds 
J'me prend une nouvelle paire si j'peux m'les fournir sans les yaip (payer) 
Oui j'ai tourner dans les iefs (fiefs) j'ai p'tet manger plus de 100 tiep 
J'ai vu que ceux qui n'ont rien partagent et que les riches sont sans tièp (pitié) 
J'veux pas finir en iench à quatre te-pa 
Quand la richesse tente de nous phone ici on capte pas
Tu veux diriger ta vie mais t'as pas la clef d'contact 
C'est pour compter leur tune qu'ils t'ont nommé comptable 
Poto, t'es seul avec ou sans amis 
L'amitié perd de sa valeur comme un pain sans sa mie 
Bref, tout ça pour dire qu'en résumé [en résumé] 
Elle fait flipper la race humaine [elle fait flipper la race humaine *3] 

J'essaye de grimper l'échelle sociale avec une jambe de bois 
Je n'attend rien d'une courte échelle vu la hauteur d'mes ambitions 
Dur de démarrer la course avec une paire de Atemi 
Quel âge à celui qui dit qu'avec le temps la douleur s'atténue 
C'est dur de réussir sa vie tout comme de rater sa mort 
Certains me disent depuis le temps que tu fais du rap ça mors ? 
J'ai beau leurs dire qu'on est pas sorti de l'auberge 
Tellement j'en chie de loin tu peux même sentir l'odeur 
Un quart de vie passé avec des sparadraps c'est pas un drame 
On s'barre à Dam attendre le prochain paragraphe 
Akhi, on m'avait dit que la France était un eldorado 
Dès l'atterrissage ils m'ont collé un poisson d'avril dans l'dos 
Les années passent les saisons changent 
Les problèmes viennent plus des cours de maths mais d'avoir la peau mâte 
Comment prouver qu'j'suis oppressé les chaines sont invisibles 
Les mecs s'efforcent de faire dans l'subtile mais restent prévisibles 
Mes gars n'ont plus la forme humaine 
A contresens sur un circuit de formule 1 
Ferme la et range tes formulaires, j'vais te l'formuler 
Autrement j'te l'dis fermement j'veux pas faire l'mulet 

J'suis là pour dénoncer pas là pour faire l'pantin 
C'est plus des carottes qu'on s'mange mais des bananes Plantin 
Belek au sourire d'une femme à cause d'elle tu peux perdre le tien 
La trahison nous fait pâlir jusqu'à en perdre le teint 
Pas d'noirs à la télé si c'n'est pour le Sida 
Et l'seul kain-fry qui a la côte chez Disney c'est Simba 
M'invite pas à table j'suis pas dans mon assiette 
Pas l'habitude des couverts nous on partage un bol à 7 
On m'a dit qu'en grandissant la voisine serait moins souriante 
Qu'avec ou sans dents de lait si c'est la hass les souris entrent 
Que rien n'est sûr chaque être humain est en sursis 
C'qui est sûr c'est que chaque paire de fesses qui passe c'est un souci 
Les p'tits peuvent pas arracher les curs ils sont passés au keus 
Et si la nuit porte conseil, bah elle a zappé les geush 
En résumé crois pas que le temps chôme 
Si le monde te sourit akhi saches qu'il a les dents jaunes 
J'aimerai effacé le numéro de tout mes frères écroués 
Mais dans c'monde rien n'est parfait akhi même la lune est trouée 
J'ai les mains sur le cur, les pieds au sol et la tête vers les cieux 
Donc dîtes aux travelos que j'les appellerai toujours Messieurs 

Paname est vivante mon quartier réside dans son zen 
Quand elle éternue, les bicraveurs tombent et prennent du ferme 
Le monde est subtile, saches que c'est pas la taille qui compte 
Car si le président est un nain bah devant lui tu parais si p'tit 
Panam est un chien sans maître donc fuck l'éducatrice 
Moi, j'suis né dans l'creux d'une cicatrice 
Akhi, tu veux des frissons ? touches moi 
Martin Luther King a fait un rêve et Maître Gims a fait un cauchemar 
Tu trouves ça gore et alors ? 
Censurez moi ça changera rien comme un aveugle dans l'noir 
J'suis foutu, caractère de base têtu 
L'être humain n'est que du sperme vêtu 
Les mécréants voudraient voir Dieu 
Essayes d'abord de regarder le soleil dans les yeux
J'me demande plus quand tout ça cessera 
Marre de m'battre pour un quartier qui porte le nom d'un ciste-ra 
Puis ça m'fait chier 
Donc si une meuf me plaît de trop bah je l'imagine en train d'chier 
J'vise la tête j'ai plus le temps pour les essais 
Et si le monde t'ouvre ses bras bah saches
Qu'il fouette des aisselles
Fouette des aisselles, fouette des aisselles

Moi inch'Allah j'vais pas repartir comme j'suis arriver
En faisant souffrir la daronne encore pire la voir crier 
On ira tous au paradis n'est qu'une chanson d'Enfoirés 
Et tes et tes hassanets ils s'trouvent pas dans tes putains d'soirées
Rien ne marche depuis mes premiers pas
J'me lève tout les jours du pied gauche comme si on m'avait amputé du droit 
Les les qui à dit qui au bled c'est la santé 
Quoi l'argent n'a pas d'odeur tu mens je l'ai senti 
Stop y'a ton gars sûr qui joue au con 
Dis lui qu'il est suivi du regard et que c'est pas celui de la Joconde 
Y'a celui qui mord la vie et celui qui vit la mort 
Dans les deux cas personne peut ves-qui son heure
La beauté de l'homme est dans sa poche 
Si t'es milliardaire t'as l'droit d'être moche 
Religieux que quand ça t'chantes 
Mais les vrais religieux ne chante pas 
Comme d'hab ils diront que les kain-fry divaguent 
Eux ils lisent des livres alors qui y'en a qu'un qui dit vrai
Si l'argent tombait du ciel, ciel ciel ciel
L'avare tiendrait son parapluie à l'envers sans hésiter

J'ai grandi près des quartiers sales et d'la place Vandôme
et j'ai compris qu'mon pote Richesse en fait n'était qu'un fantôme

J'veux mettre aux chiottes les factures akhi mais y'a qu'un seau dos

On m'a dit pour ça faut les tunes 
Mais j'ai pas les loves
Les huissiers ont menacé de m'expulser 
J'les payerai si j'avais assez
Mais j'ai pas les loves 
Je voulais faire de mon père un roi, de ma mère une reine
Leur construire une baraque au bled
Mais j'ai pas les loves
J'veux l'épouser, tout plaquer, m'poser 
Donner la dote que son père a imposée
Mais j'ai pas les loves.

Le diable joue avec nous et avec un rien nous taquine,
On se fatigue mais tout part vite comme dans un karting
Où ta future carcasse est garée dans ton parking.
Le jour se lève et mon heure fait encore un pas,
J'me tape chaque jour pour rendre à dieu mon corps intact,
Car toutes mes affaires en fait s'appellent revient
Et quand je serai dans ma tombe personne me dira je te rejoins.
A la mairie elle t'appartient pour la vie,
Mais cinq ans plus tard avec un autre elle parcourt la ville,
Quant au succès il t'appartient pas, t'accroches ap,
Si tu loupes le co-ch, le public te fait un croche-pattes.
Tout ce qu'on t'a prêté tu le rends
Même ce que tu bouffes tu le rechies,
Dis-leur chut, l'argent est un fidèle poto dealer de shit.
Dès le choc que j'ai reçu en sachant qu'on était seul j'me suis dit
""Mehlich il m'reste la foi donc j'mets mon front au sol""

Du quelque des soucis qui vont te noyer, il faut que tu nages.
T'aimais madame à en mourir, aujourd'hui c'est lui qu'elle aime
Avec la même fougue qu'y'avait dans vos nuits de rêves!
Le propriétaire ne fait que louer une terre jusqu'à sa mort
Ce monde t'appartient autant qu'Hitler avait de remords
La vie est-elle une illusion à laquelle on s'accroche
Ou la plus grande des convictions pour laquelle l'homme devient atroce?
Même mon corps n'est qu'une location j'évite les tatouages,
On s'imagine à la retraite bien qu'on puisse partir à tout âge
Attaché grave à ton pote mais c'est ton pote qui t'a poucave
Il se foutait de la belle époque, il a tout avoué!

Tout est voué à l'échec, les belles villas les grosses caisses,
Six pieds sous terre rongé par les vers!

High school sweethearts, 
love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life
I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we pray

Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl when you lose
Oh it's too hot, too hot, lady
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot, too hot, lady
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago you were my love
Oh my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds

Gang,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose 
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know 
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic 
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head 
He began to dance around

Oh Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play 
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun 
Now before I melt away

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square 
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler Stop
For Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day

""Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about,
cos most groups make most of their songs about falling in love
or how happy they are to be in love,
you occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time -
it's because these groups think there's something very special about it
either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has,
you know to burst into song you have to be inspired
and nothing inspires quite like love.

These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone
by singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love
or so they would have you believe anyway
but these groups seem to go along with what, the belief
that love is deep in everyone's personality.
I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love,
we just don't think that what goes on between two people
should be shrouded with mystery.""

What I've been saying won't say them again
My head's not empty, it's full with my brain
The thoughts I'm thinking
Like piss down a drain

And I feel like a beetle on its back
And there's no way for me to get up
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax

Nothing in there but sunshades for the blind
Only yesterday I said to myself
The things I'm doing are not good

Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about
'Cause most groups make most of their songs about falling in love
Or how happy they are to be in love
You occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time 
It's because these groups think there's something very special about it
Either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has
You know to burst into song you have to be inspired
And nothing inspires quite like love

These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone
By singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love
Or so they would have you believe anyway
But these groups seem to go along with what, the belief
That love is deep in everyone's personality
I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love
We just don't think that what goes on between two people
Should be shrouded with mystery

It's not the lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it

Can't trust the Gods we trusted

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

This wheel spins letting me off
These doubts and nagging worries
Nothing to work towards

The hope that does not fade

Gang of Youths,"You want someone who wants you for who you are
I want someone to try, then let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight
Honey, it’s no secret that with matters of the heart
Unreserved, I’m irrational and rarely ever start
But since the world’s dark and often inhumane
Relish our condition, come drinking in the rain
‘Cause you remember when, after Paris
We all decided the best way to fight it was
Drink wine, dance here and pray
And make love that lasts with avengeance
So you can join the cowards all aboard the outrage train
You can stay afraid, or slit the throat of fear and be brave
And scratch the little itch
'Til you’re moving like a motherfucker up in this bitch

You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and fall in love
Don’t stop, don’t stop believing
In truth and grace in the grievance
You want someone who wants you for who you are
I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

So look at me and tell me what I already know
That I trialed and I failed and it’s good to let it go
Sometimes life sucks, everything is lame
Not everything’s as easy as making lemonade
And so dismembering our state of balance
With lust requited, a gaze undivided
With a cool mind and warmth in your face
A good heart, a grace under pressure
You give me a good reason to be heartsick again
To be here, to be strong, to be oddly and boldly estranged
From the loss and bitter years
I found myself descending into tedium and fear

You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and fall in love
Don’t stop, don’t stop believing
In truth and grace in the grievance
You want someone who wants you for who you are
I want someone to try, then let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

If it’s late, you’re drunk and wanting
A reason, some reason to live
I always, I always say
Just put on some Whitesnake

Honey, it’s no secret that I’ve been losing my way
In the weirdest of moments and the stupidest of ways
But hey, I’m still young and it’s gonna be okay
I got solipsism, baby, and I brought lemonade
I’ll surrender then, all my balance
And be excited and drink to tonight
It’s not a, a bad time, time spent with you
There’s cool lights and songs with good lyrics
We never have to talk again, whatever, up to you
But since you’re putting up with me
Here’s another toast just to you
Let’s dance, off the beat
Then mosey out together and say goodbye on the street

You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and love someone
Don’t stop, don’t stop believing
In truth and personal freedom
I want someone to want me for who I am
I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

Yo, I don't even want to fight with you man
I'll lay you right where you stand
You can catch a few shells
One go right through your polo, man
Usually I'm dolo and I gotta crazy team
Car kissed the ride on you, watch for the laserbeam
Shit, it's that Ol' G Flavor
Remind you of a quarter bodega and that oldie behavior
All point but I ain't tryna scuffle with chumps
My long joints got the culture power plus the double pump
Troublesome, to anyone who stands in the way
I'll stand and I'll spray, FUCK if ya man is in the way
Your girl want me 'cause I do it better than you
The whole world wants me nigga, I'ma legend to you
Like LL, Rakim, Ice-T and them niggaz
Like Cube, Snoop and Dre, I'ma be seenin them figures
It don't matter, you don't have to be likin me man
Keep playin, you'll be layin there, right where you stand
[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Gun on my waist, knife in my hand
I keep tellin you cowards, I'ma leave you there right where you stand
I don't want to talk and I ain't tryna want to fight with ya man
Tryna get it over quick, leave you right where you stand
Some say I'm trifflin, sometimes I'm rightfully am
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma leave you right where you stand
You just mad, you will never be as nice as I am
D-Block, GangStarr leave you right where you stand, what
[Jadakiss]
You want to know why I invest all my money into haze and into dope
'cause right now, I'm currently a slave for Interscope
Respect first, then money - basic shit
If you got niggaz under pressure, you could take they shit
Listen, I'ma leave you right where you stand
Have the ambulance pass ya Timberlands off right to ya man
'cause he pussy, he ain't gonna do nothin but look
When it come to beef, he don't want to do nothing but cook
As soon as the chrome scope him, right there, two in the dome
Smokin, Kiss keep funeral homes open
I fall back, smoke an ounce in the dark
Bounce on a Preme track like I bounce on a NARC
Keep playin, why'all niggaz will burn
and you know they say it takes somethin to happen for niggaz to learn
Let the .40 Cal give em a perm
This industry is like bacteria and my flow is a germ
Just mad 'cause you'll never be as nice as I am
J to the mwah and I'll leave you right where you stand, huh...

I see you got the fear of God in you
We'll tear your heart in two
Too bad you didn't know what you got into
Yeah, the most righteous, till Malcolm got a close likeness
My name carry weight to capitate most vipers
Hot rhymes, spit a dime, hit a case beater
Flow is angry like I'm in your face with heaters
Chasin divas - nah, I don't ever have to do that
P.I. till I die and I laugh at you cats
You happy perhaps 'cause you got dough and bitches
But no love from streets only for moles and snitches
Only from the meatlapin, suckers won't see it happen
Cross that line, then it's time for the heat clappin
I do my thing like the whole planet depends on me
I got game to make Janet want to spend on me
Some say I'm trifflin and sometimes I'm rightfully am
Getcha man, I'll lay him right where he stand
[Chorus]",Rite Where U Stand,
Gang Starr,"[Verse One]
Other MCs in the place know I`m much too much
And I`ll bust `em all up without even cussing
All wannabe`s are never ever gonna be nothin`
Gang Starr`s in the house and we`re crushing
So suckers better be up on their p`s and q`s and
Competition come against me and you`re losing
I`ll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed 'cause you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin`
And never had no problems getting women
I`m like a catalyst causin` a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That`s why the people say that I`m much too much

[Chorus]
I`m much too much
I`m much too much
I`m much too much
I`m much too much

[Verse Two]
Check the G-you-are-you yes the brother who`s progressing
If beats are cake I`m frosting, if salad I`m dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
And kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I`m gettin` kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I`m due and it`s true 'cause you know
A rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch `em later
'cause I`m like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn`t matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape 'cause I`m much too much

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I walk in the room unload a boom that`s like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I`ve rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
'cause the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I`m swift like the breeze
I`ll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That`s the type of crap you know I`m not buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don`t apply and
That`s why I`ve come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I`m controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That`s why everybody knows that I`m much too much

To take my kindness, for weakness, cause they don`t seem to
Respect my generosity, and what it`s costin me
Is headaches, I don`t like fakes, or people bossin me around
You clown, it`s time I beat you down
You tried to play me betray me and slay me, and now you`ll drown
In the river, I`ll give ya, reasons you should shiver
Cause when I get to wreckin and deckin, I won`t forgive ya
You had the opportunity, for bein cool with me
You stabbed me in the back you duck, and now you`re soon to be
Disarmed, embalmed, I`ll break off all your arms
And then your legs, you`ll beg, I`ll crack you like a egg
And spill your yolk, you joke, I`ll duff you in the eye

And as I speak you girlies yell to your friends, ""Yo it`s him!
He`s shockin again!"" This is the season for breezin with reason
Because I`m in, charge of the attack on suckers who just rap on
Wack track that lack that snap, while I just mack on
Honies who look good and, they all want the wood in
They push up, to get up close, to serve me puddin
And I just tell em, ""Look here, I am not a crook there""
But I like to snatch em all, cause like a hook they`re stuck
Struck, they tried to press their luck
They want to tease me and skeeze me and please me, to squeeze the bucks
From my pocket that is bulging, I`m not indulging
In lame games with phony dames, too busy buildin my fortress
Score this, drink while I pour this
I`m livin and givin my rhymes, so I`ll ignore this
Garbage you are runnin, I am not the one and
You`ll never get to vamp me tramp cause I`ll be stunning your mind
I`ll sign, my name on your behind and cool you off
Like frost, I`m leary of the way you double cross
Get lost, I`ll tell you you are fly and say goodbye
And burning and yearing you`ll ask my why
And I`ll reply with a wink of an eye, ""There`ll be no more Mr. Nice Guy""

No More Mr. Nice Guy
No More Mr. Nice Guy

Oh sure, you`re, running back for me
I`ma great you defeat you and beat you, show you the door
Cause you ain`t really welcome, you know you`re seldom
Thinkin of your fellow man, but you still til them
You want to be a friend then, you keep pretendin
You`re two-faced, so you`ll taste, just what I`m sendin
POW, now, you`re shaken sayin WOW
You stare, you fear, my wrath is too severe
I never let up so get up I`m fed up, and I don`t care
I`ll duff you in the eye and you`ll say, ""Why?""
While you`re bleeding and pleading, you`ll start to cry
And I`ll reply, ""Either do or you die,
Cause there`ll be no more Mr. Nice Guy""

No More Mr. Nice Guy",No More Mr. Nice Guy,1989
Gang Starr,"And I would like to play a
Little tune I just composed not so long ago
Ms. Billie Holiday
Byrd?
The music called Jazz

It's roots are in the sounds of the African
Or should I say the mother, bringin' us back again
From the drummin' on the Congo
We came with a strong flow and continue to grow

Feet move, to the beat of the t'balo
Now dig the story and follow
For then it landed, on American soil
Through the sweat, the blood and the toil

Hear, ""Praise the Lord,"" shouted on chain gangs
Pain they felt, but it helped them to maintain
Scott Joplin's rags, Bessie Smith's blues

St. Louis blues, they were all the news
Ringin' smooth in all the listener's ears
Fulfillin' the needs and plantin' the seeds of a jazz thing

King Oliver's group was a train comin' through
To Chicago, bringin' the New Orleans groove
And when Satchmo blew, the audience knew

Basil Street blues was the whole house tune
It was music, great to dance to
Great to romance to, with a lot to say to you
Relaying a message, revealing the essence of a jazz thing

Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music
Jazz music, jazz music, jazz music

In the 40's came be-bop, the first be-bop
The real be-bop, so let me talk about
Diz' and Byrd, givin' the word
Defining how a beat could be so complete

Playing with ferocity, thinkin' with velocity
About ornithology, or anthropology
And even [Incomprehensible], and this is real history

Theolonious Monk, a melodious thunk
No mistakes were made with the notes he played
His conception, was [Incomprehensible]

A star glowing bright among dim lights
The critics did cite that he sounded alright
Charlie Mingus, such nimble fingers
Droppin' the bass, all over the place

And Max Roach, cymbals socking
Bass drum talking, snare drum rocking
Restructuring the metaphysics of a jazz thing

John Coltrane, a man supreme
He was the cream, he was the wise one
The impression of Afro Blue and of the promise
That was not kept, he was a giant step

And there was Ornette Coleman
He was another soul man
The original invisible, playing great music
I wonder why the Bangles couldn't use it

Now listen see, the real mystery is how music history
Created by white men or any other white man
That pretended he originated

And contended that he innovated a jazz thing
Of course we know who can really blow
Scheamin' on the meaning of a jazz thing

And this music ain't dead, so don't be misled
By those who said that jazz was on it's deathbed
'Cause when Betty Carter sings a song
Ain't nuttin' goin' on, but simply good music
And you won't refuse it

She's takin' her time, makin' the nuances rhyme
Sonny Rollins, tenor saxophone
With a big old tone, recitin' poems
With notes as words and haven't you heard
Next stop butter, right past Oleo

Now there's young cats blowin'
And more and more people, yes they will be knowin'
Jazz ain't the past, this music's gonna last
And as the facts unfold, remember who foretold

The 90's, will be the decade of a jazz thing
I love jazz music
A jazz thing
I love jazz music
A jazz thing
I love jazz music

I love jazz music
A jazz thing

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
I got a shitload of story tales in my sack
Please come in, hang your coat on the rag
While you at it, make my coffee black
So I can get the monkey from off my back
15 cents minus 5 is a dime
Sexy young ladies, let's intertwine
Greg N-i-c-e ran it down the line-line

[ VERSE 2: Preacher Earl ]
I'm the P-r-e-a-c-h-e-r, uh
Preacher Earl and I'm considered a superstar
Pick up the microphone and I proceed to rock 'n roll
By the time I sweat I'm out of control
I'm like a locomotive goin express
My lyrics written in spraypaint on the wall (ssss...) def
I'm from Uptown, I'm a gangster from the projects
Either or, take it all, get much respect
Destined for fame when I'm goin for mine
This, this is how I run it down the line

[ VERSE 3: Melo T ]
Hey yo, beats, styles, mics I be flashin
If you step up step in a orderly fashion
See, I collect the dough for the show and then I'm dashin
House parties I'm crashin, pool parties I'm splashin
Eatin candy yams, drinkin Baby Sham, breakin down ( ? )
Got the masterplan, glance at the Melo stance
Arms are crisscrossed, posture rasta
When I wanna go to the mall, I need a helicopter
Rrrrring - I think that's my time
Yo, (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 4: Bass Blaster ]
The biggeda-Bass Blaster with a tongue-twistin rhyme
(This is how we run it down the line)
Yo, literally, literary literature
Six slippery Seals slippin silently ashore
Sally sold seashells down by the seashore
Sold two shells but couldn't see to sell no more
Beautiful babblin brooks bubba between blossom and banks
Brothers above the Brooks take a punch off the plank
A big black bug bit a big black bear, bit him on the rear
The bear was big but the bug didn't care, he had no fear
 
How much would could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Yo, I don't know, all I know is I say it good
Asu, you got the funky, funky rhymes
Yo my brother, run it down the line

[ VERSE 5: Asu ]
Yo, rhymes is rippin and the mic is passed to me
It was too young so they got me for statuatory
Don't take me for granted, punk, yeah, and think I'm worthless
Fuck movin mountains I move planets and you'll be earthless
You don't wanna battle Asu, all I leave is fossils
Lethal Weapons Die Harder cause the Mission's Impossible
And my rhymes is riper, I'm ready to come crisper
Old jacks know that so they go back and whisper
Takin surveys, gettin nervous, I'm just too worthy
They can't stand me and say, 'He can't be from Jersey'

[ VERSE 6: Guru ]
Mad, mad response I'm catchin just as soon as I step into the place
That's why a smile's on my face
I got styles that you trace with haste but I'm too deep
Lots of the ladies I meet, I must be sweet
So I say hold up and wait up and then listen here
My rhymes come crisp and clear, but beware
My format is all that, my concept's refined
The Gang to the S-t-a-double r shines
Chumps be losin it, abusin it, not gainin
So there my gain is they vanish while I'm remainin
And twice as Nice with a Smooth groove I end my rhyme
And yo (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 7: Smooth B ]
Yeah, lyrical, financial and spiritual
A dream of touchin my style would take a miracle
You didn't know how deadly was my flow as I grow
And bumrush and crush any foe
But I prefer to have a good time when I rhyme
But lately I have had to refine and be sublime
Cause sometimes some people don't understand
That I'm a man with ambitious plans and I stand to live grand
And they fight with all their money invested to hold me back
But now I'm featuring the mack pack
Smooth B, you know I'm feelin fine

Gang Starr,"Paragraphs, portraying my viewpoint
So stay attentive, cause this is a new joint
From the G-A-N-G with the info
Lyrical elements emerge from the intro
Forming a poetic mass over pathetic trash
Other writers are outclassed
Surpassed by the words and the wit
Rhymes fit and hit cause that's how we designed it
Page for page, we are the new age
Dope in the videos and dope when we're on stage
Commanding respect with my ink pen while suckers are sinking
As I'm keeping them thinking
Narrating phrases of value, and I can see now you
Relate to what I create
From back in the days of my youth, I've looked for the truth
And yo my rhymes are the real proof
New heights and new realms have been reached
By use of my speech along with one of Premier's beats
So listen and we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A

Worshipful words giving insight, so just be observant
So you can get this right
My oratory gift is abundant, so dazzling to minds
That you should come get
A glimpse of the one who puts wimps out of work
The script is a mess and they dress like they're jerks
Beyond them, is where I'll be dwellin
The Guru will tell em, why their records ain't sellin
Placin my fingers on the tool, I runaway all fools
When I'm dispersin a verse
Think of an enjoyable moment, then boogie your body
Cause this party I own it
The origin of this is on paper
Vibes will ascend from my mind to each line
I go with the flow as I show expertise
The powers increase as my voice hits the streets
Then gripping your soul with authority
I pour these rhymes in a cup so drink up
And then I might bring another round
Watch the sound pound from the floor to the ground
And keep aware, cause we'll show you the best way
And then sway, as I read my S-A",As I Read My S-A,1991
Gang Starr,"Expanding the depth of your brainpower
Ours is a better gift, not to be bragging nor lolligagging
I can see dimensions of sound and light around my mic
Transmitting lyrics like teletype
Reacting to a beat in a whisper
And like a transistor, I'm sounding dope when I'm crisper
The shortest length between two points is a straight line
I've gotta take mine, I heard it through the grapevine
That some can't find hype lines (hype lines...)
And so I'm smothering, over my prey I am hovering
Suckers I'm shoving at the same time covering
You with the blanket of some language that's distinguished
How swift can I get? You ask and I'll tell
For I can excel real well like a gazelle
Past your head, I'm grabbin abstract thought
Like some gain glory, while others get no part
I feel for the hurt ones, the victims of wrong deeds
Awareness is key, our people have strong needs
Science, math, history theology
Philosophy psychology english and biology
Et cetera, and all of these have a purpose
But genocide makes me nervous
So many questions, many opinions to mention
And damn (damn) this jam's beyond comprehension

Like planets in orbit, we ride the life cycle
Some take a rifle on the street cause it seems neat
Whatever turns you on I guess, that's why vests are in season
I'll do my show then I'm leavin
I'd rather be blastin dope sounds on the other side of town
Than be there when they close the place down
But anyway, everyday, there's another way
For a person to just flip, so a brother may
Simply go buckwild, get crazy and mad
I know the struggle my father had
Poetry it comes from within, and will always win
Hold captive bodies from end to end
And at a party, I'll survey then slay with the quickness
Displaying the fitness
Easing the mind and relieving the tension
And singing my own song that's beyond comprehension",Beyond Comprehension,1991
Gang Starr,"You puny protozoa, you`re so minute you didn`t know the
Gang has been watchin but instead of just squashin you
I`m scoopin you up out of the muck you wallow in
Like a chief chemist, other scientists are followin
Plannin to examine you, on a petrie dish
Sticking you and frickin you, just a teenie bit
I`m clever, with science, but never relyin
On false words from cowards who forever be tryin
Insistin they come off, I let `em get some off
Then come back wit drum tracks, their ears could get numb off
Blockbustin, like makin love, i`ll never stop thrustin
Into your system, so just listen
I`m like a neurosurgeon, operatin wit a purer version
I write prescriptions, of words that fit in
The thought gets prescribed, as I kick it live
Cause it`s more that a style, it`s conceptual genius
My effect on the scene is, to project that I mean this
You deadbeat, wait until you see my next feat
I get respect for the rep when I speak
Check the technique

I`m rushin you like a defensive end as I recommend
That you comprehend, I could stomp you in
A battle, contest, or war, what will occur
Will be the forfeiture, of your immature
Insecure for sure, meek, weak visions of grandeur
To rudely awaken you, and then`ll be breakin you
Taxin without askin and trackin and snakin you
Makin you succumb to the drums of gangstarr
By far we are, truly gifted ones son
But if you were to speculate or estimate us losin
You`ll be dyin, tryin to face the fate of your delusions
Cause miscalculation, is all you`re statin
So i`m chumpin, puntin punks just like footballs
Cause I want to put y`all, back in the messhall
To clean up the slop, and stop all the bullcrap
Your rap`s crazy wack, so don`t try to pull that
You`re lackin the vernacular, i`m slappin ya and cappin ya
And closin your jaw, cause you can`t mess with gangstarr
The guru and premier always dope with the blessed beats
Dance your ass off hobbes, check the technique

""Bon voyage"", ""sayanora"", ""arriva derci""
Your ass gets busted doodoo mustard, you tried to work me
You irked me - because you copy and falsify
And I don`t care how many step up, cause you all can try
To wish and fish for a style, here`s a fishin rod
These rhymes are hittin hard, constantly i`m gettin large
Inevitably, I readily kick a slew
Of lyrics so deep, so don`t sleep, but just peep me
Puttin methods on records and spinning for each millisecond
33 rpm`s displays the art of men
And as my rhymin builds you see my time it`s chill
And then I look upon weak ones
I`m teachin each one so they become redone
Essays are relayed to twist you up like french braids
Or tied up like corn braids, cause I got a strong way
Force like police raids to never be delayed
I once was the least paid but I made the grade
Cause this ain`t a slave sale and I ain`t the same stale
Rapper, no, i`m not a phony microphonist wit no blaster
No type of real appeal or real - talent
And it makes me violent man
To see all of these peewee bee mc wannabees
Makin g`s for some dumb companies
And lots of money but no idea what is rap and what is dope
So check out what the guru wrote
Cause I will prevail, give you tales as I unveil
Have enough braincells so I can stay paid well
Now i`m in the driver`s seat, and rockin the liver beats
Bouncin and boomin and blastin you to the next seat
Shiek and unique with lots of kick like a cleat

Gang Starr,"I knew this chump see, he tried to play me
He was my right hand man, but he betrayed me
I let him chill at my crib, cause we were down and
I went to work everyday while he was loungin
He tried to backstab, he kept on jokin
He didn't know he could've got his back broken
I had to cut homeboy off for even tryin that
His game was mad weak, know what I'm sayin black?
Stepped to him quietly, he copped a plea
Told him to fix it or I'd have to catch a body
In this society, there's many snakes
Don't be too eager when you're seeking a break
Cause chumps will exploit, use you to benefit
So just be keen and, learn all the ins of it
I've had my share, of dealing with fake men
I left them squealing, ""It was I who did the taking""
Proceeding exactly, according to plan
I foiled the scheme cause it seemed I was that man
And if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness, the execution of a chump

Now, now, let's get the purpose of it
I'm snatchin hearts out of chumps, cause I deserve to love it
Observin acts of a snake, while I evaluate
Eliminate the nucleus, I'm doin this
Pissed usin fists usin force of any sort
My conscience says it's nonsense, if I put up with it
It meaning sleazy, sorry-type slick types
I'll drive em all to danger, and make em hitchike
Cause if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness, the execution of a chump

Call me the Guru, known as a spiritual teacher
I'll reach you deftly, directly, correctly so select me
Elect me as your prophet and we'll praise him as I drop it
Pursue this, review this, I knowledge more than buddhist monks, punk
I'll wreck the set and grab a big chunk
Known to be a wise one, known to be a seeker
Following my calling in life, so I can keep the
Minds in line to find devine designs of rhyme
Rewind this on your box one time
But if you step up like the kid who did front
You will bear witness, the execution of a chump",Execution of a Chump (No More Mr. Nice Guy),1991
Gang Starr,"Tell me, do you have a clue of what to do
Can you groove to this smooth tune, you must presume
It's important, for you to follow this creation
And hey Son, life is more than having fun
So run and get some help with the problems that you face
Take a taste of the bass put your perspective in place
Get real, deep, so you can keep involved
Revolve and solve, so you can make the calls
Like a supervisor he who is wiser than the others
'Cause they need someone to advise them to discover
Things that they don't know so the papers I will check
Then they'll start to grow to this form of intellect

When the road is too steep, do you have the stamina
First album took us two weeks, since then we have been plannin'
An exclusive attraction, produce it to your satisfaction
Those of you lackin, we will put you back in your slime
So you can think and get a grip of
Yourself by yourself, and then you'll get a sip of
A gift that's equipped with the script that shocks
You can take a walk ?on God?
With your mouth wide open, hoping you can find a
Way to display similar actions in a kind of mockery
'Cause you don't realize the cost to be
Creative genius please, I'm too clean to play
Glance per chance, watch GangStarr perfect
And dance your pants like champs, to this form of intellect

Valuable solutions, we invent here
Break and remake the cupcakes to show we've been sent here
To serve you, so swallow this and bite it
And why bring, ignorance when we're inviting
You to get advancement, while you're on the dance tip
And don't you know the transcript will make you shake hips
Or chill at will, and with skill, you'll learn some etiquette
Better get the subject or be last at the predicate
And get a set, of headphones and speakers
As lyrical lessons manifest, I will keep you
Abrest of the best, in this rap mess
Over-saturated market, full of wackness
I'm Gifted Unlimited, Rhymes Universal
The Guru, nursing you with a verse spilled
Don't choke, and don't turn blue in a frenzy
Premier's severe, on the steel wheels he lends me
Spontaneous cuts, but not mainly just that
It's the scratching format, exact with maddening accuracy
Craftily, on the side or in back of me
Nastily, as if his name was Dick Dastardly
Original so get it yo the Gang gets respect
The chain and the star is a symbol, of this form of intellect",Form of Intellect,1991
Gang Starr,"Many MC`s are mislead
Mislead by the lies that they pump in their heads
The money and the fame that they`re hoping to find
Will never come close to the scope of my rhyme
Now some have been successful but really
And yo, these MC`s are clearly not nearly
Up to this level or should I say caliber
Because I`m hype that the company`s selling me
Because they`ll take a dud, talk some crud and then push him
But in the next year, someone new will just squoosh him
Because when you sell out to appeal to the masses
You have to go back and enroll in some classes
So cash in your check `cause it`s the last one you get
The tables have turn and now you ain`t in effect
So jet to the rear and you better just follow
`Cause what`s here today maybe gone tomorrow

Here and gone in a flash, some made cash
While other suckers go broke real fast
Some never make any money but still they act funny
LIke they`re thinking they`re running
Things, wearing rings and medallions
Then listen to their rhymes when we rather take valiums
`Cause swiftness and skills they are lacking
So I send them packing, they should have know not to tax in
And smashing all of the vocals to smithereens
Watching them collecting themselves `cause they ?(bitter seen)?
But some find happiness while others find sorrow
And what`s here today, maybe gone tomorrow","Here Today, Gone Tomorrow",1991
Gang Starr,"Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes

Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'Cause in the night, you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a 4-5th, I guess you just might
Want to do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew
No matter is you or your brother's a star
He could pop you in check without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame
From the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain
That the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claimin' respect, just to get a rep

Ten brothers in a circle
Had the kid trapped, the one wit the hood, he said, ""we'll hurt you""
If you don't run out your dues and pay
Give up the rolex watch or you won't see another day
See, they were on the attack
And one said, ""yo, you want to make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""now"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep",Just to Get a Rep,1991
Gang Starr,"The meaning of the name GangStarr, well I'll tell ya
It means How far my mind can excel to
A greater type of thought, brought by the things that I've been taught
In relation to things that I rebel to divine and combine
With a sense of confidence
Accomplishments, are achieved on floppy disc
But slopiness, I could never tolerate it
Not the Guru nor Premier you don't know how long we've waited
While other groups have faded, just like haircuts
We use sheer guts to open the earducts of your brain
To expose every vain
Cause you sound plain, insane, and mundane, it's a shame
You've got no beats, so you get no seats
At this table, you ain't stable with the mic cable
Cain and Abel, jealous brothers
And I knew some girls who were overzealous lovers
But back to the act of developing the GangStarr track
It means that nothing can be wack
The music is picked right, the mic is gripped tight
The lyrics I kick right to a beat like Kryptonite power
Not withstood by any mortal or immortal
To make you get on the floor til
Another dope jam we slam with precision
Bringing beams of light, like the colors in a prism
Or reflections, through a spectrum
And all the soft silly suckers I'mma wet them
In other words destroy boy, and then claim my fame...
This is the meaning of the name

GangStarr, it means a lot to me
It means I'm free to bust rhymes sporadically
Gang represents my boys or a posse
So just back up off me
And the Starr symbolizes the power
Making the suckers and weak brothers cower
We got strong, intelligent minds with a street sense
Crazy offense, and stupid defense
Now, have I made myself clear?
Or do I have to call on DJ Premier?
For he and I make up the songs that you long for
Meanwhile ducks just knock on the wrong door
Waiting for a call or for the doors to open
Cause they're hoping, that they'll get chosen
But to be chosen is indeed our gift
You better get a job quick
See you can't rhyme and all your beats are weak
You oughta take a peak and check out the technique
Seek, and you shall find
GangStarr stands for mastermind

Don`t misinterpret or slander

'Cause you`re in the right place, and luckily it`s the right time
And since I`m inclined, I`ll kick precisely the right rhymes

Listen listen listen I`ll tell ya
My rhymes are like shelter, or rather like an umbrella
Protecting you from the weak stuff you heard from those creampuffs
About the schemes that they dreamed of

About the way they slayed this one or that one
But won`t step to me, cause they know the last one
Who tried to match the panache of the Guru
Received a curse that was much worse than voodoo

I got much flavor and class too

Satisfying your cravings, and calming your nerves

Gang Starr,"So many things will happen that one can`t explain
You find yourself saying ""who me"", time and again
They say what goes around, comes around
Ahun, so think about it while you`re messing up clown
A mother`s love and a father`s concern
Here is the reason you should listen and learn
`Cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
I know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
But take it from somebody who knows
`Cause after all the highs, you`re gonna feel all the lows
This is why knowledge of self is essential
`Cause if you don`t have it, you may simply go mental
See, life is not a thing to be toyed wit
`Cause every second, another dream is destroyed wit

And straight to hell is where they`re trying to take us
But never fold and hold back your fears
Have a strong mind and try to say your prayers",Say Your Prayers,1991
Gang Starr,"Once you step in the arena, cheater, you`re gonna be a-
Mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to find a cause, I won`t pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I`m like claws
That`ll rip `cause your gift, is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you, would give it a rest
But if you don`t, I`ll unsheath my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet ya challenger
A true hero, while you`re a through zero
Gettin beat to a pulp so that you can`t run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat, cause you hope that I`ll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check out how I mellowed into it
Face to feet to defeat, you can tell I`m into it
As I`m pullin out my lance, to kill you and advance to
The winner`s throne, cause I own you once you step in the arena

In the arenak, or rather coliseum
There`s people gatherin by multitudes to see one
Perpetrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born wit the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up, makes GangStarr want to snatch up
One or two phrases from the new book with new pages
Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it, to the battle set
If a beat was a princess, I would marry it
But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorius, glorious, understand now
Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, cause you`d rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed or
Struck by a blow, from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
Cause rhymin is serious, I`m strong, I`m like Hercules
You`ll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet cause I wreck once you step in the arena

In the arena or forum, weak MC`s I will floor `em
Causin' mayhem, I`ll slay them, and the blood`ll be pourin'
Furthermore I implore, that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean but none`ll be
Tryin' to toy wit a destroyer of many
You shitted your pants cause you can`t figure any
Foe that can step to this concept so
You better sit again citizen, weak MC`s I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions, cause they didn`t listen
And tried goin' up against a hungry killer who`s itchin
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena",Step in the Arena,1991
Gang Starr,"Presenting you with alternative music
'Cause, yo, the struggle is tough, and we must learn to live through it
Pleasure and pain, pain and pleasure
We gotta maintain a balance to obtain the treasure

Not really preaching or teaching but just reaching
Out to a brother or sister who is keeping
The faith and trying hard to get straight
The time is crucial so I think we must congregate

Let's have a meeting of the minds
Before we all fall and get left far behind
Finding a way is important
Map out a plan, take a stand, you can work it

The future's all in your hands and

Gang Starr,"Well goodness gracious, let me just take this
Time out to pull a rhyme out, and update this
For you and yours, simply because
Some MC's have luck but suck
So I pluck em like feathers on the back of a chicken
Cause I'm mad like a pit when my man says, ""sick 'em""
Positive is the mindstate, but it could still mean that
I will kick a ill, malicious like mean rap
Suckers they forced me, to knock em all out and
They think they know things, like what I'm about and
They try to analyze criticize scandalize
The outcome is death, don't ask me to sympathize
Realize, that I'm not to be played with
I'll flip so fast, you won't know I'm the same kid
I'm tired and fed, with all the weak stuff said
All the phony-baloney, that went out like Pro-Keds
You've got no leads, so you shoot blanks
It's me the crowd thanks as I step to the top ranks
Bankin my money, and investin it wisely
Snatchin up chumps when they try to sneak by me
I'm the dominant one, call me the prominent one
And as I'm speakin I'll be bombin the dumb
Deaf and blind cause I was born with a sharp mind
Eatin MC's with ease like it's lunchtime
Or crunchtime, when they get done without warning
I'll bust that butt from nighttime til morning
Your song's boring, and so I'm scoring
Much points cause when it's time to throw joints
I cause havoc, the mic I grab is like savage
I invade the stage, and make you get off
The force is like a three-eight, blowin your head off
And that's just in case you might be wearin a vest
Cause you're simply a pest in this mess I suggest you

Don't ever sleep son, peep one or two of these lines here
Arranged by a great brain, delivering rhymes clear
And concise with a nice dope voice and
Killin the fakes like a taste of some poison
Punks are thinkin they're alla that, their voices are all flat
They're findin their names, in a Wack Rapper's Almanac
Me follow that hollow crap, no way Jose
I'll seek out a better sound, to somethin Premier plays
Days will go by, and soon you'll know why
MC's like me will rise like the Enterprise
Starship, headin straight for the target
Destination, a place where no perpetration
Is permitted, the Guru is with it to explain
How some MC's are scared to ride on a Four train
Or any other train in the city, for that matter
Playin a role that they stole like a batter
But I know they ain't so I'll paint the real picture
My vocals go solo and like a bolo I'll hitcha
Square in your face I'll crack your ribs and your chest
Cause you thought your off-brand jam was the best
You fessed cause you guessed people would be impressed
I'm gonna bust that bubble on the double ""take a rest""

Sit back and reflect, ponder and chill out
Rhymes like daggers make blood spill out
But you can't blame me, for bringin disaster
With all these ducks, claimin that they're the masters
Only thing they mastered, is how to get wacker
As I roll uphill, they roll downhill faster
Now they're wondering how they lost their touch
Wanna buy my rhymes but mine cost too much
I'm the innovative one, call me the creative one
And I won't stop til the job is done
All the slobs just run when I come to get some
Cause they know better, than to challenge this go-getter
They get bust you can trust cause I won't let a
Booty-ass rapper get wins against me?
I guarantee that I won't act friendly
Cause crabs have a nerve and deserve to get whipped on
Their girls get kissed on, while they get flipped on
I slaughter and slay, or slap em up quick
Cause the lyrics they kick make me seriously sick
No substance, no value, but nevertheless
They're gettin daytime play but I still say they should ""take a rest""",Take a Rest,1991

Havin' the right to choose the one I want
And, if I had a girl, why would I front?
You're only gonna get your feelings hurt, miss
And truthfully I really don't wanna have to diss

How does she know where we live, I didn't tell her
And word is bond, duke, I'm not the fella
No matter what I say this young lady's persistent
For instance, she watches me from a distance
And if I walk by and I forget to say hi
She pushes up on me and rubs me with her thigh
I told her I was taken, but she doesn't care
A-yo, do me a favour, tell her I'm not here
Forget it, I think she heard my voice already

At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book

A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break

Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, cuz now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?

The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less travelled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible
That's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?",Who's Gonna Take the Weight?,1991
Gang Starr,"I'm 2 deep and yes much too complicated
My lines when stated are quite often underrated
So consider it a privilege to hear this
Those weak-minded opinions could never come near this
For my outlook on life is a profound view
Whil the suckers act down thinking that they sound new
Only a few sound true
Me and the crew know who
'Cause you see me and the fellas have been waiting for a while now
Giving you the time to get your wack-ass style down
You punks pop junk as if life is a fantasy
Knowing that hard is something you can`t be
So you front but you could never call my bluff
'Cause you`ll catch hell you`ll get dealt with

[Chorus]
I never sleep
I always peep
Rhymes creep
I`m 2 Deep
I`m 2 Deep....

I forgive you sike I`m takin` your life
'Cause you continue to disrespect so I`ma get trife
But then again I think I`ll spare ya
'Cause I know tht all it takes one rhyme just to scare ya
See I`m the holder of the key 
Don`t ask me if I`m Muslim don`t say nothin` to me 
I said I was raised like one son I had two cousins 
They pushed me to find myself or else they knew I wasn`t
Gonna make it and then end up a statistic
My life was twisted I almost missed it
The chance yes the chance to make you feel good
I used to steal goods and fake my parents out real good
But now I got K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E of self 'cause I`m me
And the nation of Islam has my support 
'Cause they try to reeducate the ones who are lost
And the 5 percent nation takes other steps
To get through to brothers on the corners with the reps
And in the prison they give the brothers new visions
Of how we can gain wealth gain self esteem and dream
Of a total different scene I dress clean, stand lean 
Say what I mean and I`m out
Like a scout on a new route exhibitting clout

[Chorus]

For right now yo my religion is rhyming
Perfect timing test the flow and climb in
Ansaar, Sunnite, Sheite, Jihad
All must regard the times are hard
Unite or perish
Is the message I cherish
That goes for my people of all religions
If we`re all black why have so many divisions
Superficial factors are drawing us apart 
Don`t let it happen
Let`s put some respect back in
So before I act I think 'cause it`s the brink of destruction
Word corruption what`s up son your gun is just one
And I just might have one 
Or two or maybe even three or four
And plus an army of 100 or more
But violence is never my first choice
I come in peace to release the effect of my voice

[Chorus]",2 Deep,1992
Gang Starr,"I'm like a sniper rhymes'll strike ya when I'm rockin
Mad chicks be jockin' when the g starr's talking
And that's because my word is bond
I get much fan mail and I always respond
So tell your hon to write me too
Make sure she puts attention mr. guru
Brothers know the flow is unique
I got 100 wild styles in my black valise
Mc's wanna be me so they keep askin
For me to teach 'em methods both slow and fast
And others wanna act as if they're better
But they only got one style which ain't all that clever
I'm cooler than wind, harder than cold steel
I get the ladies with more than just sex appeal
A mystic psychic scanning all your thoughts
I'll touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
When my rapture traps ya and makes you mine
You'll submit to the gift and to the lyrical lines
So suckers realize that the size is too large
When I come through I'm pullin' whole crews cards
I be wreckin' correct and on the gangster tip
Mc's who front: imma' gonna bust your shit

I wonder do you love it enough
I'm steppin' rugged and tough, never to front or to bluff
I got the fresh cut baldy, the brothers call me
Guru the man yes with all the
J-a-z-z-y type essence, street type lessons manifesting
The one who make the fly ladies feel pleasant
Never forgettin' that to myself I'm true
Do what you want to but watch yourself though ""duke""
I don't wanna hear all of that loud mouthing
Try to pull yours out when nothing comes out
Then you'll see why you can't compete with me
The notorious guru of the gang you see
Starr stands for power like I said before
I'm like the doctors cure slicker than roger moore
I slide up to a crab mc like this
Tap 'em in the head with my mic like this
I'll be revealing that you're weak to the world if you wish
And I insist that if you persist
Then you get creamed, 'cause imma' get real steamed
So don't you try to flex and try to look all mean
Heyo check it that's dead that's it
'cause all you phony ass rappers imma' bust your shit

Now when you see me on the set you know I may unleash
A lyric like a mad dog barking through the speaker
Step off unless you wanna get torn up
Your raps worn out burned out fucked up
You lucked up or maybe you lucked out
'cause at the battle last time you snuck out
But now I'm rolling over you full blast
I'm here to let you know no longer will the bull last
Mc's telling lies and poppin' all those myths
Keep on fakin' moves and imma'",B.Y.S.,1992
Gang Starr,"You can't tell me life was meant to be like this
A black man in a world dominated by whiteness
Ever since the declaration of independence
We've been easily brainwashed by just one sentence
It goes: all men are created equal
That's why corrupt governments kill innocent people
With chemical warfare they created crack and aids
Got the public thinking these were things that black folks made
And every time there's violence shown in the media
Usually it's a black thing so where are they leading ya
To a world full of ignorance, hatred, and prejudice
Tv and the news for years they have fed you this
Foolish notion that blacks are all criminals
Violent, low lifes, and then even animals
I'm telling the truth so some suckers are fearing me
But I must do my part to combat the conspiracy

The S.A.T. is not geared for the lower class
So why waste time even trying to pass
The educational system presumes you to fail
The next place is the corner then after that jail
You've got to understand that this has all been conspired
To put a strain on our brains so that the strong grow tired
It even exists when you go to your church
'Cause up on the wall a white jesus lurks
They use your subconscious to control your will
They've done it for a while and developed the skill
To make you want to kill your own brother man
Black against black you see it's part of their plan
They want to send us to war and they want to ban rap
What they really want to do is get rid of us blacks
Genocide is for real and I hope that you're hearing me
You must be aware to combat the conspiracy

Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold
Now that rap is big business the snakes got bold
They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop
'Cause they have no regard for real hip-hop
They'll compare you to others and say: ""but yo, he sells""
And you know in your heart that he's weak as hell
So you say: ""I ain't doing that corny stuff""
But they tell ya that your chart positions will go up
Sometimes they front big time and make you many promises
And when they break 'em then your mama says
""son you're making records but that guy seems shady""
It could be too late and your career could be played gee
I hope you listen to the things that I'm sharing see
We all have a job to combat the conspiracy",Conspiracy,1992
Gang Starr,"You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me to drop her for it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelects
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my beema goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Bow I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field cuz I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with a grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm on with the next girl

She had much loot liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near cuz of my svoir faire
The time we shared was brief cuz I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad
Yo but she'd tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm straight with the next girl

You saw my mom in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how's my sister then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father cuz you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darlin' was fly and this was the problem
Cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and me I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex-girl to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
Went home to see mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? nah I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl out",Ex Girl to Next Girl,1992
Gang Starr,"Brave is the knave who steps up to be slayed
By the one who forgave him for his first mistakes
He'd best behave, or I`ma send him a wave
Of some shocking volts, he doesn`t know what he`s talkin about
He's kickin a bunch of crap so I`ll be the judge of that
The boy lacks artistry but still he tries hard to be
An entertainer, but instead he`s a waste of
My time and your time so I`ll kick the pure rhymes
Whenever you`re looking for rap that`s exceptional
And credible, straight to the G`s you better go
Cause GangStarr`s known to be prone to be
Masters of streetwise poetry and turntable wizardry
But still be a cold day in Hell when you hear that
Guru or Premier ever tell suckers get sales
But they fail in the long run that kid who went gold yo
That was the wrong one but tonight the spotlight is all on me
I`m the Guru, of the G-A-N-G
Taking out scrubs cause they rub me the wrong way
And I`ll say, that they`ve still got a long way to go
To show they can flow like a real pro
So gimme that loot catch the boot from my steel toe
I`m changing the scenery as I make em uncomfortable
Cause most MC`s ain`t really got no pull
Watch me stifle em quick with the gift and the wit
Make em quit all that riff as I flip the script

[Chorus]

Fool listen, I know that you`ve been missing
All this and so my rhymes are gonna gleem and glisten
Like a gem, and if you are the fake MC type
I`ll shine so bright I`ll be blinding your eyesight
Your capabilities fall short so I`ma treat you like a dwarf
On a basketball court still you try to rap
And even claim you got new styles but
Rolling your tongue`s been playe dout for a while
And you don`t sound fly so why are you doing that?
You had a dope track but you`re wack so you ruined that
I couldn`t make out what you were saying your diction
Is jumbled where as me I`m conveying clear thoughts
To a crowd that`s most critical
Booty duck rappers like you are just pitiful
I bet you couldn`t name more than one pioneer
Cause you didn`t pay dues and you got on on outta nowhere
But that`s OK cause I`m peeping your card
If rap was my house you`d be sweeping the yard
As I recline I`ll find more chores to give ya
Like moppin the floors or maybe fetchin my slippers
So don`t even trip or run off with the lip
Cause as soon as you slip you know I`ll flip the script

[Chorus]

So as I kick a bit flip with script without a skip
Butter roll MC`s get dissed like this
You`ll never got none son because I`ll become troublesome
You rap like a simpleton
And I hate scum yo I can easily deflect your threats
Cause they`re idle my recital will break you down
Just a fight til the end cause I can take ten at a time
Give em all a fair shot to see if any can rhyme
And even if one is decent, I`ll still get props
I`ll kick the slick lines til the last one drops
As my powerful skills are unveiled I`m tippin the scales
And weighing much more than your tall tales
Stop the exaggeration perpetration observe
And make simple notation
Nobody no where no way no how
Is taking me out cause I can throw so you know now
Can you feel it, I bust raps so lay off
Before I steal that so called title that you gave yourself
But you really ain`t jack so yo you played yourself
And now you look from a distance as you sweat my tip
You know I`ll whip you swift when I flip the script",Flip the Script,1992
Gang Starr,"Now I got you looking stiff you numbskull, you`re at a stand still
Still faking that you`re hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
So I`ll easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
Send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
Then if you want you can go call your people
You`re gonna need a mob against me cause I`m lethal
Not that I`m a violent brother to the contrary
My vocals carry, and then I bury
MC`s in holes that they dug for themselves
Couldn`t be themselves so they sold themselves
To a company exec who doesn`t have respect
For real rap music so he wants to get an MC
That starts out street to crossover
But not me, cause I`m the hardcore composer

You ain`t a writer nor a fighter you`re just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite
Of the reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you`re really a crab
So I`ll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
And back to trace my flow but don`t waste your time bro
It only takes a minute a second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick cause I can kick plenty styles
Rhymes stretch many miles
I`m the authentic yes the lyric unloader
The truth exposer, the hardcore composer

All you delirious curious suckers
You better act like you`ve been known I mack
And hold my own with a mike just to stagger
A bragger, retire a lair and very easily
I`m pass by ya cause you didn`t want to give the credit
Where it was due, yeah it was you, uh huh it was you
And your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost and plus you oughta
Find another type of life and yes another source of income
And here`s some advice you can`t rap this nice
I broke ya over and over I told ya
I would mold ya why? Because I`m bound
To give original sound and as your ears pound
Bringing pleasure and pain
As brains start to gain from musical measures
Forming mystical questions never typical inventions
Developed by my Gifted Unlimited mind
Suckers want to rhyme cause they`re eager to find
The secret behind the way that I stomp all comp
Just like a Timberland it`s the Guru and Premier
It`s them again droppin the fly tracks
And taking things over and never selling out
Cause I`m the hardcore composer",Hardcore Composer,1992
Gang Starr,"I say people people come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
[what's your name?] call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
Slander the name and with-hold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going no where
'Cause my strret style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
Mc's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggaz better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm bout to blow the fuck up because I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
Yeah me and the crew think its about that time
But on the DL you know that Gangstarr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My nautica, asking for a hookup
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate
Before I get irate
And I'll kick your can
From here to Japan
With force you can't withstand
'Cause I'm the muthafuckin' man

Yo right now I got my man Lil' Dap from the Group home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, muthafucka just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip
Lil' Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick
So all you punks hear this
Everytime you riff
The more fame that we get
Muthafuckas act hard
Thinking that they are God
Niggaz just don't understand
Let me be my own man
Did everything on my own
And everyplace wasn't home
Everywhere that I'd rest
I had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind
Brothers doin' mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime
As we're rippin' the lines
Brothers just don't know
How shit got to go
'Cause I was told
To never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto
Dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound
Then I walk with a frown
Another minute
Another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close that's why the Group Home is thick
So everytime you riff the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next
Because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said
Yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around
Tryin' to get down
Niggaz just don't understand
I'm the mutha fuckin' man

And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

I'll tap your jaw
You probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore with more
Dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef
The chief ambassador
Niggaz get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot
Don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before
I tap jaws
Snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars
Vic a style you said was yours
Money grip want to flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us
When we rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lot's of friends, lot's of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, kreeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
I'm a get mines 'cause the crew'll get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands
You know the program I'm the mutha fuckin' man",I'm the Man,1992
Gang Starr,"[Chorus:]
Gotta be the illest brother to claim respect
It takes the illest brother just to get respect
Got to be the illest brother when it`s time to get wreck
Got to be the illest brother when I get my mic check

I`m one of the illest brothers known to man
But if you don`t understand, see I`m a grown man
And I stand 5`8"" and 3 quarters
Giving orders to my sqaudron 'cause I`m like the sergeant 
Or general but let me keep this minimal
I used to hang with kids who like to live trife with a knife
Cutting kids for fun and pulling out much guns
And like riflery champs fellas start to get real amped
Dead bodies lay stamped to the pavement so I gave it some thought
Remembering the brothers who are gone now
I will make a strong vow to make things right
Ignite the mic, get hype and all that
Suckers try to menace but they always fall
Flat to the ground as I astound come around
I`ll put you down about the brothers who think they`re the boss
Think they`re getting large but in the end they pay the cost
Of their lives and that ain`t the way to go out
Even take their boys with `em cause they know their boys will go out
But when it comes to facing some time
They`re like crying like weeping, want to call mom Dukes
But mom Dukes is fed, fed up with the shit you did
She knows that you shot and she knows that you cripples kids
But who`s to judge when you`re trying to survive
The one who moves first might be the one to stay alive
So when you think you`re hard and dominating the set
Just remember the illest brother claims respect!

Like I said I`m an ill kid, so never dare test me
They want to arrest me 'cause i`m causing a frenzy
Fake gangsters come and fake gangsters go
Real gangsters chill 'cause real gangsters know
That quietly you stalk your prey on the down low
'cause too much talk will get you beef on the street
And brothers in the city have to live this way
It may cause dismay but Imma` tell it anyway
Yo guns are easy to get and like a puppet
Some young kid is gonna be the subject of internal oppression
An example of hard times
'cause to make it out the trap in your mind it`s a hard climb
But even if you change and come right and exact
There`s another brother scheming so just watch your back
I know a brother who thought he had it all
But little did he know he was bound for a down fall
He`d pick up the heater and go stick somebody
He wouldn`t give a damn if he killed somebody
'cause if somebody would get in the way of him getting loot
There`d be no hesitation he`d just shoot
It`s like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
Except it`s reality and you don`t see it on TV
Brothers keep dying in the streets 'cause the streets are designed 
To keep you from having peace of mind
I know an old man, he`s got a rifle to stifle 
Any young punk, he hides it under his bunk
And I know a kid who`s been to jail
And he told me that the system had failed him
So now he`s out the joint and he`s like flippin` on kids
And the people in his neighborhood are flippin` their wigs
But you gotta check the move 'cause there`s a reason
A method to the madness and you know what I`m meaning
'cause rather than being the herb, vic, or chump
You can be just like my man cold holding the pump
But living like that you take a chance with your life
But some things in life, sometimes will make you uptight
I`m like an avalanche of knowledge pounding down all fools
All fakes, all snakes
And ones who try to break the rules and regulations
Stipulations made by the GangStarr
You try to flex muscle but you know you can`t hang ha
You`re making me vexed but yeah you can go next
Just remember the illest brother claims respect

[Chorus:]  repeat
Yo money don`t front you know you blew your chance
And now it`s my turn so Imma` take command
'cause I`m like the one who`s got all the juice
I always get loose I got the balls to reduce your crew
Very easily I got more ammo
I`m like the ill kid the psycho man yo
'cause now I`m past the point and I ain`t gonna return
And when it comes to your destruction I ain`t really concerned
About the consequences 'cause I`m living day to day
So who are you to comment about me and my ways.
I get my attitude from living and I never forget
You got to be the illest brother just to claim respect!",The Illest Brother,1992
Gang Starr,"Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their p's and q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed cuz you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist ad now the main attractionn
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Check the G-U-R-U yes the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
And kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true cuz you know
A rapper this nice oughtta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
Cuz I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape cuz I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
Cuz the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm not buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Gang Starr,"As I deliver rhymes with ease and walk around with my head up
I`m dead up serious so don`t be getting too curious
Motherfuckers always want to know what makes me tick
I`ll pull a phrase out quick 'cause I`m dipped and I`m slick
You thought that I would slip 'cause you seen me drinking forty`s
It shocked you then you told your friends you saw me
Well say what you want 'cause all of mine is in tact
In fact I`ll have you open like a hookers gap
I like to catch a buzz 'cause I get into the beats more
MC`s are washed up like dead fish on the seashore
Save the talk 'cause you know I walk that walk
Hitting city to city but I make my home in New York
I know the time with this rap shit 'cause they got it all backwards
They need to take a hint or catch my microphone imprint
Straight to the dome through the skull to the tissue
Call me Guru I`ll diss you if you`re pressing the issue
Not my style to be sweatin` all the stupid ass rumors
I take it as a compliment and fuck you too
If you`re scheming on the chance to put a stain on my name
Don`t even think about it 'cause ain`t no shame in my game

No shame in my game
Stick to the subject I ain`t afraid to be real
A lot of MC`s fake hard just to gain appeal
I like some gangster rap, don`t like the prankster crap
So I get passed all that by kicking straight up facts
There ain`t no reason to shoot unless you got beef
If you pull out and you don`t use it than you may catch grief
Toolies and techs ain`t toys but kids got `em today
And if they`re ready to spray best get the fuck out the way
I try keeping my sanity by thinking of better times
If I write clever rhymes then maybe I`ll climb
But what the hell`s success if the mess ain`t changing
50`s still corrupt stupid gangs still bangin`
Stick up kids still stickin` nasty hookers still trickin`
All the pimps still pimpin` and all the crackheads trippin`
While the dealers still sellin` so I`ll refrain from the yellin`
And the preachin` 'cause who the fuck would I reach man
Niggaz don`t want to stop that, they want to live fat
Who`d want to clean up their act when the papes come in stacks
They live for the minute and they`re all wrapped up in it
It`s an unfortunate state for many it`s too late
Now death stalks the streets and it`s right at your gate
So bug, lose your mind but I ain`t goin` insane
I`ll kick the fly lyrics 'cause ain`t no shame in my game

No shame in my game
Life`s a bitch so who are we to judge each other
I know I got faults I ain`t the only motherfucker
Stuff I heard about you wasn`t too cool you know
Like how you smoke wools and that your girl`s a ho
But I don`t listen to shit unless the story`s legit
Knuckleheads need to quit 'cause they be riding the dilsnick
But I`ll be taking care of business regardless
And when it comes to rhyming you know I`m hitting hardest
So you can kick dirt but in the end you`ll feel pain
You little sucker, there ain`t no shame in my game",No Shame in My Game,1992

New York, New york is where we live and we`re thorough
Never taking shorts 'cause Brooklyn`s the borough
Peace to Uptown, to queens and the Bronx
Long Island and Jersey get as fly as they want
Where we rest is no joke
So let me break it down to sections for you slowpokes
Fort Green, Bedsty, Flatbush, Brownsville
Crown Heights and East New York will be down till
Medina takes respect for the style`s we bring
'cause in Brooklyn, we be into our own thing
Alantic terminals, Redhook Bushwick
Come to Brooklyn frontin, and you`ll get mushed quick
We ain`t just know for flipping and turning out parties
But also for the take no bullshit hotties
On the subject of blackness, well let me share this
Brooklyn is the home for cultural awareness
So in all fairness, you can never compare this
Some good, some bad. little hope for the weak
Dangerous streets and Coney Island Beach
All this included when you go for a tour
Some can get scandolous and outright raw
When you step, step correct and watch where you move
We pay dues so we ain`t trying to lose
Here in Brooklyn
The home of the black and the beautiful
For a ruffrap sound, ain`t a place more suitable
Other cities claim this, and others claim that
But let me give some props to the place where we be at
be	-are-double O- K-l-why-N
I came in for a visit and ever since then
I`ve been incorporated with select personnel
Right here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell

Way down in Brooklyn (3x)
Those who live in Brooklyn know just what I`m talking about

[Verse two:]
Peace to Boston, Philly, Connecticut, DC
All the east coast cities are fly to me
Peace to everybody down south and out west
But for me, Brooklyn, New York is the best
Don`t be afraid to venture over the bridge
Although you may run in to some wild ass kids
Take the j train, the d or the a if you dare
And the 2,3,4,5 also comes here
There`s so much to see 'cause Brooklyn`s historic
Fools act jealous but you have to ignore it
So I just lounge wit the fat clientel
Out here in Brooklyn, the place where we dwell

Gang Starr,"5 carloads deep, time to go do a show
Got a massive crew and we`re ready to roll
So I grab my gear hop in the whip and ride
Premier he`s got the fly dope system inside
But my shit cranks too and we`ve got mad tapes
Of all the underground groups with the lyrics and bass
Off into the New York night we go
Dre large got the camera biggest, Gord`s got three rolls of film
So we can take the macked out photos
Tommy Hill, The Damaja and my man Gunsmoke
Corey and Smurf and Lil Dap`s got a forty
My man Gary and Shiz and the nutcracker Shorty
Mike Rhone, chillin` like Capone
Robinhood, Known as Mel with the clientelle
Mo, JT, Mega, can`t forget black
They`re rockin` sincere, yes the posse`s fat
Out loud pulls up plus there`s Sid and OC
Big Mel from strong island H.L. the one and only
O. Delicious, Ely, Bazz and Eon
And the aroma of the blunts has me thinking beyond
And to the rest of the crew you know the bond is strong
And you know who`s who, so let me not prolong
For this was a night to remember
I had on the beige Tims with the two tone leather
So we get to the jam, the gig, the venue
Then we circled around and then drove in through
The front the place was packed the line was long
I was bobbing my head 'cause the music was on
I turned it down then I peeped to my right
I saw this kid and his girl having a fight
Another kid walked up and mushed the kid in his face
And then the kid pulled out and bust and laid him to waist
A riot broke out girls screaming and scheming crews
Started buck wiling tryna` snatch kids jewels
After that 50 came and turned the party out
And then the ambulance came to take the body out
And we didn`t even get all the equipment out
And we didn`t even get to turn the place out
This can happen often and it`s really fucked up
So I`ll ask you to your face homeboy what`s up
Did you come to see my show or the stupid nigga playoffs
Killing you and killing me it`s the soliloquy of chaos

And if you live in the cities where streets reek warfare
People getting nowhere bot you go for yours there
You`ll find it doesn`t pay to front or play the role
You could get stole or maybe beat with a pole
Then you`ll want to retaliate, regroup and come back
So you set the brothers up for a sneak attack
Whether you die or kill them, it`s another brother dead
But I know you`ll never get that through your head
'Cause we`re mislead and misfed facts, we`re way off
Killing you and killing me, it`s the soliloquy of chaos",Soliloquy of Chaos,1992
Gang Starr,"Get with this get with this 
Get with this 'cause you got no choice
Rappers sometimes you`ll find make dough 
But yo you know they`ve got no voice
Get him off the podium he ain`t no speaker
Yes he`s just a phony and look at his sneakers
Played out of style out of rhymes
He`s out his mind
Lost his way lost his pay
I`m takin` his props so call the cops
You can call `em but I know `em
Sweet MCs I think I`ll ho `em
'Cause they front so very hard and big or small
I`ll break `em all
Ain`t gotta say that I`m the best
My skills will show I passed the test
When it comes to beats and rhymes
We come correctly everytime
And stay tuned

[Chorus]
Stay tuned...

With information like the CNN
I can take you there and then
The rest is up to you to choose
The bottom line is win or lose
Suckers suckers suckers don`t be listening
So I can`t be waitin` on `em
I ain`t got no time to play, do you?
Look at the state of things and tell me true
In the city any city life`s a paradox of good and evil
Many fall into the vicious cycle
Living by the gun or by the rifle
Think they got a reason that ain`t really sure
The death toll rises more
It`s trife the way some live life
I love rap, I like the city
But for a fool I have no pity
There`stoo much suffering too much struggle
Too much injustice and don`t it bug you
Enough for you to press on harder
Against the odds the wayn our forefathers
Made away but foolishly we go astray
Think about it and stay tuned

[Chorus]

What you really oughta do is lay back smooth
As my vocals compliment the slow fat groove
Just for you to blast around the way
Play it nice and loud and hear me say
Gang Starr is hitting `92 and on
Showing how to make a dope rap song
Doing this while some disperse
Then dissolve like specs of dirt
Our music pertains to those who remain
Down with the real not wealth or the fame
Peace out, we`ll be back, stay tuned...

Please stay tuned",Stay Tuned,1992
Gang Starr,"I never thought that you would crab me
Undermine me, and backstab me
But I can see clearly now the rain is gone
The pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
There was a few times I needed your support
But you tried to play me like an indoor sport
Like racquetball, tennis, fool, whatever
All I know is you attempted to be clever
Nevertheless, cleverness can`t impress
Cause now you`ve been expose like a person undressed
Cause I see through you, I`m the Guru
Now what you gonna do when I step to you
And when I pay you back I`ll be hurting you
This ain`t no threat so take it personal

Rap is an art you can`t own no loops
It`s how you hook em up and the rhyme style troop
So don`t even think you could say someone bit
Off your weak beat come on you need to quit
I flip lines and kick rhymes that never sound like yours
There oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows from in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the
Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can`t think as quick
So Premier drops a beat, for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper then take it personal

Don`t be mad cause I don`t come around the way
Like I used to, I don`t have time these days
I`m keeping busy making power moves
Don`t try to say I don`t remember you
You shouldn`t let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by, cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don`t even know
You`re like a daytime talk show, and that`s low
So you can tell everyone, that I`m jerking you
And if you don`t like it kid, take it personal",Take It Personal,1992
Gang Starr,"Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

Take two and pass so we can all get blunted
Don't smoke ciggarettes so my growth ain't stunted
We got at least five head so I rolled a white owl
It's the break of dawn and we're awake like night owls
Phillies are cool but they burn much quicker...
Hey yo come on pass that shit nigga
We lounge to the sounds as we leave from uptown
It's time to go downtown and make some more rounds
This city never sleeps that what sinatra sang
For that fat fat blunt you know I got this thing
So hand it over cause I want to get charred
I'm in love with mary jane she keeps me large
So don't hog it let's get it moving real fast
Everybody just chill and take like two pulls and pass

Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

The club is crowded everyone's up in here
Heyo premier what's that you got there?
It looks like a nice plump blunt in your hand
I just know you're gonna share it with me cause I'm your man
So bust it, I got one too and if you spark up yours
I'll light up mine when it's through
Oh shit, there goes my man the fat mack
We used to get blazed I know he's got a fat sack
Let's go upstairs grab a chair and unwind
So the la la can enhance our minds
The system booming let the bass increase
I find me a seat so I can peep the chic
Ladies and maybe get my homeboys some ass
All you gotta do is take two pulls and pass

Take two and pass
Take two and pass
Take two and pass
So the blunt will last

Even in the morning like the flavor of juice
A blunt adds spice and a blunt can spruce
Up your day but I'm not advertising just telling
Of aspect a part of our lives
And around the way there ain't no shame in our game
Cause the fame is no thing we get together and hang
And since you know I got dash and class
Then I'm after you so take two pulls and pass",Take Two and Pass,1992
Gang Starr,"Strangely enough I've been struck
Affected by her smile
And yo, her style is worthwhile
And knowing that I'm deep like a river
I feel I should give her
Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished
It seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity
My boys they try schoolin' me
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine
This honey is so fine
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy
She mad like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said ""I know the stuff we had planned
But please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man""
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her
She said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things
And she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting
I said, ""Hey baby, please calm down
Cuz I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on?
You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?""
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm lovesick

Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning cuz I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out
So she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few
Some girls that I knew
Stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said ""Hey love, just wait for a second
And won't you just check it?
It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry
So listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed
About havin' trust?
What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey don't you turn your back like that
Come on, this is wack
You're heated up like a thermostat""
Then she stepped off in a whirlwind
And I don't know when
Or if I'm gonna see her again
I coulda sworn she was the right one to pick
But now man I'm just lovesick",Love Sick,1992

A tech nine might come in handy for the next time

Too gold, too bold, too fly for them to stop
The man to respect 'cause I'm ripping up blocks
I gotta get the dough, gotta run the show
I'm flipping like a kilo, stash a million or so
Go for what you feel and deal wit this
'Cause I'm dangerous, I come real wit this
And packing and strapping, it goes along wit the rapping
By any means necessary, you can't get buried
I may come wit a smile but I've been known to get crazy wild

And I've been out here and yes, I've seen you

I make the moves, I'm never faking
'Cause the loot is for the taking

The loot is for the taking

Mad murderer stalk in the night when you walk
Feelings of stone to the bone, I'm a rock
No regrets for doing shit I had to do
I was hard headed and yea, I still am too
But you know I got things under control
So you should slow your roll that's my advice to you bro
A street veteran, sometimes I'm trife as a juvenile
I'll beep your style, you can't fuck wit the golden child
That's why you're riffing but you know you're just ass kissing
You wanna meet'cha maker, I'm a take ya
Or else let the man command
'Cause I'll be ready to get you open, ain't no joking, I jam
So if you wanna know who's really boss
Then try your game, lamb, and end up taking a big loss
If  I don't get my way, you're history
To you, I'm a mystery, you never understand me

I came to get what's due to me 'cause I got clout
I make the moves, I'm never faking

I'm sinister, I'm selling no wolf tickets here
Rolling correct to get my point across clear
Sights in the city make me bitter
And I ain't taking no shit from no sucker nigga
I move swift, always looking for the money to make
I need the cash flow, I got a lot at stake
And I could never go out like a crab
So shut the hell up and put the money in a big bag
Hand it over smooth like
I need fat dough, I got things to do tonight
I'm always on my job, ain't no time to be caught short
And those outta line, pay a fine or get knocked off
It's my turn to clock the duckets
Being broke, nah, I can't fuck wit it
I'm making moves, never faking

Played for everyone, by sons, of the motherland
Sendin out a message of peace, to everybody and
Came across the oceans in chains and shame
Easing the pain, and it was without name
Until some men in New Orleans on Rampart Street
Put out the sounds, and then they gave it a beat
I`m talkin' 'bout Jelly Roll, King, and Satch
I`m talkin' 'bout the music that had no match
Yes the music, and it was born down there
We`re gonna use it, so make the horn sound clear
It`s jazz music...jazz music

Yo, the music that Pops, and other cats made
It stayed, cause people love when they played
To the North, it took a riverboat shuffle
To the big cities, with lots of hustle and bustle
To Chicago, and to the Apple too
This was a scene, that our forefathers knew
Go get your crew, I know they`ll get into
The jazz music... jazz music

The music called jazz had the razzamatazz
It had the flavor, and a lot of pizazz
The big band beat was very neat and unique
The swing was king, it made you tap your feet
There was Benny and Duke and of course the Count Basie
The melody was smooth and yes, very taste
There was Hap, The Prez, and Lady Day and
Dizzy Bird and Miles, they were all playin'
They brought it to the people of the foreign lands
Back across the oceans and the desert sands
Where it echoes in the distant sounds of drums
And it rises with the sun on days begun
This is the music, that we give tribute to
They gave it to us, that`s why we give it to you

And we don't care who's wit cha, got the picture? 
And you don't want to hear the burners go pop 
Gang Starr motherfucker, what, blowin' up the spot 

""I'm bout to blow the fuck up"" 

I go from one format then switch to the next 
Reflex sets the pitch vocals rip through projects 
Crazy shouts are heard all around 
Cause the GangStarr sound carries more weight per pound 
I got some brand new Timbs, so emcees sing new hymns 
You betta repent, come correct, represent 
Or get stomped, smacked and slapped, cap peeled back 
I got you open, and now you cling to my sac 
Get off, hands off, stay off, you're way off 
You rookie motherfuckers it's the finals not the playoffs 
I'll break you up into particles, to small pieces 
Because your brain is miniscule 
You little fool, come learn the tools of the trade 
I made the rules so go to school and get played 
Just when you're thinkin' that your jam is hot 
Up steps the niggaz who be blowin' up the spot",Blowin' up the Spot,1994
Gang Starr,"One two checka, get, down and dirty
And my sounds are worthy of respect
So I'ma flex my text just like a, major takeover
Chumps pass the mic over
Growin more and more nervous when I serve this ass whoopin
Comin straight out of Brooklyn, baldhead from the old school
Born to rule with more class than Billy Dee
To a pussy emcee, you know a wuss emcee
I'm like his worst nightmare when I'm on my killin spree
Pick the vic, who will it be?
Your vote may hold the key
It's up to you, tell us true
Who'll be, herb of the day?
And your fake, you break, when suckers choose, they lose
I'm like lethal, to you and your people
It's like an outrage, when punks step on stage
With the weak show, weak flow, and still make dough
So I'ma take dough from em, and then stum em
Teach em how to really get biz like this
Me and my Gang's gonna swarm, Brainstorm

It takes at least, two to tango, so you can get strangled
From any angle, as I get buck on ducks
All the, sexy girlies wanna push up close to
The man with the most who don't flaunt his ego
Some motherfuckers ain't as gifted
Not everyone can move the crowd and uplift it
I'm swift with the shit like a bullet's trajectory
So don't stand next to me
It's like a, warm sensation when my shells hit
You were wrong, you know what you did so you fell quick
To the pavement, no signs of body movement
See I knew it, yo I had to do it
And it's, cool to duel but don't slip up fool
Cause I'ma leave you dead and stinkin like a sesspool
And all the chicks know what's goin on
Cause baby, there ain't no sunshine when I'm gone
And you can beg for me to stay and parlay
But sorry, I gots to go, got bills to pay
See by nature I'm godly
When I touch the mic, it's never too hard for me
To let out, a mastermind of mad clout
Huh, me and my Gang's gonna swarm... Brainstorm

I'm gonna get ya
You might be bigger than me, so I'ma wet ya
Come into your house to douse it with the
Malatov cocktail, I won't fail
Burn out your eyeballs, and leave a note in braille
So what the fuck you gonna do?
Yea I know I used to act relaxed but now I'm cuckoo
Come into my darkest deepest thoughts
We fought I won, and now you're caught and bein tortured
Water pellets dripped upon your forehead
But you can't move, because you're tied up
Your time's up",Brainstorm,1994
Gang Starr,"Take this for example young brothers want rep
Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crime for fun
And if you ain't down, you'll get played out son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent, pull a screwdriver, and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's open
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buckwild in another court case
It's the code of the streets

They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target, for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets

Nine times out of ten I win, with the skills I be weilding
Got the tec one dealing, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
Anf fuck turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so Imma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling
Maybe criminal or felon dropping gems on your melon
So keep abreast to the GangStarr conquest
Underground ruffnecks, pounds of respect
I've never been afraid to let loose my speech
My brothers know I kick the code of the streets",Code of the Streets,1994
Gang Starr,"I hit the chicks with the nice round heinies
Play a ho like a ho, play a sucka like stymied
Try me, and you'll descend into your end
Never thought it could be you well think again my friend
My pen illuminates, and dooms the fakes
You're soon to break, you're strawberry like shortcake
I'm in that ass with my Timbs all day
You couldn't tarnish my rep, so you crept away
Just behave and be a good son -- or else
I'm bringin the noise cause most emcees are puns
I used to chill in Roxbury now I'm comin outta Brooklyn
Herb niggas are assed out, y'all get tooken
Or taken, and that's word to all rude bwoy Jamaican
I swing bitch, yes I'm crankin
Just like an Alpine, a deadly rhyme, brand spankin new
Pumped to put some lead in your crew
A hollow point shot, cause your weak shallow point's
Not hittin, should've gave up from the beginning
But since you're bluffin with your tape that's trash
Tell your peeps that we comin for datazz

Whose that lurkin in the dark with the hoodie strapped;
Puffin on a blizz, mellow meditatin black?
I ain't impressed cause the rest they fess
Sometimes I wanna flip, clap a hole in they chest
But I lay back, as I prepare for the payback
And drop the master rhymes with the mad crew from wayback
I stay back, I watch, the whole job, you botched
Couldn't maintain, it's like your brain just stopped
But the Gang is on the prowl kid like Lecter
Paint a logo with your blood so you niggas remember
The Chain and the Star, mystical and never typical
The average rap group, ain't even equipped to go
Head up, I'm dead up, you ducks could never last
You fakin jacks, we comin for datazz

I heard some hardheaded punks wanna see me
Jealous of a nigga just because he's on TV
You know the video shows that you be watchin
Call up and request so you can see it more often
My persona sheds more light than a nova
Cause niggas are soldier, yo this war, it ain't over
And ain't no stopping like McFadden and Whitehead
You might get dead, fuckin around like you do
Pursue the knowledge that's available
Before your chump-style game and your punk friends fail you
Gonna dissect your brain for a minute
Look at your puny ass world and what's in it
Nothin, that's how long you've been frontin
I figured by now that you've come up with somethin
But you're still the same snake with my name on your mouth
Wanna know what I'm doin, wanna know why I shine?
Cause I'm the rebirth, so now you gotta see me first
I kick more facts than paperbacks for research
And knees hurt, next you feel em bucklin
The huge pussy look on your face reveals the sucker
Inside of ya, because I checked the way you're ridin the
Jimsome, better sing more than a hymn son
Never sustain the true pain of my wisdom
Never be able to touch GangStarr
True indeed, I believe in takin my words far

I chant eenie meenie, minie moe
I wreck da mic like a pimp pimps hoes
Here's how it goes I am a genius I mean this
I shake this you'll take this
I'm kinda fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meaning my mental state
Still I'm 5 foot 8
Crazy as I wanna be
Cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sorta da boss so get lost
The brotha dat will make you change opinions
Dominions I'm in them when it's time to kick shit from
The heart, plus I get a piece of the action
I'm feelin satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid, too late
When they dip in the kick they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and in still is
I get more props den stunts den Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes and can't lose when I cruise
Out on the expressway
Leavin the Bodega I say ""suave""
Premier's got more beats den barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, neva have ta run

I left my Phillie at home
Do you have another?
I wanna get blunted my brother
Now may I make a mark
Then make a spark over this phat track
Or should I say dope beat
Subtract, delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's comin from way way back
Hey yo Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You hear we quit?
No way, bullshit
I told ya before we come back wit more hits
I provide bright flava, so you could sketch me
Do me a favor, dont try and catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like, paraphenalia
I'm infallable, not into failure
Like a rhinocerus, my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write here tonite to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own cause Smooth B will neva bite",DWYCK,1994

Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfuckin posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills nag you can't compare me
And no we don't make wack tracks
and all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin real facts
I represent set up shit like a tent boy
You're paranoid cause you're my son like Elroy

Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

I be like fascinatin when I be updatin
Cuttin off wack kids, pullin their trump cards
I thump hard, and mak eem say that I'm God

Never know the meaning of [real hardcore]
But I get props like a slogan and no man
Could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connecting complete mic wrecking
No double checking vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to I go all out with no mic
Yeah that's right cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
Cause suckers be like playin themselves to have mass appeal

I know I'm dope but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks but now I'm makin greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop
of pure bomb, just like the seashore I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond I go on and on
For you it's tragic I got magic like wands

And put your money where your mouth is
No time for toys
Your game is weak, get it, so don't sleep
'cause I'll be checking and wrecking ya
When I start to creep
Through the backdoor
I know I caught you out there
You got no clout here
And I doubt there
Is anyway that you can stop the beat down
You better play the background
And sit back down
Chumps like you, I gotta keep'em in line
So prepare to suffer boy, 'cause now you're mine

And make amends for the silly trash you were talking
Take a walk and your shots I'm swatting

I rock all courts
And even get down to give you a rematch
After I wax and tax that butt
When I slam the alley oop
You can rally troops
But I play the awesome defense
I'll pick your pocket
And send you to the bench
With tears in your eyes as you realize

Packed my bags, to leave for good, it was a Monday
Kissed my mother, gave my pops a pound
Then he hugged me, and then he turned around
I threw the duffelbag over my shoulder
It was time to get props kid, cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself jack
So I'ma go for mine, and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move Troop
But I ain't even tryin to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent

And all the spots in Beantown where niggaz carry burners
But I was more turned on by the micraphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin blunts on ?
Or workin in a mail room Uptown, feelin sick and
tired, of payin all these fucked up dues
I wasn't tryin to lose -- I refused
Had a chick Uptown, one in Queens and one in Jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by, is a girlie
But yo I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block, happen nightly
East New York is no joke kid
And peace to my man Hass doin his bad
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin to read
That shit was rough cause my pockets was bare
and like the sayin goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart there ain't no quittin
So I stayed up late, to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin
But fuckit I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin

Smokin up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggaz Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut had to go to Fort Greene
on Myrtle Ave, to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around, and find a chick to go Uptown
and check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much but yo my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin out bein no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin I was on kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank 40's with Tommy, Hill and Gunsmoke
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin every night

My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out

Yo you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Flavors do get deep when you're walking the east
A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it til the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that?  Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet i just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it

Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
and all the honies be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa fuck your girl and I'll drop her
cause she be working on my nerves
and yo I got more gang than the bitch got curves
I'm like gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
and I know, I break your back with my rap like smack
because I'm all that
And so the next time when you're wishing for my downfall
I'm a come back to drown y'all
With stupid lyrics relative to a bloodbath
And stay the fuck out my path",Speak Ya Clout,1994

Night crusaders able to break down barriers

Who am I, I'm the substance that'll make your third eye cry
Too potent, too high in intelligence quotient
when I unleash my speech I'll have you punk rappers open
I won't expose your names and your identities
You know you're phoney get the fuck from in front of me

A few of my crew members like to pack guns
I'm high strung but don't mistake me when I smile
I murder an entire rap chart with my freestyle

Fakes thought I was friendly, at their wakes I was host
Toast without a gun you'd be done
Throw up your hands bitch and now you know you stand to lose one
Choose one metaphor and then choose another
Wax that ass like a bully have you calling your big brother
Although I'm five foot eight they call me sargeant
Got more hoes in my dick than you can fit in the garden
At Madison Square I shot a fair one
So many niggaz knew me that the kid wouldn't dare run

They know they can't take me; the G-A-N-G, you crazy?

Uplift your soul and make the brothers want to roll.
Sixteen years old, with heart that's gold.
Yo, check it, check it out, like this, here we go.
Run around the streets, cold strapped like an alley rat,
But now I'm gettin' much props, like a fat cat.
A young mack, but I don't think I'm all that.
I just can't sweat another brother's bozack.
So what the fuck, y'all movin' on up;
Gonna swim in big bucks, like Scrooge McDuck.
And if ya don't like and you want to step up,
Then open your mouth, and suck my nuts.
Melachi the Nutcracker, I'm always gettin' blacker,
Fatter, I bust a fat rhyme to make your head shatter.
I'm from the Bronx, New York City.

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
or we'll start the wettin up

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow

This world's a twisted maze, but I got the swiftest blades
My swords they can slice and dice precise ways
Those who come against me, can get blazed, sprayed and laid
No trace, just a glimpse of my face, hittin the shade
You look up, there's a full moon in the sky
And all my would-be enemies, yeah they're soon to die
Livin in this warzone, we frequent fly at home
Many of us grow violent prone, ain't tryin to be dyin alone
So I'ma take the competition wit me, Lord forgive me
But a whole bunch, of blood-suckin punks, is out to get me
In a flash of a moment, I slash vital components
Tryin to scheme on me and my team bitch, you know we own this
We can scrap, wit guns, knives, chains and bats
Whatever baby, erase that ass quick fast off the map
Plus they better bring, medical attention after I swing my weapon
Won't be no recovery, no divine intervention
No prevention, from gettin hung in the streets where I'm from

Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher; thoughts will spray
like street sweepers Little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combine, over the frontline
The ten percenters, promotin slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

Yeah; I leave scientists mentally scarred -- triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
and catch a charge shake em down like the riot squad
And they deserve ruin like ancient Rome; I span the universe
and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply you with the fire?
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and more
but our hands are the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn; we come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin
When we die hard, to build the monument to honor us with
humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual -- above the clouds
reigning/raining down, holdin it down

Son you're supposed to be my man, but you ain't wise enough to realize
this is B.I., see I wanna taste the whole cake
Some things in this industry, shit be so fake
Make no mistake, if you're my man you'd understand
about the plan, to stack hundreds of grands (That's right!)
And how to stand, on much more acres of land
And to expand from the days of goin hand to hand
So like I was CEO I do my thing son
and turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
Release a fistful, of rhymes for the fiscal year
MC's are wishful fuckin with this here
They stuck with the tear, for fear they foresake a brother's love
it's clear -- I'd have to be the better man I'm thinkin
The 7th Letter Man ain't got no time for petty speakin (uhh)
So we go our seperate ways I see the fork in the road
I know I blessed you with a portion of gold
and some good fortune to hold, so KEEP THAT
while I keep it movin, just like truckloads
of interstate cargo, taxin niggaz like U.S. embargoes
You my man like I said so all the best
You shoulda known we do shit differently than all of the rest
Can't afford to let a link be, loose in the chain
It's time for us to get mad more, juice in the game
You're buggin son (that's right) that's word to Billy and Fame
So I'ma stay the game, that we play to win (Yeah!)
So I don't care what you say to her or say to him
The object son, is to excel and lead
And niggaz be bluffin fallin for nothin but greed

So don't fool yourself, clown ass nigga!
I always been the type of cat that'll put it on ya
since back in the days when Laze snatched me off the corner
And every since then, the whole game changed
Everybody's against, Lil' ass Fame
They wanna see me stretched out with my back smokin
Left for dead in the street with my back opened
So I don't keep friends I just roll with
niggaz I was RAISED WITH, went out in a BLAZE WITH
In the penile, to B.ville, down to Grayson
And we thick together, in these last days kid
So I don't have what you call friends
cause when it's on then they gone in the end!
But I'ma handle my business indeed
Cause niggaz be bluffin fallin for nothin but greed!

We all aim, for the big picture

See my business is my friendship and my friendship is my business
Can I get a witness?!  (Preach on nigga!)

Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin"" but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
Hi spops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady ass no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him doe
and taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle,fam and all that
He could tell it was him 'cause he wore the same slacks, he wore when
he took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?

Flip big Benz's, flossin all gators
Had it all mapped out,6-8,12th grader
Fresh outta school, he fin' to go lay paper
He had abrother who was hustlin collectin his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under naighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumpin
So now he's sittin on the sidewalk bleedin
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin in the world ain't goin to bring him back
his brother, sittin at the wake wipin tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin the price
while he's starin at the shell
his brothers soul wants hell the trigger man made bail
and you, wouldn't pay the boys mail, and sacrificed the fuckin family

With the burning desire we make it out of the crossfire
Thoughts are higher, elevating and focused
while the path is narrow, for those like us
Primo beats provoke us to meditate like Zen
With the will and the strength, of a million men
While they introspect, where nothing is met
It's been that way for a while so much has come and then went
But I'm confident, a few, are due to redeem
their respective kingdoms, with an abundance of cream

Past trivial pursuits like East and West coast feuds
Come against me on the mic, many and most will lose
Like most dudes, I love this hip-hop, and this rap stuff
But I don't like the shows, where the ignorant act up
While some'll be rippin it, they be in the crowd wildin
Flippin on kids, for the chains and medallions
Or the kid they don't like, from a beef from way back
And decide that's the night, perfect time for payback

Let my offspring feed all three, corpus delectis cost me
Lost and found on enemy ground, quoted although

Make some power moves and tighten up my bankroll 
Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat 
I'm like the black Dutch Schultz when you get me upset 
Five-oh makes me want to flip, Larry Davis style 
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaitin' trial 
It's OK though, cause from grey skies comes blue 
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the Guru 
And this I certify we all should be alerted by 
the traps within the system, our youth is gettin' murdered by 
the D.A. says they got me on a felony 
I'm tryin' to live my life, so what the fuck is you tellin' me? 
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for 
And I take the weight as I did before 
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio 
A rapper arrested, suckers showin' me on video 
Of course I know, that I'm a role model 
But yo this rap life is real life sometimes it's full throttle 
Right now I gotta think about me fuck the industry 
You gets no love, except those who support me

Nothin' happened, mind your business yo step

Let's make moves no discussion 

Peace to my man Hass, and Orange Man payin the cost 
All the twenty-five to lifers all my brothers gettin' tossed 
into the system, supposed to rehabilitate 
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate 
Read, study lessons and build your inner power 
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards 
For example, I know this rich Nigerian 
Powerful American that's proud to be an African 
He asked me why do all us brothers be gettin' trapped 
I told him I'd explain it broke it down in a rap 
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair 
Without esteem for yourself nigga, you goin' nowhere 
And you can swagger like you rule this; Josey Wales 
unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails 
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers 
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more 
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best 
Our rhyme as live as it gets, JFK 2 LAX 
They're always makin' trouble yo, against the righteous 
Killin' us in cold blood, those beats those vipers 
And as I sit feelin' the pain in my wrist 
I vow to myself that I'ma change this shit 
Or at least I gotta try, or part of me will die 
And only by action will any ideas solidify 
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder 
This grown man will make mistakes no longer 
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim 
to their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em 
And so I rip facts to dope tracks I caress

When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven, twenty-one, eighteen, twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone

Steppin' up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial, like saccarhin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lackin' in
Concepts you bite, 'cause your identity ain't tight
Tryin' to be somethin' you're not, like pullin' a knife at a gunfight
I'm troopin' on night air, like flight number 1-0-6,
And gettin' all up in your fuckin' mix
You get me upset, and I got you uptight
'Cause my committee's in your city tonight, a'ight?
We got seventeen million of us, plus two million Indians
That makes nineteen mil, lightin' shit up, like Wild Bill
I be the supreme father, plus the ill kid, with drama
My karma, creates the teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit, before you walk to me, or talk to me
Steppin' to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearin' tracks out the frame
You know my fuckin' name, I rule all game
I'm universal, on all planes, what's your claim?

Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous tropper, verbal nigga, with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer, then I blast ya
Slice precise, like Benihanas, when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the God
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep, in my backyard,
I laugh hard, while your mental, I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror, to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks want to enter this rap scene
Kickin' Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion; the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief, plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fuckin' barber
So what, you made some dough, you best keep on scramblin'
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handlin'
Demandin' that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday

I see myself as the black Rap Messiah
Colossal, spreadin' my gospel through electrical wires
Spit fire through speech, so I can reach each and every
Tom, Dick, and Jerry, slippin' like petroleum jelly
Too busy in the limelight, can't rhyme tight
I got divine right to bring y'all to light
Somethin' ain't right, to be an MC, you gotta thug
Or to thug you gotta be an MC, this shit is bugged
Show love but few; deal with crew and crew only
And think universal, like Sony
Phony pounds and fake hugs is usually avoided
Give a fuck like Pizza Hut, I got to stay Noyd-ed
'Cause that same nigga you trust, could be that same cat
Behind that gat that bust, quiet ya, with the silencer
Keep it hush, ashes to dust, then dust to ashes
Nowadays it's who pull out the fastest, imagine this
Rap shit without this gat shit, or the phony cat
In black, talkin' 'bout how much his Mac spit
But this year, Gang Starr got changes bein' made
No wack shit bein' played, no fake macks gettin' paid
No Versace MC's, with a mouth full of Mo'
Soundin' like a ho, spittin' that old-fashioned show flow
I bombshell that pastel Chanel rap, through a Maxwell
Ever since young Krumb, was taught to rap well
Goin' deep, process of thought, when my eyes closes
Awaken with interpretive robe and sandals, like Moses
Travellin' high sands and Eastern lands, for the answers
Ignorance is spreadin' through the streets, like it was cancer
Too many drinkin' not thinkin', when behind that trigger

She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer

Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot
Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools
It's the Militia
",The Militia,1998
Gang Starr,"No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth baby

They say it's lonely at the top, in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

The same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up, nigga peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although mc's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize, what I have done up to this point
So I'mma get more guys, to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate, or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shining, some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks, will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
Cause they love it, to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is coming to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth

Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

Sometimes you gotta dig deep, when problems come near
Don't fear things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen, to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin, is mad amazin
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin in my bedroom pacin
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin
Suicide? nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinking, or even gettin high
Cause all that's gonna do really, is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit, before
So I oughta be able, to withstand some more
But I'm sweating though, my eyes are turning red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife, and take the bullets out my nine
My only crime, was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect, that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, remembering the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth

""You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!""

Yo I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one, is pointed at your weak ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger, on these fully loaded lines
You're gonna wish I woulda pulled a black nine, I mack dimes
Crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin triflin niggas, and the studio pranksters
Yo lookin at the situation plainly: will you remain g?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator, with the greater data
Revolvin on the tascam much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle, tricky metaphors
I explore more, to expose the core
A lot of emcees, act stupid to me
And we have yet to see, if they can match our longevity
But anyway it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Styles, smooth but rugged -- you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin your hideout, blockin out your sunlight
Your image and your business, were truly not done right
Throw up your he-allah-i now, divine saviors
You got no hand skills there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop, to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
Cause you must meet your moment of truth

They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth",Moment of Truth,1998
Gang Starr,"Yo, yo, gu-rizzi, yo
Yo, whassup, son?
Yo, man, you know what I mean? I need this money, man
Get up, out in these, in these streets, man
Yo, so what's the deal, god?
I'm sayin', what you need though?
Yo, let me have like, two or three, three g's, man
I'm sayin', I'm sayin' son, man
You know what happened last time, though?
I gotta do what I gotta do, man.  I gotta eat, man
Whassup man? Oh, your baby momma stressin' you?
Way past the days of the deuce, me and you stays a crew
Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight, from Crenshaw to Castlegate
Like Pete and C.L., I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York, and all the ways
For certain niggaz to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
'Cause some nights I got so wild, yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't tryin' to hear it, 'cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga, Havoc, said, sometimes you gott
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
'Cause no matter the weather, niggaz be needin' cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond, to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man, Baby Pop, you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you
You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked
Doin' your thing, sewin' shit up on the block?
You need to stop, 'fore you get caught, again
Or you get shot, and I lose another friend
""Any man with the plan, is precise with his life
Think twice""
My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lightin' a fuse, whether it's sneakers or shoes
'Cause somebody always want to step up, to start a feud
It's like settin' it off, but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women, forget floozies and the groupies
'Cause they spell mad problems, from Watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop, 'long as the world's revolvin'
And I recall when niggaz knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry-ass was gettin' kicked out
And they was seein' if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple, and double, with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear 'em in my heart, like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin' dope, coke, or dust
It's killin us; let's take our people, and make a exodus
Annhilation, inhilation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams, and drug schemes of mad cream
'Could be a sad scene when you go to that extreme
""Any man with the plan is precise with his life
Think twice.""

""From New York straight talk, America's best""

Yo, it doesn't make sense, for you to compete against
This New York vibe that gets your whole body tense
Calm down, listen to a brother who knows
Cause the rappers out here come up with mad different types of flows
Switch-up, change-up, yo pull the range up
So we can build on this shit, for real that's how we came up
Used to ride the subway trains back and forth
Now I push an E-Class, four-two-zero of course
Still material gains, make one more aware
Of all the madness and the civil unrest that's out here
I doubt there, is anyplace more complex
You can get lost in the sauce, New York'll have you vexed
Who's next to get served, herbs'll get knocked off
Burning flammable rappers, is how I get my rocks off
I pop your top off as if you were the bottle
Then I'll drain all your fluid, you're better off playing lotto
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday

""From New York straight talk, America's best""
""Yo I'm not new to this I'm true to this"" ""Word up!""
""From New York straight talk, America's best""

True if you can make it out here, you can make it anywhere
That means a lot of rappers, they should stay away from here
Cause we still care, about the total artform
Niggaz could sell more records but they still can't flip a live forum
Plus everybody out here ain't talkin true shit either
Mad niggaz is fakin jacks, I don't like them neither
But the competition keeps me on point
That's why I lamp in the studio composin fresh new joints
From the streets, Medina, Manhattan, Staten, P-Lawn
The struggle continues, everybody wants to be on
The rat race, makes this lifestyle fast paced
I've loved it since the days of fat shoelace
Screwface me all you want, but I'm used to it
I'll never give up rep in New York, I'm true to it
From forty-deuce to Queens, back to East New Yi
We takin no shorts, and plus we showin no pity
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York, we get the money all day everyday

You get bent up, sent up creek, without a paddle
You want to battle? Well I live in New York
So think twice blink twice now your Roley and Lincoln's gone
Don't come into this rap game if you don't belong
You won't be on but for a minute anyway
You're just a scavenger, you don't live this life everyday
Rap is regional, so you can check the demographics
Everybody represent where they live, cause shit is drastic
Confusion, while I'm givin rappers contusions
And people don't realize that real hip-hop is losing
They want to shut us down, and I say, ""Shut up clown!""
Cause New York is too corrupt and too tough to lay down
And just quit, cause MC's out here kick serious lyrics
And I come to you, with my infinite spirit
Not takin nothin from your hood or your set
But GangStarr could be a threat, in New York we rep
That's where it comes from, that's why you're feelin it
So why suppress it, I'd rather be revealin it
Bright lights, big city and dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday

Gang Starr,"Word is bond, these cats been on the mic fantasizing a LOT
So called MC's, wannabe rappers and all that, whatever
You get your knot rocked kid, yo

You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time

So just perhaps, you wanna challenge my style of rap
Talkin bout you bust caps, we know that's just a pile of crap
The underground is where I dwell at
It's where I find my heaven, and where you find your hell at
You're in my clutches now, you get slit up and lit up
just like some Dutches now, see I'm hard to define
My mind travels far, from ghettoes to galaxies
representin GangStarr -- The street life
The reason why my mic ignites, I bring more ruckus
than a nightclub fight, or bar brawl
I'm swingin lyrics like broken glass palm to skull y'all
Hold your head, cause all that weak shit is dead
See the times are changin, and me and my peeps is gettin crazy fed
So remember when you writing your rhymes
Stop fantasizing, and bring some real shit next time
Yeah, bring some real shit, yo

You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine
I rocked you in your knot hope you have better luck next time
You thought you brought your best lines, but they couldn't touch mine

Yo, I do what I have to do to master you and capture you
Until you recognize, what my rapture can do
You thought I wouldn't step up, to keep my rep up
I ain't them other kids, I don't need to play no catchup
I got too much pride for this, I know some niggaz
that'll ride for this, with me it's do or die for this
Street knowledge, intellect and spirituality
My survival package, as I deal with reality
I'm like Fishburne in Hoodlum when I come to do em
Chew em up, spit em out, the most respected no doubt
You seen me in action so act you been knowin
The G-U-R-U, of the Gang, I've been flowing
just like the river Niger all the way to the Hudson
Had so many lyrics stashed, and I couldn't wait to bust some
Lately, I've watched this game evolve and elevate
So now I push my music like drug dealers push weight
Straight like that, straight out the gate
Cause it's never too late, to set this fuckin record straight
But it is too late, for you and your crew son
You had the audacity to come against me, the gifted one?
And Primo with the tracks, to inspire my next line
You've got no wins here, so better luck next time

Yeah yeah
Better luck next time

Gang Starr,"You do your first bid and dirt to get your name known
You never talk too much to get your spot blown
Now you`re no longer just a face in the crowd
You`re gettin so much respect that niggaz might as well bow
And movin up with your hustle like you planned it
Rakin dough like the world`s greatest bandit
Always got one eye open, for the stick-up kids postin
So much cream chumps they can`t understand it
Ladies flock to your jock like it`s golden
Curious, to test the weight you be holdin
but you ain`t got no time, to be chasin felines
If she`s the chick that you pick then she gets chosen
People treat you like you`re ghetto royalty
And all your staff shows you utmost loyalty
You paid your dues, refuse to lose in this scenario
The rep grows bigga, you`re a legend and a hero

Your fame has gotten larger than your life
You`ve got a harem of bitches and killer niggaz that`s hype
They got your back, but you so fly you don`t need em
You shit what you`re eatin so you don`t peep the proceedings
They start schemeing, feeling that you`re too swollen
and that`s the reason why your cash and stash gets stolen
You start perspiring, because you`re paranoid
Still another confrontation that you couldn`t avoid
Prepare for drama, as if you were a stunt man
Back in the days you was a forty and a blunt man
Today you`re a Willie, now the weather`s too chilly
New York City ain`t the place to be frontin
Over your shoulders day and night`s where you look
Your so-called fam ran a scam, and you got shook
Go back to square one, better go talk to your son
See reps grow bigga in the life of a crook

Years ago, we were new jacks to this scene
Showed some effort, made fat records, but still saw no green
Know what I mean? They tried to stifle us
Nigga you could not believe how really ill and trife it was
Fed up so we headed on a serious mission
Wishin, that we could better our position
Two businessmen, Guru and Prim`, we enterprised
Too strong to be stepped on, creatively wise
The dedicated ministers of underground sound
When we`re doin our thing, you know we don`t fuck around
No matter how bizarre and different you think you are
your team wouldn`t dream of competeing with GangStarr
Premier in the rear with the beats and cuts
And Guru with the mic ready to tear shit up

She knows what she wants and just how to get it

She knows what she wants, she's bold so she flaunts
Her hourglass jewels to mad clientele
Rejected oh well, she ain't goin to no hotel
Not the frantic freak type, but if you speak right
You get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
Weekends, she wants to spend your ends
Her shopping spree is colossal, attitude semi-hostile

I take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
I'm type crashin', down like a meteorite
I'm Bogart-ing, mics and whole stages
Destroying MC's dreams, from words to whole pages
Their rapbooks, look more like scrapbooks
With their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin'
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin'
There's been mad signs, for this brother to heed
And while some choose greed, I choose to plant seeds
For your mental, spirit and physical temple
Bob your head to it, there's the water you've been lead to it
Bathe in it, a long time you've been cravin' it
Prance to it, use your third eye and glance through it
Your state of being, becoming advanced through it
While others rhyme with no reason I be breezin
Their mics I seize them, then I try em for treason
I used to always like to hang out
Now I lounge in the rest writin' bombs while tracks bang out
I know you peeped me in the club then

Now I stand here with virtue, of course I could hurt you
Simply with my point of view, and I knew
That many would come, that's why I've chosen
To cut off pathways, and there's no runways or doorways open
For the jokers who ain't focused
And all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
Nothing's blurry, fuck it I got no worries
Hearts and minds, shine bright light with insight
Yeah sense my birthright to set up cyphers with power
Cause mad shit ain't right, like punks in the spotlight

Gang Starr,"""The real, hip-hop""
""MCing, and DJing from your own mind, ya know?""
""I, I guess right now we should start the show""

Who's the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones, and all you knuckleheads
Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
Cause I'm like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack, over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whup ass
Droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin, on it's axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this; so many people
searching for false lift, I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez

""You know my steez""
""Let em know, do your thing y'all""
""Keep it live""
""To the beat y'all""

The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one, to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid but still can't make the fuckin grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo they must wanna fry, they can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort

On the microphone you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks, ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin to be fly, ridin high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes makin fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn he flipped""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder, than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas, yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong

All for the cash man, niggaz'll be ready to blast man
Mad hoes, 'll be quick, to give up the ass man
Traitors, they'll be robbing your stash man
Don't want to end up like the last man

If the price is right, niggaz can get trife awright
They plot and they scheme, all day and all night

Pretendin' that she loved him, only really loved dollars
Holla'd at his man so they could, rendezvous
Said to his man, ""Forget him, I'm fond of you""

So after the screw, she put him down with her plan
The utmost betrayal, this nigga's down with her man
But the sex changed everything, they conspired to snake him
Talked about the best time, and best way, they could take him
While in bed, she told him just where her man kept his dough

She said, ""Yo, tonight he's bout to cop some blow
And I know, there's at least, 50 grand to show
Bring a gat, wear a mask, and come through the window
I'll leave it open for you, he won't never know

So run in, grab the money, later on, you and I can flow
If we do this shit right, he won't fight
Break out with the cash and stay your ass out of sight""
So the nigga sat back, but little did he know

He was about to ruin his life over a silly hoe
And really though, the whole shit went wrong
'Cause when he came through the window and pulled out it was on
Money they was gon' rob was high, on some shit

He said, ""Fuck that shit!"" So they tussled n shit

They didn't know me when I was broke and I was lonely
Only a few came to check me, so they come first...
... And yo our people come next G
We'd go to a club, the Milky Way or the Payday
The outlaw spots, where the music was real hot
And you wasn't there, when the underrated, real MC's
Came equipped... and used to kick slick lyrics
All live, without no lip sync
To a dope crate, building skills from instinct
I'm tired of people, gettin' all excited
I'm not trippin' on just a thing, but I'm delighted
To let you know, that some others be flim-flammin'
I'll let you know, that all this time, we been jammin'

Cause yo they come from the sweet...

While they be sweatin' and pretendin' that they know a real rap sound
But I know some guys, and some ladies, that can fill those spots mate
To promote the real greats
And educate, and get it straight
And mobilizin' the imitators, exposin' the explosive core
I hope to explore
Galaxies of remedies for your wack rap sickness
As I convey relay, mack rap quickness
In this business, I witness trickiness
Some MC's are into stickiness

I didn't get this far overnight, and there's nothin' like

They're misled, and yo they like to squawk too much

Twenty-for track mix, with the deep-ass kick
The objective, is to surely demolish
The chances of the wack takin' all the dollars
Support the brothers who are truly gifted
This way, the odds, could never be shifted
Like my man, you know he works real hard
He's good at what he does and now he lives real large
So why envy him, or anyone in his crew

A good time can become a nightmare so often
Like this nigga I know, that met these chicks on tour
They rocked him to sleep, robbed his ass for cash galore
Skated off in the night, without a trace or a hint
Scheamin tantalizin him, dressed up in lace and shit
Caught that kid out there, all high and dumbfounded
Made him think he was gettin some pussy
He just knew he was gonna pound it

Said we'll make a few million by the next millenium

Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug

Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline

And don't let too many men, receive your treasure

Escape, without givin up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin time

The more lies you sell, and by surprise you fell
Into my deathtrap, right into my clutches
Stupid, you know the God must bless every single mic he touches
I've suffered, just so I could return harder
Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr
I make ya famous, turn around and make ya nameless
Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is
Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one
Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one

So if you stand in my way, I'm gonna have to spray
Learn that if you come against me son you're gonna have to pray
Since back in the day I held the weight and kept my head up
They wanna see the God catch an L it's all a set up
I give no man or thing power over me
Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour, over me?
I'm bolder G, I'm like impossible to stop
I'm like that nigga in the ring with you, impossible to drop
I'm like two magazines fully loaded to your one

Blowing back your wig piece just for the way you're looking at me

Face the consequence of your childish nonsense
I could make your head explode just by my lyrical content
Get you in my scope and metaphorically snipe ya
I never liked ya, I gas that ass and then ignite ya
The flame thrower, make your peeps afraid to know ya
How many times I told ya, play your position small soldier
My heart is colder, makes me wanna resort to violence
Stop beating me in the head son, nah, I'm not buying it

Gang Starr,"[Chorus:]
Yo, you suckers is playin' a role
You niggaz is out of control
This world could swallow you whole
The evil could snatch your soul


Yo nigga put the gun away, or you get done away
If not today there'll be a bullet for you one day
The gun play used to be the forte
As a youth, bustin' shots off the roof for horseplay
But once you get a glimpse of the shots, flyin' at you
You think about the possibility of dying and that's true
You won't be stressin' the gun my son
You'll be askin' the Lord for a chance, just one
Trials and tribulations, critical situations
Read it in revelations, check the configuration
They poison our population no matter your occupation
No matter your congregation, this is a troubled nation

[Chorus x2] 

I've seen the worst of the worst, I've seen the best of the best
Seems like the weight of the world is ridin' on my chest
A universal pain, my soul has absorbed
Don't respect no phonies, don't pay attention to frauds
The Lord only knows the depths of my sorrow
And some don't follow because their brains are hollow
So swallow these words and observe the signs
Yo turbulent times, are disturbin' the minds
of the youth, and ghetto life, is the proof
The only skills that's taught, is how to cock and to shoot
Poverty crack guns, hustlers stack ones
Take money is the motto cause we all lack funds

[Chorus x2] 

Nobody owes you nuttin' so you better get yours
My desire flows like sweat, from my open pores
My sores heal, but still the scars remain
A lot of niggaz gonna feel, much more pain
But yo I guess that's life, it don't make things right
Been through a lot of fights, cause ignorance makes me uptight
And cats be thinkin', that us rappers ain't real
And other cats be thinkin' street life is all about steel
Some of this may be, but yo, look in my face
Cause can't none of why'all bitches ever stand in my place
Pop the Remi, some for L, Tah, 'Pac and Biggie
Really? Niggaz want to stop the jiggy?
Fuck a willie, still you know you gots to dig me
The city, rotten to the core, no pity
The crowds roar, scavengers are out to get me
I want to live, I'm tryin' hard to stay positive

So many have a lonely painful road to travel on

That's some faggot bitch shit y'all are listenin to!
All you dj's are lettin the program directors handcuff you
And sit there and tell you how to mix?! you fuckin robots!
Fuck y'all!

Real talk, serious thoughts
True and livin with a youthful vengeance, yo

(Trust me, I'm as live as it gets)

At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
I show love cause it's a terrible thing to hate
Of course I want money, but I won't compromise
Y'all don't realize, think I won't bomb you guys?
With the truth nigga, stop misleadin the youth nigga
Too many wakes and funerals, that's the proof nigga
Our hood's in danger, kids need guidance
You keep lyin, still the young keep dyin
As I walk through the valley I fear none, yes I'm the chairman
Here with my nigga premier son
And we came to change the game
We represent the pain that's real talk, what's y'all claim to fame?
Rappers simply tracin flows and chasin hoes
Frontin mad hard, that shit's amazin yo
Producers makin tinkerbell beats for them to rhyme on
Their ass if they get on the same stage that I'm on

Our shit be rugged, like the new york streets
Make the wrong move stupid then you lose your seat
Cats be buyin up SoundScans to beef up sales
Niggas wanna crossover, wanna be upscale
Fuck that, that ain't hip-hop, that's somethin else
You're better off back on the ave doin somethin else
All you suckers claimin that you are, thug or gangsta
You disrespect the game by dry-snitchin you prankster
I thank y'all for makin more room for us, uhh
Ashes to dust you wonder who's to trust
My sense of self, and my mental health
Is much more powerful, than any hint of wealth
A lot of niggas get cash, and collect Mercedes
But neglect their ladies, and forget their babies
Then the chicks turn and act like dudes
Cause they reflect our light, so yo act right fool
And this is just a piece of my mind, a thesis of mine
I'mma make moves and I'mma leave you behind
At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
I show love cause it's a terrible thing to hate

While you rap clone phonies only hurtin' the game
I'm too persistent, plus I flow too vicious

Family tradition when I'm randomly spittin'
And girls love my voice, they say it's handsomely different
I never won awards, no Grammys and things
Back in the days did sticks, made niggaz hand me they rings

What goes around comes around, they tried me later
But I survived all the thugged out, grimey capers
My concepts caused more panic than bomb threats
Don't take me for granted because I'm calm and shit
Cause when I FLIP, I'ma take over the ship

Locked room, at a prize fight, before he hit the ring
Like when I tell these corporate leeches they can't get a thing
Or when I tell relentless rappers they had better sing
The position that anyone holds could be up to grabs
I'm waitin' up the ave to see if anyone folds
Since I was twenty-one years old and legal
I knew the difference between gimmicky gangsters and powerful people

I'm the reason, why the game is flipped
I'm the reason, why your aim is missed
I'm the reason why you're mad I only sprained my wrist
The reason my mind frame is trained in this

'Cause you walk around with full pounds by them waist
Deface property, they be laced properly

Gang Starr,"I want the public to know, what goes on
I mean, look at the situation, be real

The names have been changed to protect the innocent
Each step is intricate, I rep magnificent
Knew this kid named Ronnie, used to make cash with Caesar
They made a lot of money back in the 80's crack fever
Caesar was an overachiever, a kingpin and 18-and-a-half
He got knocked and left Ronnie to watch the team and the stash
Plus his crib, his jewels, his whip and his girl
And Ronnie's self-interests had him livin in a different world
He rocked Caesar's chains, he put Caesar's rings
Smokin mad wools all day, with Caesar's change
Not to mention he pushed up on Caesar's wifey
A move like that my man, extremely sheisty
It all got back to Caesar in the bing
They found Ronnie's body in the playground by the swings
Anyone can get it, for sure it don't matter dawg

Dissension can occur from within one's ranks
The chain can be weakened, by just one link
Pricks be galavantin from one crew to the next
Musical click-ass niggas catch two to the chest
My usual guess is that they chose to digress
Disillusioned by greed, causin you to distress
Just do what's best, clean house, leave out
Them punks can't touch what they can't peep out
See I'm a raw nigga, and like my pops I'm a lawgiver
Can't throw a wrench in my game, I'm a boss figure
Take you under my wing, it don't matter God
Dead you if you try to commit, sabotage
Rise for me now, kneel for me now
Time to pass judgment, can't feel for you now
Lay in your bed, accept your fate
Try to clean it up, except you're late

There oughtta be laws against you yapping your jaws

Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can`t think as quick

I`m keeping busy making power moves
Don`t try to say I don`t remember you

To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun

They've got a civic centre but best of the lot
You know what they've got?
Well they've got ambulance men in the main street
Well they've got ambulance men in the main street
Well they've got ambulance men in the main street
And you know you could win

When they sit down waiting for rain to come
Still, there's a pub to be found on every corner in town
Where there's boys in the bar and there's girls in the lounge rooms with their mums
And just to see them, they've got what they want
They've got a sporting complex but best of the lot
You know what they've got?
Well they've got ambulance men in the main street
Well they've got ambulance men in the main street
Well they've got ambulance men in the main street
And you know you could win.

You know I drove home today, I saw the places I'd played
For hours in the sun, five on five, three on one
And the trees had all gone from the street with the school and the radio on
Replaced by arcades filled with people having fun
And just to see them they've got what they want
They've got a civic centre but best of the lot
You know what they've got?

GANGgajang,"""Is this what my life amounts to?""
Says the man with the carnation in his lapel,
""I didn't know it worked this way
I thought every dog had his day""

And he'd believed in the dream
He'd waited on every corner
But now forsaken he explains
It wasn't the temptation of a woman

It was American money
I tell you it made him what he is today
It was American money
He imagined stuffing pictures of Washington
In the pocket of his raincoat

""So where has my family gone to?""
Says the man
From the fortieth floor of his hotel
Well everybody has to pay
But maybe it's in different ways

'Cause he'd believed in the dream
Why he'd met it on every corner
But he never could explain
What could made a man lose his sense of decency

It was American money
I tell you it made him what he is today
It was American money
So don't underestimate the power of
The dollar in your pocket

American money
And there's pictures of Washington
Falling from his pockets

Now they got guns in outer space
And nobody's going to win that race
'Cause when there's nowhere left to hide
You won't be taking sides

Though you believed in the dream
And it was waiting on every corner
But now it's coming down around you
Like bankers jumping from the windows of Wall Street

American money
I tell you it made us what we are today
It was American money
So don't underestimate the power
Of the dollar in your pocket

Mow the lawn and read the papers, the afternoon game will be on the set
Sunday breakfast and an hour at church, I think I'll have a beer with the boys at lunch
Colourful shirts and colourful trousers, just the shot for a spot on the set
They don't worry about tomorrow, today's what counts and they're here today

Well I don't give a damn anyway, new gadgets and fashions of distraction
You know it was different in my day, quiet evenings at home with the family
The bigger they are the bigger they get.

Read the story now lots of adventure, follow the plot and it will take you away
Flashy fights and royal blue murder, anything to take your mind of today
I think I understand just what Sam said, when he said he's gonna live inside his head
Well, interesting facts and fascinating figures, the science of tomorrow is the pulp of today
And I don't find it all so amazing, loud and noisy and totally useless

Well I don't give a damn anyway, new gadgets and fashions of distraction

So this is the car, the car that we bought

Well it's a pressure situation
Life encountered from day today,
Uneasy feelings of uncertainty.
Back by the bywash, out in the open,
Floating down and around and through
A breath of air, the sound of light
Uplifting moments of emotion

The Giver of Life,
You are the Giver of Life.

For what you give now, for what you get
Well it's an endless spinning circle
There is no reason no right or wrong
Just a chord answering a call
Out on the inroads, back on the backtracks
Floating down and around and through
The cry of fire, the sway of soul
Uplifting moments of emotion

The Giver of Life,
You are the Giver of Life.

For what you count on for what you trust
Well it's a precious situation
Out in the cities, sold in the cellars
On the floor into the heart of clubland
The king of beat under the flashing lights
Uplifting moments of emotion

You are the Giver of Life.




",Giver of Life,1992
GANGgajang,"We knew when we began, it wouldn't last forever
But we always thought, somehow it would get better.
There should be love and affection, not rejection,
Love is the key I'm sure, to open every door.
But when love goes away, there's no foundation,
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above
Just another crazy scene, just another nightmare dream,

And it all falls down like a house of cards
And it all falls down like a house of cards

So stop those angry words, they don't prove a thing.
Just look around, and see the mess we're in
Every single day, you know I need you
I need the kind of love I can believe in
But when love goes astray, there's no foundation
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above
Just another crazy scene, just another nightmare dream


When it all falls down like a House of Cards.
And it all falls down like a House of Cards in the wind
It all falls down like a House of Cards falls down.

So stop! those angry words, they don't prove a thing.
Just look around, and see the mess we're in
Every single day, you know I need you
I need the kind of love I can believe in
But when love goes astray, there's no foundation
And no foundation of love means everything is loose above

GANGgajang,"(G.Stapleton)

I keep a picture of you on my wall
Exactly why it's there I can't recall
I think I keep it to remind myself

That what we had was never very clear
I often wondered what it was I feared
But now I hardly think of you at all

Oh no but I climbed the walls
And kept alive
In spite of love
There was no reflection
The sun it was hidden
Behind the belief
That the world had stopped turning

And when the lovers meet as lovers do
These days I rarely even think of you
I turn the TV off and go to bed

Oh no but I climbed the walls
And kept alive
In spite of love
The summer was colder
By half than the winter
And only the calendar
Called it a liar

Oh no but I climbed the walls
And kept alive
In spite of love
There was no reflection
The sun it was hidden
Behind the belief
That the world had stopped turning



",In Spite of Love,1992
GANGgajang,"The luck of the Irish borne of ages past
Has spawned a cruel history, lets hope that luck don't last
It came with the longships and from across the Irish sea
The endless tides of fighting men bought the Ard ris to their knees
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

Then came the English with their reforming ways
The luck of the Irish bore ample fruit in those days
The land was replanted with the winners of English wars
And the only crops harvested were famine and plague and the odd lost cause
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

One day things will change and then you know you will see
Just how lucky they can all really be
When the orange and the green meet on the white in between
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

The luck of the Irish still hangs around their heels
As bombers stop the cities hearts and blood is spilt in the greenest fields
And the orangemen remember, the old horse is yearly shod
To ride again with long dead men and kill or be killed for the one same god.
Oh the luck of the Irish, Oh the luck of the Irish

One day things will change and then you know you will see
Just how lucky they can all really be
When the orange and the green meet on the white in between

When I hear you, when I hear the things you say
I wonder what I'm doing here
Hanging on to what I know is going wrong
Maybe I'm intentionally blind
Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

Is it history repeating itself?
Is it science, biology or something else?
That leads me down familiar streets
Ignoring warnings and the danger signs that I see
Maybe I'm intentionally blind
Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

You tell me you're good for me
And believe me there's no other place I'd rather be
When I'm down and need someone to hold me tight
That's the moment that makes it all alright

Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

GANGgajang,"To the north are the canefields, seas of waving green
And then the fires come, and burn the water
It's a sight to be seen

The men in slouch hats reap the harvest
Brown sticks they place in cages

And then the trains hiss, they carry bounty
From the furnace to the mill

Stick men silhouettes bend against the flame,
Shout above the crackle crunch.

Watch as the ground spits at the sky
A yellow-orange spit from a mouth that will never die




",To the North,1992
GANGgajang,"Every night when the sun goes down and cool air with calm surrounds
The silent garden in which can be found the tree of love
Every night you can find me there with sweating palms and matted hair
And drops of blood dot the sand everywhere under the tree of love

And you can hear them whispering under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every saint and every sinner
As they paw the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Some nights there are many there and murmurs fill the desert air
Odd and evens trying to make a pair under the tree of love
On and on as the darkness falls the wistful sound of the searchers calls
Are heard within and without the walls around the tree of love

And you can hear them talking under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every heel and every hero
As they scour the desert sands for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Last night, before the end, I found myself under the tree again
The branches break as the bones they bend under the tree of love

And you can hear them shouting under the tree of love
And you can see them - under the tree of love can be found every saint and every sinner
As they search the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love
They paw the desert ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love
They scour the ground for the fruit that falls each night from the tree of love

Under the tree of love you will find me waiting

Someday in an ordinary world

We've seen Mother Nature; we've seen her lost and found
Still hanging on her apron strings she spins us all around
So high, so low sometimes so twisted we can't see

Is it rhyme or reason that makes me thinks this way?

We don't seem to know too much our heads are underground
And the future keeps on looming regardless of what we've found

In brick veneer on financed beds. 
In a room, of silent hardiflex 
That certain texture, that certain smell, 
Brings home the heavy days, 
Brings home the the night time swell, 

Out on the patio we'd sit, 
And the humidity we'd breathe, 
We'd watch the lightning crack over canefields 
Laugh and think, this is Australia.

With long diagonals, sloping too. 
And in the distance, through the heat haze, 
In convoys of silence the cattle graze.

I've been feeling old
I got demons on my soul when I'm writing
The beat play the role of a seat on a bike how I ride it
My vices proposed to me nights when I'm trapped in this pain
Ain't my wife when the light drizzle tap on the pain
I'm inside with them
When the sky clear up, still inside tripping
You can see I ain't been sleeping in my eyes, nigga
In the mirror throwing hands, I don't toss fights
I'm heavyweight, get a load of these light niggas
Looking washed online like light linen drying
I'm through trying with niggas
I'm gifted cause my eyes work in different
And I be seeing straight through the skies as my nigga
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these bitches
And these guys what's the difference, I despise of 'em
I dispose of 'em too, I'm a trashman
You don't want trouble dude

You a coyote fucking with a roadrunner fool

Give him a chance to spit his last word, unerve

Now first of all I know my story sound wild
But guess what I swear to god I was a mama's child
You see my mama left me back in 79'
I knew it was gods will so I'm done cryin

You see my mama was the one who
Brought me up, taught me up
And showed me what was good and bad
Now after her I was raised a bastard child

Every now and then I got to see my fuckin' dad
You see my dad was a wicked and wild man
Everytime I saw him he had a fat knot in his head
Sportin' that ??? but I'm lookin' bummy

So didn't fuckin' understand
Prayin' that my dad would step to me
I was chillin in Tennesse
He was livin in Atlanta, G.

Now years rolled on luckly ?unkown?
Mad mad face I'm mad as fuck, uh

That life is a bitch, you pay bills and then you die

Since ?INT? it just wasn't fair to me
I wanted all the luxuries
I'm tired of fuckin' poverty
Now what the hell am I supposed to do

You said don't slang dope, but dope makes my loot
I really didn't have a fuckin' friend in the world
See my grandma tryin' raise 5 boys and 7 girls
And them was only grand kids g

One of them was my brother Gangsta Blac, respect see
Work the life it was the streets
And them South Park niggas in Tennesse SPV
That taught this new dog old tricks

New dog old tricks, yo now ain't that a bitch?
You see me and my brother we hung tight
Fight after fight drinkin' night after night
Enough respect to my niggas like dre

Well I'm happy in November
Whe month before december
The where is and the who was

Growin up as a young buck
Let me tell you how I came up
No life without no mama
Each night I deal with drama

My father was a no-show
His where has I want info
Found out ?and lost? my kinfolks
Much love gotta keep it real though

Been ballin to nintendo
Got niggas through the window
Lookin' cause I can't go out

You had your chance to be real, instead you mappin' out your death

'Cause it's ???, or try to camoflage me

I'm the provider for them, can't be around and not down

To go and get it for us, and we ain't got it no more
What's in store?

No more of stressin' me out, no more of this and the other
No more of upside-down smiles, to cut by you suckas
No more of smokin' your weed, no more of jonesin' for that
Instead I'm grillin' you villains, like they gone keep up the laggin'

No more attackin' my pride, never again hold it in
I buck it once 'fore I duck, trick will get stuck to the vent
No more of thinkin' my talents gone be insured for a mil
'cause if it was, my 'cause, came up and do it for real
No more of dealin' with hoes, I'd rather have me a bitch
'Cause she ain't shit from the start, just keep her slick with the dick

No more of hard-head grindin' that shit round the trunk
Too used to gettin' what I want, so I'm gone keep this shit blunt
No more of layin' in the road, for you to walk over mud

Not the suckas stink, but get'cha straight when all their body numb
Can't compact the garbage that you start producin' orally

Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well
How the hell you been since I had no job
Hum, why don't you give me some
Cause you know I flow and run for Suave
Nah, all of that was on the couch
No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin' in gold

Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their Johnson very dirty
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit

Can't stay out the club
All in the hoe's face
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased
I see him in the back
Countin' up that chedder
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd
I think I know one
I remember you, oh yes I do
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo
What time the club close, at 3
What's up, you comin' with me
We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees
You want some cheese
Hoes don't stay at the suave house
Hoes around my nuts like knats
Real dogs don't pay for cats, dats
For real baby
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sho' 'nough

Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe
Wants to get close to me
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow
Lookin for, confidants, and tickets to my next show
Check yo' bitch
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses
Oh yes it's very true
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do
Let her loose or let her remain
Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame
A bigger name
Look, this thang with bigger game
And she claim she ain't heard my music
Tryin' to trick me
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsly
She still hit me
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I
Really just don't plan on takin it out cause I

From me to you, this gangsta boo, and I'm just tellin' the truth
You hurt me bad, feelin' strange, wit revenge on my mind
Call my baby from the 8 and say ""it's been a long time""
How are ya doin'? (doin' great)

Though you be wit it, this affair is too good to be true
It must be blessed
Besides, yo' man is too posessive & over-protective
You want him deceased, I'll be da trigga man on the piece
After it's over, you & I can have an intimate feast
Let me know the time & location plus how to do it
You told me 12 at yo' house, sliced & least dilluted
So I'm creepin' to the doorstep of your 30 million mansion
It's time fo' havoc, ???, he'll be evicted on the fuckin' minute
You been takin' shovin' & orders
He bust & you're a torch

I'm havin' second thoughts but now I got me a new man

Like his ass locked up hell tight
I sexed him down once he ate his food, this was like right
After the clock struck 9, 12 on midnight, he finished
'cause my baby paco want to blow his brains on the ceiling
Hope his folks don't be mad
Fuck it! I just might flee
Because he left a lot of money in the s-a-f-e

Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre
But you can call me Possum Allawishes Jenkins
Andre 3000 for short
And no I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
And I will pause for your cause

And then I'm a get mine

Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady
Wit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy
What ya mean dog, telling a play like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking you for fun
Join the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars
Hitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all

Do me and tell all my friends my truly blew me

Nigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cut shot white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to idle wishes
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came

When I be riding in the SUV, I'm thinking of you
When I be rolling up a fat one, boy I'm thinking of you
You got me going like uh
I'm feelin the rush, I like to fuck
Let's get buck in the back of the truck, so boy what's up?
It's whatever when it comes down to you
Well it was, until you made it clear that I ain't for you
You just abandoned me, you left me strandedly
Heart broke, constantly
Hearing love songs on the radio, that remind me of you
They say a gangsta ain't 'posed to cry
But I'm shedding tears and I'm a gangsta until I die
I'm telling you boy, they say no pain then no gain
Now they call me player because you teaching me all yo game
I say I ain't change, but then again just peep me out

Why you out here cheating on me, I'm getting my own creeping on
Hey girl, why you ain't answer that god damn phone?

I don't need you, got my own fingers for my sex thrill
Shit, I'm a mack, player you ain't heard my real name?
Mrs. Pimping Thing, pussy power to the fucking brain
If you want to play, get in the shower stroke yourself
I ain't the one to be messed with, pimping to my death
Slip in and slip out, remember how that used to be?
I would get so wet when you put yo' love inside of me
But that's the past now, no more freaky tail nights
No more popping X, or sex asshole tight

I ain't trying get caught up in yo games
Personally, I think that shit is lame
What you doing err' now and then when you want to hit
I ain't giving yo ass shit, you'll be just another trick
On my list of busta's, diamond clusters
Rings, old game used to be so not told
With yo' frozen heart, boy you tore my soul apart
My XX plot, about a nigga from the ?
With yo' seven inch cock, give it to me don't you stop
I keep falling for you, hypnotized doubt you get my props
But now I'm single, pussy bad tight
I ain't fucking with no giggalos, niggas ain't right
They want to cut now, they want to cut later
They ain't call yo ass then, they ain't call yo ass later
That's how it goes, I'm out the door, holla back
Hit me on my 2 Way when you ready

Here the king of archery come, with a cracker dick
To fuck you in that pussy carpet you munch
If I'm not hardly the one, you must be barely the one billionth
Really you kiddin', bitch I'm the prodigal son

And I'm 'bout to walk into a bank with a shank and a black can of paint to check the clerk
(Where the keys?) Bitch you better take your purse! I got a brick of herb
And I hit the syrup, and I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb

Prada? Not a chance, I was thinkin' about buyin' you some clothes
But Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart, but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know, they didn't carry a size eight in hoes!
Oh! This is ugly boy swag, puttin' toe tags on you motherfuckin' ho bags
What a trailer trash pioneer, I am here, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea!
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two
'Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you
So we don't gotta scream at you!

Turnt than a motherfucker
Bought that ho a shot cause you wanna cuff her
All these other motherfuckers think they stuntin'
But they spot is 'bout to close
And they ain't pullin' nothin'
Walls smell like pussy when it's wet
Snort it to the face, but the club wet
Trying to get a taste, baby wanna flex
Sick of pushin' weight in an alley with a mind full of sex
She walk to the floor, leave the bar stool soakin'
Drop it down low, make it wade like the ocean
And every man up in here wanna see her bust it open
But you ain't gonna get it if you so soft-spoken
Flashing lights, molly dreams, face down low
DJ screaming ""last call"", that liquor dark, that dick gone hard
With visions of her legs up in the air over your face under her ass
And breaking lamps from beating pussy purple cause she like it fast
Wha-wha-wha-what's your fantasy? Ass like Trina, face like Beyonce
And tell your story, try to whip her fine ass free

Don't you want to take me home? Don't you want to see me roam?
Music beatin', twerkin' to the sound, I'm all up in my zone
Lookin' for a victim, caught him slippin', I just want some sex
Nothing else to do when I leave the club so that's the best thing next
Here, just take my number, when you leave be sure to send a text
I'll be at the Waffle House waitin', baby fuck the rest
If you at the club and you feel trashed and it about to close
Make sure you have a freak that knows how to bend and touch her toes
Make sure that that boy know, he gotta play when he weighin' that soul(?)

Put me off in any hood, I bet chu' I'ma survive
365 reasons to stay alive
In this jungle, lies be the king of these streets
But even the lies be runnin' from the crooked police
It ain't no peace cause they got the hood split up in sections
Violate the wronge set and they comin' with techs
There ain't no questions be asked, no bullies gettin' mad
Just killers on a task, and units bein' blast
With no remorse, I done seen it plenty of times
So I take it to my room and write plenty of rhymes
About the dirty game, thangs ain't the same no mo'
They try to stick together, just ain't what they claim no mo'
So hit the floor when they hit the door, give up them sacks
Everybody's got a posse so they robbin' in packs
On the attack and they keep gun runnin' like wood
And respect is something that chu' gotta earn in the hood

[Hook]
It's all good in my neighborhood
We out hustlin' doin' thangs y'all wish y'all could
We in this game, gettin' money and we livin' good
Stayin' real to the end like we know we should
It's all good

[Verse 2]
It's all about the money, gettin' paid is an every day job
And we connected, makin' moves like a heavyweight mob
And well respected, the hood is gonna make you or break you
And livin' and learnin' through all the drama that it'll take you
Keep you focused on reality, deep in the thoughts
Tryin' to count for every penny that you keep in the vault
So keep your yoks and still watch ya back
Cause in the hood your own friends will be the one to jack
Knowin' crosses is comin' throughout my whole nature
Takin' losses and dealin' with all this play hation
Steady chasin' that cheese and hangin' out with G's
Fuck what cha' sayin' bout gankin' and doin' robberies
I'm just tryin' to survive and keep myself alive
See I'm all about hustlin' can't work no 9 to 5
I'm stay thuggish not ruggish off in that hood
Steady tryin' to maintain and keep the paper good

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
You gotta watch ya back cause them killers be havin' jacks
They travel in packs and they quick to pull them gats
Ain't no time for negotiatin'
Just give up for good, look at the occupation
I run in numbers before the drama even kicks off
Duckin' and dodgin' from all them shots they done let off
I see it all the time in my neighborhood
Robbin' murder and madness but still the paper's good
I keep my mind on money and block out the pain
Ya see depression, deprivin' can drive ya mind insane
I'm trapped in this game and it ain't one way out
I strugglin' and strivin' to keep my pockets stout
See I'm tryin' to stay Southern, ain't no love for cowards
On the block steady hustlin' and don't cha' doubt us
I'm always down for my hood like I know I should
Gettin' plenty of money like I knew I could

Ganksta N-I-P,"A tisket, a tasket, a bloody, bloody basket
Cut his head and ate his leg, now he's in a casket
A tisket, a tasket, N-I-P and dope he did it
He tried to get smart so we ripped out his heart
Cooked it and we split it

Sick in the head, bloodshed in a ant bed
You want a new leg? Give me some needle and thread
So I can sew you one - 'cause I'm in it to win it
My horoscope said I'ma die in 20 minutes
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm worse than Freddie
You can't kill me 'cause I'm dead already
Egypt E is the motherfucking shrink(Damn right!)
After 12 o'clock my blood turns hot pink
Nah, you weak-ass hoes can't [???]
A thousand dead cut-up elephants in my luggage
Fuck with a psycho, you end up dead
Those who didn't live, drowned in a turtle's head
A twelve gauge is my only protection
Every bullet shot has a different infection
Woke up this morning with a dead dog on me
So I thought, ""Huh - baloney!""
If a nigga run up I don't care if he pushes
Fuck around and find his ass somewhere dead in some sticker bushes
Mess with N-I-P you must be tired of livin
Cut off your head - mmm, Thanksgiving
If you want to live, your ass better beg
People say I'm crazy 'cause I go with a cow's leg
Don't run up - 'cause I kick like Bruce
I want to and I'm gonna trade heads with a moose
Ganksta N-I-P with the psycho voice
Some say I'm insane 'cause I married a dead horse
It's Christmas time - Happy New Year G
A dead pig's head makes a good-ass Christmas tree
Kill a nigga for a measly-ass nickel
Frozen blood on a stick, equals strawberry popsicles
Fuck up and watch your Black neck bend
Dead men, making rounds cutting throats with a violin
I ain't gon' lie I feel like killin' my niece
A bird's leg woke up dead with his head in some fish grease
Ten died yesterday, ten just died
Ten died today - now this football's on layaway
You said I was weak, yeah, point blank told me
Tied a needle to my dick then my grandmother rode me
It ain't another nigga in this world can match this
I feel like swimmin' in rat piss
Fuck with N-I-P - I ain't no actor
My twelve daughters died from talking shit to a tractor
I'm getting pissed from the blood I threw up
Barely snapped my fingers and Jupiter blew up!
Hoes, they love me, they say I'm a pleaser
I woke up dead in a cat's leg screaming ""Caesar!""
Quick to break your motherfuckin' spine
A dead goat got pregnant and said it was mine
Ganksta N-I-P - I'm down with the Mob
Cuttin' off heads was my last year's Summer job
Blame it on TV - then put it on the map
This is a horror movie rap

A tisket, a tasket, you ain't gon' believe me
It ain't N-I-P's fault that he got crazy thoughts
Blame it on the TV
A tisket, a tasket, you might think I'm sick
If you don't like what I write, you can suck my di-ick

Pour some chocolate on your arm so it can taste like a Snicker
Push your ass off a building, check to see if you're dead
Blast back a second blade, plus I'll sharpen your fuckin' head

I'm strapped with the uzi, so get ready to die
Catch a nigga' while he sleep and strike a match in his eye
I'll sneak in your house and kill your ass for fun

Dead babies in my house suffocated by plastic

Think you can beat me? You gotta' be jokin' hoe...
Threw a brick in Houston, Texas, broke a window in Tokyo
Your sister stole my money, that's alright, I'ma slam her
Catch that bitch by herself, and beat her the fuck up with a hammer

Throw your daughter in the air, hope that bitch break her leg

Make no mistake it was a reflection of the sixties
That when niggas got beat down in the slavery days

Erotic, exotic, and a little psychotic.

Picture a room where a con lives, it's dark inside
Newspaper clippins on the wall, from vics that died
Blood everywhere, you can tell the psycho went through
He had darts in their faces up to number fifty two
Psycho Uh, stalkin niggas, butcher knives stays handy
He would sit inside the park, and laugh and give kids candy
They say he was weird, but the bodies he killed
He always scratched off the names of the people he killed
Real slow, Pysch torture style, pass me the scissors
And cut off microscopic pieces like a mirror
Terror screams, let me know the spinal was crumbled
By the gestures they made and the words that they mumbled
Maybe I can slice a throat when I'm ready
It takes practice, training to keep a nail gun steady
You should yell when it clicks, 'cause blood finna seep
And bring a hundred thousand mourners and children to weep

I'm standing there, watchin', they put him in the ground
Blow a sweet when it's over, I'll go kill downtown
Cops don't understand, they thought he was bluffin'
They say the officer went crazy when he murdered a dozen
Other cops and didn't ? 'cause life ain't fair
They put his body in the chair, but his mind wasn't there
Soul snatcher, got cha, hit him with a heavy right
Hold him, hug him, hit him with a heavy pipe
Burn him, scorch him, you can bet the people saw it
Leave him there for thirty minutes, you'll see the birds ?

Ya know what I'm talking bout
That shit bumps hard in ya muthafuckin trunk
Ya know what I'm saying

[Verse 1]
My veins pop out I'm high, you have a question ask me
Who left the baby bleeding butchered up in some plastic
Inside the woods where the birds was beating it
I had to take my gun and stop the squirrels from eating it
Some say that I'm the type that does not believe in God
Some say I have the power, psychic similar to Moses' rod
Strike like a snake leaving venom in ya chest
Lung disease on top of cancer he was cardiac arrest
Head tuners, deadly rumors of wars to come 
I'm a scientist peep game the wars a done
Body snatcher, head cracker, a car hijacker
Catch you down town now I'm a D.A attacker
Sleep walking through the house, dreaming I'm eager to hunt
'cause my sub-conscience tells my conscience to do what it wants
In and out of reality you burn from the high flames 
Skin peeling off on a mission to rock brains 
Crucify my enemies and slay my opponents
Uncut pure club rocks keep em still for a moment
You don't hear me you better fear me, I change with the times
Tarzan swung through the ghetto he got shot on the vine

Bumps hard in the trunk nigga
Psycho Funk, Psycho Funk, Psycho Funk
It ain't made for no punks nigga 

I see spirits don't come near me, their anxious to live
You play my song back to back it might just fracture your ribs
A graveyard is a place where the dead can rest
A mortician keeps the dead looking at their very best
Now I'm snoring, wake me up I'm trapped in a dream
It's like swimming tied up I'm floating upstream
Back to consciousness, why is that I thought I was woke
You see I'm dead I'm just simply waiting to wake up and croak
Horrific dreams, keep these spleens, take notes as a thrill
A Vampire performs at night, daytime you can kill him
Stephen King, Stephen Spielberg, I'm ending ya reign
My thoughts they cause pain psycho horror movie games
Twist and turn in the bed, death is nothin' but dread
Trapped in time angel wings violins on my head
'cause I slip inside the coma with the  diploma
Left body there for three days a fleshy aroma 
Starts to build up hold ya nose the scent is to strong
Flesh evaporates fast an turns the build up to bones

Click ya heels commit suicide and wish for ya mama

",Psycho on the Loose,1998
Ganksta N-I-P,"Picture a room full of candles, it's dark inside
Newspaper clippings on the wall from victims that died
Blood everywhere
You can tell the psych be through

He had darts in their faces up to number fifty two
Psyco
Stalking niggers, Tec-9 stays handy
He would sit inside the park and laugh and give kids candy

People say he was weird, his mother ill is in the clip
He always scratched off people names those ones that he killed
Real slow
Psych torture style, pass me the scissors, uh

And cut off microscopic pieces of a mirror
Out of stomachly
You can tell the spinal was crumbled
By the gestures that they made and the words that they mumbled

Shit like Nip
Don't do it
It's already dead
And if his beef is too tight ??? child in their head

You got this nigger fucked up
Gangster Nip is so bold
You make him mad, he ?? that
You watch him run through a house hall, it's sic

Scarface, uh
This nigger is sic, uh
Big Chief, Lil J, uh
My niggers sic, uh

Psych Ward mercenary
Stay on them ready
It takes practice, much training to keep a nail gun steady
When it clicks it thrills deep

His blood finna sip
And bring a hundred thousand mourners and children to weep
Graveyard's
In my slaughterhouse we catch you and beat you

Mutilation plus bacteria that straight cats hit you
You can bet that he's full of healthy humans and mice
Kinda looking like a fleshy big pot full of rice
When you stare it up

Watch this stiff, a terrible smell
I walk around with a sign, say ?? I got gumble to sell
Big balls
'Cause more than you eat every beating

People ask me what ingredients
I put it in this shit
""It's to meat""
Child beef different animals look

And you can bet his heart came out an insane cook book now I
Gotcha hook
They crowed, they ???
Makes my food with human flesh like the chinesse ?dude?

Psychopath Liu Kang, he'll leave you for dead
But Mortal Kombat will let you cut off arms and legs and heads
Now you's a killa, even if your enemy's bigger
Fatality means you get to finish the nigga

See I'm the man that took control
And I'm the one you'll be dealin with
Every person that you kill, see you'll really be feelin it
Healin quick, uh it's like you have a new life
Perfectly in great condition, but there's a new knife
Now it's adding, then you gon subtract one
Then you go attack one, then you go collapse one
Now you're shootin fire and ice, bullets servin em all
I'll teach you how to play Psycho NIP and murder em all
You gotta start from the bottom and rise to the top
Fight hard with combinations, finish him with a glock

Shoot inside the crowd, make em scatter like Raid

Whatever parts that they don't eat, the fire ants feel wealth
Then they throw a party, now they on their feet
But that rival ant gang, they want that meat
Now it's an ant war, fire ants cannot be beat
Now that's the same type a shit that you see on the street
Hit the sweet, move somethin', then grab your Glocks
Cuz niggas listen to my music then they go kill cops
They in a trance, hypnotically they do what I say
See, I got the hook up spot where you can buy an A-K
Then go out, straight murderin', and start you a spree
And don't come back until a thousand nine hundred seventy three
Bodies drop, inside the freezer, with ziplock tags
And leave the corpses all tied up in ziplock bags
A blow torch is now needed, they'll turn into crust
Cuz with the fire, then immortals turn slowly to dust
Psycho NIP, mad scientist, I'll crush up them bones
Cuz I'll catch you, I'll keep you, I'll kill you in the Psych

Insect war ground, see I can face it now
For my reality is body parts, I can taste it now
Crushed ice cubes keeps it all frozen stiff
A chainsaw pursues much blood, they ready to rip
What you want? You bloody shit, when the wrists get slit
A thumbtack takes out the eyeballs, they bust real quick

First thing first - and for me that's n's

If I want it, no matter the cost, I'll get it
It's mine, so I know you gon' let me spend it
My clique made it known: we 'bout havin' things
Sport diamonds, so I know you gon' let us bling
B.G.: shut it down when I come through
They say I'm wrong, but I know you gon' let me do what I do
If I got it, I ain't gon' hide it - I show mine
I know you gon' respect it, I know you gon' let me shine
I know you ain't gon' step, I know you know I tote iron
Quick to bust, and I know you don' wan' die
You see eight Bentleys comin' on the lake Sunday
I know you know that's Cash Money Millionaires comin'

Women, over here come listen, tell em
If you ain't been with a nigga, its too late
In the game, for a nigga to be making a bitch feel lead
You'll want to get it right, and when you get it right
You'll want to keep it right, look
A real nigga is hard to come by, believe it

Girl I can't believe you, how you gone
Turn around and bite the hand that feeds you

You don't want to be careful, why should I try to keep you
Nigga gon fuck, then he gone in a week or two

Behind your back, run and tell me, each and everything you do
You better wake up, and pay attention
Realize your partners want to ask you out, to get to your position
I guarantee they got they man cuffed, if he say no that mean no

With them knuckle head, fucking give head hoes
Bring em to your house, then walk around in they bad clothes
You sneaking to the club with em, when I be on the map, that's cold
But its cool, cause my mama never raised no fool
We was in school, you had a nigga when I played on you
I should've seen it, but I was too caught up on the grind
In the blind, you knew I stayed with other shit on my mind
But all it did was take time, to show me the light
No I can't put this one behind, so you can go head and kite
So tell them hoes that there, and see what they say
They can't fuck you, but I can knock them off any day
So get your hand out my face, 'fore I bat you in yours
You should of, stayed in your place now the tables done turned
And everything I gave you, bitch I struggled to earn
Get your purse you gotta skate, you lucky you don't get burned

Girl don't play dumb, you know who made you
Everything you want you get, everything you got I gave you
I took you from hard times and saved you
In the best of everything I laced you
Made it where no one could fade you, sometimes I hate you
I love you to death, but the way you act
I know that's not the way, that Lil B. Gizzle raised you
I'm on the verge, about to shake you, don't forget
I'm a paid nigga getting sick of you trying to be slicker
Tripping, trying to build fake cases, a house
Your clothes, your feature and supplied transportation
And that's how you gonna' do a nigga, mentally abuse a nigga
You gonna' regret trying to use a nigga, you this close from bout to lose this nigga
Man they got hoes all over the world, that wish they knew this nigga
See one time threw with you, I'm threw with you
Ain't nothing that I could do with you, but try to be cool with you

We taking care of the whole section, with liquor
Marijuana smoke in the back, where Gar be at
Big trucks on 22's, loud sounds with screens
Who up in there, that got them chickens fixing they hair
And getting naked full of Cristal, that's the lifestyle
So I hit the club, with a pocket full of Lifestyles
Ooh shorty getting wild, now put your hands in the air
While you do that dance, and let me get behind you
While you in front of my man, in front of your man
Chill gun on my waist, with a blunt in my hand
We spending a grand on Bubbly, round for round
That's how the Chopper City mob, get down
Hydro in the bottle, with the yellow wrapper
And you players better, hold your broads
Cause these boys, will snatch her

I hold it down full of Mo' and Crown, it make the kid move
Quick, too much Vodka make me nervous bad
I'm popping bottles every hour, making Erkles mad
I left the scene, swerved past in a purple Jag
You heard of trap, ladies love me you perverted fags
I rock the house like it's church, yeah I love the Lord
Play with my team, Chopper City it's goin' be murder mass you heard me
Know you love the way that gangstas play it, we drank and blazing
Till ancient ages, this ain't for babies
So ease your nerves, play your girl like she easing surf
Cause chill what's beneath my shirt, have you bleeding syrup
I ain't tripping if you need that work, Sniper pull up in a Viper
With a rifle, that'll mean your smirk
Flows make my people lean, and twerk
I hit the track and beat it up like Ike and Tina Turner, it's Chopper City man

And you know, where I'm found in here
Last week they had a body, left found in here
And with the drank getting smoked, the bottles is popping
We ain't even make it to the party, and girls jocking
It's Hakizzle, you know the name girl
Just write your number down, and I'll give you a ring girl
I don't mean, to snatch your chicks player
But the bar need chips player, look at my wrist player
The hood call me, Young Neno
Cause I'm quick to snatch your senorita, or hit the block with a kilo
Calm down homeboy, you messing up my groove
Yeah iight you smoking, give me a cool
We stunt round year, ride in convertibles
Them Chopper City dudes'll murder you, holla back Kizzle

Thugging popping bottles, until the sun rise
It's going down, it's going dizzle, it's going diggity
We from Uptown, off the hizzle off the higgity
I know you feeling me fa shiggity, Baby Gizzle
Baby Geezie, Baby Gangsta popping pistols

With me, I won't miss you I got the pistol
Hoes jocking niggas hating, can't take us
Can't fade us, we ball just like the Lakers

Told him I had skills he needed to peep me up
He did that snatch me him Slim and Fresh was feelin me
Took me to studio from that we made history

In the mid east of that I was doin my thang
And I met this four foot hustla they called him Lil Wayne

Baby drew a cross between us but I still love him
Universal up to deal we went to get mills
That's when nigga decided to not keep it real

I beg my god to speak and tear me apart
I'd lay down my body I'd lay down my arms
I never once in my sweet short life meant anybody harm

In my happy home i read the signs
In my lovers arms I move in time
There's no more crying and there's no more lies

Of bullets built with me in mind

Kiss my mother on her cheek and lay my burden down

Gave it to the homeless man

To call up my old friend
She said she had a
Poem for me
And did I hear that
She was thinking of leaving
I said I will miss you
And then
I played her my new song
We laughed and cried
We never said goodbye
And when I called again
She was gone

Touch my heart it is open
Kiss my soul if you're willing

I'm feeling very rich

And tomorrow's gonna
Work itself out

Gardens of Gehenna,"[lyrics by Birgit Lages]

born from illusions, bread by dreams
No one can follow us.
We were gone before we came, alone, eternal
Dark and damned

don't ever try to understand
No consolation
And when we reach what we came for
It won't be a victory,

it's just the beginning of another end

the mechanism masochism
You have given back hell to me
And I will keep it now and forever
My mechanism masochism

as long as you sit calm and small
You'll never feel the chains
And then we'll create ourselves a god
Without whom we cannot live.
At night like a big black beast
With scars and blood dark floods

there's the beginning of another end

the mechanism masochism
You have given hell back to me
And I will keep it now and forever
My mechanism masochism





",Blood Dark Floods,2006
Gardens of Gehenna,"[lyrics by Birgit Lages]

and yes, we are mortal
Now that we've left Eden.
The raven's calling for my soul.
Come, dark angel, strengthen me.

ablaze my rage, come, dark angel,
Tear open my wounds, let me bleed.
Keep me free of indifference,
Drink my sorrows, gorge my grief.

help me to shine in godlike anger,
Help me never to forget,
Let me hate and let me live,
Let me remember that we've met

and that you've cast your spell on me.
Far off lies the universe,
Sunk in ashes, mud and tears,
Far off lies reality.

and yes, we are vulnerable,
Vulnerable and earth tied.
But it doesn't matter any more.
Come, dark angel, be my guide.

before I slip into the damnation
Of obedience and apathy
In a cloud of dust and blood
Come, dark anger, rescue me.





",Dark Angel,2006
Gardens of Gehenna,"There is something going on
And it's rough
And it's cruel
And it's deeply satisfying

There is something from inside
That is huge, that is cruel
That is something
That you'll never understand

Somewhere beyond the far horizon
The Gods of gloom and gore arise
Where from an everlasting wound
Bleeding are the western skies

The darkness talks if you do listen
The silence will dance at times
If you don't live within this world
You'll never know about the fight

That's fought within myself so often
You'll never know what demons dream
How wolves became a part of me
How crows and ravens rule the night

Watch me rise
As I celebrate your decay
Watch me grow
As I fall and pray
",Gods of Gloom,2006
Gardens of Gehenna,"[lyrics by Birgit Lages / Uli Bauer]

l'ombra della notte
Circonda la materia della terra
I corvi fanni grandi cerchi
Sapra dimenticati nell'passato.

posti, dore fuerrieri sono diventati eroi
E la spade diventano rossi dall'sangue.

cold shadows arise
From the darkness within
Like ravens they glide
Above times that have been

at places where once
Delusion and lies
Turned into death

'cause sometimes they lie
And in oceans of blood
They drown the truth
Sometimes we die.

un tempo, dore la rabbia era forte
E nessuno sapera chi era buono o male
Che l'ora della vendetta riarrivera,
E la povere creature spariscono
Nella palude dell'eternita

sometimes satan takes a fancy
To assume the shape of man
And walk among the mortals
To learn about their desires
To open wide the portals
For his coming from the other side

There's a special someone to make them whole
Someone to give their heart completely

And you may search high and low
And when you find your angel and when you know
Then you finally get that feeling
It'll be as clear as the air you're breathing

That's when the world feels small beneath your feet
It's when the stars above are only just out of reach
When you feel you're alive for the very first time
And there's nothing that you can rise above
That's when you know that you're in love

And who can tell the time and place
When you see your soul reflected in their face
It'll be a spell you're under
And it'll hit you just like thunder

'Cause that's when the world feels small beneath your feet
It's when the stars above are only just out of reach
When you feel you're alive for the very first time
And when you hold them in your arms and can't let go
And that's when you know

For all of my life I have been searching
For something I couldn't find
But now that I know that you are the one
I understand, I read the signs

'Cause now the world feels small beneath my feet
And all the stars above are only just out of reach

And there's nothing that you can rise above

When baby you don't love me anymore

Say it isn't so

So say it isn't so

Ten to five at least we tried
We're still alive but hope has died

Whistle blows the turns of steel
Shake the ground beneath the wheels
As I wish I never found you

How can I be smiling when your gone?
Will I be strong enough to carry on?

Tell me your not leaving

Before I can sing
Before i can lay my love for you to sleep

Don't let me down

Give me the part that's always true
Give to my heart protection

Give me your soul affection
Don't keep your love from me taboo
Bring out the best emotion

But I must have expectations
As soon as you show you really care
There will be no hesitation

Don't want you holding back on me
And if you're game stay around

If I'm coming round, 'cause I know there's a way
To the end of the world is as long as we'll last
Remember no beginning, forget about the past

Give me the part that's always true

You tried your best, got so far

And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown 
Then I could believe that I`m bound to find 
A better life than I left behind 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold 

So I had to leave from my country of birth 
As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam 
There`s a thousand miles of the long journey home

Garland Jeffreys,"She caught my eye
When she came into view
I met her on some New York avenue
I liked her smile
Her style and her grace
Her sexy walk could light up anyplace
She said to me
I just came in from Paris
I said to her
I'd like to get to know you
She said to me
I'm shy and a bit embarrassed
I said to her
There are some things I'd like to show you

Christine, Christine

I soon found out
It was more than fascination
I soon found out
It was much more than just a cheap imitation
I held her hand
Slowly we got closer
Felt like a man
And not some kind of poseur
Yes it's true she just came in from Paris
Her French perfume I got to know it better
We talked of love and poetry and marriage
Then I discovered that mysterious love letter

Christine, Christine

She caught my eye
When she came into view
I met her on some New York City avenue
I liked her smile
Her style and her grace
Her sexy walk could light up anyplace
She said to me
I must go back to Paris
I said to her
Oh please don't do that to me
She said to me
I got another boyfriend
I said to her
Well why didn't the hell you tell me

Christine, Christine",Christine,1981
Garland Jeffreys,"Here comes Victor Hugo
He follows me wherever I go
I'm walking Paris streets
Talking cobblestones
Feeling like I'm at home

And here comes Les Miserables
It's one of my favorite novels
But it's so serious
Hope I'm not too rude
But I'm not in the mood

Jump jump
Let's make the great escape
All due respect to art for art's sake
Jump jump
We're gonna have some fun
For you and me and everyone
Jump jump
To the rock 'n' roll Rimbauds
Jump jump
To the poets and verse
Jump jump
To the Venus de Milo
Jump jump
To the ones who came first

Here goes the ghost of V. Van Gogh
He follows me wherever I go
We pass Notre Dame
So much history
So much bigger than me

And here comes another museum
They pass so fast we hardly can see 'em
There goes a Claude Monet
And a Paul Cezanne
And I always been a fan

Jump jump...",Jump Jump,1981
Garland Jeffreys,"When the bull is in the ring
I need all the help you can
And the Mariachis sing
With the lonely mandolin
See those people shout out loud
Give me more and give me more
And I'm thinkin' to myself
Take me to the Matador

Take me to the Matador
He will fill and ease my soul
He will give me configence
When I think I've lost control

He will help me with my Muse
In the age of win and lose
With the ancient cup and swords
And a hundred Spanish lords
See one thousands violins
Golden trumpets soar on high
Waves and waves of joyful hymns

Silver sonnets reach the sky
Fight the battles and the blues
Wars of love and wars of art
Tonight the cape is what I choose
Goya's in my Spanish heart

He will help me with my love
Dance the dance that lovers do
Rhumba with the velvet glove
'Neath the Barcelona moon
See one thousands violins
Golden trumpets soar on high
Waves and waves of joyful hymns
Silver sonnets rech the sky

take me to the matador",Matador,1981
