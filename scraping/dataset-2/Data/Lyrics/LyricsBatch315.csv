Glendon Smith,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine",The Best Is Yet to Come,2002
Glendon Smith,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,2002
Glendon Smith,"Strangers in the night, 
Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.",Strangers in the Night,2002
Glenn Alves,"Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whispering in the words, to melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu√±equita, my Spanish Harlem, Monalisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it

But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it

Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Give me your heart, make it real
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it
Let's not forget about it",Smooth,2002
Glenn Barbour,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2001
Glenn Brooks,"Oh, come back, baby
Oh, mama, please, don't go, yeah
'Cause the way I love you
Child, you'll never know

Oh, come back, baby, yeah, yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh, now, now

Well, I admit, baby
That I was wrong
Don't you know, baby?
Child, you been gone too long

Oh, come back, baby, yeah, yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh, now, now

Say, if I could holler
Like a mountain jack
Yeah, yeah, oh, people
I'd call my baby back

Oh, come back, baby, woo, yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh, now, now

Now one of these days, baby
And it won't be long, yeah
You're gonna look for me, child, you know
And I'll be gone

So come back, baby, yeah, yeah
Let's talk it over one more time
Oh, now, now",Come Back Baby,2000
Glenn Brooks,"As I was walking down the street last night
A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, ""Hold it bud, I don't play that game""
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes.
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, ""My name's Flo, and you're on the right track,
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back,
So if you want to have fun in this man's land,
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands.""
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight,
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose,
She said, ""Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose""
I sat back down with a smiling face,
While she went down to the powder place
With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
The music stopped and the lights came on,
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long
I left the place with tears in my eyes
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll",Greenbacks,2000
Glenn Cambell,"I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy, my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way to Dead Man's Curve""

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve) you'd best keep away
(Dead Man's Curve) I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You should've heard the whine from my screamin' machine

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were at Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
Dead Man's Curve

""Well, the last thing I remember, Doc
I started to swerve
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right""

Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play

Glenn Cambell,"Well she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

And she'll have fun fun fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away)

Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
(You walk like an ace now you walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now
(You look like an ace now you look like an ace)
A lotta guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
(You drive like an ace now you drive like an ace)

And she'll have fun fun fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away)

Well you knew all along
That your dad was gettin' wise to you now
(You shouldn't have lied now you shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now

But you can come along with me

Glenn Close,"Don't know why I'm frightened
I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye
Oh, please don't ever ever make me say goodbye",As If We Never Said Goodbye,1994
Glenn Close,"Sure I came out here to make my name
Wanted my pool my dose of fame
Wanted my parking space at Warners
But after a year

Of one room hell
A Murphy bell
A rancid smell
Wallpaper peeling at the corners

Sunset Boulevard
Twisting boulevard
Secret of the rich
A little scary
Sunset Boulevard
Tempting boulevard
Waiting there to swallow the unwary

Dreams are not enough to win a war
Out here they're always keeping score
Beneath the tan
The battle rages
Smile a rented smile

Fill someone's glass
Kiss someone's wife
Kiss someone's ass
We do whatever pays the wages

Sunset Boulevard
Headline boulevard
Getting here is only the beginning
Sunset Boulevard
Jackpot boulevard
Once you've won, you have to go on winning

You think I've sold out
Damn right I've sold out
I've just been waiting 
For the right offer

Comfortable quarters
Regular rations
Twenty four hour
Five star room service

And if I'm honest
I like the lady
I can't help being
Touched by her folly

I'm treading water
Taking her money
Watching her sun set
Well I'm a writer

LA's changed a lot over the years
Since those brave goldrush pioneers
Came in their creaky covered wagons
Far as they could go
End of the line

Their dreams were yours
Their dreams were mine
But in those dreams
Were hidden dragons

Sunset Boulevard
Frenzied boulevard
Swamped with every kind of false emotion
Sunset Boulevard
Brutal boulevard
Just like you we'll wind up in the ocean

She was sinking fast
I threw a rope
Now I have suits
And she is hope
It seemed an elegant solution

One day this must end
It isn't real
Still I'll enjoy a hearty meal
Before tomorrow's execution

I play every part 
I can make your sad heart sing 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one smile 
I'm the girl next door 
Or the love that you've hungered for 
When I speak it's with my soul 
I can play any role 

No words can tell 
The stories my eyes tell 
Watch me when I frown 
You can't write that down 
You know I'm right 
It's there in black and white 
When I look your way 
You'll hear what I say

Yes, with one look 
I put words to shame 
Just one look 
Sets the screen aflame 
Silent music starts to play 
One tear from my eye 
Makes the whole world cry

With one look

They'll rejoice: I've returned at last 
To my people in the dark 
Still out there in the dark 

Silent music starts to play 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know

With one look 
I'll ignite a blaze 
I'll return to my glory days 
They'll say Norma's back at last

I'm staying for good

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.

One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?

in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Next year will be the perfect year 

No need to hear the music play 
Your eyes say all there is to say 
The stars can fade 
And they can shine 
Long as your face is next to mine 

I don't need a crowded ballroom 
Everything I need is here, if you're with me 
Next year will be the perfect year 

We don't need a crowded ballroom

Glenn Close,"The colors of my life, are bountiful and bold
The purple glow of indigo, the gleam of green and gold
The splendor of a sunrise, the dazzle of a flame
The glory of a rainbow, I put 'em all to shame

No quiet browns or grays, I'll take my days instead
And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red
And should this sunlit world, grow dark one day
The colors of my life will leave a shining light to show the way

The colors of my life, are softer than a breeze
The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Your reds are much too bold, in gold I find no worth
I fill my days with [Incomprehensible] brown, the colors of the earth
And if from by my side my love should roam
The colors of my life will shine a quiet light to lead her home

Paradise to live

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes

Glenn Frey,"Lonely girl, rainy night
Lookin' for that number
She needs someone to treat her right

There's plenty of men she could call
But she wants him most of all
Oh God, I hope he's home tonight

She needs a love from a real exciter
She needs the allnighter, the allnighter

He's the one, the one she calls
When she gets that feeling
Some nights she just can't stop herself

He's tough and tender, a soul bender
Ain't no service he can't render
He touches her like nobody else

He brings out the love, love
Love deep inside her, he's the allnighter

Now when all the stimulation
Let's you down, down, down
And there ain't no medication
Layin' around, 'round, 'round

You feel your little heart
Begin to pound and pound
He's a satisfier of that one desire

Other guys come and go
They may try but they don't know
Every girl needs special care

Oh, he's so bad, he's so good
He makes it feel just the way it should
Nobody else can take her there

He's the real thing, the pure delighter
He's the allnighter, the allnighter

It's getting lighter
There goes the allnighter

Glenn Frey,"Woke up this morning with a smile on my face 
Set up in bed, and looked around this old place 
Opened the window, let the sun shine in 
You see, me and my baby, we're back together again. 

Jumped on the freeway with this song in my head 
I started thinkin' 'bout the things we said 
I said I'm sorry; She said I'm sorry too; 
You know I can't be happy 'less I'm happy with you. 

I got love, it's my lucky day 
I got love, gonna keep it that way 
It's the sweetest gift from the heavens above 
I got you, babe, I got love. 

No more staring at my blue telephone 
No more pretending I like being alone 
No more searching when the workday's done 
I get back on the freeway, head on home to number one 

I got love, she's waiting for me 
I got love, she's sweet as can be 
She's the greatest gift from the heavens above 
OO, babe, I got love 

When you've got love, you got to walk like a man 
You've got to bend, you've got to understand 
It won't be easy, no, no, that's not in the plan, 
But if it ain't all honey, still it's right on the money 

I got love, I'm happy to say 
I got love, it's stronger each day 
It's the sweetest gift from the powers above 
I got you, babe, and I know I got love 

I got love 
I got love",I Got Love,1984
Glenn Frey,"Another lonely night under the spell of the summer moon
I heard the wind sing a lonely tune
I did it for your love

I waited by the shore
Just for a glimpse of you, nothing more
I heard the wind tell the stars above
I did it for your love

How can I believe in love when all that I can see
Is everything it's done to you and me?
I went the extra mile
Did everything just to see you smile
Somehow I knew it was all worth while
Cause I did it for your love

The leaves will soon be turning, then falling to the ground
I'll face the cold of winter, but you won't be around
Another lonely night, somehow, it all slipped through my hands
Somehow, I knew you would understand

Do what you got to do.
It's your dream,
And sometimes dreams come true.
I just want to say,
I believe in you.

It's your heart,
That tells you right from wrong,
If you leave too soon,
Or if you stay too long.
If it's meant to be,
Only time will tell.
If you have to leave,
Then I'll say farewell.

It's your life,

If it's here with me,
Or with someone new.

She made excuses to the ones who said they cared 
They fell into each other's arms, they knew the passion

The night is filled with every kind of new emotion 
With every moment comes a chance they might delay

No consolation to the ones who stayed away 
Why must young lovers always hide what should be natural? 
Why must they always do what others tell them to? 
They'll find a place to hide, a place to take their passion 
They'll find a way to do what only lovers do

I knew I could not wait another day

I can hear it when I stand beside the river
I can see it when I look up in the sky
I can feel it when I hear that lonesome highway
So many miles to go before I die

We can never know about tomorrow
Still we have to choose which way to go
You and I are standing at the crossroads
Darling, there is one thing you should know....

I look at me and I`m running out of time

You've been out riding fences, for so long now
Oh you're a hard one but I know you got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy, she'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones that you can't get
Desperado, oh, you ain't getting no younger

Your pain and your hunger they're driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom, well, that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
The sky won't snow, and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time, from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away

Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences and open the gate?
It may be raining, oh raining but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you, let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you before it's too late

To comfort an old friend who's feelin' down

Four that wanna own me,
Two that wanna stone me,
One says she's a friend of mine
Take It easy, take it easy

Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand

Runnin' away from what I couldn't be
Down some endless road just south of nowhere

I still believe in chasing dreams and placing bets
And I have learned that all you give is all you get
So give it all you've got

I had my share, I drank my fill
And even though I'm satisfied, I'm hungry still
To see what's down another road, beyond a hill
And do it all again

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
So here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

Funny how the time just flies
How love can go from warm hellos to sad goodbyes
And leave you with the memories you've memorized
To keep your winters warm

But there's no yes in yesterday
And who knows what tomorrow brings, or takes away
As long as I'm still in the game, I want to play
For laughs, for life, for love

So here's to life
And every joy it brings
Here's to life
To dreamers and their dreams

May all your storms be weathered
And all that's good get better
Here's to life
Here's to love
And here's to you

One day in early Spring
You held a piper in your hand
To mend its' broken wing

Now I remember many a day
And many a lonely mile
The echo of a piper's song
The shadow of a smile

The shadow of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
Was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring

I will be remembering

When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

Somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company
Wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine",I Wanna Be Around [*],2012

That promise you made was only a lie
Now after you've gone all alone

But all that I've got is a worried mind",Worried Mind [*],2012
Glenn Frey,"Somewhere along the way I found the meaning
Woke up dreaming along the way
Never quite seems the same when you awaken
And makin' up for the time is such a price to pay
Then they take your dream away and it just ain't fair

Help me through the night, mama
Help me ease the pain
And tell me it's alright
Help me through the night once again

That's the danger in pretending
Trying to defend yourself from someone else's war
Don't know what they're fighting for
And they just don't care

Open my eyes again
And tell me it's alright
Help me through the night once again

will find me

They heard my story
And then the jury tried and sentenced me
And now I'm sanctified, without resistance

At the station
I hear the engine of the train

The sand keeps turnin'
Outside my window, falls the rain
That washes me

Past midnight I still see the land
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
The city's ablaze, the town's on fire
The woman's flames are reachin' higher
We were fools - we called her a liar
All I hear is - Burn
They didn't believe she was devil's sperm
She said ""Curse you all never learn when I leave, there's no return""
The people laughed 'till she said - ""Burn""
Warning came - no one cared
Earth was shakin' - we stood and stared
When it came, no one was spared
Still I hear - Burn
You know we had no time
We could not even try
You know we had no time

To give me a line
She said boy what have you done
Passing your time with a holy man
Talking about the moon and sun

Away from all these lies

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me your hand
I've been picking up my bones too long
Won't you understand

Called to the captain
To put me ashore
For it looked like no man's land

He told me had no answer
He didn't really hold the key

In a dream I had a final vision
How come you just wanna be my friend? How come?
Will you ever have to justify?
The hidden meaning in your time again? How come?

I'm gone, gone just like the past because I'm gone
And you won't be the last 'cause I?ll be strong
Now can you hear my voice because I'm gone?

In an ordinary conversation
I come to my realization, how come?
Then you come to me with velvet skin
How come I did let you in? How come?

I'm gone, gone just like the past because I'm gone
And you won't be the last, I?ll be strong
Now can you hear my voice because I'm gone?

Still it breaks me down inside
As I walk through the fire
I am a chosen man
Nothing can change me at all
You lie, now listen

In a dream I had a final vision
How come you just wanna be my friend? How come?

I'm gone, gone just like the past because I'm gone
You won't be the last, I?ll be strong
Now can you hear my voice because I'm gone?

I'm gone, gone just like the past because I'm gone
You won't be the last and I?ll be strong
Now can you hear my voice because I'm gone?

Can you hear me?

Nothing will change you
Nothing will change you

In a dream I had
You lie

I stand alone for what is right

I make amends to cure my sight

Gave his life to the divine

He pulled the shutters down
And will he ever see
What all the others found?

Get closer to the sky

Take it for what it's worth

Slowly I lay down this burden
Beside me
And I start to stumble
And rise to my feet

I cannot wander

Smoke, Swords and Fire, bravemans true desire
For free men must fight tonight all in the glory of war
We sit in waiting every mile on Hadrian's Wall
With steel dirt and sand
We all have stake in the land
For many will not see
Morning sun rising, flags on the horizon
Thus begins the battle of Hadrian's Wall
Tonight they will come, 4,000 chariots strong
River of red flowing down, all in the name of Galaman's crown
For many will not see
Morning sun rising

Over the horizon
Lead by arrows
And the release of the dragon
Blood rivers flowing
Man die without knowing
We fight as legions
Against a crown of treason

Never thought I'd see a morning sun rise
Never thought I'd live to see another day

Will break this spell

So hard I fell
Lost in a shell, ghostly
And the rain falls down
On this lonely child

To grieve

I can feel the afterburn
There lies my freedom

Given into the fall

You gave me your heart
I learned to forgive
And when I come through it all

I've felt ruined inside
Watched it all crumble

One day I'm around, the next I disappear 
This is a crazy act 
But I won't think I'm kissing you till that's a fact 
Cause always, ever after and more 

[Chorus] 
When you think the party's over 
Look over your shoulder 
I'm at your door, coming back for more 
Dancing in the moonlight 
Till the break of daylight 
Like we did before 
Well be coming back for more 

Were on a one-way ride 
And all I need is someone like you by my side 
You saw the movie too 
Well ride into the sunset like they always do 
For all days, all nights 
Ill hurt some more

Well be coming back for more 
If I'm still number one 
The one you're looking for

No, Ill be back for more

[Verse 1]
It's a pity that you're so dirty
Worthy of some Southern hos-pital
See we them Northern boys with nose and how's
NYC livin' ain't nothin' like it
See how me and my peeps fit, we jigsaw
Sometimes I play big saw to cut the deal
And we keepin' them bills paid with meals in the mouths of many
A noble job at Feni
Money ain't everything but everything makes me want it
But won't dishonor my name so the claim throwers
Act like game on the dice on the mic device
Stay above middle class for life
Not an easy task but I've grown to love it
Dub it to tape, why don't you whip a grin
While I speak to my mens about the world problems
And girl problems with no immediate way to solve em'
But I'm on hits

[Chorus]
I make the best of the life I be with it
Making the most of the moment among the livin'
And it feels good
Being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Now I'm asking am I worthy of you, of you
Am I worthy of you

[Verse 2]
Pull them quarters down
I got some things on these nine ounces to vamp
Me on a mission why'all
Dug fresh dirt out the ground
Lookin' for the treasures in life
A bambino picket fence around the residence
I wore these shackels here for thirteen years
 
But the only real slaves is the ones we record on
We off all checks and God's blessin'
Tryin' to own a thousand island like we salad dressin'
Patience for the main course
Don't have me in position to remain boss
Cause the man next to the man above the exec
Don't give a damn if I papered yet
Sometimes it make me want to go make a bet
I did away with knock em' and release some stress
By any means, these petty greens will only get me stuck in a box
Doin' a dick shot in Oz, jerkin' off in the J
But anyway I keep my head on

[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I know people who tippy-toe through they own stompin' ground
Master not makin' a sound to stay safe
From the local star renaissance
And the response is usually the same
Wishin' like it used to be
Nothin' in that life is new to me
We roll like eyes on a ghetto girl
Brushin' off some no-man cause she's his ghetto pearl
We into livin' beyond not livin' fads
Me and my comrads became dads young
Try to have fun amongst responsibility
Like fillin' these accounts full
Got caught up at a party in Bull's
Sometimes gotta have the nerve to say some rhymes
Because some minds take offense
Try to make ya life tense but we still here
Still gainin' the love, still standin' above most

[Chorus to end]",Am I Worth You?,2001
Glenn Lewis,"If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

My God it's a beautiful day to just sit and enjoy blue skies
And all the brothers in the streets gettin' high
Give thanks for your life because yo things will change
Ghetto people suffering will soon in-herit the game

The last will come first and the first will come last
And the good will take a seat in the holiest of mass
And blast out the world sin, hard times we living in
I am trying to do the best I can living with my breddrens

The world is filled with negative and positive
Never judge a man what he is is what he is
And I am an ill bro blessed with an ill flow
With an opportunity to rep the T-dot O

And try to spread some of the blessings, lyrical dressings
And I am guessing that your listening to what I am addressing
Especially since I'm rhymiing from my heart
Trying to supress the craziness before it even starts

Yo every gun man has to have a soft spot
Every thug nigga has gotta have some heart
It's these things that I hold to be true
So I don't have to pray that they won't blast you

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

Yo, I was touched by the real the other day
If my pops was here he would tell me enjoy every single day
And support your family 'cause blood comes first for real
Nevermind about trying to sign a deal

Just do what you gotta do and do it like the best
Even when it seems that people C-Bn' for no reason
Don't study the treason, function like a G'
And with that, the world is ready steady f-ing with me

Admiring who I be, I take it as flattery
I must exemplify just what it is to be an emcee
I breathe in the tragedy and breathe out a song of hope
Free from government, politics, lies, plus the Pope

The 5.0 sells dope, police make nuff sales
We're taken out of the hood and locked up with no bail
But either way we get out and try to turn it around
You can't see it but you feel it in the sound, you know dat

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

I'm not a reverend, a preacher, V.P. or teacher
But still I gotta reach and none can impeach
But the most high spiritual, virtually physical
Higher power more than capable to make miracle

In every black home and in every jail cell
And in everyone of us to let the righteous set sail
And accept positioning, whether you a Christian
A Jew, or Muslim, yo have faith in him

The G's in the street know what I'm talking about
The man dem on the corner, surviving with no doubt
The kids in the park trying to keep things real
Yo, who don't hear muss feel? You know that

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets

If everyone could see just how I see
They'd function like a G'
And walk that big walk in the streets, in the streets

Still as beautiful as first day we met

Amazing how the years can go

When we wanted different things
You wanted a family, I was chasing my dream
I didn't know what I had back then
How could I go off through the growing pains of being a man?

I really didn't understand
I took you for granted, now it's out of my hands
Now I wish I had it to do all over again

'Cause all I do is dream about the times we had together
We used to think that they would last forever
But who've thought it be my fault we didn't make it
And when I'm missing you so much that I can't take it
I just close my eyes, I just close my eyes and dream

Don't know what I had thought I really figured out
Looking back had no clue what it was all about
I tried to explain what I was feeling but when I couldn't get through
I would just turn around and get mad at you

Frustrated not knowing the reasons for the things I do
Couldn't see just why you and I would fall apart
Humble by drift and heart
But now I can clearly see how things ended up because of me

Still loving you was all the same

I never believed that love could be for me

Feeling taken for granted but I'm here to tell you, baby

Glenn Lewis,"Living life early morning love
Summer days and getting paid
Friends from around the way
Rain done gone away

Favorite songs knowing where you belong
No place like home
Whatever your vice
That got you nice at any price

And it feels so good
The way it should be
The way it feel
So good to me
Make me feel, so real, real, yeah
Said it's alright, said it's alright

Family shade from a tree, special memories
'Bout the way it used to be
Hanging on the corner
Doing what you wanna, so happy

Out at the movies with ya love
Feeling high above
Any troubles you'd have
Just being glad to be alive and it's alright

It feels so good
The way it should be
The way it feel
Is so good to me
Make me feel, so real, real, yeah
It's alright, said it's alright, great

It feels so good
The way it should be
The way it feel
Is so good to me
Make me feel, so real, real, yeah
I know it's alright, said it's alright

A warm smile from a child
Taking in the game
The scent of spring rain
A day to relax a sensation of climax

It's the way it should be
The way it feel
Is so good to me
Make me feel, so real, real, yeah
I said it's alright, said it's alright

And it feels so good
The way it should be

Glenn Lewis,"I was thinking you and me 
Could start again, fulfill a dream 
Read that somewhere we would find, paradise 
Walls of change have clearly fell 
Sure with loves cry out for help 
If you'd only try with me and see that we 

Should be trying to find a 'cause 
Before a problem flaws 
But know that just to be with, you in a love that truly free 
That could be you and me 

It was something to see, 'cause you know we're too far gone 
To ever be, the same way we been so long 
It was something to see, we can make it if we hold on 
The way it should be, with love leading us along 
  
Love so beautiful to me, now's the chance for all to see 
All you need is to believe, that love's the key 
With peace between us, you and me, then a crystal city's where we could be 
Then there'd be no mystery, just free to be 

Only trying to find a cause, 
Before a problem flaws 
But know that just to be with you, and in love was all it was 
It should ever be because 

It was something to see cause you know we're too far gone 
To ever be, the same way we been so long 
It was something to see, we can make it if we hold on 
The way it should be, with love leading us along, love leading us along",Something to See,2002
Glenn Lewis,"Look at what a mess I made
If I paid attention, maybe then you might have stayed
Deserted you, in the middle of the night
One to many times and askin' why

Where did all the promises go?
Of love you had, not like you don't hear me though
That's what she said to me
I treated it like it was talk just something momentary

Now she's leaving from me being, neglecting of her heart
How I regret it now and I don't know how
I let it get this bad but now I wish
I had the chance to tell you my baby

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, I wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, I wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

You first left I, blamed it on everything but myself
Girlfriends talking to someone else
Present the picture doin' all I'm supposed to do
Getting close to you

Woke up from my sleep 'cause I couldn't breathe
From my heart being so weak if only my tears could speak
They'd say, it was such a mistake
Still I love you babe, hey babe

And now she's leaving from me being, neglecting of her heart
How I regret it now and I don't know how
I let it get this bad but now I wish
I had the chance to tell you my baby

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, I wish that I had the chance
Just before you said bye bye

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, I wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

Tell me what I'm supposed to do
Now that you left me this way
Friends tell you don't be talkin' bout
Your love oh I can't do without that

Now what am I supposed to do?
Life just helplessly whithers away
Tell me if you would ever have that feeling
Like life itself just ain't have no meaning

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I didn't mean to make you cry
Why oh why, wish that I had the chance
Before you had said bye bye

So sorry, so
So sorry, sorry

",Sorry,2002
Glenn Lewis,"It was in November
When while out one night with friends
That I saw her there
She was just standing there

Something in her distant stare
A faint look of despair
To her I was drawn
Asked her was anything wrong

I told her my name
Said how you do
'Bouts to say you take care
It was nice to meet you

Then she stopped me desperately
As if to say don't go, but then she said to me

""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""
""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""

Not knowing what to say
But I could see
She was going through some things
And needed someone to be
There to listen, probably wishing
She was someone else

And in my heart felt bad
And I just knew I had
'Cause I'd want the same myself
So we got into it
And while she talked I thought to myself
How could it be

That she'd have no one, not even a friend to come
And she'd have to turn to me and say

""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""
""Anywhere, you wanna go
Just take me, take me""

Seeking the wrong kind of attention
Always in abusive situations
And don't know how she got it good
Was starting to sound like it could be
The reason for misery

Slowly I could see
She had problems nothing
I or anyone could say or do
Would help what she was going through

Then suddenly, she stood up across from me
And as loud as she could be, screaming out
""Some one help me please""
Realizing she was gone wishing I'd mind my own saying

Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy
Take me an-nywhere but here
She's crazy, crazy

Glenn Lewis,"I have cried all night
Trying to make it better
I recognize my pain
Things are getting harder
For us to be in this love

And my tears wash away my smile
And I'm drowning in my sorrow
There's no hope for today
I can't see my tomorrow
'Cause we are no longer in love

This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love
This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love, love, love

I've been blazed all day
Dreading confrontation
I've waited until now
For this conversation to take place
That we're wasting time

With this love, I'm trying to be nice
Don't want you to be a hater
We've had our beautiful sons
So we gotta be one, sooner or later
'Cause we've got so much more, than this love

This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love
This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love, love, love

Can we still be, can we still be friends?
It will all end in tears if we decide
To leave, but stay, I'm so confused
I can't go on this way, I just can't go on, on this way

This love, your love, my love
It used to be our love
This love, your love, our love
It used to be our love, love, love

What happened to my love baby?
Now we got to think about our sons
So now it's over babe, now it's over baby, babe

Find it in your heart, in your heart

Kiss and make up
I know that will be hard
I love from the start
Now your hearts been scarred

I stand here alone, I feel like the dirt
You lost your main squeeze fuck her nice work
The whole town is laughing at me I'm a clown
I smile on the outside but inside I frown

All the tears and the pain

I apologize for all I have done
Caught between the walls I can't run

Glenn McGregor,"You see 'em coming at you every night
Strung on pretension, they fall for you at first sight
You know their business, you think it's a bore
They make you restless, it's nothing you ain't seen before
Get around town, spend your time on the run
You never let down, say you do it for fun
You never miss a play, though you make quite a few
You give it all away when everybody wants you

You crave attention, you can never say ""no""
Throw your affections anyway the wind blows
You always make it, you're on top of the scene
You sell the copy like the cover of a magazine
Putting on the eyes till there's nobody else
You never realize what you do to yourself
The things that they see make the daily reviews
You never get free when everybody wants you

Everybody knows you
Everybody snows you
Everybody needs you, leads you, bleeds you

Nights of confusion and impossible dreams
Days at the mirror, patching up around the seams
You got your glory, you paid for it all
You take your pension in loneliness and alcohol
Say goodbye to conventional ways
You can't escape the hours, you lose track of the days
The more you understand, seems the more like you do
You never get away, everybody wants you

Everybody want you
Everybody want you",Everybody,2000
Glenn Medeiros,"Ooh
Ooh oh oh

I used to think I lived, to be in love, 
But what I had to give was not enough.

Now you look into the mirror and you'll see
The reflection of just how our love used to be.

And though, we had it all,
We wanted even more

Even more

We don't have to look for love, 

It's knocking at our door

I said let's take it slow, but you didn't care.

What was to be our future is now our past.
And I am the best that you will find.
We were both the best we left behind,
And though, we had it all,
We wanted even more,
Even more,
Wanted so much more,
We don't have to look for love, 

It's knocking at our door

Glenn Medeiros,"Why do I seem to be caught up inside a dream
All my life, it's always been my shadow and me
Over my shoulder there's always a voice somewhere
Saying I never should try to set my heart free
I wish that love would come and take me in her arms
Show me what I've never known
Where I could hold someone, words like right and wrong
Just fade away like yesterday

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why, won't even let me fall in love
Oooooh everywhere I go always by my side
Won't even let me fall in love

I try and say I love you but the words won't come through
In my eyes, see all the tears and sad memories
Why can't I start out new and leave that old feeling too far behind
I guess that lonely needs company
Around each bend of road
I'm thinking that in time there will be that rainbow's end
But when I follow those self illusions
I find that it's only lonely and me again

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why, won't even let me fall in love
Oooooh everywhere I go always by my side
Won't even let me fall in love

I wish that love would come
Lonely won't leave me alone
And take me home

The girl jazz you but she's nothing but trouble

Take her where she wants to go
And ev'ry day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind
But she just cops an attitude and leads you off and leaves you blue
Can't you see she's really just a waste of time?
One day she'll treat you nice
Then she'll turn as cold as ice
But you think your love will win her in the end, think again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo

I know better than, better than, better than you

And keeps you waitin' on the phone

I'm not the only boy in town
And she loves me into the ground
But tell me, do you really like standing in line?
Give her ev'rything you have and all it does is make you sad

That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried

One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this key as a kiss and a good-bye
She ain't worth it even though she's on a high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick

Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

She gets you but then leaves you cold
And keeps you waitin' on the phone
'cause you know you'll alway give her on more try
I'm not the only boy in town
And she loves me into the ground
But tell me, do you really like standing in line?
Give her ev'rything you have and all it does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
'Cause there's no one in this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied
I know, 'cause I tried

One thing I hate is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
'Cause I tried to make you mine for the last time
So take this key as a kiss and a good-bye
She ain't worth it even though she's on a high tip
She better get a grip and get a grip quick
Fast in a hurry 'cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy but she's nothin' but trouble
Give her ev'rything you have all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do is tell her friends she did it again

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me I know
I know better than, better than, better than you

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief that she's been puttin' you through, oo
She ain't worth it

What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size
I'll just tell him, ""Baby, won't you swing it with me""
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely ""Darling may I intrude""
He said ""Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood""

First I held him lightly and we started to dance
Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said ""Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me""
""Well"" he answered ""Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood""

In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skipping

Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo

Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'

A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh

No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

Bright down in Rio De Janiero
Comes a gent with a mellow instrument
And a colorful sombrero,
Then he sings and the melody he brings 
So tenderly played 
Is called the Gaucho Serenade.

Si, Senor he's a happy troubadour 
On a patio you'll find him.
Si Senor, he will go from door to door
Leaving happiness behind him.
All the sweet Senoritas hurry out to join the parade

Where the moon was dreaming on a distant hill,
When a smile danced by it was then that I saw
Heaven in a pair of wooden shoes.

In an old Dutch garden where the tulips grow
That's where I first whispered that I love you so
For my heart was blue till I gave it to 
An angel in a pair of wooden shoes.

Then one sad day when summer meets September
I sailed away from a thrill I will remember,

I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.

Love Child, by society,
Love Child, never meant to be, 
Love Child, diff'rent from the rest.

To be without the simple things,

Don't think I don't want to please you.

I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

I had no complaints
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away",Hallelujah!,1991

And now they're commin' for to carry me home","Swing Low, Sweet Chariot",1995
Glenn Miller,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1995
Glenn Miller,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1995

Glenn Miller,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep.

The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop,

So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you.

You are the one
Only you beneath the moon

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

Glenn Miller
Written by Nat Burton and Walter Kent.
As recorded by the Glenn Miller on November 24th 1941 with Ray Eberle.
there'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
there'll be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow, when the world is free
The shepherd will tend his sheep
The valley will bloom again
And Johnny will go to sleep
In his own little room again
there'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see...!

Glenn Miller,"Angels come to paint the desert nightly 
When the moon is beaming brightly 
Along the Santa Fe Trail 
Stardust scattered all along the highway 

On a rainbow-colored skyway 
Along the Santa Fe Trail 
Beside you 
I'm riding every hill and dale 

Wide shadows hide you 
Just like a pretty purple veil 
Thereby hangs a tale 
I found you 

And the mountains that surround you 
Are the wall I built around you 
Along the Santa Fe trail...",Along the Santa Fe Trail,1995
Glenn Miller,"You are always in my heart 
Even though you're far away 
I can hear the music of 
The song of love 
I sang with you 
You are always in my heart 
And when skies above are grey 
I remember that you care 
And then and there 
The sun breaks through 

Just before I go to sleep 
There's a rendezvous I keep 
And a dream I always meet 
Helps me forget we're far apart 
I don't know exactly when, dear, 
But I'm sure we'll meet again, dear, 
And my darling, till we do 
You are always in my heart!",Always in My Heart,1995
Glenn Miller,"Summer, you old Indian Summer
You're the tear that comes after June times laughter
You see so many dreams that don't come true
Dreams we fashioned when summer time was new

You are here to watch over
Some heart that is broken
By a word that somebody left unspoken
You're the ghost of a romance in June

Going astray, fading too soon
That's why I say, ""Farewell to you, Indian Summer!""

",Anvil Chorus,1995
Glenn Miller,"Hi there Tex, what you say
Step aside partner, it's my day
Bend an ear and listen to my version
Of a really solid Tennessee excursion

Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo choo? (yes yes)
Track twenty-nine
Boy, you can gimme a shine
Can you afford To board a Chattanooga choo choo
I've got my fare And just a trifle to spare

You leave the Pennsylvania Station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner
Nothing could be finer
Then to have your ham an' eggs in Carolina

When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in
Gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga there you are

There's gonna be
A certain party at the station
Satin and lace
I used to call ""funny face""
She's gonna cry
Until I tell her that I'll never roam

Won't you choo-choo me home?

Glenn Miller,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

Where my heart can go a-journeying 
Over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane?

And down and down I go; round and round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide.

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name and I'm aflame.
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire.

For you're the lover I have waited for,
The mate that Fate had me created for.

Glenn Miller,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1998

And so it never dies

And if only they could feel it too

Can you afford To board a Chattanooga choo choo

Nothing could be finer

Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in
Gotta keep it rollin'

and a twinkle in your eye

that you nearly passed me by

Now ev'ry year we go back

When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

We didn't make a movie though maybe the next year or so

know what you're missin friend
The last album was dope y'all, and here we go again!

Yo Jeff, straight up, we can't allow them
to go out like that, our music is too def
We produce hit records right and left
Daytime, nighttime, def beat, def rhyme
Chorus line, bass drum, snare drum, bassline
All of this makes our records rock til the party's end..

When we first came out, we had a smash hit song
Then people started askin, ""What's takin so long
for y'all to put another record out for the airwaves?""
I said, ""Hold up - let me explain.
When you hear a record on your radio station
it's probably getting played all throughout the nation
But we got lucky, ours was played in Germany
France, Japan, Sweden London Italy
So therefore, we had to go on tour
City after city, 'Encore encore, bravo bravo!'
Sorry we gotta go

Glenn Miller,"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

And you know what happened

Glenn Miller,"South of the border - down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love, where the stars above - came out to play
And now as I wander - my thoughts ever stray
South of the border - down Mexico way

She was a picture - in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed a smile - upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta - and we were so gay
South of the border - Mexico way

Then she smiled as she whispered ""manana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
Then I lied as a whispered ""manana""
'Cause our tomorrow never came

South of the border - I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white, by the candle light - she knelt to pray
The mission bells told me (ding-dong) - that I musn't stay

Glenn Miller,"Our waltz is music fashioned in heaven,
Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Angels were watching one day,
And our love was their inspiration!

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

It's just an old piano and a knocked out bass

Mammy's sellin' chicken fried in bacon grease
Well come along with me boys it's just down the road a piece.

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night.

My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you and sing you a Moonlight Serenade.

Let us stray till break of day
in love's valley of dreams.
Just you and I, a summer sky,
a heavenly breeze kissing the trees.

Glenn Miller,"In a little honky-tonky village in Texas 
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far 
He can play piano any way that you like it 
But the way he likes it best is eight to the bar 
When he plays it's a ball 
He is the daddy of them all... 
The people gather round when he gets on the stand 
Then when he plays he gets a hand 
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance 
Nobody there bothers to dance 
And when he jams with the bass and guitar 
They holler all, ""Beat me daddy, eight to bar!"" 
 A plink, plunkin' on the keys
 A riff, well, a-riffin' out with ease 
And when he jams with the bass and guitar 
They holler all, ""Come on and beat me daddy, eight to bar!""",Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar,2006

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy (Londonderry Serenade),2011

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon!""

The music started and was I the perplexed one 
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?"" 
In my frightened arms polka dots and moonbeams 
Sparkled on a pugnosed dream 

There were questions in the eyes of all the dancers 
As we floated over the floor 
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers 
And perhaps a few things more...

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

Why can't I let you know,

Just for a tender while, I kissed a smile - upon her face
'Cause it was fiesta - and we were so gay

Then she smiled as she whispered ""manana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
Then I lied as a whispered ""manana""

Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight.
I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night.
The roses are sighing a Moonlight Serenade.

The stars are aglow and tonight how their light sets medreaming.
My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you and sing you a Moonlight Serenade.

Let us stray till break of day
in love's valley of dreams.
Just you and I, a summer sky,
a heavenly breeze kissing the trees.

So don' let me wait, come to me tenderly in the June night.
I stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight,
a love song, my darling, a Moonlight Serenade.",Moonlight Serenade,1991

I hate to see that evening sun go down

Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"I was never spellbound by a starry sky
What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven 
For you are mine at last
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven",At Last [*],1991

Glenn Miller
Written by Nat Burton and Walter Kent.
As recorded by the Glenn Miller on November 24th 1941 with Ray Eberle.
there'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
there'll be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow, when the world is free
The shepherd will tend his sheep
The valley will bloom again
And Johnny will go to sleep
In his own little room again
there'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see...!

And when I touched your lips
I fell in love last night...
Last night, I felt your heart beat fast

Swiftly the moments passed
Why couldn't it last last night?
Tonight here I am all alone
My lovely dream has flown

Why must I be alone?
Last night, why did we say goodbye?
My heart keeps asking why,
Why couldn't it last last night...?

Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"Life, Look, Pic, Peek always print a beautiful cast 
And another thing they love 
Is a certain photograph 
You take the Time, Tide, Newsweek, ev?ry editorial staff 
Over a beer they agree 

The man of the year 
Is the air minded executive 
Who dearly loves to fly 
He was an up to date go-getter 

His lady friend was even better 
She went along to take a letter 
Just to be nearby 
The air minded executive 

Will take off on the sly 
He was a most romantic feller 
And all the things he used to tell her 
About the role of his propeller 

Somewhere in the sky... 
Foggy or fair, 
Gotta be there 
Lightin' a flare at the airport 

Fillin' the tanks 
Callin' the banks 
Tellin' them, ""Hold up the contract!""

Air minded executive became a wealthy guy 
And so he wed his secretary 
They settled down in Waterbury

And they commute by stratos-ferry
My, they love to fly

When the moon is beaming brightly 
Along the Santa Fe Trail 
Stardust scattered all along the highway 

On a rainbow-colored skyway 
Along the Santa Fe Trail 
Beside you 
I'm riding every hill and dale 

Wide shadows hide you 
Just like a pretty purple veil 
Thereby hangs a tale

And then and there 
The sun breaks through 

Just before I go to sleep 
There's a rendezvous I keep 
And a dream I always meet 
Helps me forget we're far apart

The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard 
You speak and the angels sing 
Or am I breathing music into every word?

I can see water and moonlight beaming 
Silvry waves that break on an undiscovered shore 
Then suddenly I see it all change 
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming

We kiss and the angels sing 
And leave their music ringing in my heart!",And the Angels Sing,1991

And I was so surprised to find my arms around romance

Takes you off the beaten track 
You don't look at your partner at all 
When you dance back to back 

That's that new attack 
That the other dances lack

When you dance back to back... 

Your partner won't see you make eyes at who dances by

Let me place you in the pack 

Cut the cards and I?ll deal you a queen and a jack
