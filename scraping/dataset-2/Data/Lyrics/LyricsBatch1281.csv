Woodie,"Much pride north side of the golden state
It's woodie wood from the a-n-t-i-o-see-h
Where the crack bags potent
And the pigs are deep
For every new batch could happen to go sleep
And I creep in a 69 lark for dark
Parking up the block on rallies
Chrome shining like jark
Swinging sideways the highways up there aiming for brains
With my eyes all dilated swerving through lanes
Shits gone strange but i was up in funk before that
So nothings really changed in this yoc life format
Homies gone or doing time so they putting it deep
But we some norte sidin ridin 90 bumping with heat (with beat)
Waking out the windows spitting yoc life lingo
(that shits so tight it makes my ears tingle)
I seen gold shot duce duces all it takes
Still rattled up these crazy killas bearing for state
But I prefer to talk a tray five save on my nuts
So I can hit them with a gunshot fuckin them up

Living in the skirts of the eastbay co co county
Cranking buns to keep the ballers paid
But you can't fade when the soldiers get to riding
Fire it up fire it up

Yoc Influenced what the fuck does it mean
It's the reason why I'M cocking back and blowing out your spleen
It could mean that your all about your green and copping see notes
Or rolling on the triple gold's where and folks are serving bedos
Might have you flossing with your town soiled up
Or hit the county you a bitch or a snitch your getting rolled up
So I'M a solidified yoc swinga a malt liqueur drinker a fuckin deep thinker
Until I hit the grave better count me as a factor
Cause I ain't ever been out shooting blanks hauling with actor
Prepare to scrap down as I pound through this town
Of a hundred thousand people fifty thousand living bound
Back in 92 only a few busters ridin
93 grew out these fools south siding
94 we kept the pistol chamber smoking
95 realized the yoc ain't joking
96 had the homies prove they swanging
that's all good but why'd you fools quit banging
97 fuck it i ain't even trippin load the homies that I got even more
And keep dipping let the record state
In 98 shall I die write the words in my obituary for the north side I serve

Living life strapped put a target on a scrap
And imma hit a bullseye cause its like that
Woodies only hated for the fact I'm gang related
Fuck rapping about that bullshit been through too much to fake it

[Woodie]
Bullets fly
Quicker than the eyes
You was hittin' Mary-Jane
To ease the pain
Your homie died
Muthafucka I'm a ride
To the rallies on steel
I'm in the bushes camouflage
Ain't thinkin' 'bout no clientele
If I fail I'll rot in jail
And if I succeed
I'll burn in hell
So either way I'm fucked in these streets
The Bible says I live my life rough
Statistics say I'll die young
I can't disagree 'cause I'm a  
Fuckin' walkin' time bomb
The clock is tickin'
Finger's itchin'
To unleash a piece
Some 32 empty homies
That are dyin' to beat
The [?] flesh you want to kill me
Sucka really
Ya'll the type that pull your strap
And shoot holes in the ceiling
And I get out for killin'
Sucka give it up
With your strap beside and ride
To the club and live it up

[Chorus] x3
Out to the cuts
The clock is tickin'
Finger's itchin'
In the bushes camouflaged
Waiting for my victim

[Woodie]
I never thought that I would live
To see the age of 21
I grew up paranoid
When I often sleepin' with my gun
50 dollars by my purse
Strap a sawed off one shot gauge
Since the a day I lay the blaze
I was stuck in evil ways
In amaze
At the power that it could devour
Strip that O.G. from his reputation
In the late night hour
Show shower let the situation sour funk
But ain't no stoppin' the poppin'
That gets the droppin' these pumps
I found my callin' and I
Hooked up with some natural born killas
Preferrin' 45 calibur's over 9 miler's
Survivals of the peelas
So I creep precaution
Steppin' out his skeleton
An I'm red chucks flossin', hoggin'
I'll be that muthafucka that you hate
'cause you know I'll take that clip and
Slap it in and test your fate
And demonstrate the Yoc influenced  
State of mind that I'm stuck
I'll be committin' sins wit a devilish grin
I gives a fuck

[Chorus] x4

[Woodie]
Creepin', crawlin'
Strap not fallin'
But got a box of ammo
For the weapon that I'm haulin'
The streets are callin'
So I'm comin' with artillery
And chucks and khakis
As I move up on my enemies
A pedigree soldier
Yeah that's were the foul
Northern Cal profile
Nothin' less I confess
I'm a sinner
But how can I show remorse
'cause I can't afford to let the Bible
Throw me off course
I'm known to rivals
When I gotta make these  
Sucka's skull crack
It could be better than
Havin' my chips and a yacht
And bet the whole stack
Do or die
Make these muthafuckas understand
That they're tryin' to touch
A particle that they can't comprehend
Can't pretend to be a soldier
When your a punk
'cause it'll hold ya
Hog tied in the trunk
And name one chump
Run your mouth
And now your bent up like a slut
Should have kept your pistol cocked
Fuckin' with this Yoc murderer

[Chorus] x4

Out to the cuts [echoes out]",The Clock Is Tickin',1999
Woodie,"My momma always told me it was gonna be days like this [like this]

I live a lifestyle, covered up by dark clouds
Dealin' with these suckas, but they only see the bar clouds
Still I keep a strap for when I come across a killa
I dreamt the day I'll have to fight that killa in the mirror
I wake up every mornin', hit my fifth and hope I live
Just another day to see what tomorrow's got to give
I'm addicted to the liquor
And at days I peel the sticker off another forty ounce
And wonder, 'How did my life get here?'
My ole goes in stayin' drunk and eliminatin' funk
Fuckin' hoes or rollin' triple golds always up in the trunk
My mother asks me everyday, 'Are you still bangin?'
I lie and tell her, 'No', but her heart knows I ain't changed none

I hate to see her cry, wipe the tears from her eyes
And try to tell her everything is gonna be alright
I hug her tightly, as I leave it bothers me
But for now I gotta go, 'cause these streets are callin' me

[Chorus x2]
My mother prays that I quit the life I lead
Damn I try to change my ways, but these streets are callin' me
And I love her to death, but at the same time I'm a souljah
I gotta put in work, let rivals know they can't get over

I'm a yoc influenced souljah taking chances
I'm levelin' with all my homeboys up in drug induced trances
Evil dances through our thoughts as we plot different strategies

To kill our enemies and not get concepts
My homie got shot in the spine, he's been paralyzed
I see nothin' but deep despair when I stare into his eyes
I feel my anger rise as I think about his character
He never hurt nobody, just a homeboy that was there for ya

These streets are really fair, and that's a hard lesson learned

But you realize quick enough after up three time getting burned

The streets are cold, bits of love but mostly greed is all they hold
You in my way, I'll burn a load and make yo head explode, [Now what]

That's my moto
Livin' in the bottle, hit the throttle
Let this shit start to get you thick, break out the fully-auto
[scrap killa]

[Chorus x2] 

Just got done
Creasin' up my khakis, put my nights on
I hear my homeboys outside honkin' the horn
I guess tonight's on
Grabbed the tray snubby
Give my moms a kiss goodbye
As I hop into the ride
She prays that I come home alive
I can't justify my life because I know I'm livin' raw
What the fuck do you expect me to do when the funk is on
Tryin' to get along, with my rivals
Foo, you must be jokin'
What you smokin?
Hollow tips and pistols clips is what I got for fools approachin'

I'm tryin' to get ahead
Spitin' high-lead at these rivals ramped up
In this life of vega got me homicidal
Better check my vital signs
Since I'm livin half dead by the thoughts
Got my brain washed, fuckin' with my head
Break a sweat up in my bed
Dude, the nightmares got my body tense
But still I'm prepared to die for this so called nonsense
'Cause everything is fucked up
The whole world is corrupt
I'll never switch up on my homies
So consider me stuck, f**ked
I ain't trippin' though
Yeah my money's sittin' low
But still I got enough to get a four-0 at the liquor store
And clothes on my back, plus a gat for these rivals
All my only necessities for survival

Woodie," 

Chorus: [Woodie]
I might of shot your homies  
Once or twice you never know
But I still walk the streets
So I assumed they let it go
But just in case they didn't
I pack metal for clever folks
So all that talk in breakin' Woodie off
Whatever tho'

[Woodie]
I'm still puttin' it down
Sidin' through the town Yoc bound
Suckas want to talk down
But ain't prepared to cock down
They want to bang like killas
But don't bang with no killas
They want to claim they killas
But don't hang with no killas
This is Antioch, the A-N-T-I-O-see-H
And I'm the one who brought the Yoc  
Up out the Golden State
You want to hate this
Hate yourself
Think your from the Yoc
Talkin' down on my name
'cause I ain't askin' you to jock
Just recognize
From two professional years of rappin'
East Co. Co. Records puttin' this crap
Back in time on the map
And then some
We takin' nationwide infected
Each and every nook and cranny
Were that Yoc life bakins'
And I reckon
We'll be collectin' dividends along the way
And that's exactly were this haterism comes into play
What's there to say
Nothin' but hot ones  
I got for those talkin' down on me

[Chorus] X2

[Woodie]
Come on haters try to stop this
Dig deep into your pockets
'cause that'll give me a legit reason  
To make yo knot twist, not this  
Northern fella Antioch dwella
Won't fall hostage  
To the thoughts and plots of the jealous
Your gonna watch this
Independent label succeed
Were re-precautions 10-4 for  
Every homey that bleeds
We'll plant our seeds in some mattress
And watch our killas grow
Teach ?em everything we know
So that they gonna run the show
I'm talkin' fathers and sons
Uncles and nephews packin' guns
Holdin' down the fort
Prepared for war
Protectin' loved one
No more snatchin' up our dreams
Through the dope on triple beams
Or an enemy shot
'cause that's the power money brings
We're the kings of our own plot
We found a spot
Don't make room
If you think we're bluffin'
I assume you have a skank too
So if you want to get me
Come and get me
Quit talkin'
And send the messages through bitches
'cause that shit'll leave you chopped up

[Chorus] X2

[Woodie]
You want to talk behind my back
And jar jack amongst female company
And every word up out your mouth
Eventually gon' come to me
How dumb could you be
Maybe you really want to see me
But most likely you a sucka
And you hatin' you can't be me
Probably got that A-D-D
Attention Deficit Disorder
And you've notice when you say my name
That people won't ignore ya
That's pathetic
Just another sorry chump in the game
Go ahead keep bumpin' my name
'cause your just pumpin' my fame
But when we cross paths
Haul that
So people prepare to ache
'cause I'm a draw fast
Cock blast
With heat to tear your brain
'cause I've HAD IT UP TO HERE [echoes]
Through your history
I got my stripes
Sucka you ain't pumpin' fears
So come here and get a dose of  
This Antioch West Twompsta
The demon in me wants to
Go back to a mobsta
And put this music shit on stand by
To make a man die
How do I cope with this
I focus on the grand prize

[Chorus] X2

Nothin' but hot ones I got for those talkin' down on me

Woodie,"[A-Wax]
Yo feel my flury
Feel my fury
Middle finger to the world
Till I'm burried
Heaven or hell
Choose one or be a treat
By seven I'm in a spell, bumpin' a beat
Somethin' comes from deep within me
Talkin' sickly, stictly, talkin' to me
So possibly I could be goin' insane
Snortin' this cane
Stressed out like a muthafucka flowin' his pain
Misunderstood by most
Few people considered close
It's a very thin line between foes and folks
Slide up [?] and spokes, bangin' the curb
Stumblin' out the driver side tamin' the Burg
Mumblin' words, ready to reach
Dawg I'm deadly wit heat
Hold it steady I'll be
A fuckin' nut, patna what
Run up and get touched
Sent him on a journey stretched out on a gurney
I'm turnin' more savage as the days go by
Think I'm headed for the flames
Dawg, I ain't gon' lie
It's a cold world full a sin
What the fuck, what the fuck
What the fuck are you supposed to do
They after you and they want yo soul
But it ain't nothin' you can do
Wit that chrome 44
All the love in the world couldn't kill this rage
And I simply love nothin' but this kill I blaze

[Chorus: Woodie (A-Wax)]
Let me take you on a journey (journey)
Heaven to the depths of hell burning (heaven to the depths of hell)
Westcoast to eastcoast where we makin' earnings (westcoast, eastcoast)
America, we ain't scared of ya we darin' ya (America) (darin' ya)
Better be prepared when you hit the Bay Area (better be prepared) (Bay Area)
Journey, heaven to the depths of hell burning (heaven to the depths of hell)
Westcoast to eastcoast where we makin' earnings (westcoast, eastcoast)
America, we ain't scared of ya we darin' ya (America) (we darin' ya)
Better be prepared when you hit the Bay Area (better be prepared) (Bay Area)

[Woodie]
That's the point ya existence
I could feel these haters in a distance
Plottin', schemin', dreamin' that they can get wit this
Witness through the eyes of a survivor
From these battlefields in the streets
I was born a fighter
And unlike many others
I've been through this shit
I've held a homie's hand
Till he died and lost grip
Homie rip, rest in peace
Things we used to say but fuck that!
That ain't enough I'm gonna ride to my grave
Think I'm gonna pay for the actions that you make
I'm way beyond the point of wonder why I'm [?] trait
This goes to all my enemies
Big or small, your up in the fault
I got nothin' to loose
I die or win it all
Look my mind is like a brick wall
Hard to penetrate
This stuborn muthafucka that I am is ready to demonstrate
You tend to fake
Sucka you'll be the first to go
'cause I'm a lay it down, right now
Woodie let ya know

Woodkid,"Buying some vintage records in Williamsberg stores
Playing paper boats on east river shores
Meeting mermaids and lobsters in Coney Island
Puking our deep fried Oreos in Astroland
Spending our days watching skylines from rooftops
On Independence Day, Manhattan fireworks
Life is easier where the walls are red
Brooklyn is a place stuck in my head
Here in Paris the rain is falling
My heart belongs to Brooklyn

I'm sick of four star food, I want to be where life is
As simple as two bucks pizza slices
I swear I'll tell you, next time I knock at your door
That I am not leaving Brooklyn anymore
Would it be that nice if you were not part of it?
Would Brooklyn be worth crossing the Atlantic
Life is easier where we can join our hands
Your face is a face that's stuck in my head
Here in Paris rain is falling
My heart belongs to Brooklyn

Life is easier where we can join our hands

Woodkid,"Most of my sweet memories were buried in the sand
The fire and the pain will now be coming to an end
How did you get to save me from this desolate wasteland
In your eyes I see the dawn of brighter days again.

With my tears you washed away the mud stuck on my hands
All the things you're trying to do make me a better man
Now I remember the joy and the taste of candy cane
The innocence of youth and the sound of major scales.

Most of what I used to be had vanished in the waves
The memories of the boy I've been were drowning and you saved them
Now I remember the joy and the meaning of the fate
The color of the truth and the sound of sunny days.

And everybody else in the county
Chasin' him all across the swamp

He looked up to the tree there
And seen the lights from a house

He didn't know whether the people inside
Was friends or were enemies
So he wanted to go up to the house
So, and asked if he could stay there
To get away from the bloodhounds

He was afraid if he did go up there

Barking at him or shoot him down

This group is already well on its way to oink oink land. 
Oops, so sorry. Once again behaving in a manner I had sworn to aschew. 
Thank you. Once again falling into the vat of vulgarity. 
Oh tut tut. I did so want to leave my sordid past behind and emerge 
Form this project beathed in a new and ennobling light. 
I wanted to come out and be the sweet, pure, honest, 
Unadorned person that I really really am. 
I wanted to show you the good beneath the gaudy, 
The saint beneath all this paint, the sweet, pure, 
Winsome little soul that lurks beneath this lurid exterior. 
But fortunately, just as I was about to rush down the path 
To repectability and righteousness, 
A wee small voice called out to me in the night 
And reminded me of the motto by which I've always tried to live my life: 
F$CK 'EM IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE!""

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Who would ever thought a guy
Would want a girl like me
Who would ever thought that I
Would  fall so easily
Who would ever thought that we
Would finally come to be
I guess they just don't know
How much you mean to me
Who would ever thought that they
Would have some words to say
We'll go on anyway
It's alright, it's okay
Take what ever comes our way
Together we will stay
I got three words to say
Never say never

I can't believe they'd stop our happiness
By trying to pull us down with such a mess
Why can't they let us live just like the rest
And keep us out of all of this crazy madness
Now when they talk I think it's just a shame
That all they do is sit and think my name
When all that I do is mainly
Sit and think about my baby and me

Now baby they can't believe that
You and me are together
That's why they should have never
Never say never
There were times when we thought that
You an me could never be together
That's why we should have never
Never say never

Now there's a lot of talkin' goin' round
About the way me and you gettin' down
What are they jealous are they hatin' me
I guess they all have their own Ph.D's
I wish that they would just stop sweatin' me
Stop trying to get the best of me
No matter what they say baby
We gotta move on because we're gonna be happy

We didn't let the thoughts that we had
We didn't let the words that they said
Keep us from the love we now have
Never say never
Simply for me to see when
Never would've been never allowed
Now that we are together
Never say never

If I'd listened to what mama said  
I'd be at home today 
Being so young and foolish, poor girl 
I let a gambler lead me astray 

My mother she's a tailor 
Sews those new blue jeans 
My sweetheart, he's a drunkard, Lord God 
He drinks down in New Orleans

He fills his glasses to the brim 
Passes them around
The only pleasure that he gets out of life  
Is a hoboin' from town to town 

The only thing a drunkard needs 
Is a suitcase and a trunk 
The only time that he's half satisfied 
Is when he's on a drunk

Go and tell my baby sister  
Never do like I have done 
Shun that house down in New Orleans 
That they call that Rising Sun. 

It's one foot on the platform,  
One foot on the train. 
I'm going back down to New Orleans 
To wear my ball and my chain

Woody Guthrie,"Two good men a long time gone,
Two good men a long time gone
(Two good men a long time gone, oh, gone),
Sacco, Vanzetti a long time gone,
Left me here to sing this song.

Say, there, did you hear the news?
Sacco worked at trimming shoes;
Vanzetti was a peddling man,
Pushed his fish cart with his hands.

Sacco was born across the sea
Somewhere over in Italy;
Vanzetti was born of parents fine,
Drank the best Italian wine.

Sacco sailed the sea one day,
Landed up in Boston Bay;
Vanzetti sailed the ocean blue,
Landed up in Boston, too.

Sacco's wife three children had,
Sacco was a family man;
Vanzetti was a dreaming man,
His book was always in his hand.

Sacco earned his bread and butter
Being the factory's best shoe cutter;
Vanzetti spoke both day and night,
Told the workers how to fight.

I'll tell you if you ask me
'Bout this payroll robbery;
Two clerks was killed by the shoe factory
On the street in South Braintree.

Judge Thayer told his friends around
He would cut the radicals down;
Anarchist bastards was the name
Judge Thayer called these two good men.

I'll tell you the prosecutors' names,
Katsman, Adams, Williams, Kane;
The judge and lawyers strutted down,
They done more tricks than circus clowns.

Vanzetti docked here in 1908;
He slept along the dirty streets,
He told the workers ?Organize?
And on the electric chair he dies.

All you people ought to be like me,
And work like Sacco and Vanzetti;
And every day find some ways to fight
On the union side for workers' rights.

I've got no time to tell this tale,
The dicks and bulls are on my trail;

But I'll remember these two good men
That died to show me how to live.

Sing this song and sing it plain.
All you folks that's coming along,
Jump in with me, and sing this song.",Two Good Men,1960

Smoked glasses to block out the light

I see 'em in fast running cars

Woody Guthrie,"One evening when the sun was low 
My brown eyes whispered, ""I must go.""
Not one second would she wait. 
She kissed my cheek and left my gate.

[Chorus]
Those brown eyes I loved so well. 
Those brown eyes I long to see.
How I long for those brown eyes. 
Strangers they have grown to be.

One night I met her on the street. 
I tipped my hat but I could not speak.
Another man was by her side. 
Soon I thought she'd be his bride.

'Twas just a year ago today, 
They laid my own brown eyes away.
Six long years for me she cried. 
It was her brother by her side.

Woody Guthrie,"On Springfield Mountain there did dwell
A lovely youth I knowed him well.

Too roo de nay, too roo de noo

This lovely youth one day did go
Down to the meadom for to mow.

Too roo de nay, too roo de noo.

He scarce had mowed quite round the field
When a crul serpent bit his heel.

Too roo de nay, too roo de noo.

They took him home to molly dear
Which made him feel so very gueer.

Too roo de nay, too roo de noo.

Now Molly had two ruby lips
With which the poison she did sip.

Too roo de nay, too roo de noo.

Now Molly had a rotting tooth,
And so the poison killed them both.

Woody Guthrie,"(The Great Dust Storm)

On the 14th day of April of 1935,
There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky.
You could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black,
And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track.

From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,
Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,
It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,
We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom.

The radio reported, we listened with alarm,
The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm;
From Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico,
They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw.

From old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell,
And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill.
From Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong,
They thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long.

Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks,
And the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks.
And the family it was crowded into their little room,
They thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom.

The storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night,
When we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight.
We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown
Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown.

It covered up our fences, it covered up our barns,
It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm.
We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in,
We rattled down that highway to never come back again.

I don't want your silver change 
All I want is your love darling 
Won't you take me back again

And you thought this world of me 
Then you left me for another 
In my grave I'd rather be 

I don't want no greenback dollar 
I don't want your silver change
All I wants your pretty little daughter 
Won't you take me back again",Greenback Dollar,1964

Woody Guthrie,"Come all you old time cowboys
And listen to my song
Please do not grow weary
I'll not detain you long

Concerning some wild cowboys
Who did agree to go
Spend the summer pleasant
On the trail of the buffalo

I found myself in griffin
In the spring of '83
When a well known famous drover
Come walking up to me

Said, ""How do you do, young fellow
Well, how would you like to go
And spend the summer pleasant
On the trail of the buffalo?""

Well, I being out of work right then
To the drover I did say
""Going out on the buffalo road
Depends on the pay""

If you will pay good wages
And transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
On the hunt of the buffalo

Of course I'll pay good wages
And transportation too
If you will agree to work for me
Until the season's through

But if you do get homesick
And you try to run away
You will starve to death
Out on the trail and also lose your pay

Well with all his flattering talking
He signed up quite a train
Some 10 or 12 in number
Some able bodied men

Our trip it was a pleasant one
As we hit the Westward road
Until we crossed Old Boggy Creek
In Old New Mexico

There our pleasures ended
And our troubles all began
A lightening storm hit us
And made the cattle run

Got all full of stickers
From the cactus that did not grow
And the outlaws watching
To pick us off in the hills of Mexico

Well, our working season ended
And the drover would not pay
If you had not drunk too much
You are all in debt to me

But the cowboys never had heard
Such a thing as a bankrupt law
So we left that drover's bones to bleach
On the plains of the buffalo

Way down in that old Columbus Stockade

Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

Many a night with you I've rambled
Honey, countless hours with you I've spent
Thought I had your sweet love and your little heart forever
But I find it was only lent.

Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

Last night as I lay sleeping
Oh, I dreamd that I was you in my arms
When I woke I was mistaken

Some say he's born up in Maine
I just say he was a Louisiana man

Well, the Captain said to John Henry
""I'm gonna bring my steam drill around
Gonna bring my steam drill out on the job
Gonna whup that steel on down, down, down

(What he say?)
""You can bring your steam drill around
You can bring your steam drill out on the job
I'll beat your steam drill down, down, down
Beat your steam drill down""

John Henry said to his Shaker
""Shaker, you had better pray
If you miss your six feet of steel
I'll be your buryin' day, day, day
I'll be your buryin' day""

I'd die with an hammer in my hand, hand, hand

Her name was Polly Anne

While Polly handled steel like a man, man, man
Polly handled steel like a man

He met Preacher Casey, and they had a little drink
But they found that his family they was gone
He found that his family they was gone

He found his mother's old fashion shoe
Found his daddy's hat
And he found little Muley and Muley said

Found his family
They took Preacher Casey and loaded in a car

He picked up a handful of land in his hand
Said: I'm stayin' with the farm till I die

Shot a woman in the back
Before he could take his aim again

And then he got away
And he met Tom Joad on the old river bridge

Preached about the rich and the poor

Cause we ain't got a chance anymore

To the bridge where the water run down
But the vigilante thugs hit Casey with a club

Woody Guthrie,"Take a trip with me in 1913,
To Calumet, Michigan, in the copper country.
I will take you to a place called Italian Hall,
Where the miners are having their big Christmas ball.

I will take you in a door and up a high stairs,
Singing and dancing is heard everywhere,
I will let you shake hands with the people you see,
And watch the kids dance around the big Christmas tree.

You ask about work and you ask about pay,
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day,
Working the copper claims, risking their lives,
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives.

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air,
And the spirit of Christmas is there everywhere,
Before you know it you're friends with us all,
And you're dancing around and around in the hall.

Well a little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights,
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet,
To hear all this fun you would not realize,
That the copper boss' thug men are milling outside.

The copper boss' thugs stuck their heads in the door,
One of them yelled and he screamed, ""there's a fire,""
A lady she hollered, ""there's no such a thing.
Keep on with your party, there's no such thing.""

A few people rushed and it was only a few,
""It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you,""
A man grabbed his daughter and carried her down,
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out.

And then others followed, a hundred or more,
But most everybody remained on the floor,
The gun thugs they laughed at their murderous joke,
While the children were smothered on the stairs by the door.

Such a terrible sight I never did see,
We carried our children back up to their tree,
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree,
And the children that died there were seventy-three.

The piano played a slow funeral tune,
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon,
The parents they cried and the miners they moaned,
""See what your greed for money has done.""",1913 Massacre,1976
Woody Guthrie,"Friend of mine bought an automobile
At a dollar down and a dollar a week
Every time he turned the wheel
It was a dollar down and a dollar a week

He went riding down the road
Pinched this girl upon her cheek
Speed cop took him to the judge
He got a dollar down and a dollar a week

Sixty days he laid in jail
At a dollar down and a dollar a week
Another man was a lovin' his gal
At a dollar down and a dollar a week

When he got out he shot the man
And he laid him in the graveyard six feet deep
And when he bought the graveyard spot
It was a dollar down and a dollar a week",A Dollar Down,1976
Woody Guthrie,"It happened an hour ago,
Way down in this tunnel of coal,
Gas caught fire from somebody's lamp.
And the miners are choking in smoke.

Goodbye to Dickie and Honey,
Goodbye to the wife that I love.
Lot of these men not coming home,
Tonight when the work whistle blows.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

It looks like the end for me,
And all of my buddies I see.
We're all writing letters to children we love,
Please carry our word to our wives.

We, found a little place in the air,
Crawled and drug ourselves here.
But the smoke is bad and the fumes coming in,
And the gas is burning my eyes.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

Forgive me for the things I done wrong,
I love you lots more than you know.
When the night whistle blows and I don't come home,
Do all that you can to help mom.

I can hear the moans and groans,
More than a hundred good men.
Just work and fight and try to see,
That this never happens again.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

My eyes are blinded with fumes,
But it sounds like the men are all gone,
'Cept Joe Valentini, Fred Gussler and George,
Trapped down in this hell hole of fire.

Please name our new baby Joe,
So he'll grow up like big Joe.
He'll work and he'll fight and he'll fix up the mines,
So fire can't kill daddy no more.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

Woody Guthrie,"It was early springtime when the strike was on,
They drove us miners out of doors,
Out from the houses that the Company owned,
We moved into tents up at old Ludlow.

I was worried bad about my children,
Soldiers guarding the railroad bridge,
Every once in a while a bullet would fly,
Kick up gravel under my feet.

We were so afraid you would kill our children,
We dug us a cave that was seven foot deep,
Carried our young ones and pregnant women
Down inside the cave to sleep.

That very night your soldiers waited,
Until all us miners were asleep,
You snuck around our little tent town,
Soaked our tents with your kerosene.

You struck a match and in the blaze that started,
You pulled the triggers of your gatling guns,
I made a run for the children but the fire wall stopped me.
Thirteen children died from your guns.

I carried my blanket to a wire fence corner,
Watched the fire till the blaze died down,
I helped some people drag their belongings,
While your bullets killed us all around.

I never will forget the look on the faces
Of the men and women that awful day,
When we stood around to preach their funerals,
And lay the corpses of the dead away.

We told the Colorado Governor to call the President,
Tell him to call off his National Guard,
But the National Guard belonged to the Governor,
So he didn't try so very hard.

Our women from Trinidad they hauled some potatoes,
Up to Walsenburg in a little cart,
They sold their potatoes and brought some guns back,
And they put a gun in every hand.

The state soldiers jumped us in a wire fence corners,
They did not know we had these guns,
And the Red-neck Miners mowed down these troopers,
You should have seen those poor boys run.

We took some cement and walled that cave up,
Where you killed these thirteen children inside,
I said, ""God bless the Mine Workers' Union,""
And then I hung my head and cried.",Ludlow Massacre,1976
Woody Guthrie,"I see they're low'ring a right new coffin,
I see they're letting down a right new coffin,
Way over in that union burying ground.

And the new dirt's a falling on a right new coffin,

Way over in that union burying ground.

Oh, tell me, who's that they're letting down, down?
Tell me, who's that they're letting down, down?
Way over in that union burying ground.

Another union organizer,
Another union organizer,
Way over in that union burying ground.

I'm a gonna sleep in a union coffin,

Every new grave brings a thousand members,

Woody Guthrie,"Tell the miners' kids and wives
There's a blast in the number five
And the families I see standing at the gate
The inspector years ago said number five's a deadly hole
And the men most likely won't come out alive

Waiting at the gate, we are waiting at the gate
Smoke and fire does boil and roll from that dark and deadly hole
While the miners' kids and wives wait at the gate

The inspector told the boss, it was more than a year ago
You're risking these men's lives in number five
That hole's full of fumes and dust, full of high explosive gas
But the boss said we'll just have to take the chance

Waiting at the gate, we are waiting at the gate
Smoke and fire does boil and roll from that dark and deadly hole
While the miners' kids and wives wait at the gate

Well the men in the number five kissed their wives and kids goodbye
Then they walk with their lunch kits up the hill
Everybody told the owner that this deadly day would come
But he said we had to work to pay our bills

Waiting at the gate, we are waiting at the gate
Smoke and fire does roll and boil from that dark and deadly hole
While the miners' kids and wives wait at the gate

Well I tried to get a look of the face I often know
As the men are carried out wrapped up in sheets
I can hear the church bells ringing for the one hundred eleven dead
I can hear the families weeping in the streets

Waiting at the gate, we are waiting at the gate
Smoke and fire does roll and boil from that dark and deadly hole
While the miners' kids and wives wait at the gate

This explosion struck on Wednesday
And I stood by the gate till Saturday
'Til they laid my daddy out with the other men
In the pocket of his shirt I found a little note he wrote
Never go down in a dangerous mine again

Woody Guthrie,"It was late last night when the boss come home
He's askin' about his lady
The only answer he received, ""She's gone with the
Gypsy Davy, gone with the gypsy Davy""

""Go saddle for me my buskin' horse
And a hundred dollars saddle
Point out to me their wagon tracks
And after them I'll travel, after them I'll ride""

Well, I had not rode 'til the midnight moon
When I saw the campfire gleaming
I heard the notes of the big guitar
And the voice of the gypsy singin'

That song of the gypsy Dave
There in the light of the camping fire
I saw her fair face beaming
Her heart in tune with the big guitar

And the voice of the gypsy singing
That song of the gypsy Dave
Have you forsaken your house and home
Have you forsaken your baby

Have you forsaken your husband dear
To go to the gypsy Davy
And sing with the gypsy Dave
That song of the gypsy Dave

Yes, I've forsaken my husband dear
To go with the gypsy Davy
And I've forsaken my mansion high
But not my blue-eyed baby
Not my blue-eyed babe

She smiled to leave her husband dear
And go with the Gypsy Davy
But the tears come a-trickling down her cheeks
To think of the blue-eyed baby
Pretty little blue-eyed babe

Take off, take off your buckskin gloves
Made of Spanish leather
Give to me your lily-white hair
And we'll ride home together
We'll ride home again

No, I won't take off my buckskin gloves
They're made of Spanish leather
I'll go my way from day to day
And sing with the Gypsy Davy

That song of the Gypsy Davy

Woody Guthrie,"Jesus Christ was a man that traveled through the land
Hard working man and brave
He said to the rich, ""Give your goods to the poor""
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave
Yes, Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
Laid poor Jesus in His grave

He went to the preacher, He went to the sheriff
Told them all the same
""Sell all of your jewelry and give it to the poor""
So they laid Jesus Christ in His grave

When Jesus come to town, all the working folks around
Believed what he did say
The bankers and the preachers, they nailed Him on the cross
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

And the working people followed him around
Singing and shouting gay
But the cops and soldiers nailed him in the air
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

Well the people held their breath when they heard about his death
Everybody wondered why
It was the landlord and the soldiers that they hired
To nail Jesus Christ in the sky

This song was made in New York City
Of rich man and preachers, and slaves
If Jesus was to preach like He preached in Galillee
They would lay Jesus Christ in His grave

Yes, Jesus was a man and a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty coward called Judas Iscariot
As laid poor Jesus in His grave",Jesus Christ,1977
Woody Guthrie,"It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Out of your Dust Bowl and westward we rolled
And your deserts were hot and your mountain was cold

I worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
Slept on the ground in the light of your moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind

California and Arizona, I make all your crops
And its North up to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in this Union us migrants have been
We'll work in this fight and we'll fight till we win

Well, it's always we rambled, that river and I
All along your green valley, I will work till I die

'Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free",Pastures of Plenty,1977

From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters

I saw above me that endless skyway
Saw below me the golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
All around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting
This land was made for you and me

I'm mean in the East, mean in the West,
Mean to the people that I like the best.
I go around a-causin' lot of accidents,

Rather see you starved to death

Keep you without no vote,
Keep you without no union.

And the sand fleas, and the tater bugs,
And the grub worms, and the stingarees,
And the tarantulas, and the spiders, childs of the earth,
The ticks and the blow-flies,

Well, I used to be a pretty fair organized feller,
Till I turned a scab and then I turned off yeller,
Fought ev'ry union with teeth and toenail,
And I sprouted a six-inch stinger right in the middle of the tail,
And I growed horns,
And then I cut 'em off, I wanted to fool you.
I hated union every where,
Cause God likes unions
And I hate God!

Well, if I can get the fat to hatin' the lean
That'd tickle me more than anything I've seen,
Then get the colors to fightin' one another,
And friend against friend, and brother, and sister against brother,
That'll be just it.

Everybody's brains a-boilin' in turpentine,
And their teeth fallin' out all up and down the streets,

And I hate everything that's planned,

Did you ever lose your father on a hangknot?

Left him there to rot on that hangknot.

Tell me who makes the laws for that hangknot?
Who makes the laws for that hangknot?
Who says who will go to the calaboose?

I left in my old hometown

The peach trees they are loaded
The limbs are bending down
I pick 'em all day for a dollar, boys

And falls upon the ground
There's a hungry mouth for every peach

I wish that I could settle down
But I cant' save a penny, boys

So long, it's been good to know yuh;
So long, it's been good to know yuh;
So long, it's been good to know yuh.
This dusty old dust is a-gettin' my home,
And I got to be driftin' along.

A dust storm hit, an' it hit like thunder;
It dusted us over, an' it covered us under;
Blocked out the traffic an' blocked out the sun,
Straight for home all the people did run,
Singin',

We talked of the end of the world, and then
We'd sing a song an' then sing it again.
We'd sit for an hour an' not say a word,
And then these words would be heard:

Sweethearts sat in the dark and sparked,
They hugged and kissed in that dusty old dark.
They sighed and cried, hugged and kissed,
Instead of marriage, they talked like this:
""Honey,""

Now, the telephone rang, an' it jumped off the wall,
That was the preacher, a-makin' his call.
He said, ""Kind friend, this may the end;
An' you got your last chance of salvation of sin!""

The churches was jammed, and the churches was packed,
An' that dusty old dust storm blowed so black.

He's born in a money family on that Hudson's rocky shore;
Outrun every kid a-growin' up 'round Hyde Park just for fun;
This world was lucky to see him born.

He went away to grade school and wrote back to his folks;
He drew such funny pictures and always pulling a joke;
This world was lucky to see him born.

He went on up towards Harvard, he read his books of law;
He loved his trees and horses, loved everything he saw;
This world was lucky to see him born.

He got struck down by fever and it settled in his leg;
He loved the folks that wished him well as everybody did;
This world was lucky to see him born.

He took his office on a crippled leg, he said to one and all:
""You money changin' racket boys have sure 'nuff got to fall;""
This world was lucky to see him born,

In senate walls and congress halls he used his gift of tongue
To get you thieves and liars told and put you on the run;
This world was lucky to see him born,

I voted for him for lots o' jobs, I'd vote his name again;
He tried to find an honest job for every idle man;
This world was lucky to see him born,

He helped to build my union hall, he learned me how to talk;
I could see he was a cripple but he learned my soul to walk;
This world was lucky to see him born.

You Nazis and you fascists tried to boss this world by hate;
He fought my war the union way and the hate gang all got beat;
This world was lucky to see him born.

I sent him 'cross that ocean to Yalta and to Tehran;
He didn't like Churchill very much and told him man to man;
This world was lucky to see him born.

He said he didn't like DeGaulle, nor no Chiang Kai Shek;
Shook hands with Joseph Stalin, says: ""There's a man I like!""
This world was lucky to see him born.

I was torpedoed on my merchant ship the day he took command;
He was hated by my captain, but loved by all ships hands;
This world was lucky to see him born.

I was a Gl in my army camp that day he passed away,
And over my shoulder talkin' I could hear some soldier say:
""This world was lucky to see him born.""

I guess this world was lucky just to see him born;
I know this world was lucky just to see him born;
This world was lucky to see him born.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,

She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard

Woody Guthrie,"Back in Nineteen Twenty-Seven,
I had a little farm and I called that heaven.
Well, the prices up and the rain come down,
And I hauled my crops all into town --
I got the money, bought clothes and groceries,
Fed the kids, and raised a family.

Rain quit and the wind got high,
And the black ol' dust storm filled the sky.
And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine,
And I poured it full of this gas-I-line --
And I started, rockin' an' a-rollin',
Over the mountains, out towards the old Peach Bowl.

Way up yonder on a mountain road,
I had a hot motor and a heavy load,
I's a-goin' pretty fast, there wasn't even stoppin',
A-bouncin' up and down, like popcorn poppin' --
Had a breakdown, sort of a nervous bustdown of some kind,
There was a feller there, a mechanic feller,
Said it was en-gine trouble.

Way up yonder on a mountain curve,
It's way up yonder in the piney wood,
An' I give that rollin' Ford a shove,
An' I's a-gonna coast as far as I could --
Commence coastin', pickin' up speed,
Was a hairpin turn, I didn't make it.

Man alive, I'm a-tellin' you,
The fiddles and the guitars really flew.
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
An' it flew halfway around the world --
Scattered wives and children's
All over the side of that mountain.

We got out to the West Coast broke,
So dad-gum hungry I thought I'd croak,
An' I bummed up a spud or two,
An' my wife fixed up a tater stew --
We poured the kids full of it,
Mighty thin stew, though,
You could read a magazine right through it.
Always have figured
That if it'd been just a little bit thinner,
Some of these here politicians
Coulda seen through it.

Why do your death bombs fall from my skies?
Why do you burn my farm and my town down?

What makes your boats haul death to my people?
Nitro blockbusters, big cannons and guns?
Why doesn't your ship bring food and some clothing?

Why can't my two hands get a good pay job?
I can still plow, plant, I can still sow!
Why did your lawbook chase me off my good land?
I'd sure like to know, friend, I've just got to know!

What good work did you do, sir, I'd like to ask you,
To give you my money right out of my hands?
I built your big house here to hide from my people,
Why you crave to hide so, I'd love to know!

You keep me in jail and you lock me in prison,
Your hospital's jammed and your crazyhouse full,
What made your cop kill my trade union worker?
You'll hafta talk plain 'cause I sure have to know!

Why can't I get work and cash my big paycheck?
Why can't I buy things in your place and your store?
Why do you close my plant down and starve all my buddies?

Some gardens and some towers, I guess you know them well

She heads up the Canadian Rockies where the rippling waters glide
Comes a-rumbling down the canyon to meet that salty tide
Of the wide Pacific Ocean where the sun sets in the west
And the big Grand Coulee country in the land I love the best

In the misty crystal glitter of that wild and windward spray
Men have fought the pounding waters and met a watery grave
Well, she tore their boats to splinters but she gave men dreams to dream
Of the day the Coulee Dam would cross that wild and wasted stream

Uncle Sam took up the challenge in the year of Thirty three
For the farmer and the factory and all of you and me
He said, ""Roll along Columbia. You can ramble to the sea
But river while you're ramblin' you can do some work for me""

Now in Washington and Oregon you hear the factories hum
Making chrome and making manganese and light aluminum
And there roars a mighty furnace now to fight for Uncle Sam
Spawned upon the King Columbia by the big Grand Coulee Dam

Woody Guthrie,"Mister Charlie Lindbergh, he flew to old Berlin
Got 'im a big Iron Cross, and he flew right back again
To Washington, Washington

Misses Charlie Lindbergh, she come dressed in red
Said: ""I'd like to sleep in that pretty White House bed
In Washington, Washington""

Lindy said to Annie: ""We'll get there by and by
But we'll have to split the bed up with Wheeler, Clark, and Nye
In Washington, Washington""

Hitler wrote to Lindy, said ""Do your very worst""
Lindy started an outfit that he called America First
In Washington, Washington

All around the country, Lindbergh, he did fly
Gasoline was paid for by Hoover, Clark, and Nye
In Washington, Washington

Lindy said to Hoover: ""We'll do the same as France
Make a deal with Hitler, and then we'll get our chance
In Washington, Washington""

Then they had a meetin', and all the Firsters com
Come on a-walkin', they come on a-runnin'
In Washington, Washington

Yonder comes Father Coughlin, wearin' the silver chain
Cash on his stomach and Hitler on the brain
In Washington, Washington

Mister John L. Lewis would sit and straddle a fence
His daughter signed with Lindbergh, and we ain't seen her since
In Washington, Washington

Hitler said to Lindy: ""Stall 'em all you can
Gonna bomb Pearl Harbor with the help of old Japan""
In Washington, Washington

Then on a December mornin', the bombs come from Japan
Wake Island and Pearl Harbor, kill fifteen hundred men
In Washington, Washington

Now Lindy tried to join the army, but they wouldn't let 'im in
'Fraid he'd sell to Hitler a few more million men
In Washington, Washington

So I'm a gonna tell you people: If Hitler's gonna be beat
The common workin' people has got to take the seat
In Washington, Washington

And I'm gonna tell you workers, 'fore you cash in your checks
They say ""America First,"" but they mean ""America Next!""

Where romances blooms and fades
There was Philadelphia lawyer
Makin' love with a Hollywood maid

""Come, love, and we'll go ramblin'
Down where the lights are so bright
I'll win you a divorce from your husband
And we can get married tonight""

Wild Bill was a gun-totin' cowhand
Ten notches were carved in his gun
And all the boys around Reno
Left Bill's Hollywood sweetheart alone

One night when Bill was returning
From ridin' the range in the cold
He thought of his Hollywood sweetheart
Her love was as lasting as gold

As he drew near to her window
Two shadows he saw on the shade
'Twas the great Philadelphia lawyer
Makin' love to Bill's Hollywood maid

The night was as still as the desert
The moon hangin' high overhead
Bill listened awhile through the window
He could hear ev'ry word that they said

""Your hands are so pretty and lovely
Your form's so rare and divine
Come go back with me to Philadelphia
And leave this wild cowboy behind""

Among her beautiful pines
There's one less Philadelphia lawyer

Woody Guthrie,"In the world's mighty gallery of pictures
There's scenes that're painted from life
Scenes of youth and of beauty
Scenes of hardship and strife

Scenes of wealth and of plenty
Old age and a blushing young bride
Hang on the wall but the saddest of all
Is the pictures from life's other side

A picture from life's other side
Somebody has fell by the way
And a life has gone out with the tide
That might have been happy some day

There's a poor old mother at home
She's watching and waiting alone
Longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just a picture from life's other side

Now the first scene is one of two brothers
Who had lost all of his money at play
One lived in luxury and riches
And the other went beg for his bread

One night they met on the highway
""Your money or lives, sir,"" they cried
Then with his knife took his own brother life
That's a picture from life's other side

Now the next scene is that by the river
A heartbroken mother and babe
In the harbor lights shine and they shiver
Outcast, soon no one will save

Once she was once a true woman
Somebody's darling and pride
God help her she leaps, there's no one to weep
That's a picture from life's other side

That's a picture from life's other side
Somebody has fell by the way

Woody Guthrie,"Have you heard of a ship called the good Reuben James
Manned by hard fighting men both of honor and fame?
She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave on the bottom of the sea

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

Well, a hundred men went down in that dark watery grave
When that good ship went down only forty-four were saved
That was the last day of October we saved the forty-four
From the cold ocean waters and the cold icy shore

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

It was there in the dark of that uncertain night
That we watched for the you-boats and waited for a fight
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roared
And they laid the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

Now tonight there are lights in our country so bright
In the farms and in the cities they're telling of the fight
And now our mighty battleships will steam the bounding main
And remember the name of that good Reuben James

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names

Woody Guthrie,"I went down to the fishing hole
And I set down with my fishing pole
Somethin' grabb'd my hook and it got my bait
And jerked me out in the middle of the lake
Some jump
I got sunk, baptized on credit

Fishin' down on th' muddy bank
Felt a pull an' give a big yank
I holed out three old rubber boots
A Ford radiator an' a Chevrolet coop
I handed it in
For National Defence

Settin' in a boat with a bucket of beer
Hadn't caught nuthin' but didn't much care
I guess I was pretty well satisfied
Had my little lady right by my side
Takin' it easy, yeah still waitin'
Worm been gone off-a that hook for a couple of hours

You go fishin', tell y' what to do
Go set down by the grassy dew
Take a piece of string, tie it on yo' pole
And throw it way out in th' middle of th' hole
Find you a good shady tree and then just set down
Go to sleep, forget all about it

Jumped in the river and went down deep
There was a hundred pound cat-fish lying there asleep
I jumped on his back and rode him all aroun'
Saddled him up and I came into town
People came runnin', lookin', dogs a-barkin'
Kids a-squallin'

Stagnate water's a stinkin' thing
Slick on top and all turned green
When the water goes bad, the fish all run
Sit all day and not catch a-one
Mud wallopers, jewgars
A few little suckers

I waded out to a sandy bar
And I caught myself a big alligator gar
Brung him home across my back
Tail was dragging a mile and a half
Flippin' and floppin'
Sold him for a quarter
Shot craps, got in jail

Early one mornin', I took me a notion
To go out a-fishin' in the middle of the ocean
Throwed out my line, I caught me a shark
I didn't get him home 'til way past dark
He's man-eater, tough customer
Just wasn't quite tough enough

Last last night I had me a dream
I was out fishin' in a whiskey stream
Baited my hook with apple-jack
Threw out a drink, drug a gallon back
Done pretty good till the creek run dry
I give the fish back to the finance company",Talking Fishing Blues,1997
Woody Guthrie,"While we are on the subject of hard work
I just wanted to say you that, ""I always was a man who likes hard work""
I was born working and I worked my way up by hard work
I ain't ever got no where, but I got there by hard work

Work of the hardest kind I been down and I been out
I been disgusted I been busted and I couldn't be trusted
I worked my way up and I worked my way down
I been drunk and I been sober, I been baptized and got hijacked
I been robbed for cash and I been robbed on a credit

Worked my way in jail and I worked my way outta jail
Woke up a lot of mornin's, didn't know where I was at
The hardest work I ever done was, when I was tryin'
To get myself a worried woman to help ease my worried mind

I'm gonna tell ya just how much work I had to do
To get this woman I was tellin' you about, I shook hands
With ninety seven of her kinfolk and her blood relatives
And I done just the same with eighty six people
Who's just her friends and her neighbors

I kissed seventy three babies and put dry pants
On thirty four of em', well as others done this same thing several times
Well there are a lot of other things just like this
I held one hundred twenty five wild horses
And put saddles and bridles on more than that

Harnessed some of the craziest and wildest teams in that whole country'
I rode fourteen loco broncos to a stand still
And I let forty two hound dogs lick me all over seven times
I's bit by hungry dogs and I was chewed all to pieces
My water moccasins and rattlesnakes on two river bottoms

I chopped and carried three hundred fourteen arm loads
Of stove wood, one hundred nine buckets of coal
Carried a gallon of kerosene eighteen miles over the mountains
Got lost, lost a good pair of shoes in a mud hole
And I chopped and weeded forty eight rows of short cotton

Thirteen acres of bad corn, I cut the sticker weeds
Out of eleven back yards, all on account of 'cause
I wanted to show her that I was a man and I liked to work
I cleaned out nine barn lofts, cranked thirty one cars
All makes and models, pulled three cars out of mud holes
And four or five out of snow drifts

I dug five cisterns of water for some of her friends
Run all kinds of errands, played the fiddle for nine
Church meetin's I Joined eleven separate denominations
I joined up and signed up with seven best trade unions
I could find, I paid my wages, a, dues six months in advance

I waded forty eight miles of swamps and six big rivers
Walked across two ranges of mountains
Crossed three deserts, I got the fever, sun stroke, Malaria, blue
Moonstruck, skeeter bit, poison ivy and the seven year itch
And the blind staggers, I was give up for less, lost and dead

A couple of times struck by lightning, struck by Congress
Struck by friends and kinfolks eell as by three cars on highways
A lot of times in people's hen houses, I been hit and run down
Run over and walked on knocked around, I'm just sittin' here
Now tryin' to study up what else I can do to show that women
That I still ain't afraid of hard work",Talking Hard Work,1997
Woody Guthrie,"This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me

And I went walking that ribbon of highway
And saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me the golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around meT, a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me
A sign was painted said: Private Property
But on the back side it didn't say nothing
This land was made for you and me

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting
This land was made for you and me

From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters

Woody Guthrie,"I'll sing you a true song of Billy the Kid,
I'll sing of the desperate deeds that he did,
Way out in New Mexico, long long ago
When a man's only chance was his own 44.
When Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In the old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out in the West with a gun in his hand
At the age of twelve years he first killed his man.
Fair Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
A song about Billy, the boy bandit king
How ere his young manhood had reached its sad end
He'd a notch on his pistol for twenty-one men.
'Twas on the same night when poor Billy died
He said to his friends: ""I am not satisfied.
There are twenty-one men I have put bullets through
And sheriff Pat Garrett must make twenty-two.""
Now this is how Billy the Kid met his fate,
The bright moon was shining, the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett, who once was his friend
The young outlaw's life had now come to its end.
There's many a man with a face fine and fair
Who starts out in life with a chance to be square,
But just like poor Billy he wanders astray
And loses his life in the very same way.",Billy the Kid,1999

Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish
For they say you are gong away

O how lonely and how dreary it will be
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking
And the pain you are causing to me

Woody Guthrie,"My name is King Cyrus, my order I give,
You Jews can go back to your home
To build your holy temple again
In the land of Palestine.

We've sung and danced o'er the hot rocky roads
Back to Eretz Yisroel's land
We worked with plow and rake and hoe
And we blessed the works of our hands

My name is Ezra the Teacher man
I brought my scroll book along
I brought my flock to Yisroel
From that land called Babylon

I'll read you my Talmud Torah book
And the prophet's dreams to you
And you'll be fertile and multiply
If you keep your Torah true

My name is Alexander the Great
More than half of this wide world is mine
Come stand around, my servants all
I'm wrapped on my bed here to die

As the King of Syria and Palestine
Antiochus the Fourth, you'll stand
To kill the Jews if they refuse
To worship our idols and gods

My name is Hannah, my first born son
Now stands before this king
Guilty of keeping the Sabbath laws
By the soldiers I see him slain

It's one by one my seven sons
In front of my eyes cut down
For keeping to the Torah laws
I pay with my warm blood now

My name is Mattathias, I've got five sons
In Modin City we dwell
They tried to make me bow down to their gods
Two of the King's flunkeys I killed

A hundred or more who'll fight to be Jews
Did come to these hills with me
On my death bed your leader I'll name
'Tis Judah, the Macabee

My name is Judah, the Macabee
By the name of the hammer I'm called
We'll pray to God before every fight
Till all of our enemies fall

Appolonius, the Governor, this day I killed
And his army we did bust
Some few of his soldiers run away in the wind
But most we've dropped dead in the dust

Syron is my name, from Syria came
To destroy that fool Macabee
My army was great, his army was small
But he somehow did win over me

To deliver the many to the hands of his few
For God this is no trick at all
In a few short hours my army did break
And we flooded this valley with blood

My name is Lysias, I dreamed up a plan
To burn the Jews tents as they slept
When I got there, their tents were all bare
And the Macabee's army had left

He stormed my own camp as my soldiers did sleep
And he killed several thousand in fear
My elephants, my horsemen, my footsoldiers, all
Judah hammered them down from the rear

My name is Jerusalem where Judah came back
To build up my Temple once more
To cut down the weeds and thorny brush
That grows 'round my windows and doors

Whole stones, whole stones, we'll build and pray
To God as a wholehearted Jew
God's love the hateful many did place
In the hands of a God loving few

We found in our temple a little oil jug
Just enough for the lamps for one night
That one little jug burned Eight whole days
And it kept our new temple in light

Eight candles we'll burn and a Ninth one too
Every New Year that comes and goes
We'll think of the many in the hands of the few
And thank God we are seeds of the Jews

My Dad builds the planes and they fly through the sky
And that's what keeps your daddy up there so high

That's what keeps your daddy up there so high
That's what keeps your daddy up there so high
My Dad builds the planes and they fly through the sky
And that's what keeps your daddy up there so high

Then a freckle-faced kid pinched his toe in the sand
He says, My Daddy works at that place where they land
You tell your mama, don't be afraid
My Dad'll bring your daddy back home again

My Dad'll bring your daddy back home again
My Dad'll bring your daddy back home again
Don't be afraid when it gets dark and rains
My Dad'll bring your daddy back home again

Come the wife and kids and me.

For a dust bowl refugee.

Hard, it's always been that way,
Here today and on our way
Down that mountain, 'cross the desert,

We are only here today,
Then we travel with the seasons,
We're the dust bowl refugees.

From the south land and the drought land,
Come the wife and kids and me,
And this old world is a hard world
For a dust bowl refugee.

Yes, we ramble and we roam
And the highway that's our home,
It's a never-ending highway
For a dust bowl refugee.

Yes, we wander and we work
In your crops and in your fruit,

Be a dust bowl refugee?

",Dust Pneumonia Blues,2000
Woody Guthrie,"On the 14th day of April of 1935,
There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky.
You could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black,
And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track.
From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,
Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,
It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,
We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom.

The radio reported, we listened with alarm,
The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm;
From Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico,
They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw.

From old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell,
And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill.
From Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong,
They thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long.

Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks,
And the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks.
And the family it was crowded into their little room,
They thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom.

The storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night,
When we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight.
We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown
Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown.

It covered up our fences, it covered up our barns,
It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm.
We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in,
We rattled down that highway to never come back again.

Just a wandrin' worker, I go from town to town.
And the police make it hard wherever I may go
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road,
A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod;
Rich man took my home and drove me from my door
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

Was a-farmin' on the shares, and always I was poor;
My crops I lay into the banker's store.
My wife took down and died upon the cabin floor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

I mined in your mines and I gathered in your corn
I been working, mister, since the day I was born
Now I worry all the time like I never did before
'Cause I ain't got no home in this world anymore

Now as I look around, it's mighty plain to see
This world is such a great and a funny place to be;
Oh, the gamblin' man is rich an' the workin' man is poor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

Sleepin' just as still as a mouse,
Man come along an' he chased us out in the rain.
Was that a vigilante man?

Stormy days we passed the time away,
Sleepin' in some good warm place.
Man come along an' we give him a little race.

Preacher Casey was just a workin' man,
And he said, ""Unite all you working men.""
Killed him in the river some strange man.

Why does a vigilante man
Carry that sawed-off shot-gun in his hand?
Would he shoot his brother and sister down?

And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle.

From a chain gang down in Louisiana

About sixteen bloodhound, took in after him

And everybody else in the county
Chasin' him all across the swamp

Lost John outrun the bloodhounds there
All night long, it was long towards mornin'
He looked up to the tree there
And seen the lights from a house

He didn't know whether the people inside
Was friends or were enemies
So he wanted to go up to the house
So, and asked if he could stay there
To get away from the bloodhounds

He was afraid if he did go up there
That the people might set their dogs
Barking at him or shoot him down
With a Winchester riffle

There he got his parole.
After four long years on a man killing charge,
Tom Joad come a-walkin' down the road, poor boy,
Tom Joad come a-walkin' down the road.

Tom Joad, he met a truck driving man;
There he caught him a ride.
He said, ""I just got loose from McAlester Pen
On a charge called homicide,
A charge called homicide.""

That truck rolled away in a cloud of dust;
Tommy turned his face toward home.
He met Preacher Casey, and they had a little drink,
But they found that his family they was gone,
He found that his family they was gone.

He found his mother's old fashion shoe,
Found his daddy's hat.
And he found little Muley and Muley said,
""They've been tractored out by the cats,
They've been tractored out by the cats.""

Tom Joad walked down to the neighbor's farm,
Found his family.
They took Preacher Casey and loaded in a car,
And his mother said, ""We've got to get away.""
His mother said, ""We've got to get away.""

Now, the twelve of the Joads made a mighty heavy load;
But Grandpa Joad did cry.
He picked up a handful of land in his hand,
Said: ""I'm stayin' with the farm till I die.
Yes, I'm stayin' with the farm till I die.""

They fed him short ribs and coffee and soothing syrup;
And Grandpa Joad did die.
They buried Grandpa Joad by the side of the road,
Grandma on the California side,
They buried Grandma on the California side.

They stood on a mountain and they looked to the west,
And it looked like the promised land.
That bright green valley with a river running through,
There was work for every single hand, they thought,
There was work for every single hand.

The Joads rolled away to the jungle camp,
There they cooked a stew.
And the hungry little kids of the jungle camp
Said: ""We'd like to have some, too.""
Said: ""We'd like to have some, too.""

Now a deputy sheriff fired loose at a man,
Shot a woman in the back.
Before he could take his aim again,
Preacher Casey dropped him in his track, poor boy,
Preacher Casey dropped him in his track.

They handcuffed Casey and they took him in jail;
And then he got away.
And he met Tom Joad on the old river bridge,
And these few words he did say, poor boy,
These few words he did say.

""I preached for the Lord a mighty long time,
Preached about the rich and the poor.
Us workin' folkses, all get together,
'Cause we ain't got a chance anymore.
We ain't got a chance anymore.""

Now, the deputies come, and Tom and Casey run
To the bridge where the water run down.
But the vigilante thugs hit Casey with a club,
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground, poor Casey,
They laid Preacher Casey on the ground.

Tom Joad, he grabbed that deputy's club,
Hit him over the head.
Tom Joad took flight in the dark rainy night,
And a deputy and a preacher lying dead, two men,
A deputy and a preacher lying dead.

Tom run back where his mother was asleep;
He woke her up out of bed.
An' he kissed goodbye to the mother that he loved,
Said what Preacher Casey said, Tom Joad,
He said what Preacher Casey said.

""Ever'body might be just one big soul,
Well it looks that a-way to me.
Everywhere that you look, in the day or night,
That's where I'm a-gonna be, Ma,
That's where I'm a-gonna be.

Wherever little children are hungry and cry,
Wherever people ain't free.
Wherever men are fightin' for their rights,
That's where I'm a-gonna be, Ma.

I saw above me that endless skyway
And saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me

I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me , a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me

In the wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting

I had a little farm and I called that heaven.
Well, the prices up and the rain come down,
And I hauled my crops all into town --
I got the money, bought clothes and groceries,
Fed the kids, and raised a family.

Rain quit and the wind got high,
And the black ol' dust storm filled the sky.
And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine,
And I poured it full of this gas-I-line --
And I started, rockin' an' a-rollin',
Over the mountains, out towards the old Peach Bowl.

Way up yonder on a mountain road,
I had a hot motor and a heavy load,
I's a-goin' pretty fast, there wasn't even stoppin',
A-bouncin' up and down, like popcorn poppin' --
Had a breakdown, sort of a nervous bustdown of some kind,
There was a feller there, a mechanic feller,
Said it was en-gine trouble.

Way up yonder on a mountain curve,
It's way up yonder in the piney wood,
An' I give that rollin' Ford a shove,
An' I's a-gonna coast as far as I could --
Commence coastin', pickin' up speed,
Was a hairpin turn, I didn't make it.

Man alive, I'm a-tellin' you,
The fiddles and the guitars really flew.
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
An' it flew halfway around the world --
Scattered wives and children's
All over the side of that mountain.

We got out to the West Coast broke,
So dad-gum hungry I thought I'd croak,
An' I bummed up a spud or two,
An' my wife fixed up a tater stew --
We poured the kids full of it,
Mighty thin stew, though,
You could read a magazine right through it.
Always have figured
That if it'd been just a little bit thinner,
Some of these here politicians
Coulda seen through it.

California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi.

You want to buy you a home or a farm, that can't deal nobody harm,
Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea.
Don't swap your old cow for a car,
You better stay right where you are,
Better take this little tip from me.
Cause I look through the want ads every day
But the headlines on the papers always say

Woody Guthrie,"Come all of you cowboys all over this land,
I'll teach you the law of the Ranger's Command:
To hold a six shooter, and never to run
As long as there's bullets in both of your guns.

I met a fair maiden whose name I don't know;
I asked her to the roundup with me would she go;
She said she'd go with me to the cold roundup,
And drink that hard liquor from the cold, bitter cup.

We started for the canyon in the fall of the year
Expecting to get there with a herd of fat steer;
And the rustlers broke on us in the dead hours of night;
She 'rose from her warm bed, a battle to fight.

She 'rose from her warm bed with a gun in each hand,
Said: Come all of you cowboys and fight for your land,
Come all of you cowboys and don't ever run
As long as there's bullets in both of your guns.",Rangers Command,2005

Just a wandrin' worker, I go from town to town.
And the police make it hard wherever I may go
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road,
A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod;
Rich man took my home and drove me from my door
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

Was a-farmin' on the shares, and always I was poor;
My crops I lay into the banker's store.
My wife took down and died upon the cabin floor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

I mined in your mines and I gathered in your corn
I been working, mister, since the day I was born
Now I worry all the time like I never did before
'Cause I ain't got no home in this world anymore

Now as I look around, it's mighty plain to see
This world is such a great and a funny place to be;
Oh, the gamblin' man is rich an' the workin' man is poor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones

Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go

Woody Guthrie,"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,2006

A story I will tell
Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well

It was in the town of Shawnee
It was Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife she overheard

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain and the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed he laid that deputy down

There's a many a-starving farmers
The same old story told
How this outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes

Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath his napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill

It was in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There was a whole carload of groceries
With a letter that did say

""Well, you say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief
Here's a Christmas dinner for the families on relief""

Now, as through this world I ramble
I seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
Some with a fountain pen

Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away

Comes a summons, hide behind the door

Comes a mousey, you can chase it with a broom

Woody Herman,"Don't stamp your foot at me
It's impolite
To stamp your foot at me
Is not quite right
At man's ingratitude
A woman winks
But such an attitude just stinks

I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you
I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds
I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you
Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me- me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And ev'rything I've got belongs to you

Don't raise your voice at me
That's very rude
To raise your voice at me
Is rather crude
It's wrong essentially when woman yells
And confidentially, it smells

I'll converse with you on politics at length
I'll protect you with my superhuman strength
If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , ""Boo!''
And everything I've got belongs to you
I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put
Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot
I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too
And everything I've got belongs to you
Off to bed we will creep
Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
Till the birds start to peep
I'll give you plenty of nothing
I'll be yours forever and a day
If the first good breeze does not blow me away
You're enough for one man, that's why I'll be true
And everything I've got belongs to you

You may have some things that I can't use at all
When I look at you, your manly gifts are small
I've a wonderful way of saying adieu
And everything I've got belongs to you
You won't know how good I am until you try
And you'll let my well of loneliness run dry
I've a marvelous way of telling you no
And everything I've got belongs to you
And everything you want belongs to me!
And everything you need belongs to me!

Life has no shape or form
And no design
It isn't life without

He has brains enough for any child of five
Oh, he isn't too rich in vigor and vim
But everything I've got belongs to him
He's a naughty brat that can't be left alone
He has eyes for every skirt except my own
Even under a tree, he grabs for the limb
But everything I've got belongs to him
Something beats in his chest
But it's just a pump at best
I'm for him, he's for him
He gives me plenty of nothing
When I see that funny face, I know

Or was that a nightingale?

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.

But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh

A spider's touch
Such a cold finger beckons you to enter his web of sin
But don't go in

Golden words he will pour in your ear

For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her
It's the kiss of death from Mister

Bright, sparkling diamonds
But, believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world but he'll never love the way

To fancy clubs and restaurants

Woody Herman,"Johnny could only sing one note 
And the note he sang was this: aaaahh 
Poor Johnny One Note 

Sang out with Gusto 
And just overloaded the place
Poor Johnny One Note 
Yelled willy-nilly 
Until he was blue in the face
For holding one note was his ace 
Couldn't hear the brass 
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class 
By himself, by gum
Poor Johnny One Note 

Got in Aida indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note 
Howled like the North Wind 
Brought forth wind that made critics rave
While Verdi turned round in his grave 
Couldn't hear the flute 

Or the big trombone
Everyone was mute 
Johnny stood alone
Cats and dogs stopped yapping 
Lions in the zoo 
Were all jealous of Johnny's big thrill
Thunderclaps stopped clapping 
Traffic ceased its roar 
And they tell us Niag'ra stood still
He stopped the trainwistles 
Boatwhistles 
Steamwhistles 
Copwhistles
All whistles bowed to his skill 
Sing Johnny One Note 
Sing out with gusto 
And just overwhelm all the crowd 
Aaaahh 

So sing, Johnny One Note out loud 
Sing, Johnny One Note 
Sing - Johnny - One Note - Out loud",Johnny One Note,1973

This is a lovely way to spend an evening. can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening, can't think of anyone as lovely as you

But if you never found me I would die
I'd like to break the chains you put around me,
But I know I never will

You stay away and all I do is
Wonder why the hell I wait for you
But when did common sense prevail
For lovers when we know it never will

Impossible to live with you,
But I know, I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

You never treat me like you should, so what's the good of loving as I do?
Although you always laugh at love,
Nothing else would be good enough for you

Impossible to live with you,
But I know, I could never live without you
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you

You make me laugh, you make me cry,
You make me live, you make me die, for you
You make me sing, you make me sad,
You make me glad, you make me mad, for you

I love you, hate you, love you, hate you
But I'll want you till the world stops turning
For whatever you do
I never, never, never want to be in love with anyone but you...
I love you, hate you, love you, hate you

Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Starry eyed and dreamy 
And nights are luscious and long 
If you're kinda lonely 
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin' 
The blues are brewin' 

When the wind through the window 
Blows across your pillow 
And tells you sleepin' is wrong 
If love goes a thirsting 
Till you feel like bursting 
Then nothing but the blues are brewin' 
The blues are brewin' 

Suppose you want somebody 
But you ain't got nobody 
You only get a gleam in your eyes 
Till somebody's found you 
And put their lovin' arms around you 
You got the feelin' you want to die 

But when the Lord up above you 
Send's someone to love you 
The blues are something you loose 
You're so busy doing 
The things that you're doing 
That love ain't got no time 
For brewin' the blues

I am in a mood I can't explain,
I drift to an isle of perfume where summer roses eternally bloom,
There is a golden gleam waits my one wonderful dream;
Soon in a garden for two,
Lips cling to mine in the shadowy blue;
Arms filled with sweet delight hold me tight all through the night.
Music take me don't forsake me,
Let me be a ship lost at sea that the winds rock and roll;
Whirling, swirling, twirling, out of control, 
That music drives me crazy,
Ev'rything becomes so hazy;
Drums are booming, cellos zooming,
Cymbals crashing, sabres flashing in a willy nilly sort of way,
I seem to hear it night and day;
Blending in romantic fashion, melody, moonlight and passion,
Riding high on heaven's highway,
Purple stars are guiding my way;
I am like a comet whizzing by,
Just when I get the feeling that the universe
Is reeling, suddenly the song is ending;
And I find that I'm descending like a star 
That's falling from the sky,
Toppling! Twisting! Tumbling!
And down and down and down and down and

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,1997

It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say

Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.

Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.

Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I tell you I mean it

Are you pretending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat

Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe
Comes love, nothing can be done

Don't try hiding 'cause there isn't any use
You'll start sliding when your heart turns on the juice

Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes a heatwave, you can hurry to the shore
Comes a summons, hide behind the door
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes the measles, you can quarantine the room
Comes a mousey, you can chase it with a broom
Comes love, nothing can be done

That's all brother, if you ever been in love
That's all mother, you know what I'm speaking of

Comes the nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you may get another break

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

I drift to an isle of perfume where summer roses eternally bloom,
There is a golden gleam waits my one wonderful dream;
Soon in a garden for two,
Lips cling to mine in the shadowy blue;
Arms filled with sweet delight hold me tight all through the night.
Music take me don't forsake me,
Let me be a ship lost at sea that the winds rock and roll;
Whirling, swirling, twirling, out of control, 
That music drives me crazy,
Ev'rything becomes so hazy;
Drums are booming, cellos zooming,
Cymbals crashing, sabres flashing in a willy nilly sort of way,
I seem to hear it night and day;
Blending in romantic fashion, melody, moonlight and passion,
Riding high on heaven's highway,
Purple stars are guiding my way;
I am like a comet whizzing by,
Just when I get the feeling that the universe
Is reeling, suddenly the song is ending;
And I find that I'm descending like a star 
That's falling from the sky,
Toppling! Twisting! Tumbling!
And down and down and down and down and

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember,
And the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember
When your lips were close to mine,
And I saw the midnight sun.

Woody Herman & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Woody Herman & His Orchestra,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2000

Woody Herman & His Orchestra,"When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.

I drift to an isle of perfume where summer roses eternally bloom,
There is a golden gleam waits my one wonderful dream;
Soon in a garden for two,
Lips cling to mine in the shadowy blue;
Arms filled with sweet delight hold me tight all through the night.
Music take me don't forsake me,
Let me be a ship lost at sea that the winds rock and roll;
Whirling, swirling, twirling, out of control, 
That music drives me crazy,
Ev'rything becomes so hazy;
Drums are booming, cellos zooming,
Cymbals crashing, sabres flashing in a willy nilly sort of way,
I seem to hear it night and day;
Blending in romantic fashion, melody, moonlight and passion,
Riding high on heaven's highway,
Purple stars are guiding my way;
I am like a comet whizzing by,
Just when I get the feeling that the universe
Is reeling, suddenly the song is ending;
And I find that I'm descending like a star 
That's falling from the sky,
Toppling! Twisting! Tumbling!

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2005

I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Woody Shaw,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Woody Shaw,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me
",Imagination,1987
Woody Shaw,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1997

Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello

Woody Wright,"Life is like a mountain railroad
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves, the hills, the tunnels
Never falter, never quail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us
Til we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In thy praise for evermore

You will roll up grades of trial
You will cross the bridge of strife
See that Christ is your conductor
On this lightning train of life
Always mindful of obstruction
Do your duty, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

You will often find obstruction
Look for storms of wind and rain
On a hill, or curve, or trestle
They will almost ditch your train
Put your trust alone in Jesus
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the union depot
Into which your train will guide
There you'll meet the superintendent
God the father, God the son
With the hearty, joyous plaudit

Hating niggas took your life over envy (True!)
A lot of snakes in the grass won’t protect me (Yes!)
When I make it to the gates don’t reject me (Yes!)

In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Word ,"Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

Streetlight, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anythin' to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
And now the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

And fiery billows roll below.",Greenwich,1979

I got no time for the politics
I do not care about names
They don't mean nothin' to me
I didn't get in the game to make friends

Look over, kiss my lil' girl in the head
'Cause everyday is Father's Day
Just like everyday is a birthday, you dig?

The wisest one, I build my house up with bricks
So when the storm came, we just came together in the Lord's name

Bruh, I been grimy
Lord's stackin', you can ask 'bout me
Had the OG's, they respected me
The younger boys not remember me
I was in them streets in the background
Was your ganstar's gangsta, I spit game for free
Nowadays when I recollected and I put it down, gotta pay me
When you say Hollywood, gotta say me
When it comes to these raps and these APs
Cadillacs always been a M.O
Even when the old school broke down
I'll patch 'em up, hit the skrip with 'em
It's no surprise a brother on now
When the streets get a chance to speak up
They want a brother that's gon' eat with 'em
Speak up about the same issues and run it straight
Ain't gon' play with 'em
My contents done changed up, so them twelve year olds need a young sheperd
Looked at Santino right in his eyes
He broked out laughin', he's so reckless
He know I got now, it's no pressure
But when it's his turn, let the grits burn
That Lawrence Fishburne
But it's on record how his old boy spit it like an old veteran
Fernie

That give longitude and latitude some attitudes 

From an environment, freestyle's a requirement 
Upon every album, that my parents had to hide the rent 
If my demise commence unexpectantly, just test my pee 
I bet you see ecstasy or some obscenity inject in me (what else?) 
I flood your airways, place planes in jeopardy 
Flights vanish, panic deputies, expectancy for jet debris 
Let it be, and commence the record to play 
I'm so ahead of my time when I talk there's a seven second delay 
Don't judge a book by its cover when I'm inventin' 
I add your colon to my sentence, and start to pluck off on your appendix 
Dexterity hurled is about to rally the world 
You can't write without using like, what are you some type of valley girl? 
At open mics, I'm tellin' y'all one last time 
Stop askin' for a capellas and then kickin' those wack rhymes, flat line

Taught discipline through paragraphs, walk back streets and narrow paths

Flippin' styles that'd pioneered in the Space Age 
Writin' your first paragraph, I'm already on my eighth page 
For the way you write your rhymes, I could tell you never really made grades 
Going through life miserable, hatin' yourself on payday 
A pleasant plea, Thirstin in parentheses 
I heard a mute man mention me to a blind woman on Vescey Street 
Urged to leave gats alone in memory of Pumpkin and Faster Poem 
Wouldn't want my moms to identify me with half the dome! 
A toast, with high price gangrere 
Battle the best motherfuckers and whoever they bring here 
Long term, sought through rations 
I even put freestyle under special skills when submitting application

We gonna get into the situation for the situation
So I can talk about the situation
You know what I'm sayin Ayatollah on the beat
Let's do it

[Verse 1]
Right now you're privileged
My freestyle and phenomenal writtens
Gives y'all a conflict of interest
Whenever I star the entrance line is so far in distance
You think up ahead is a car collision
If you heard or read separately

That I smashed a celebrity's integrity
Believe it's all fact not allegedly
Murder y'all professionally no hype man next to me
That only puts him in jeopardy of bein an accessory
Can't control my conduct facin you
The radio adds to the ratio of bein confrontational
My concerts pay per view's capable of enragin you
To drive a car or truck with a bomb duck taped to you
Put you arms up got you raisin your hands
Like you confused about the rules before you take your exam
Like your left one's on the bible before takin the stand
Words is the inspiration for the creation of man

[Chorus]
Wait ladies and gentlemen glad y'all waited
Thanks but I need you attention (right now)
We finally headed in the right direction to get it
Ain't no better time than the present

[Verse 2]
Throughout the metropolitan I got a cult followin
Sore throat swallowin from sittin close hollerin
Some listeners rhyme but after they listen to mine
The list to resign looks like a petition was signed
c'mon you gotta believe my lyrics guided your seed
Put 'em in the album cover and it got 'em to read
You not in my league my flow's cold in the hottest degrees
Can seize and cause liquor in a bottle to freeze
A lotta emcee's when they see me on the streets try me
But they only claim to fame is gettin beat by me
But if you recollect and did a background check

Of my past I bet I wouldn't be at sound check
When we collaborate to my madness their's no method
I don't care if we in the same room or we wrote separate
If I'm first or third fourth or I go second
Unless I'm last the DJ won't play the whole record

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In every class their's a clown so when I ask the crowd
Are there rappers around the whackest always has to get loud
With a pack or a pile of cats all night they hassle and hound
My crew so they can try to battle me now
So here's a comparison to narrow it down
My delivery's by air and yours travels by ground
Cause lightenin to flash thunder claps in the clouds
You can't counteract when you're under attack from the sound
Security won't tackle you down your neck I'll throw a lasso around
Hang you two feet from tappin the ground
As of (right now) Words is more anticipated
Than a patient waitin for a transplant match to be found

[Chorus]",Right Now,2004
Wordsworth,"Lost in a dream
Nothing is what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
Time and again
She repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes
Another truth bends,
I must confess
I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again
But I wish I could trust
My body aches of mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
How could this be happening to me
I'm lying when I say, ""Trust me""
I can't believe this is true
Trust hurts
Why does trust equal suffering
Absolutely nothing we trust",Trust (Donae),2004

I know I can't change it
That's why the lonely people just throw it all away

You'll be dancing rhythm,
I'll be jerking to the sound.

That you are coming home.

Of the 7 deadly sins
We're all at the mercy
Of the elements in this world we're in

We're all at the mercy
Of each other's little whims
And we're all at the mercy
Of the little man within

Show no mercy, no more mercy
For this little man within
We're all at the mercy
Of the little man within

Hey mister how did you fit
Into the same shoes as him?
No more mercy, mo more mercy
Show no mercy, no more mercy
For the little man within

He tears up all the countryside
Stops when he should begin
He drowns when he tries to walk on water
But he never learns to swim

He's an animal but he thinks he's God
Gets him mixed up with him
And we're all at the mercy
Of this little man within

He was doing fine in 39
Thank God he did not win
He kept playing on his fiddle
As he watched old Rome cave in

He sold love away from his children's hearts
And told them it was sin
Now we're all at the mercy, we're all at the mercy
Of that little man within

Now he's sitting in the gardens
As the acid rain comes in
He got it covered full of rhino heads
And boots of leopard skin

He got the means, he make the harvest high
But you can count those hungry people die
We're all at the mercy
Of the greedy man within

So if you're feeling lonely, baby
If you're feeling blue
If you listen to your little friend
You know he'll tell you what to do

But if you hear his words and you get confused
Start believing they're all true
Then you have just been fooled again
Who said we won't get fooled again?
By the little man within

He might recognize the great one
He might understand what's good
But he believes that he can never live
The way they say he should

So he puts them in the asylum
And he just throws away the key
He keeps the deep freeze inside you
He keeps the deep freeze inside you
And he puts the light in me

So show no mercy, no more mercy
For the little man within
We're all at the mercy
Of this little man within

Hey sister, how did fit
Into the same shoes as him?
Show no mercy, show no mercy
Show no more mercy, no more mercy

Staring at my breakfast
When I thought I heard it say
Fighting is no good
Success an empty lie.
The treasure hunt is lonely
Until you realize.

We came to take it up
We came to take it up
We came to take it up
We came to raise it up
Came to take it up
Came to move it up.

I promise you miss, I will do my best today
But somebody keeps trying to make me
Trying to make me lose my way
But I believe, oh my darling,
I believe in you
And I hope when you hear this
You'll remember what we were sent to do

We came to take it up
Came to take it up
Came to take it up.
We came to move it up
Came to raise it up
Came to praise it up
I came to take you up
You came to take me up
We came to take it up

Take me up
Take me up

Speeding out of the town
I thought I'd lost my way
Til I saw the green and ebony
Come a-wondering about their pay.
Well, I've got the money
If you've still got the friends.
We can really put this world to right
Or sit and watch the end.

We gonna move it up.

Never stop to wonder why I'm
Way down now
I'm way down now
Some faceless get on the screen
The most honest man I've ever seen
I'm way down now
I'm way down now

Won't you show me something true today
C'mon and show me anything but this

She took us by the hand
Hell was the promised land I'm
Way down now
I'm way down now
I'm lying by the road
Because she cut off all my clothes
I'm way down now
Way down now

Won't you show me something true today
C'mon and show me anything but this

Inside my future I
What I see just makes me cry
I'm way down now
I'm way down now
The clocks will all run backwards
All the sheep will have two heads
And Thursday night and Friday
Will be on Tuesday night instead
And all the times will keep on changing
And the movement will increase
There's something about the living, babe
That sends me off my feet
There's breeding in the sewers
And the rats are on their way
They're clouding up the images of my perfect day
And I know I'm not alone
And I know I'm not alone
And I know I'm not alone

Anything but this
Do you hear me I said

Never stop to wonder why
I'm way down now
I'm way down now
