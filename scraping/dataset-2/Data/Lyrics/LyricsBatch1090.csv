Thad Jones,"You don't love me no more
Get out my life woman
You don't love me no more
Get out my life woman
You don't love me no more

Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around
Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around
Get out my life, heartaches
Nothin' but heartaches by the pound

Get off my ladder, woman
I got to climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman
There is nothin that can make me stop

Get out the way, woman

Thad Jones,"Hurry on down to my house, honey
Ain't nobody home but me

Thad Jones,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2000
Thad Jones,"Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before
Don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore

I wouldn't leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times; I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I never want to work that hard
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from the heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are",Just the Way You Are,2001
Thad Jones,"Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Breaking rocks and serving my time
Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Because they done convicted me of crime

[Chorus]
Hold it steady right there while I hit it
Well, reckon that ought to get it
Been working and working
But I still got so terribly far to go

I committed crime, Lord, I needed
Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man bleeding
When they caught me robbing his store

[Chorus]

I heard the judge say five years
On chain-gang you gonna go
I heard the judge say five years labor
I heard my old man scream ""Lordy, no!""

[Chorus]

Gonna see my sweet honey bee
Gonna break this chain off to run
Gonna lay down somewhere shady
Lord, I sure am hot in the sun

Hold it right there while I hit it
Well reckon that ought to get it
Been workin' and workin'
Been workin' and slavin'
And workin' and workin'
But I still got so terribly far to go",Work Song,2001
Thad Jones,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002
Thad Jones,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks [*],2003
Thad Jones,"Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

I'm going down to the river
I'm going top take me a rocking chair
and if the blues don't leave me, I rock on away from here

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living, I feel like I could die

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is healing slow
I've never had such trouble in my whole life before

I'm gonna lay my head on some lonesome railroad line
and let that 2:19 special ease my troubled mind

Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always
Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday",Trouble in Mind,2012
Thad Jones,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.",After You've Gone,2015
Thad Jones,"I got the blues
I feel so lonely
I'd give the world if I could only make you understand
Yes, it surely would be grand
I'm simply wild about my baby
Ask her won't she please come home
Since she's gone, I stay worried all the time
So, baby, won't you, please, come home?
You know your daddy's all alone
I have tried but all in vain
Never no more to call your name
Since you left, you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you, please, come home to your daddy?
Baby, won't you, please, come home?
Since you left, you know you broke my heart
But that will never make us part
Every hour, every day
You can hear me say
Baby, won't you, please, come home to your daddy?
Baby, won't you, please, come home?",Baby Won't You Please Come Home,2015
Thad Jones,"My man mistreated and he drove me from his door
Lord, he mistreated me and he drove me from his door
But the Good Book says you've got
To reap just what you sow

I got the world in a jug, got the supper?
Right here in my hand
I got the world in a jug, got the supper?
Right here in my hand

And if you want me, sweet papa
You gotta come under my command

Say, I ain't never loved but three men in my life
Lord, I ain't never loved but three men in my life
'twas my father and my brother
And a man that wretched my life

Lord, it may be a week and it may be a month or two
I said, it may be a week and it may be a month or two
All the dirt you're doin' to me
Sho' comin' home to you

Lord, I walked the floor, hang my head and cried
Lord, I walked the floor, hang my head and cried

And I couldn't be satisified",Down Hearted Blues,2015
Thad Jones,"Up in Harlem on a Saturday night
Were the highbrows get together, it's just to tight
We all gather at the Harlem Strut
And what we do is tut tut tut

Ol' Hannah Brown, from way cross town
Keeps drinking her liquor and she brings them down
Just at the break of day
You could hear old Hannah say

I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me daddy, cos I don't care
I feel just like I wanna clown
Give the piano player a drink
Cause he brought me down

He just send me right off to sleep

Thad Jones,"Now I, ain't got nobody, nobody cares for me
And I'm so sad and lonely
Won't somebody take a chance with me

I'll sing sweet love songs, honey, all the time
If you'll come and be my sweet baby, mine

'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town. 

If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway. 

Oh, that St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings, 
She pulls my man around by her apron strings. 
And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair, 
Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere.

Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea,

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye

Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

Escrever uma canção só pra nós dois
Será que ainda tem saudade e chora por mim?
Será que ainda lembra do tempo que já se foi?

Eu nunca imaginei, tão de repente, te encontrar
Fazia oito anos que a gente não se via
Engraçado como eu fui pra outro lugar
E você formado em direito e agronomia

Me lembrei do beijo, do primeiro dia em que te amei
Em frente a casinha onde eu morei
Ali nasceu o amor

Mas éramos tão imaturos
Éramos tão inseguros
Erramos por medo de amar
E sem nenhuma experiência para se entregar

Éramos tão imaturos
Éramos tão inseguros
Quem sabe se a gente tentar
Ainda resta uma esperança pra recomeçar

Abri a caixa empoeirada que eu guardei
Achei as cartas e o álbum que você me deu
Em uma delas, a promessa que não aconteceu
Com vinte e cinco anos, finalmente ia ser meu

Me lembrou do abraço do último dia em que contou
Dos quatro meses de intercâmbio
Que provou que tudo tinha um fim

Mas éramos tão imaturos
Éramos tão inseguros
Erramos por medo de amar
E sem nenhuma experiência para se entregar

My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down

Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something

Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat

Sólo un poco, un poco mas
Déjame quererte mas
Sólo un poco, un poco mas
Déjame amarte
Déjame que te ame

sólo un poco, un poco mas
Déjame que te ame
Déjame quererte mas
Déjame quererte mas
Déjame amarte
Sólo un poco, un poco mas
El exceso de pudor
Why las almas timidas se hicieron

enfria el deseo de amor
Déjate querer, déjame querer
Para dar why sentir amor
Hoy mi mundo esta un poco cambiado,
Siente el aire why escucha tus latidos
Déjate querer, déjame querer

Déjame amarte
Déjame quererte
Déjame amarte

déjame quererte
Déjame quererte mas
Déjame amarte mas
Déjame quererte mas
Déjame amarte mas
Déjame quererte
Déjame amarte
Déjame quererte mas
Déjame amarte mas...

Ven
Suave
 
De claro a oscuro pasamos etapas
A veces sin reaccionar
Dejamos que el tiempo
Resuelva esta desigualdad
Rodeamos el fuego en vez de cruzarlo
Dejándolo madurar
Dejamos as en cenizas todo ideal
Y si a un abismo nos dejamos caer
Quien de los dos da la mano. 
 
No es el momento en que
Debemos dejarnos atrás
No es el momento en que
La razón debe gobernar
Si hemos pensado juntos
Todo poder conquistar
Ahora es tiempo de ver, entender y escuchar
Dejando al corazón andar 
 
No importe creemos poder separar
Las cosas que marchan mal
Igual que de niños pasa con el umbilical
Que ingenua la idea de querer suponer
Que en nada afectar
Lavarnos las manos que
Nos van a crucificar.
Si a la rutina nos dejamos caer
Quien de los dos da la mano. 
 
No es el momento en que
Debemos dejarnos atrás
No es el momento en que
La razón debe gobernar
Si hemos pensado juntos
Todo poder conquistar
Ahora es tiempo de ver, entender y escuchar
Dejando al corazón andar 
 
Si al conformismo nos dejamos caer
Quien de los dos da la mano. 
 
No es el momento en que
Debemos dejarnos atrás
No es el momento en que

Thalía,"Vengo a cantar para ti 
La canción que aprendí
Ala orilla del mar

La llevo en mi corazon
Con el último adiós
Que me diste al partir

Enamorada de ti, 
Es mi faro tu amor, y mi luz tu mirar 
Muero de pena al partir, pues
Yo quisiera vivir, a tu lado nomas 

Me voy, esta noche tibia y sensual
Llena de calor tropical
Muy sola con mi triste pena

Si tu, quieres nuestro amor recordar
Busca por la orilla del mar
Tu nombre que grabé en la arena

Me voy, pues sin ti no puedo vivir
Y ya no es posible sufrir
La angustia de mi soledad

Adiós, a él que entregué el corazon
Al amor que fue mi ilusión

Cuando tus ojos me miran

Tu risa ideando la mía

Si me hablas cantaré 
Lo veo todo en rosa 
Tus susurros son la miel 
Tus penas mi pesar 
Pero al final es todo rosa 
Es mi joya el corazón 
Tú eres el ladrón 
Rondas mi balcón 
No salgas de mi corazón jamás 

Júramelo, júralo por tu amor 
Desde que se declaró 
Mi alma se quebró vivo de ti

Fue como primera vista

Mente sana en cuerpo sano-ooo

Es una maquina de amar a toda hora

Aeróbico, aeróbico,
Es un muchacho natural why me enamora

Ni toma copas de mas,

Al acero de su brazos
Es romance de alto impacto
Lleno de vitalidad.

Es tu amor fuego lento que va
Quemándome por dentro hasta la eternidad
Más dulce que la miel
Más honesto que el pan
Más suave que la piel
Más profundo que el mar
Es tu amor darse entero y después
Jugarse hasta la vida sin miedo a perder
Es más emocionante que un juego de azar
Mi oficio predilecto, mi talla ideal
Es tu amor ir al cielo y volver
Es ver caer el sol en el atardecer
Es darse hasta morir

Es tu amor un perfume sutil
Una tarde sin sol, una lluvia de abril
Es tu amor, entregarnos el alma
Perdonar el error, tu calor en mi almohada
Es tu amor toda razón para vivir
Es la llama que se enciende dentro de mí

Es tu amor fuego lento que va
Quemándome por dentro hasta la eternidad
Más dulce que la miel
Más honesto que el pan
Más suave que la piel
Más profundo que el mar
Es tu amor darse entero y después
Jugarse hasta la vida sin miedo a perder
Es más emocionante que un juego de azar
Mi oficio predilecto, mi talla ideal
Es tu amor ir al cielo y volver
Es ver caer el sol en el atardecer
Es darse hasta morir
Y volver a nacer",Es Tu Amor,1997

Thalía,"Noches sin luna
Voy buscando mi fortuna
Tantas noches sin luna
Tantas puertas por abrir
Tantas frases vacias
Tantas cosas por decir
Tantos anos viviendo
Encerrada en un jardin
Poco a poco muriendo
Sin saber a donde ir
Carcomida de suenos
De illusiones que se van
Sumergida en mis dudas
Fuera de la realidad
Inventando mentiras
Que me ayudan a escapar
Del abismo que lleva
A mi propia obscuridad
Pero sigo buscando
Una forma de escapar
De mis noches sin luna
De este cuento sin final
Descubriendo un camino
Una isla en este mar
Escribiendo el destino
Encontrando mi lugar
Noches sin luna...voy buscando mi fortuna
Noches sin luna...voy saliendo de mis dudas...
Oh, oh, oh, anos viviendo
Encerrada en un jardin
Que hoy floreciendo
Why otra vez puedo vivir
Why yo sigo buscando
Una forma de escapar
De mis noches sin luna
De este encuentro sin final
Descubriendo un camino
Una isla en este mar
Escribiendo el destino
Encontrando mi lugar

Voy saliendo de mis dudas

Sólo a un minuto de salir de ti
Why antes de hacerlo yo te ruego que me escuches
Sólo te pido un minuto, un instante para mí

Yo si te quise, mi amor tú no pudiste entender
Cual fue la forma de darte las cosas,
No era con rosas mi amor, como mi alma
Se da why se goza, no era con versos como se entrega mi alma

Yo sólo amaba, vivía why moría
Pensaba why ardía por ti
Yo sólo buscaba, anhelaba el segundo
El instante de hacerte feliz

Yo sólo amaba, vivía why moría
Pensaba why ardía por ti
Yo sólo buscaba el instante
De hacerte feliz

Estoy a punto de subir al tren, estoy tan lejos de volver a ti
Sólo quería que escucharas bien las cosas
Que compartieras este espacio junto a mí
Why que supieras que aún tengo aquí la duda

Si me quisiste realmente alguna vez
No era con rosas mi amor ni con los versos
Yo si te quise why no supiste entender
No, no pudiste entender, no

Yo sólo amaba, vivía why moría
Pensaba why ardía por ti
Yo sólo buscaba, anhelaba el segundo
El instante de hacerte feliz

Yo sólo amaba, vivía why moría
Pensaba why ardía por ti
Yo sólo anhelaba el instante

Thalía,"Sentada en una buhardilla,
Viendo una calle vaca,
En un  desierto nocturno,
Disfruto mi libertad.
Mas no encuentro con quien compartirla,
Con quien platicar,
El silencio no se interrumpe,
Una luz tenue descubre la soledad. 
 
Recuerdo ese año de ser fiel y lo extraño,
Igual que esos das al calor de tu piel.
Mis sueño son hoy pesadillas,
Noches que lloran y chillan
En un mundo cruel. 
 
Te necesito cerca de mi,
Te necesito cerca de mi.
Te amo, te extraño, te adoro,
La vida no es nada si no estas junto a mi,
Te necesito cerca de mi. 
 
Me levanto y escribo esta historia
Al borde de enloquecer,
Triste veo el infinito
Esperando la luz del ayer.
Se disipa el claro de luna,
Siento mi cuerpo desfallecer.
La rueda de la fortuna
En mi suerte caer. 
 
El sol traza en las nubes
En forma d e rosas el amanecer.
Hoy el cario olvidado se encuentra truncado
Porque va a llover. 
 
Te necesito cerca de mi,
Te necesito cerca de mi.
Te amo, te extraño, te adoro,
La vida no es nada si no estás junto a m,
Te necesito cerca de mi
 
 Te necesito, cerca dentro de mi.",Te Necesito,1998

Amor sin desengaño
Me duele que lo sepas corazón
Querer es admitir que tienes que sufrir

Tal vez te has encontrado
Con un amor sincero
Pero no estés confiado corazón
Tarde o temprano llorarás

Existen tantas cosas
En contra de un cariño
La vida es como un niño
Que juega por capricho
Con nuestro gran dolor

Thalía,"Arrasando oye papi damelo todo
Que sube que baja que no se que pasa
Que la condición humana va acabando con la raza
Cuando triunfas en la vida va creciendo mas la envidia
Vas sintiendo cuando subes que te dan zancadillas
No sabes que los lobos están a tu lado
Pues les va de maravilla, la apariencia mas sencilla
Nunca faltan los gorrones para ir de reventones
Mas cuando los necesitas, no les ves ni los talones
Son tantos los celos que me hacen cosquillas
Que si engordo, que si enflaco, que si no tengo costillas
Hoy tengo respuesta a cualquier encuesta
Pues yo sigo caminando y también sigo arrasando

Arrasando con la vida
Cosechando la alegría
No hay obstáculo que me impida
Disfrutar de un nuevo día
Arrasando con lo bueno
Desechando todo lo malo
No hay oscuridad que cubra
Esta luz que en mi deslumbra

Parece que somos armas mortales
Pues sin miedo mutilamos sentimientos naturales
Destrozamos la alegría, acabamos con la vida
Sabotajes para el alma, tropezones y apatía
Juzgamos a todos los que encontramos
Destrozamos sus creencias y evadimos sus razones
Que si es guapo, pues es gay, que si es rico es del cartel
Que si es joven y es muy bella la cuchilla estuvo en ella
Estamos entrando a un nuevo milenio
Pretendamos concentrarnos en lo que haré nuestro cuerpo
Somos jovenes fuertes y también inteligentes
En el alma ir concentrando lo que el día va arrasando

Arrasando con la vida
Cosechando la alegría
No hay obstáculo que me impida
Disfrutar de un nuevo día
Arrasando con lo bueno
Desechando todo lo malo
No hay oscuridad que cubra
Esta luz que en mi deslumbra

Mirando hacia atrás aprende el legado
De personas que han dejado una huella en el pasado
Einstein, DaVinci, Neruda y la Malinche
Los Aztecas y Toltecas y también los Zapotecas
Napoleon conocido como estratega
A Cleopatra no le importa en el amor la entrega
Gandhi, Lutero y Madre Teresa
Aunque pasen muchos años se hablara de su entereza
Lady Diana princesa de corazones
Y una Eva que ha pecado y nos jala con sus acciones
Luther King, Malcom X, personajes de la fe
Que la historia va dejando pa' que sigan arrasando

Arrasando con la vida
Cosechando la alegría
No hay obstáculo que me impida
Disfrutar de un nuevo día
Arrasando con lo bueno
Desechando todo lo malo
No hay oscuridad que cubra
Esta luz que en mi deslumbra",Arrasando,2000
Thalía,"Aunque te hayas ido sigues conmigo
Siento el respiro de tu amor
Con un triste suspiro
Llega la noche
y me platica de los dos
Eterno fue lo que hubo entre tu y yo
Que nunca un adiós se contempló
Entre el mar y una estrella
Seguirás estando al filo de mis venas
Te pondré algunas velas
Para preguntarle a Dios cuando regresas

Ya no me sabe el día
Menos la dicha
Se me entristece el corazón

y lo que sufro
Es tan inmenso como el sol
Te sigo amando en contra del rencor
Aunque se muera mi alma de dolor",Entre el Mar y una Estrella,2000

Hace que pierda la concentracia³n

Menta y canela , y bajan por el cuellito
Y siguen su caminito
Y llegan al ombliguito
Y asa­ vuelves a empezar
A besar

Thalía,"Si piensas que el mundo pierde su sonrisa
Que es muy posible olvidar la ilusión, oh, no
Sientes que, no tienes porvenir,
Que tu esperanza se perdió
Por alguien que rompió
En pedazos, tu fiel corazón

No hay que llorar, al pensar
Que el amor se marchará
No hay que sufrir, al sentir que nunca regresará

Sufres insomnios donde aparece su sonrisa
Noches en vela sin una caricia
Sabes que, por ti no terminó
Te diste hasta que se cansó
Triunfaste en el amor
Aunque ahora sufres de dolor

No hay que llorar, al pensar
Que el amor se marchará
No hay que sufrir, al sentir que nunca regresará

Si lloras por ese amor
Ese amor que se marchó, déjalo,
Si es que regresa a ti
Para siempre serás feliz
Siempre serás feliz

No hay que llorar, al pensar
Que el amor se marchará
No hay que sufrir, al sentir que nunca regresará

Hombre bien bragado en toda su tierra 
En el desayuno se echaba un tequila 
Para el mediodía abría otra botella 

Ya para la noche, pistola en la mano 
Vaciando cantinas, giraba en tacones 
Luego en una esquina buscaba chamacas 
Sombrero de lado, camisa de fuera 

Agarró a la vieja, la echaba en el anca 
Clavaba la espuela y el caballo arranca 
Y ocurrió esa noche que estando borracho 
Después de quererla, quedó entre sus brazos 

Ay Cuco Peña, ay alma en pena 
Ay Cuco Peña, no era la buena 
Ay Cuco Peña, ay alma en pena 
Ay Cuco Peña, no era la buena

""Qué hacía a su lado"", él se preguntaba 
Era el jóven Huicho, de extrañas maneras 
Vestido de 'ñora, sonriendole ahora 

""¡Me has roto la honra!"", gritó Cuco Peña 
Y desorbitado sacó la pistola 
Dándo de balazos al pobre del Huicho 
Lavó su deshonra el grán Cuco Peña 

Detrás de las rejas el grán Cuco Peña 
Triste y solitario cumple su sentencia 
Pero de su celda ya hizo vivienda 
Llegan sus muchachas, comida y bebida

Buscando su hombría que alguien se llevara

Que besaba tus labios
Con ganas que cayeras
Mas profundo entre mis brazos

A poco no sabias
Que yo te estaba odiando
A poco no sabias
Que yo te queria ver llorando

A poco no sabias
Que cuando me dejaste
Llore tres vidas juntas
Tenia ganas de matarme

Pero hoy corazoncito
Te dejo en un rinconcito
Why asi paso a pasito
Te has quedado solito

why asi corazoncito
Bebiendo en tu rinconcito
Botella tras botella
La revancha es tan bella
(Ay, ay, ay como duele querer tanto)

A poco no sabias
Que cuando regresaste
Ya estaba preparada no ibas a engañarme
A poco no sabias

Que cuando me pegaste
Formaste una venganza
Creció en mi la revancha
A poco no sabias

Que mi alma era tan noble
A poco no sabias que ahora mi filo es doble
Ay madrecita hermosa
Virgencita piadosa
No quiero mas recelo
No puedo detenerlo

Pero hoy corazoncito te dejo en un rinconcito
Why asi paso a pasito
Te has quedado solito
Why asi corazoncito
Bebiendo en tu rinconcito

Thalía,"It's my party
It's my party
It's my party

Slow down, don't move so fast
If you wanna make a lotta moments last
'Cause the moments turn to minutes and the minutes move so fast
Before you even know it you're living in the past

People are always acting too hot or too cold
They don't wanna know ya if you can't be controlled
Try to buy the future but it can't be sold
It's the will of your soul that you can get ya to your goal

So much jealousy, secrecy
Negativity I refuse to see
No mystery, no reality
It's just a fantasy and it's my party

It's my party
Following my intuition
Happiness is my ambition
Life just keeps on getting better
It's my party, come together

Never needed your permission
Having fun is my tradition
I've been dancing into forever
It's my party, come together

Oh, oh
It's my party come together
Oh, oh, oh
It's my party come together

Read between the lies of the black and white
?Cause the sun may shine in the middle of the night
The sky's still blue without clouds in sight
At the end of the tunnel there's always a light

Things aren't always what they seem to be
What feels like defeat may be victory
Don't pass judgment on what you see
What's wrong for you may be right for me

I don't wanna know what you've got to say
Don't need advice gonna do it my way
I'm never looking back on yesterday
Gonna live, love my life each and every day

It's my party
Following my intuition
Happiness is my ambition
Life just keep on getting better
It's my party, come together

Never needed your permission
Having fun is my tradition
I've been dancing into forever
It's my party, come together

Oh, oh
It's my party come together
Oh, oh, oh
It's my party come together

It's my party
It's my, it's my party
It's my, it's my party
It's my, it's my party
It's my party

Que sera, sera, what will be will be
Believe none of what you hear
Only half of what you see
A promise is a promise, not a guarantee
Nothing in this life ever comes for free

Drunk with desire, hearts on fire
When you look into mirror are you looking at a liar?
Evita, Diana, they both inspire
Let the power of example take you higher and higher

Everyone is dancing to a different beat
From the countryside to the city street
I want us all to come together I want us all to meet
'Cause it's my party get up on your feet
Get up on your feet

It's my party
Following my intuition
Happiness is my ambition
Life just keeps on getting better
It's my party, come together

Never needed your permission
Having fun is my tradition
I've been dancing to it forever
It's my party, come together

Estar sin ti es tener heridas en el alma

Miedo de reconocer que muero
Que sin ti la vida se me escapa
Miedo temor a perderte
Miedo de reconocer que muero
Que me he quedado sin nada nada

Si lo hecho ya esta dicho
No me eches al olvido
Que el silencio de tu boca
Me aniquila why me destroza
Que mi cuerpo no resiste no
Que el no verte es un pecado
Que te esfumas why te extingues
Como el agua entre las manos

Estar sin ti es tener heridas en el alma
Why te juro que yo siento

Si damos ese beso
No se tiene que derrumbar

Tell me what you feel
'Cause I'm feeling something real
I feel the same way, you make the don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you, babe

Slow down, love
Don't you see me with my girl, what you thinkin' it was
I know you're used to seein' me in the clubs
Different chicks, sippin' cris, just a million in dubs

But I've changed, only got eyes for her
Believe me, ain't no girl dividin' us
We could maybe elope, have a baby and all
'Cause I don't wanna be a player no more

Baby, no one else can ever want you like I do
I feel the same way, you make the don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

Tell me what you feel

I feel the same way, you make the don say

Who got me so completely

I knew I was in trouble

I started seeing double 
Swept me off my feet

And I ain't that kind of girl

Cause I am someone who's holding my own 
That doesn't make you afraid

And when we touch, a mess 
Cuz you're the hardest thing I've ever known to Rome

los juegos que inventamos a la mar
Comernos los labios hasta sangrar (Ah..)

Tan galán que me hare vibrar
con tu piel tostada siempre tan sensual
why todas esas cosas que piensas hablar
Me pones sexy, sexy...

Baby, nadie más puede amarte más que yo
I'm feelin? love in the deepest fall, give you the keys and all
You even when helped me when the beef was on

Dime si quizás este amor es de verdad
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

(Uh...) Slow down, love
don't you see me with my girl, what you thinkin? it was
I know you're used to seein? me in the clubs
Different chicks, sippin? Cris?, just a million in dubs
But I've changed, only got eyes for her
Believe me, ain't no girl dividin? us
We could maybe elope, have a baby and all
?Cause I don't want to be a player no more

Baby, nadie más puede amarte más que yo
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

Dime si quizás este amor es de verdad
?Cause I'm feeling something real
I feel the same way, you make the Don say
Girl, I want you, girl, I need you

Thalía,"Dicen que si duele el amor es bueno
Que hay un alma para cada quien
Dicen que nunca olvidas el primero
Y que el tercero es el mejor, es para siempre
Aunque estar tan unidos es peor
Que hay que amar en libertad
Y que es mejor dejarte ir para extrañarte
Aunque sufras, que te aguantes

Lo que no comprendo es porque no puedo
Hacerle caso a la razón
Si me alejo un segundo de ti yo muero
Y para pensarte no preciso estar a solas
Por eso no creo en lo que dicen
O sera que muy bien no entiendo
Porque yo no puedo vivir sin ti
Vivir sin ti

No pienso correr el riesgo
No voy a escuchar consejos
Porque yo puedo admitir
Que no puedo lograr vivir sin ti
No quiero perder el tiempo
Ni ir en contra de lo que siento
Porque yo puedo admitir
Que no puedo lograr vivir sin ti
No puedo vivir sin ti

Dicen que somos vidas paralelas
Que cada uno es como es
Que haga mas lugar para mis proyectos
Que si te doy todo me quedo yo sin nada
Pero como? Si di mi palabra
De amarte como a mi misma
De entregarme a ti sin condición
Sin condición

Hablan, hablan, dicen, dicen
Tantas cosas de este gran amor",No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti,2005

Yo se que las palabras se las lleva el viento
Que por las veces que he mentido es muy difiÂ­cil que creas en mi
Quien no se ha equivocado why por error a herido un corazon
Pues que tiren la primera piedra, esta noche me arrodillo por tu amor

Perdon, te falle, why no fue esa mi intencion
Por unas noches de aventura hay un dilema entre tu why yo
Fui infiel, lentamente me consumo en el dolor
Que me parta un rayo si te miento arrepentido en mi interior


No soy aquella niÃ±a a la que ayer robaste un beso
El arcoiris que alumbraba mis maÃ±anas, ha perdido su color
Cuando se pierde la confianza de quien amas, ya no hay nada, no hay razon
Por continuar esa novela si el gion se trata de tracion

Perdon, de que no me vas a convencer
Por tantas noches de amargura, la soledad en mi habitacion Me fuiste infiel, no te hagas el loco, la victima soy yo
Que me parta un rayo si te perdono adolorida en mi interior

Amor que es tan letal como una puñalada
Primero me hiere, después me desangra
Amor esta locura que ha desesperado
Amor es no tenerte y no haberte olvidado

Toda mi vida se apaga, mi mundo se ciega
Amor es pedirte y gritarte que vuelvas

Que comprenderte
Que consolarte

Pero ya es tiempo para olvidarte
Se que es difícil arrancar todo de nuevo
Que tus heridas te han marcado para siempre
Pero no pienses que sufrir no te ha servido

Que no pueda devolver
Todo lo que yo le doy
Todo lo que le confié

Algún pecado del pasado
Es un castigo no merecido

Y recibir tan solo desilusiones

No es un consuelo

I can't control myself 
You chip away the stone 
And I become a puppet on a string

Don't lose time because this love is completely automatic

A ritual of love our time to be alone

Lifts our hearts up to the heavens

So powerful it leaves us defenseless

Deep inside me 
Down in the center of my soul

Inside a world only for two 

I'm 
Feeling so confused 
I shake with every move 
You hypnotize me I lose all my fears 
I fall down on my knees 
And you completely take control 

It's 
A battle in my mind 
The biggest of my life 
You occupy the empty space inside 
You keep my heart alive 
I need your love to keep on breathing

To understand you, and to console you
I know your life, it's never been that simple
But now's the time to close the circle
To start over again is something scary
I know those bruises in your heart are there forever
But now the time to start again stronger then ever
And show the world in your own way that your never going to go through this again

You know he never loved you
You know he never wanted you
He stabbed you in the back
And he broke your heart in half
But that will make you stronger
No suffering no longer
You'll learn from your mistakes
And there ain't no coming back
Now go enjoy your life and
Your going to laugh so hard
You are never going to cry once again for a guy
You know he never loved you
You know he never wanted you
But at least you learned somehow

But if now you can not stop thinking of his love
And his kisses and his caresses
If in the night, cant sleep because you miss him
Just remember the pain you've been through

To start over again is something scary

Fuiste aventura como muchas más
Amor a oscuras sin felicidad

Tal vez te quise lo mismo que tú
Cuando te fuiste volví a ver la luz otra vez

Otra vez vivo en paz, vivo en paz
No estás conmigo, no estoy contigo
Por eso ahora mismo vivo muy en paz

Mira mis manos abrazadas al vacío inmenso
Del silencio

Sin tu alegría es como un día siempre anocheciendo
Why a cada estrella voy pidiéndole el mismo deseo
Luz de la luna ven why alúmbrame hasta su regreso
Hasta su regreso

Ven a calmar mi dolor
Oye esta cumbia por Dios

Thalía,"Sé que me enamoré
Yo caí perdida sin conocer
Que al salir el sol
Se te va el amor

Duele reconocer
Duele equivocarse y duele saber
Que sin ti es mejor
Aunque al principio no

Me perdí
Apenas te vi
Siempre me hiciste
como quisiste

Porque siempre estuve equivocada
Y no lo quise ver
Porque yo por ti la vida daba
Porque todo lo que empieza acaba

Porque nunca tuve más razones para estar sin él
Porque cuesta tomar decisiones
Porque se que va a doler
Y hoy pude entender
Que a esta mujer
Siempre la hiciste inmensamente triste

Hoy que no puedo más
Sigo decidida a dejarte atrás
Por tu desamor
Lastimada estoy

Me perdí
Apenas te vi
Siempre me hiciste como quisiste

Porque siempre estuve equivocada
Y no lo quise ver
Porque yo por ti la vida daba
Porque todo lo que empieza acaba

Porque nunca tuve más razones
para estar sin él
Porque cuesta tomar decisiones
Porque se va a doler

Si, así me sentía
No sé por qué seguía
Apostándole mi vida a él

Porque siempre estuve equivocada
Y no lo quise ver
Porque yo por ti la vida daba
Porque todo lo que empieza acaba

Porque nunca tuve más razones
para estar sin el
Porque cuesta tomar decisiones
Porque se que va doler

Que a esta mujer
Siempre la hiciste inmensamente triste",Equivocada [Version],2012

Bésame la luna y tapa el sol con el pulgar
Bésame el espacio entre mi cuerpo y tu silueta

Bésame el susurro que me hiciste en el oído
Besa el recorrido de mis manos a tu altar 
Con agua bendita de tu fuente bésame toda la frente
Que me bautiza y me bendice, esa manera de besar

Besa mis campos y mis flores, con tus gotitas de colores
Besa la lluvia que resbala la ventana
Besa mi vida y mis cenizas, me dirás que voy deprisa 
Bésame y deja con un grito, que lo logre

Que no valió la pena intentarlo

Pero te has llevado lo mejor de mi vida
Desde que te fuiste, no se quien soy

La casa esta muy fría
Un mal presentimiento
Me dobla las rodillas

Te busco en el espacio
De mi angustiada prisa
Y solo encuentro rasgos
De tu indudable huida

A donde vas, por que te vas
Por que dejaste un gesto
De ti por cada esquina

Si te llevaste tanto
En solamente un día
No te costaba nada
Cargar, con tus manías

Se te olvido el aroma
Y el eco de tu risa
Se te olvido llevarme
Pedazo de mi vida

Hablando con tu foto
Y la melancolía
Después de largas horas
Por fin se asoma el día

Pero mi fe se pierde
Buscando mi agonía
Una señal más clara
Para entender la vida

A donde vas, por que te vas
Dejaste mil fantasmas
Detrás de las cortinas

Si te llevaste tanto
En solamente un día
No te costaba nada

Por las cosas lindas que una vez dijiste
Y gracias por abrazarme cuando tenia temor

También de agradezco de alguna manera
Que me hayas mentido cada vez que quisieras
Que hubieras fingido al hacerme el amor

A mi me enseñaron que hay que agradecer
Lo bueno, lo malo y lo que pudo ser
Por eso confieso hoy que te vuelvo a ver

Lo más más bonito de ti
Fue cuando te fuiste
Todo lo malo que me hiciste
Saco lo mejor de mi

Lo más bonito de ti
Fue que me dejaste
Ya conocí por eso a alguien
Que ahora me hace muy feliz
Gracias por dejarme ir

De pronto el destino no es lo que uno espera
Te vas tropezando con algunas piedras
Pero es la manera de irse acercando al mar

A mi me enseñaron que hay que agradecer
Lo bueno, lo malo y lo que pudo ser
Por eso confieso hoy que te vuelvo a ver

Lo más más bonito de ti
Fue cuando te fuiste
Todo lo malo que me hiciste
Saco lo mejor de mi

Lo más bonito de ti
Fue que me dejaste
Ya conocí por eso a alguien
Que ahora me hace muy feliz

Gracias por todo
Por todo lo que no sucedió
Lo que nunca paso
Te agradezco en el alma tu adiós

Lo más más bonito de ti
Fue cuando te fuiste
Todo lo malo que me hiciste
Saco lo mejor de mi

Lo más bonito de ti
Fue que me dejaste
Ya conocí por eso a alguien
Que ahora me hace muy feliz
Gracias por dejarme ir

Gracias por dejarme ir",Lo Más Bonito De Ti,2014
Thalía,"Amo que me digas que me amas
Que me beses con tu boca sonrojándome hasta el alma
Asomarme a tu ventana y despeinarme la costumbre
Ver tu amanecer como ilumina mi penumbra

Amo que me robes la mirada
El café por la mañana
Y despertar entre tus ramas
Que me mires de reojo si cometo una imprudencia
Que mis gestos y mis labios sean de toda tu incumbencia

Doy mi alma, doy mi cuerpo, doy mis huesos
Te entrego todo, hasta las cosas que no tengo
Te doy mis ojos para verme en tu mirada
Te doy mi almohada, la de plumas, la que amas

Por lo que reste de vida, yo me la paso contigo
Comiendo de tu boca el tiempo que me queda
Luchando contra el mundo y contra la marea

Por lo que reste de vida, yo me la paso contigo
Comiendo de tu boca el tiempo que me queda
Luchando contra el mundo y contra la marea

Por lo que reste de vida

Juro que amo todas tus carencias
Aunque prueben mi paciencia
Amo todo si es contigo
Amo eso que sentí cuando te vi
Entre todo lo que amo no amo nada mas que a ti

Doy mi alma, doy mi cuerpo, doy mis huesos
Entrego todo hasta las cosas que no tengo
Te doy mis ojos para verme en tu mirada

Thalía,"Que haces ahí?
Pensé que había quedado claro
Yo no soy para ti, tú te ibas a ir
Vete de aquí, no entiendo que estás buscando
De que me estás hablando, si hace poco decías
Que ya no sentías nada por mí

Olvídalo, no me importa tu explicación
Y por favor no menciones la palabra amor
Eso nunca sucedió

Porque solo parecía amor, solo se veía, sabía y se sentía
Como amor
Podía sentirse en el aire eso que al final me confundió
Porque solo parecía amor, no insistas no pienso escuchar
Ya no me hables no, no digas más tonterías
No tiene caso no, porque solo parecía amor

Dime que si, que si vas a cumplir el trato
No volverás a insistir, vas a dejarme vivir

Olvídalo no me importa tu explicación
Y por favor no menciones la palabra amor

Porque solo parecía amor, no insistas no pienso escuchar
Ya no hables no

Fue una copia barata tan parecida
Que te creyó mi alma, mi mente, mi gente
Todo el mundo se lo creyó
Porque solo parecía amor, solo se veía
Sabía y se sentía como amor
Actuaste tan bien que mi aliento, mi piel y mi cuerpo te creyó

Ya no hables no, no digas más tonterías
No tiene caso no, porque solo parecía amor

Thalía,"Algo en la sangre me lo pedía
De madrugada yo me escurría
Entre las sombras de la gran ciudad
Calor de hombre me perseguía
Fue como un golpe de adrenalina
El se acercaba casi sin piedad

Sobre mi cuello su respiración
(Sobre mi cuello su respiración)
Me lo decía con una canción

Tranquila el no lo sabe mi vida
Es solo una noche prohibida
Nadie más se enterará
Tranquila baila conmigo sin prisa
Date una noche prohibida
Mañana lo olvidarás

No me sorprende lo presentía
Tarde o temprano sucedería
Mi lado salvaje iba a regresar
No preguntaba, el lo sabia
Podría ver cuanto lo quería
Era un instinto más que natural

Sobre mi cuello su respiración
(Sobre mi cuello su respiración)
Me lo decía con una canción

Tranquila el no lo sabe mi vida
Es solo una noche prohibida
Nadie más se enterará
Tranquila baila conmigo sin prisa
Date una noche prohibida
Mañana lo olvidarás

Listen baby, don't tell em
For shorty think this shit a novela
I'm tryin' to show you what it feel like
When you rollin with the don
Got the stars on the roof
Mi princesa this is real life
Uh, I let her know off the bat
I'm used to getting passed first base thats facts
I'm used to playin' tag on the sands of Anguilla
This time your it baby girl tranquila

Tranquila tu muévete tranquila
Mi vida que no se enterará
Tranquila desnúdate tranquila
Sin miedo que nadie lo sabrá

Tranquila el no lo sabe mi vida
Es solo una noche prohibida
Nadie más se enterará
Tranquila baila conmigo sin prisa
Date una noche prohibida
Mañana no olvidarás",Tranquila,2014

Tu fuiste el trofeo que yo tanto quería
La apuesta que mantuve equivocadamente
Mientras te habrías un hueco despacito en mi mente
Y en mi corazón.

Tú fuiste mi curiosidad y un nudo en el alma
Por fin me decidí a desatar dos palabras
Demasiado perfecto era el guión de lo nuestro
Apúntate dos tantos por robarte mis besos, mis primeros

Y no quería hacerte daño estoy arrepentido
Y yo les vi riendo darte el premio merecido
Y cómo convencerte que ahora soy sincero
Dame tiempo porque aún te miro y sólo veo un juego

¿Qué haremos?
Dejemos que el aire corra entre los dos
A ver qué nos cuenta el viento
Dejemos que el mundo gire y gire
Hasta que nos encontremos de nuevo
Dejemos que el aire corra entre los dos

Dejemos que el aire corra entre los dos
A ver qué nos cuenta el viento
Dejemos que el mundo gire y gire
Hasta que nos encontremos de nuevo
Dejemos que el aire corra entre los dos (entre los dos)
Entre los dos
Entre los dos
Entre los dos, entre los dos",La Apuesta,2017

Was driving everybody out of their brains
But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve 
And I pleaded I was being framed

I screamed out loud
""Sailor show me which way to go""

Such a deadly silence 
Due to my defiance 
The wedding ground to a halt
Said I changed my mind
Ain't no use in your trying
So her brother punched me in the throat
Her mother got hysterical
The bitch was cynical 
Father's in the corner drunk
Picking myself off the floor 
I ran to the door
Damned if I was skippin' on my way

You should have heard the noise
Said ""Sailor show me which way to go""

Gonna love you from dusk till dawn
Keep your front door key 
Don't give him up for me

All night creepin'

Every day I write you a long letter sayin I'm leavin
But then I make a mistake
I deliver it myself
Now I got suitcase full of old letter s
I reckon I should save them
Someday I might have to keep them from someone else

You don't really want me around
But when you let me I'm bound
To break a promise I'll never tell
Because I love you I just love you, oh well

Every night I swear this isn't happenin I'm not foolin
Myself in the morning it's gonna be a different day
But then you're singing in my dreams
You wake me with the phone ring
Sayin drop on by if you're goin my way
So you say you been thinking about me
That you love me
And you're glad I understand about your little room
And then you wrap your arms around me and lift my hopin body
Send me dancing home by the light of the moon

Well I guess i'm good as gold pleased as punch
Netter fo rknowoing I'm a man lost at sea
The only trouble is like a window painted shut
You can't crawl out it but there's so much to see

Thandiswa Mazwai,"Our love is molded from the healing depths of the darkest soil,
Overflowing amongst the golden nick time of possibilities.
From the garden of creation we crawl,
Fertile earth to abound in the seed,
Bleed of grass to ancient trees,
Shiny flower into the sweetest fruits of love.

I can’t remember how we loved before,
Before the message of our true blessings,
Before the confusion.

Masters in the mysteries of the spirit,
Now been to remember anything that thinks of truth,
It started a long time ago, so many without numbers,
No longer recognizing each other is keen
And love becomes a concept, not a necessity
Not a believer to be family.

The oral traditions have been badly overdoubted,
The spiritual language replaced by commercial tongues.
The lacking of word for heal, awakening,
Feels enlightening.
It seems that we may have forgotten our purpose.
To tell the God, to own the land,
Plant the seeds of trust deep within the heart
And let the roots of love simply be.",Roots of Love,2012

His path was marked 
By the stars in the Southern Hemisphere 
And he walked his days

This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein 
After the dream of falling and calling your name out 
These are the roots of rhythm 
And the roots of rhythm remain 

In early memory 
Mission music 
Was ringing 'round my nursery door 
I said take this child, Lord 
From Tucson Arizona 
Give her the wings to fly through harmony 
And she won't bother you no more

(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!
(It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto! (It's Ghetto-oh!) It's Ghetto!

I get it jumping like a lo lo '64
And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo
You know it's him and the gang
With the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue
But remember the things, ain't too far
And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely
I know the snakes gonna slither soon
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon
The back feels like sitting in the living room
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman
It's that man that back to back plat' scan
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!

[Chorus]

They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince
And throw rose petals when I walk
They love how I came back hard like good blow
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho
That's what hood though, yes I would know
That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others
The man no other, cause I been in it
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes
I'm gone! catch up!

Where we from? Don't matter 'cause we gettin' it done
Land Rover, double sun roof, bulletproof
Tangaray and grapefruit, got me hurlin' on my boots
Man, please spit it out, twist the trees
5:40 I fly when I'm dissin' the D's
Deep Dish P., Sip Dom P. with ease

First two words I ever learn, cock and squeeze
Ain't about that, trying to do without that
Makin' niggas fuck up their budget
Time to get their paper route back
L O X three letter word, black mall
With every last member of the team on the job
Whether it be controllin' the street, holdin' the heat
Really don't matter to me, long as we eat

He put his thoughts into my mind,

He stopped me from living so unsane,
I could be just what I want to be

I can see just what I want to see

And you find you don't have to search for words,

You start doing what you want to do
And you find out that the world that you once feared,
Gets what it has from you
No one can ever hurt you
'Cause you know more than you thought you knew
And you're looking at the world
From brand new eyes,
And no one can ever spoil the view

If you should watch them they soon will astound you,

Can seesaw beneath him

Ready yourself for love everlasting

It slides you through your point of view,

And you find you don't have to search for words,
'Cause there's nothing you need to say

Well come on, you gotta let it happen to you,
Come on, and let it happen to you,
You gotta open up your mind 
And let everything come through

After your trip life opens up,
You start doing what you want to do
And you find out that the world that you once feared,
Gets what it has from you
No one can ever hurt you
'Cause you know more than you thought you knew
And you're looking at the world
From brand new eyes,
And no one can ever spoil the view

A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with a divinity or a true understanding of the human condition

Living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect

I got my pen and thought that I'd write
A melody and line for you tonight

Except, of course, the places where the internet could not go
They went to the countryside
They went to birthday parties of the children of some of his less important friends
Different countries, even the moon

When the man got sad, his friend had so many clever ways to make him feel better
He would get him cooked animals
And show him the people having sex again
And he would always, always agree with him
This one was the man's favorite and it made him very happy
The man trusted his friend so much

""I feel like I could tell you anything,"" he said, on a particularly lonely day

""You can, you can tell me anything
I'm your best friend, anything you say to me will stay strictly between you and the internet""

And so he did, the man shared everything with his friend
All of his fears and desires
All of his loves, past and present
All of the places he had been and was going, and pictures of his penis

He would tell himself, ""Man does not live by bread alone""

And then he died in his lonely house, on the lonely street, in that lonely part of the world

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made

Gotti we gone slide down swang wide
(Aight)
We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

I can hit it from the front

I'ma put it in your crack, see how you act

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor
Act a damn fool, on this damn tape

Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,

Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.

There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

For being so untrue

I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

The 45 King,"Let's start the show off sisters ago look alive 
The Queen Latifah the King of 45 
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor 
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a 
A sample sound the she added a compound 
Word this is for those who haven't heard 
A King and Queen combine minds and trample 
Those who oppose us here's an example 

It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set 
The competition is petty and ready to step 
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one 
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one 
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken 
Queen Latifah's outspoken 
Use your imagination, picture this 
Any male or female rapper trying to diss 
Here for excitement and enticement 
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment 
Teach the youth, feed the needy 
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti 
The mother of civilization will rise 
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation 
Secondary but necessary to reproduce 
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack 
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind 
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher 
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys 
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy 
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King 
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring 
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation 

Technician, musical musician 
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction 
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most 
Creativity, you get a double dose 
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test 
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet) 
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one 
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one 
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum 
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em 
I rock, never hyperventilate 
Others get tired, could use a commercial break 
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias 
It takes a ton of M-C's to prevail against me 
Just listen, I'm unstoppable 
You want a mission? This one's impossible 
Beats rock all night with no curfew 
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue 
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it 
If the style fits, I wear it 
Many attempts were made, none was recognized 
45 King said sample soundified 
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next 
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet 
Studio mixer, I got the formula 
And said the man from self, I'm warning you 
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur 
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa 
On top, it's a usual act 
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios 
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing 
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing",A King and Queen Creation,1989

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories

The 5th Dimension,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

The 5th Dimension,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe,2002

Bring back the better days for me baby
You gotta bring 'em back cos I'm going crazy

Tell me that you're gonna push your loving back my way.

Slept on the trio, but now look who's grinnin

Not on a dissin mission, but stay off my line

The 7A3,"Hit 'em again
(Here's a little story that must be told)

Police maybe, punks never
Our rhymes are slammin and we won't ever
Become intimidated by the gossip stated
Instead we'll strive and let it motivate us

'Cause we are brothers, don't try to diss
The 3 will get evil and then commit
Assault with deadly lyrics and make you admit
7A3 - we ain't havin' it

When you recover you'll try to contend
But the 3 will be waitin' and we'll hit you again

Intellectual seekers, seekin' intellect
So if you're stalkin' you better come correct
And guaranteed that when I give you a taste
It's like I buck you in your head and your grill out your face

So when they come to your funeral the casket's closed
The secrets that you keep are never exposed
'Cause you thought you was a champ but you're just another vic
Said we were stupid but you're not that slick

Heard we're in the house, got your posse and hurried
Looked into my eyes - and then you scurried
Out the door because you have no heart
I see you seen the future and it tears you apart

Once you was a enemy but now you're a friend
Because you don't want the 3 to hit em again

Once upon a time when I first started rhymin'
I used to wonder when I would start climbin'
The charts, lookin' away from the common problem
I lacked patience, and virtues, I had none

So I had to learn as time went on
About the trips I might be sent on
And by trips I don't mean a vacation
The first law of nature is self-preservation

So my motto is to hit em again
You want to know why? Well, my friend
In the end the truth is you may not win
And if you don't win you can hit em again

Because of what I am and how I stand
You tend to fear my kind of man
Collectin' knowledge from the mother Earth
And seekin' out the prophecies since the date of birth

Brothers and sisters, believe in your dreams
Because without em you're a falcon with just one wing
Always lookin' over mountains to see the sky
When you could look down as in the clouds you fly

Look at the child and all I feel is sorrow
It's hard today, and then tomorrow...
See, life is a game and anybody can win
And if at first you don't succeed, well then you hit em again",Hit 'em Again,1988
The 7A3,"World, wake up, can't you see what's goin' on
We all live in sin and say the other man is wrong
But yo, in the '80s, this world is out of hold
'Cause man hates himself, but he loves the battlezone

Ignorance is on the loose
The color of my skin could put my neck in a noose
Yo, my brain is haunted from the hate and violence
And everywhere I rock I see they take a code of silence

Said in the Bible that my Savior died
Yet other than me, they say the Lord has lied
People walkin' like zombies, they never know
What they're doin', what they're seein', 

what they're hearin', where they're goin'
It seems to me that the nature of man
Is to abolish all the knowledge that he can understand
Livin' with Lucifer, yo, you better cease
'Cause it's all about peace

Wise but still wonderin', all of the blunderin'
My soul is drenched in blood and the sky is thunderin'
Subject to all discrepancies
Is a man who chooses his enemies

[unknown] all the blessings or the color of his shirt
My enemy is chosen when a animal is hurt
The honor of the tiger can destroy the man
But he fights to the death till he cannot stand

Satan has prophets such as Hitler
We use human flesh to paint a picture
So many died, so many cried
By a German maniac, is to live out a lie

[unknown] warrior magic of a ?magician?
Producin' death, the nuclear technician
Man disrespects his woman and whose mind is fair
Are the only ones who speak and show that they care

Others turn their heads and they say it's a shame
But they live in a ???? so tell me who's to blame
You're livin' with Lucifer, yo, you better cease
It's all about peace

In 1984 the devil opened the door
For the next 7 years the Earth he shall explore
King Jr., a noble man who believed in peace
Must have thought he was wrong, so his life had to cease

Hate is a necessity and love is a choice
Men are persecuted if they choose to voice
Their opinion, see, the world's so opinionated
This is fact, not fiction that I just stated

Don't know it all, but understand a lot
Boy is playin' in the sand and in his head he's shot
By another brother who had brought the tool
He was robbin' a sister for her dookie gold

Children subjected to satanic rituals
Run demonic ways which they make habitual
Spend a million dollars on a Super Bowl
Meanwhile a child is starvin' only three years old

Classy anglosaxons, filthy white trash
Dancin jiggaboos, high yellow ass
Seems that the world is so stereotypical
We turn on our own, that's somewhat hypocritical

You're livin' with Lucifer, boy, you better cease
It's all about peace

And all we are sayin', my brothers
Is give peace a chance",Lucifer,1988

When the boys come together, we do the wild thing
Birds and bees, birds sing as the bees sting

Screams of passion, voice is goin' hoarse

Makin' millions, but on the faces no scars
You're rollin' with a posse, they seem to make you bolder
Talkin' mess lookin' over your shoulder

Don't worry 'bout a thing, you won't get snuffed
We pull a one-on-one and you get bumrushed
See, I live on the street, never carry a nine
Hit your heart and leave you staggerin like moonshine

Get ill as shit, shootin' celo
Got so much money, think I'm sellin' by the kilo
I ain't with it, everybody sells drugs

Get you all hot and sweaty, have it drip down your body
You see, we will request, any request
As long as it gives joy and happiness
So, everybody live love and laugh
Because the money you pay we split in half
See this is not a can can, but its a jam jam
And when you hear it you'll say, damn man

[Chorus]

We're telling you the truth, this tale is not a tattle
Your bodies we will rock, your minds we will rattle
So take our advice and you better skeedaddle
Cause we're pushin more power than a herd of cattle
We're tired of all the soft MCs
Sayin they'll bring us down to our knees
Talkin' mess when their backs are turned
Never say it to our face cause they know they'll get burned
United we stand, divided we fall
And in the year of eighty-seven Bouldin brothers take it all
Leave the ladies stimulated, homeboys devastated
Combination's devastatin' as we just demonstrated
See, Brett and Shawn, we formed an alliance
We'll demolish and destroy anyone who show defiance
See I'm not tweedle-dee, he's not tweedle-dumb
Keep money in my pocket cus we never are bums

Was it telling stories in a heartbreak song
Where nobody's right and nobody was wrong
Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love where did I go wrong

Well I guess I'm standing in the hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
Whenever a new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feeling comes and goes

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?

Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""

I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

					Words and Music by Margo Guryan


You make me shine,
     shine, shine, shine
Looking at me
With stars in your eyes
Trying to say
What I've always wanted to know
You want me to know that you're mine, mine

My, it feels good to believe
In someone
It's been a long time
A lonely time
It's been a hard time
An empty time
Since anyone made me feel

Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Dancing to music
And singing each line
As I shine, shine, shine, shine
    shine, shine, shine, shine

Slowing down to see the mountains you built
This life story to tell with one second to live
Slowing down to see the time that passed you by
Your life story to tell with only one second to live

Time takes throne to purge the fill of our flight
When days turn into years and a loss of life
Death rattles a mile away from your restless symphony
The ridden thought unsound
The shadows that crept lonely all around

The hammer comes down and thunder strikes
Where we burn fast in the build of our lives

Now waiting will just not work
When tales must be told, changed and retold

Slowing down to see the mountains you built

Slowing down to see the time that passed you by

Mess on our hands 

Don't give in, don't give up 
I'll be gone. 
I don't look innocent enough 
We're too young to be cynics 
We won't wish any harm at all 
Don't give in, don't give up 
No one looks innocent with this big big mess on our hands tonight. 

When it all comes crashing.",We've Got a Big Mess on Our Hands [Album Version],2007
The Academy Is...,"One song about a girl
I can't breathe when I'm around her
I'll wait here everyday
In case you scratch the surface
She'll never notice

I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl

Last night I knew what to say
But you weren't there to hear it
These lines: so well rehearsed
Tongue-tied and overloaded
You never noticed

I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl

I'm not in love
This is not your song
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl

To be loved, to be loved
What more could you ask for?
To be loved, to be loved
Everyone wants to be loved
To be loved
What more could you ask for
To be loved, to be loved
Everyone...

I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words

I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words
About a girl

I'm not in love
(To be loved, to be loved, what more could you ask for?)
This is not your song
(To be loved, to be loved, everyone wants)
I'm not gonna waste these words
(To be loved, to be loved, what more could you ask for?)

The Academy Is...,"It's a drunken midnight on the streets
Brightly dusted with a neon light
We duck behind the corner store
Smoke your smokes while I keep
A watchful eye
Right here, right now
I hope before the night is through
One fumbled touch will finally hit the spot
You've got everything going for you
So I'll go for you with everything I got
Right here, the best days of our lives
Is this coincidence or a sign?

Is there anything I missed?
Is there anything I missed?
Tell me if I'm wrong
But why would we change a thing?

When the morning light fights through the cracks
Cascading across the bed, and you are mine
When your parents start to wake for work
Between the sheets, I'll keep a watchful eye
Right here, the best days of our lives
Is this coincidence or a sign?

When we met I was on my back
I swear we spent most afternoons
Somewhere in the act
We were part of something ours
And ours alone
Anywhere was home
We're almost here again
We're almost here again
We're almost here again
Right here, right now",After the Last Midtown Show,2008
The Academy Is...,"Staring at the mirror through your hair
You can't see everything that you did to me
With your automatic eyes, five years disappeared
Five years disappeared that night

Do you want me to stay
Do you want me to go?
Do you think I recognize
The look on your face when you think that
I know
Blinded as the shades draw closed
Time's up for us
Would you want me to go
If you knew what I know?
If you knew what I know

I can't sleep with all the secrets that you keep
With your automatic eyes
Five years disappeared
Five years disappeared that night",Automatic Eyes,2008

We still spend most afternoons like that
But not for long
I find myself enjoying you
But you play these reckless games
You'll never lose
As long as I'm around

Do you want to tie me up?
Do you want to tie me down?
Go ahead and do it now

So far, so good, let it roll, let it ride, ride
So far, so good, let us fall, let us fight, fight
It's no fun on the sidelines

We both know I'm too young for you
And when you fake a laugh behind the wheel
I know where this road is heading to
With a sunken lie I lay in bed
But I will live to be twenty-three
And you'll see just how clever I can be?

Driving backwards, wasting time
Young love is ruthless, so learn to fly
You taught me things I can't forget
Positions that I don't regret

Are you ready to get undressed
Undressed in your evening best besides
Every heart is like a house on fire with escape
Routes in every room
These are the trials of our youth

But this charade is never going to last
So pick the poison and pour yourself a glass
I still feel the same
No one's to blame

I will be waiting outside if you're ready to go
Your sundress reflects in the headlight glow
Besides, every heart is like a house of cards
When the walls break down on you
These are the trials of our youth

These are the fast times
These are the fast times

These mistakes are just a part of the ride
And if we choke on the next tongue that we tie

Look in the mirror, could you tell me
What you see?
Hard hearts are crashing in a crowded room
You never felt so good, you never felt so free

Save you from yourself
Before you start to deal with everyone else
You should have kept it to yourself
Now we're looking to fight, this isn't alright
Alright, you better hold your scripted tongue
If you ever plan to use those words again
The future doesn't make much sense
With you at the helm with your friends
This is where that ends

You've got a problem here
The tide is turning you inside out

This won't take long your reign is done
We are the innocent ones
You can't take back the damage done
This is the last time you will shine
Spare us your excuse
'Cuz this exercise of self-abuse
Will swallow everything that you hold dear
The further you are, the closer we get
The more you need to hold your scripted tongue
If you ever plan to use those words again

And gawking stares that don't care

To beat the traffic after class
With all my best intentions
But when the weather changed
Like fine print, you were hard to read
Blind-folded, eyes wide open
Staring through me

I never heard the words that were spoken
With the rumored nights, with the rendezvous
I never thought the whispers were true 'til now

I saw things that I shouldn't have tonight, tonight
I know now what I couldn't have
I've gone too far to turn it back
I've gone too far to turn it back

Followed you home halfway
Over the fence to your backyard
With all my best intentions
And through your window frame
Outstretched and lying on your bed
Blind-folded, eyes wide open
Staring through me

Uninvited, no one knows
How much I care, how bad you are
How good we'd be, but you won't let me in

She tries to escape memory
And dream of a life that is but a dream

Candle light inside her room
Paints on the wall
Like a dancer that calls her by name

She sits by the window, 
Feeling the wind blowing free
She waits for a train
To come take her away to the sea
Flowers in her hair smell like the breeze

And tonight she flies
Away from misery
And tonight, tonight
The pain will set her free.

She sleeps through the day
And awakes under moonlight red glow

The cold inch of air that threatens my bed
Where you used to stand

The ghost at my arm
The kiss on my neck
So strange this house that I'm in
It's not what I meant by those things I said

The frost on the glass
The wheels on the road
The soft white machine
That holds you between
The coming and going

The closer I am, the closer I get
The further you drift from this place
While I cling to your face in my head

The closer I am to your threaded hand
The cold slice of air that holds by my bed
Where you used to stand
The closer I am

How noble in reason 
How infinite in faculties

How express and admirable

The paragon of animals 

I have of late 
But wherefore I know not 
Lost all my mirth

The earth 
Seems to me a sterile promontory 
This most excellent canopy 
The air-- look you! 
This brave o'erhanging firmament 
This majestical roof 
Fretted with golden fire 
Why it appears no other thing to me 
Than a foul and pestilent congregation 
Of vapors

The Aces,"You know, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I looked through the window, I peeked through the blind,
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

I was cleaned and skinned and so hard-pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
I finally reached my baby 'bout a half past three
She said, ""I'd like to know what you want with me.""
I said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

She screamed and said, ""What's wrong with you?
From this day on, our romance is through.""
I said, ""Tell me, baby, face to face
A-how could another man take my place?""
She said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.""

Well, I learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the wind may blow
Women may come, and the women may go,
But before I say I love 'em so,
I want-- money, honey!
Money, honey!
Money, honey,
If you want to get along with me.
(If you want to get along) Well, make some money
(If you want to get along) Well, I ain't jivin' you, honey
(If you want to get along) You better give up some money
If you want to get along with me.","Money, Marbles and Chalk",1976
