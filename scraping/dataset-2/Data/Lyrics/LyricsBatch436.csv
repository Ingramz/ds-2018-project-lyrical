Jill Sobule,"Johnny's mom was worried
She caught him in the bathroom
With a copy of GQ
The men's fall fashion issue

So she called her pastor
The respected Reverend Bean
Who, after a minute of silence
Said, ""I'll pray for thee,""

Johnny's dad was absent
At another men's convention
For Christian men who need to learn
To be better dads
Johnny's mom kept quiet
About her son's sin
Afraid that Dad would beat
The holy shit out of him

Under the disco ball
Another child will fall
Under the spell of leather
And the big kick drum

They have a scheme
They have a plan
To take the children of our land
Turn them into stylists
And women who play golf",Under the Disco Ball,2003
Jill Sobule,"I work for Abu Dhabi
And I work for Channel Four
At the Palestine hotel
You had the room next door
As the bunker bombs were falling
Lit up the Baghdad sky
You said come here you sweet infidel
I'll show you the fourth of July
I'm a war correspondent in love

I know you hate my country
But you've probably got a right
I came here to liberate and change my boring life
And I know you don't drink whisky
But you got a hookah pipe
See my hair in angles
You could more less spend the night
I'm a war correspondent in love
I'm a war correspondent in love

I really like your alphabet
I really like your laugh
Never seen anyone with such a big moustache. big moustache
I'm a war correspondent in love
I'm a war correspondent, really let's not be despondent
I'm a war correspondent in love
In love",War Correspondent,2003
Jill Sobule,"Don't let us get sick
Don't let us get old
Don't let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

The sky was on fire
When I walked to the mill
To take up the slack in the line
I thought of my friends
And the troubles they've had
To keep me from thinking of mine

Na na na na

The moon has a face
And it smiles on the lake
And causes the ripples in time
And I'm lucky to be here
With someone I like
To maketh my spirit to shine

Don't let us get sick
Don't let us get old
Don't let us get stupid, all right?
Just make us be brave
And make us play nice
And let us be together tonight

Don't let us get sick

Jill Sobule,"On Monday I wished it was Tuesday night
So I could wish for the weekend to come
On Tuesday I wished that the night would pass
So I could call you on the phone
Now a man can spend a lot of time
Wondering what was on Jack Ruby's mind 
And time is all I have without you here 

On Wednesday when you hung up
It was as much as I could do
To stop from wishing Thursday
Would pass so quickly too
They're out there making history
In the Lenin Shipyards today
And here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away

There's always room for one more soul
Down in the Human Zoo
I don't want you to come here though
I want to come home to you
Somebody's knocking at the door
Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

On Friday I wished there was something more
To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday
Oh will this torment ever end
Sometimes I get a notion to put a torch
To the tools of my trade
Here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away
",People Get Ready,2004
Jill Sobule,"If you're upset at your loved ones
Or you're just mad at mankind
Or you just need some money
Of great hall one day you would sign
You can go to Ohio
Solemnly go there for work
But do yourself a favor
Don't end up in for work

Better not kill in Texas
Whatever you do
Better not kill in the Lone Star State
They just love to kill you

Even if you had a bad childhood
And your dad mess with you at night
Even if you're real sorry
Even if you're pretty or white
Even if you say you love Jesus
Or the doctor said you're real sick
Well you can get off and board the Colorado
But they'll fry your ass in the bed

Better not kill in Texas
Whatever you do
Better not kill in the Lone Star State
They just love to kill you

Better not kill in Texas
Whatever you do
Better not kill in the Lone Star State
They just love to kill you

Oh you better not kill in Texas
Whatever you do
Better not kill in the Lone Star State
They just love to kill you",Texas,2004
Jill Sobule,"Me and Betty Shelly were at Cinnamon Park
Waiting for the battle of the bands
Betty's older brother had a bad reputation
And a water bed in his van
He said hey Jilly Sue I've got something for you
Something that will blow your mind
We hopped into his van
And he opened his hand
And said its only mother nature

[Chorus]
Cinnamon park in a cinnamon daze
We were so freaked out
But in a really good way
In a really good way
Yeah those were the days
I wish I could go back again

Billy had a talk box and a Peavey bass
Started feeling funny when they hit the stage
Betty was getting so shitfaced
And I could not stop laughing

As I spun all around and I laid on the ground
I was amazed at how the clouds just kept moving
And they played the same song
And they played the chords wrong
But I never heard it better

[Chorus]

Betty's now in counseling
And she's using again
Her brother's unemployed but with a brand new van
Billy came in second in the battle of the bands
Wish we could go back again

[Chorus: x2]",Cinnamon Park,2004
Jill Sobule,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time",For the Good Times,2006
Jill Sobule,"You're scary, you terrify me
I should draw the blinds
Do it all the time
I keep my love inside
We'll be a bloody valentine

You're lovely
I've heard such good things
And I've asked around
They tell me that you're kind
But I'm still afraid to find
Just a bloody valentine

Maybe I'm worried
It'll come back around
My hands have been bloodied
'Cause I knocked a few down

Yeah, maybe I'm worried
That this is my time
To get my heart broken
Be a bloody valentine

You're scary, you petrify me
But I sure like you
I hope that you do too
And all of it comes true

If not, then I'm resigned
To be your bloody valentine
If not, then that's just fine
I'll be your bloody valentine
Your bloody valentine

One, two, three, four

Bloody valentine
Bloody valentine

One, two, three, four
Five, and we will end

",Bloody Valentine,2009
Jill Sobule,"Right across the border
You can almost hear the trumpets playing
Maybe it's the workers
Who are building up the wall

So take my hand and come with me
Past the guards and tower
No one will ask for your ID
Not with those big blue eyes

La la, la la, la la, la, la la, la
At the Mexican pharmacy
La, la la, la
At the Mexican pharmacy

A girl is selling Chiclets
Yellow, pink, and green
We buy some and her brother
Leads us to the pharmacy

Past stolen book blankets
Cheap silver and leather
The pocketbook
Made from an armadillo

It's nothing you need
Just take us, please
To the Mexican pharmacy

You can dance all night or sleep all day
Forget about the girl and your back pain
Rise to the occasion or fade to black
When the bottle's empty, you can always go back

Student needs to stay up
The wife's doctor cuts her off
A man must please his mistress
And I just need to calm down

Tequila is swell, the Corona is cheap
Nothing compares to the pharmacy
A rancher is flying from an old Jeep
And this is so much like love

La la, la la, la la, la, la la, la
At the Mexican pharmacy
La, la la, la
At the Mexican pharmacy

La la, la la, la la, la, la la, la
At the Mexican pharmacy

Jill Sobule,"If I was your sweetheart and you were my darling
I'd always remember the way you look now
Even here in this diner your bright eyes shining
And you're always smiling when you're by my side

And that man is rude
He talks to you just like you were his wife
But I would be more kind
My coffee cup has been filled up for the seventh time
And you're so on my mind

If I was your secret and you were my keeper
I think we'd be happy or rarely be blue
We'd run around laughing and maybe go out dancing
If I was your sweetheart and you were my darling

And all I'd ever want from you is that you would keep it true
And I'd write songs for you
And we could round the world to see
All the disappearing things and then we'd vanish too

If I was your sweetheart

And that man is rude
He talks to you just like you were his wife
But I would be more kind
My coffee cup has been filled up for the seventh time
And you're so on my mind

If I was your sweetheart
And you were my darling
I'd take off your apron
You've been a good waitress

",Sweetheart,2009
Jill Sobule,"She makes me so unsure of myself
Standing there but never talking sense
Just a visitor you see
So much wanting to be seen
She'd open up the door and vaguely carry us away

It's the customary thing to say or do
To a disappointed proud man in his grief
And on Fridays she'd be there
And on Wednesday not at all
Just casually appearing from the clock across the hall

You're a ghost la la la
You're a ghost
I'm in the church and I've come
To claim you with my iron drum
La la la

The Continent's just fallen in disgrace
William William William Rogers put it in its place
Blood and tears from old Japan
Caravans and lots of jam and maids of honor
Singing crying singing tediously

Efficiency efficiency they say
Get to know the date and tell the time of day
As the crowds begin complaining
How the Beaujolais is raining
Down on darkened meetings on Champs Elysee",Paris 1919,2015

But true love burns for a thousand years
Give my tomorrows for one yesterday
Just to know that i could have you here

When will this river of tears stop fallin'

Jim & Ingrid Croce,"I've been up and down and 'round and 'round and back again,
Been so many places I can't remember where or when.
And my only boss was the clock on the wall
And my only friend never really was a friend at all.

I've traded love for pennies; sold my soul for less.
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time.
And I've turned inside out and 'round about and back and then
Found myself right back where I started again.

Once I had myself a million, now I've only got a dime.
Difference so seem quite as bad today.
With a nickel or a million I was searchin' all the time
For something that I never lost or left behind.

I've traded love for pennies; sold my soul for less.
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time.
And I've turned inside out and 'round about and back and then
Found myself right back where I started again.

And now I'm in my second circle and I'm headed for the top;
I learned a lot of things along the way.
I'll be careful while I'm climbin', 'cause it hurts a lot to drop.
Nobody gives a damn anyway.

Jim & Ingrid Croce,"My dusty feet have kicked the stones
Between a thousand railroad ties
From Boston down to New Orleans
I left the girls a cryin'
But I've still got some ramblin' in me
Got some miles left on my shoes
And before I take a job again
I'll have to be low-down
Cryin' the blues
So it's goodbye, baby, the whistle is a blowin'
If I miss the train I'll have to stay around
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending
I'll be off to another day in another town

This ain't no life for a girl
Too many people out to get you in a hobo's world
And it gets mighty cold when you're on the road

But you could join me if you want

For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue

As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam

Jim & Jesse,"Now let me tell a story, I can tell it all
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, the son, he drove the load
And when his engine roared, they called the highway thunder road

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis Town
The revenuers, they chased him, but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him, his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder road

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
The federal man sent word, he better make his run no more
He said 200 agents were covering the state
Whichever road he'd try to take, they'd get him sure as fate

“Son”, his daddy told him, “Now make this run your last
Your tank is filled with 100 proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that mountain dew”

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Roaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed through Maynardville
With G-men on his tail light, roadblocks up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at ninety, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

",Ballad of Thunder Road,1998
Jim & Jesse,"I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dance
I heard that old jukebox playing
A song about a truck driving man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that truck driving man

The waitress just brought me some coffee
I thanked her but called her again
I said that old song sure does hit me
'Cause I'm a truck driving man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that truck driving man

I climbed back aboard my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got that old truck wheels rollin'

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Jim Adams,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Jim Aikin,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1993
Jim Altamore,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

On a silent shore
I spoke to god
The sun is down
Assemble the great pandemonium
War

One more down by the brook of Babylon
One more down in accordance with my fate
One long drift across the lake of Avalon
One more trip that I must create

And my eyes sweep a shore
That was always there
A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there

She had a dream about the King of Sweden,
He gave her things that she was needin',
He gave her a home built of gold and steel,

She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
She sat around and counted them all a million times.

I'd fly you too the stars so we can disapear
If I could take your heart and keep it close to me 
I swear it will not brake, I swear it will not bleed,
And I believe just anything you say 

if you'd tell me to get lost id ask how far away 
And now its getting late and I can't keep my eyes open
But my hearts open for you

Jim Brickman,"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Oh yeah, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1997

What we believe in
Funny, just the other day
I was walking down the street
Stopped into that place
You know, the one where we used to meet
Thought I heard you call my name
And I whispered on the wind
And I remember you were going,
Never coming back again

I'll see you in heaven's first bright star
If seeing is believing
I look into the skies and there you are
You're not that far

From not so long ago
Right now, I'd give anything
If I had only known
I would never you touch you, hold you
Or kiss your face
Feel your arms around me
Or fall in your embrace
Now love will break your heart
When you say goodbye
But love is worth the pain
And all tears you cry

Mom said, ""I'm gonna go to bed, it's late""
She went to the kitchen to make three school lunches
Another night in a mother's day
Put the cereal bowls out for breakfast
Set the coffeemaker for 6 a.m.
Sewed a loose button on brother's shirt for him

Checked sister's math homework, sent a note to the teacher
Added eggs to the grocery list
Started a load of wash, made sure the doors were locked
Put water in the puppy's dish
Wrote a check to the children's piano teacher
Turned the dishwasher on
And Dad called out, ""Honey, what's takin' you so long?""

Have I ever thanked you
For everything you've done?
Now all that I can say is
""I love you, Mom""

Hung some art on the refrigerator door
And headed up the stairs
Kissed all the children and helped sister comb
Her wavy golden hair
Washed her make-up off and turned on the bath
Lay down in the moon's soft light and kissed Dad goodnight

Have I ever thanked you
For everything you've done?
Now all that I can say is
""I love you, Mom""

Through all those colds and fevers
Thank you for believin' in me

On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay 'round about
Deep and crisp and even

Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gathering winter fuel

Hither, page and stand by me
If thou knows it telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?

Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes's fountain

Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me fur logs, hither
Thou and I will see him dine
Here we bear him thither

Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer

Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly

In his master's steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed

What I'd give if I could keep

The Lamb upon his throne.
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns 
All music but its own.
Awake, my soul, and sing of him 
Who died for thee,
And hail him as thy matchless King 
Through all eternity.

Crown him the virgin's Son, 
The God incarnate born,
Whose arm those crimson trophies won 
Which now His brow adorn;
Fruit of the mystic rose, 
As of that rose the stem;
The root whence mercy ever flows, 
The Babe of Bethlehem.

Crown him the Son of God, 
Before the worlds began,
And ye who tread where he hath trod, 
Crown him the Son of Man;
Who every grief hath known 
That wrings the human breast,
And takes and bears them for His own,
That all in him may rest.

Crown him the Lord of life, 
Who triumphed over the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife 
For those he came to save.
His glories now we sing, 
Who died, and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring, 
And lives that death may die.

Crown him the Lord of peace, 
Whose power a scepter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease, 
And all be prayer and praise.
His reign shall know no end, 
And round his piercèd feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown him the Lord of love, 
Behold his hands and side,
Those wounds, yet visible above, 
In beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky 
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his burning eye 
At mysteries so bright.

Crown him the Lord of Heaven, 
Enthroned in worlds above,
Crown him the King to whom is given 
The wondrous name of Love.
Crown him with many crowns, 
As thrones before him fall;
Crown him, ye kings, with many crowns, 
For he is King of all.

Crown him the Lord of lords, 
Who over all doth reign,
Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, 
For ransomed sinners slain,
Now lives in realms of light, 
Where saints with angels sing
Their songs before him day and night, 
Their God, Redeemer, King.

Crown him the Lord of years, 
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres, 
Ineffably sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail! 
For thou has died for me;
Thy praise and glory shall not fail 
Throughout eternity.

Jim Brickman,"Jesus, joy of man's desiring 
Holy wisdom, love most bright 

Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring 
Soar to uncreated light 

Word of God, our flesh that fashioned 
With the fire of life impassioned 
Striving still to truth unknown 
Soaring, dying round Thy throne 

The original song continues with these words: 
Through the way where hope is guiding 
Hark, what peaceful music rings 
Where the flock, in Thee confiding 
Drink of joy from deathless springs 
Theirs is beauty's fairest pleasure 
Theirs is wisdom's holiest treasure 
Thou dost ever lead Thine own 
In the love of joys unknown",Jesu,2006

Of Peace on earth, good will to men
I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of Peace on earth, good will to men
And in despair, I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of Peace on earth, good will to men
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep

Santa and his sleigh
Of reindeer who found their way again

Tis the 25th day of December
In a season best to remember
That blessings and bows and mistletoes
Are not without tolls, guardian souls
A soldier has a soldier's duty
That takes no holiday

There's one thing I'd like to say

May angels fly beside you
May Heaven steel your hearts
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face
It doesn't matter if you're near or far
It's Christmas where you are

Your chair is empty at the table
Still I take your hand
As we pray for peace in this small world
On our knees we stand
Of this body of this nation
You are the heart and spine

Let all religions celebrate
The freedom that you provide
For if we stand together
We will never fall

Merry Christmas to one and all

That lights these holy stars

Jim Brickman,"There are stockings full and waiting
From sea to shining sea
Jingle bells a-ringing
In keys of liberty
Children celebrating
Santa and his sleigh
Of reindeer who found their way again
Across the home, home of the brave
Tis the 25th day of December
In a season best to remember
That blessings and bows and mistletoes
Are not without tolls, guardian souls
A soldier has a soldier's duty
That takes no holiday
So because you're far from home this winter
There's one thing I'd like to say

Thank you for the gift of freedom
That lights these holy stars
Thank you for each and every Christmas tree
Across this sacred land of ours
May angels fly beside you
May Heaven steel your hearts
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face
It doesn't matter if you're near or far
It's Christmas where you are

Your chair is empty at the table
Still I take your hand
As we pray for peace in this small world
On our knees we stand
Of this body of this nation
You are the heart and spine
So to each great generation
Of heroes down the line

Thank you for the gift of freedom
That lights these holy stars
Thank you for each and every Christmas tree
Across this sacred land of ours
May angels fly beside you
May Heaven steel your hearts
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face
It doesn't matter if you're near or far
It's Christmas where you are

Everyday is memorial day
Every day the 4th of July
Let all religions celebrate
The freedom that you provide
For if we stand together
We will never fall
Merry Christmas to the one I love
Merry Christmas to one and all

Thank you for the gift of freedom
That lights these holy stars
Thank you for each and every Christmas tree
Across this sacred land of ours
May angels fly beside you
May Heaven steel your hearts
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face
When home seems a hundred million miles away
Just close your eyes and you will see his sleigh

Jim Broadbent,"The French are glad to die for love
A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girls best friend
A kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental on your humble flat
Or help you feed your pompus cat
Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Tiffany!
Cartie!
Cause we are living in a material world and I am a material girl
Ah come and get me boys ow!
Black star, rozz call talk to me harry siblez, tell me all about it!
There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girls best friend
There may come a time when a heart-boiled employer thinks you're awful nice
Get that ice or else no dice
He's your guy when stakes are high but beware when they start to descend
Ooh, diamonds are a girls best
Diamonds are a girls best
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Lets make love
Yes! Yes! Tiger! Oh everything was going so well! (screams)
Cause that's when those louses go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best,  friend",Sparkling Diamonds,2002

On in the weary body to stray 
But we shall walk beside the still waters 
With the Good Shepherd leading The Way 

Those who have strayed were sought by The Master 
He who once gave His life for the sheep 
Out on the mountain still He is searching 
Bringing them in forever to keep 

Going up home to live in green pastures 
Where we shall live and die never more 
Even The Lord will be in that number 
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore 

We will not heed the voice of the stranger 
For he would lead us to despair 
Following on with Jesus our savior 
We shall all reach that country so fair

Where we shall live and die never more 
Even The Lord will be in that number 
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said

In the morning and started to laugh

How many times? Too many to recall.

Jim Capaldi,"He tries so hard to get himself together
But he's so weak he couldn't lift a feather
And it looks as though it's gonna be bad weather
When he comes down from the clouds

His mother says, I wish he'd should stop his drinking
He's like a ship that's on the verge of sinking
But she don't see his pupils as they're shrinking
When he's away in the clouds

He's just a boy with a problem he can't conceal
He thinks he's controlling his habit
But soon from this earth
He will leave

He used to be a very happy fellow
And everything he did was very mellow
But now his skin is slowly turning yellow
Looking just like a bad dream

He used to play a melody so pretty
On a silver stick a long way from the city
But now my heart is so filled up with pity
What can we do with him now

He's just a boy with a problem he can't conceal
He thinks he's controlling his habit
But soon from this earth
He will leave

I'm gonna write a song and send it to him
And maybe he will see just what I'm feelin'
I've still got love and hope and my affection
To keep him from fading away

The earth is pure, its veins are rivers of water
And man should be as a father to a daughter
But he does what he likes, because he thinks he's bought her
Laughing while he injects her with his filth

He's just a boy with a problem, lost out in space
We're turning him into a junkie, look at his face
What a disgrace

",Boy With a Problem,1975

Or what I'm goin' through

Everyday I hope you see me
Maybe look at me and smile
But you always seem to look right through me
I just break down and cry

Of everything I have to offer you
Of everything inside my heart

Could you ever love me too?
But you never seem to notice me

So subtle it can't be detected
They got a chain around your brain and you might as well be lame
It's too late you're already infected, ha

Universal love can be a good thing
If everybody stays on their own soil
It's when everybody tries to get together
That's when the blood begins to boil

Birds of a feather will always flock together

Hadn't traveled very far when suddenly I saw
Three small ships a-sailing all towards a distant shore
So lighting up a cigarette I followed in pursuit
And found a secret cave where they obviously stashed their loot

Filling up my pockets, even stuffed it up my nose
I must have weighed a hundred tons between my head and toes
I ventured forth before the dawn had time to change its mind
And soaring high above the clouds I found a golden shrine

Laying down my treasure before the iron gate
Quickly rang the bell hoping I hadn't come too late
But someone came along and told me not to waste my time
And when I asked him who he was he said, Just look behind

So I turned around and forty thousand headmen bit the dirt
Firing twenty shotguns each and man, it really hurt

And by the time they'd done that I was heading down the road

Ugh, hallelujah

While I'm lacing and tryna prepare this

About a dude I met once, miserable as hell
How grouchy he was
And how slouchy he was
And when he talked, you'd smell his breath
And how lousy it was
And if you daydreamed, he'd give you pinch
Now let me tell you about Mr. Grinch
Every holiday season while we was young, growing up
Everything be cool when Mr. Grinch show up
Always plottin' and schemin' to ruin everybody's holiday season
And never had a justifiable reason

But it was making me winch

I stole the gifts

What the hell made you like that?
So grouchy and grimy
How everything about you is whack

Around the gifts in your house
State of the art surveillance

With a couple wild dogs running loose, now

Safe guard your bling
You gotta safe guard your crib
Safe guard your g's

Time after time again
Never mind he already took the liqour out your Heineken
He already quick to try again
To steal the gifts another way
And give you all a different style again
Why you stackin' and you trying to swell

and snap a bone that is so close to the brain
And be attended to by so many down below
I saw a doctor tie you up from so far above

You start sliding like burned skin to a side door

Refrain:
But crow, when you throw yourself under
Singin's hard when you can't loose control
They don't know, to them in the dark you don't whisper nothin'
And they're all gonna try and rip the wind from your soul

It must have been hard to be a cashier in a bookstore
And to be surrounded by the history of your true loves
And you'd get naked between the deep shelves in the backroom
And have your brain get tan by sharp fluorescent light tubes
And you start spinning like the pillars in the temple
You'd start screaming just like Sister Aimee Semple

But Crow, when you throw yourself under
The streets are hard when you cannot lose control
They don't know, to them the dark don't whisper nothin'
And they're all gonna try and rip the wind from your soul

It was so sweet when you brought donuts to the junkies
Hey, you'd give us something we'd go slip into our coffee
And we'd start reading lines from poems that didn't matter

And I'd start reachin' for the scar along your belly
They'd start takin' us 'cause winning is their hobby

But nothing's true, she said everything is permitted

She got jewels on her tongue to time the stars
She drives all morning in unmarked cars
But nothing's true, it is all permitted

She got these special tools just to keep things tight
They robbed her eyes long ago of light
But nothing's true, she told me it's all permitted

She got inscrutable poise and nihilist charms
She gets her sleep through tubes in her arm
She said nothing is true, she said everything is permitted

She nods on graves, the marble's cold and white,
Her dreams surround the sun like a satellite
She said nothin' is true, she told me it's all permitted

The spiders [milk?] her thigh, it does not phase her
She cleans her skin with a krypton laser
Nothing is true, everything is permitted

She got heels so high, she got a gown so thin
Her eyes stop the whip before it tames her sin
She says nothin' is true, everything is permitted

Until they perfect the techniques to clone
You all better remember you're all alone
Because nothing is true, she said everything is permitted

Jim Carroll,"By jim carroll and steve linsley

You're passing,
I hear your shadow through the door
It's outlined on my shade
Like a map of some foreign shore
If I could keep that shadow,
I could live forever in these

Rooms, the rooms inside my dreams . . .
And dreams have kept me in these rooms

I've never seen her face
But I've memorized each sound . . .
The way the wind m eets grace
When it's shadows pull her gown

But I could never hear the whispers,
Voices cannot reach my room

I live inside my dreams, and dreams
Have locked me in these rooms

I have no sense of time,
Or even night and day. I left my body
Somewhere, somehow it
Just got in the way

I guess I always knew
These rooms would all lead back to you

Jim Carroll,"By jim carroll and lenny kaye

I don't believe in sin
But maybe I'll begin
A vagrant evil's climbing up my skin
The shadows from last week
Are dancing in the street
In homage to the darkness closing in

It's hard to say what's different each new morning
I need some clue to tell me when or where

But it seems I must believe
Night wears it on it's sleeve
A warning that the time's come to prepare . . .

I owe so much to someone
I've watched her teardrops fall
Like wings that melted reaching for the sun

I need her to be near
To clarify the dangers
I didn't come this far to die with strangers

I can't explain exactly what I'm saying
But you're the only reason I still care

But things become so clear
When the spider licks her tears
A warning that the time's come to prepare . . .

I beg you not to leave me
With these warnings in the air . . .
I never thought I'd say it
But for once I'm truly scared

We create every lie
In order to survive
To mirror all the terror in our souls

With nothing left to steal
Lies make our lives seem real
It slows down all the madness like a shield

I don't know why I need to understand it
I don't know if there's anyone who cares

I don't know how or why
It could be something in the sky
That makes it seem it's best to be prepared . . .

I don't know where it will be
Two by land . . . one by sea
Sleep with one eye open
Be prepared

The spectres ride the stallions of my ruin
The shifting of my blood tell me it's soon . . .

I don't know how
Or why . . . it could be
Something in the sky
That makes it seem the time says to beware

Little boy,
Looking at the sky,
Tell me what you see?

Looking at the sky,
Tell me what you see? ? ?

With her filigree design
She summons the fire from her hips
Flamingo blood melts down her lips
But the light would not share her,
From behind the bending mirror, pulling her within,
Like a jealous twin. There was something in her eye
Like a flawed alibi . . . I was just about to ask
When she rips apart her mask

[Refrain]
But me and my girl
Chase the dragon's tail
We double lock the room
We inoculate the moon
And the light glows from below
Tonight, Tonight
She hears the soft drone,
Like a pearly blade laid in silicone . . .
And the reservoir of sleep
Slides through the morning tube
Like a letter written in a dream
That is answered much too soon
And she lays across the sofa like a gold stick pin
Mascara draining down her specious grin, every notion's
Loaded motion laced in BOMBAY GIN . . . and the serpent's
Eyes are bursting as she bites into the skin

(Repeat Refrain)

She leaves a trail of broken things:
Knives . . . Lives . . . and wedding rings
And the candle drips its light
Across the fine silk floor
Someone screams for less
Someone screams for more . . .
But the light would not share her
From behind the bending mirror
Pulling her within
Like a jealous twin
There was something in her eye
Like a flawed alibi
I was just about to ask, I swear,
She ripped apart the mask
But me
And my girl
We chase the dragon's tail
We double lock the room
We inoculate the moon
And the light
Glows
From down below . . . Tonight . . . Tonight",Jealous Twin,1994
Jim Carroll,"I was underneath the staircase
I was talking with my angel
He said that beauty is only terror
You know, when terror is just beginning
I thought I heard some footsteps
Lorraine, she was coming
But she's been feelin' real sick lately
She been kickin' down her habit

So I went around to see her
I had the angel in my pocket
She had jewels between her fingers
And there was blood across Lou's carpet

But I know that she's feelin' better...
I saw her walking to the Market

She went down
The sharp black hole
She wants to die just to save her soul...

But she wants to live
She wants to start her band
She swears the stage is God's left hand

So I'm sitting in the cellar
Beneath my dark apartment
I had the angel on my shoulder
You know, his wings were kinda shattered

He plays with broken mirrors
And he said that he just saw Sally
And that Sally was with Lorraine
And they were playing in the alley

So I went around to see them
Ahhh... they were doing it together

And there was a little blood across the concrete...
I know they were feeling better...

They got straight
They understand
They wanted to die but now they got plans
They want to live; they want to start their band
They swear the stage is God's left hand

I'm waiting in the lobby
The angel dropped the mirror
But he still insists that beauty...
That beauty is just one part of terror

There's a painting on the ceiling
Of a dog . . . he had eyes like rubies,
And then the angel just remembered
That Lorraine was at the movies

I found her in the back aisle
There was blood across the next seat
When she reached out to touch me
I thought that that that was so sweet

So I stuck her with my finger
It was like a knife through leather
She had a song along her eyelid

I know she was feeling better

She got straight
She understand
She wanted to die but now she got plans

She want to live
She want to start her band
She swear the stage is God's left hand...",Lorraine,1994
Jim Carroll,"There's a wind up in the trees
Like a voice that's whispering ""Please""
Someone's decided on dividing
Everything in two 
I'd rip the money in half
I'd even break the staff
But split apart my heart
And there's no room for you 

[Chorus]
Listen, love will always divide
You may not need both sides
It may be empty, it may be full
It's all just push and pull 
The front might be the rear
My poison pet
And you can't be sure which side you get

Come on,
Then make the decision
It's a love division 
All the jealous gestures, the blades of hurt desire
Slit my heart apart
Hear the cries that flow through the wire
They're passing through
They're split in two
I know inside, I can't divide the things I'm sure are true...
But I could take what you break
And make it all seem new 

[Chorus]

Everybody's underground commuting at the speed of sound
Listen what the wheels say
They say: ""Rip apart, rip my heart, rip my heart, 
rip the dark, trip the dark, abattoir...""

Jim Carroll,"They hit you with their papers when you're living 
on loan. They're the ones who say nothing when you
answer the phone. You see them in the alleys when
you're passing late at night, but you tell your friend
to check it and there's no one in sight
I never wanted it
I never asked for it
I surely didn't sleep with them
If the phone rings, don't answer it

Death is their only way to survive
The neck of Anubis strangled by wire

They hold their eyes in their fist
One is fire... one is ice
They roll them across the bed like some loaded dice

7 come 11 but I could not stay
I kissed her eyes on the sheets
I took a bus to yesterday

Their flesh is a cemetery, centuries old...
You are free as a lap dog
Just do what you're told

They wear spandex and gloves
And feed on fetus flesh
They're the fashion rage
Of the empirical age

But I never wanted them
Never asked for them
Didn't sleep with them
Please don't answer it

Death is their only way to get high
The neck of Anubis strangled by wire

They say, ""I'll live for your sins
If you will die for mine...""

They quit before they started their search

I want a world without gravity
It could be just what I need

I'd watch the earth recede

I want to sleep where the angels don't pass
But now my lips are blue
Gravity does it to you

It's like they're pressed against a mirrored glass
I want my will and capability to meet inside the region
Where this gravity don't mean a thing
It's where the angels break through . . .
It's where they bring it to you
It's where silence, silence can teach me to sing

I want to hold you, hold you tight but never touch

I want their gravity to shatter . . . but it really doesn't matter

Jim Carroll Band,"I was born in a pool, they made my mother stand
And I spat on that surgeon and his trembling hand
When I felt the light I was worse than bored
I stole the doctor's scalpel and I slit the cord

Refrain:
I was a Catholic boy,
Redeemed through pain,
Not through joy

I was two months early they put me under glass
I screamed and cursed their children when the nurses passed
Was convicted of theft when I slipped from the womb
They led me straight from my mother to a cell in the Tombs

Repeat Refrain

They starved me for weeks, they thought they'd teach me fear
I fed on cellmates' dreams, it gave me fine ideas
When they cut me loose, the time had served me well
I made allies in heaven, I made comrades in Hell

I was a Catholic child
The blood ran red
The blood ran wild

I make angels dance and drop to their knees
When I enter a church the feet of statues bleed
I understand the fate of all my enemies
Just like Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane

Repeat Refrain

I watched the sweetest psalm stolen by the choir
I dreamed of martyrs' bones hanging from a wire
I make a contribution, I get absolution
I make a resolution to purify my soul

Repeat Refrain

They can't touch me now
I got every sacrament behind me:
I got baptism,
I got communion,
I got penance, 
I got extreme unction
I've got confirmation
'Cause I'm a Catholic child
The blood ran red
The blood ran wild!

Now I'm a Catholic man
I put my tongue to the rail whenever I can.

Jim Carroll Band,"It must be strange to just fall from the stage
and snap a bone that is so close to the brain
And be attended to by so many down below
I saw a doctor tie you up from so far above
And you start singing just like light through a black floor
You start sliding like burned skin to a side door

Refrain:
But crow, when you throw yourself under
Singin's hard when you can't loose control
They don't know, to them in the dark you don't whisper nothin'
And they're all gonna try and rip the wind from your soul

It must have been hard to be a cashier in a bookstore
And to be surrounded by the history of your true loves
And you'd get naked between the deep shelves in the backroom
And have your brain get tan by sharp fluorescent light tubes
And you start spinning like the pillars in the temple
You'd start screaming just like Sister Aimee Semple

But Crow, when you throw yourself under
The streets are hard when you cannot lose control
They don't know, to them the dark don't whisper nothin'
And they're all gonna try and rip the wind from your soul
Crow

It was so sweet when you brought donuts to the junkies
Hey, you'd give us something we'd go slip into our coffee
And we'd start reading lines from poems that didn't matter
You covered me with blankets in the Chelsea Hotel lobby
And I'd start reachin' for the scar along your belly
They'd start takin' us 'cause winning is their hobby

Jim Carroll Band,"You get nothin' back for all you've saved
Just eternity and a spacious grave
She said, ""Nothing is true, everything is permitted""



Things just go from bad to worse
Starts like a kiss and ends like a curse
But nothing's true, she said everything is permitted

She got jewels on her tongue to time the stars
She drives all morning in unmarked cars
But nothing's true, it is all permitted

She got these special tools just to keep things tight
They robbed her eyes long ago of light
But nothing's true, she told me it's all permitted

She got inscrutable poise and nihilist charms
She gets her sleep through tubes in her arm
She said nothing is true, she said everything is permitted

She nods on graves, the marble's cold and white,
Her dreams surround the sun like a satellite
She said nothin' is true, she told me it's all permitted

The spiders [milk?] her thigh, it does not phase her
She cleans her skin with a krypton laser
Nothing is true, everything is permitted

She got heels so high, she got a gown so thin
Her eyes stop the whip before it tames her sin
She says nothin' is true, everything is permitted

Until they perfect the techniques to clone
You all better remember you're all alone
Because nothing is true, she said everything is permitted

And I'd climb up the closet shelf
When I was all by myself
Grab his hat and fix the brim
Pretending I was him

No matter, how hard I try
No matter, how many tears I cry
No matter, how many years go by
I still can't say goodbye

He always took care
Of Mom and me
We all cut down a Christmas tree
He always had some time for me

Wind blows through the trees
Street lights, they still shine bright
Most things are the same
But I miss my dad tonight

I walked by a Salvation Army store
Saw a hat like my daddy wore
Tried it on when I walked in
Still trying to be like him

No matter, how many tears I cry
I still can't say goodbye

Jim Condor,"He came from Kentucky least ways that's what I've been told
Me and fate had left that state before his corpse got cold
He'd been killed for gold hhen California could be sold
To any fool who had been told bbout the Punkin Center Barn Dance

Mama had the fever and my daddy sold his soul
To someone called the devil that he'd met along life's road
Dad would stop to drink a toast and mom was looking like a ghost
Was gonna beat us to the coast and the Punkin Center Barn Dance

At the Punkin Center Barn Dance that's where everyone would be
Dancing to Virginia's reel and the waltz of Tennessee
When the roll is called up yonder you can hear the angels sing
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance God is gold the grass is green

Yeah I left California just before the Grateful Dead
Told the truth about the gold I'd searched for in my head
Like my Dad I'd roamed the land and Mom could never understand
How Lucifer could bring a man to the Punkin Center Barn Dance

Well times are changin' poets say since mom and dad both passed away
But some things in this life will never change
The poets write of things to come the earth will melt into the sun
And you and I will be the ones at the Punkin Center Barn Dance

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk

And the people came from all around

Were slippin' away from home
And puttin' jewelry in hock to take the trip
To go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy who played the

Well he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make it dime

If the total isn't high enough when they figure me
When I grow old if there's no gray from worry in my hair

What do I care just as long as you were mine a little while
When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good miles
What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip
I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips
What do I care if I never have much money
And sometimes my table looks a little bare
Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss

[Mr. Lif]
This is rock bottom why yall, I never expected it
In order to be businesslike you must meet the prerequisite
Leave your culture at home, smile, don't be too proud, too wild
You may suffer, just don't cry out loud
This notion of professionalism is like an exorcism
Forced to give your life away while you're earnin' a livin'
These thoughts had stopped me from rejoinin' the work force
But now the situation I'm in, just seems to hurt more
Maybe it won't be bad, maybe it'll be good
I could use a little structure in my life, maybe I should
Take my suit and tie out of the closet
Try shinin' my shoes and brush the fuckin' dust off of my wallet
Let's consider the prospects, make a couple phone calls
Now so many interviews you know I got next week
I'm strictly goin' from the bottom to the peak
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

[Chorus: Aesop Rock]
Daddy had a name tag that said, ""Busy Working""
Mommy had a milk carton that said, ""Missing Person""
John had a new baseball glove, with nobody to learn with
That's oil and water trying to mix on the same surface

[Mr. Lif]
I got a job at a business place I chose not to name
Ask me how did I achieve this so quick? Yes you may
Back when I was  compiled a stunning resume
I didn't value way back then, but boy it helped today
I'm pushin' every single thought of rebellin' away
I'm workin' real hard, and my pockets are swellin', and hey
Can you believe I met the girl of my dreams, I swear she's meant for me
We've been together over 2 years, goin' on 3
We married on our 4th anniversary
Bought a house and turned a room into a nursery
For the bouncin' baby that we're expecting in June
I sat in that delivery room from noon, to noon
24 hours of labour then the nurse asked me his title for the paper
You know, so the government can chase ya'
First name: John, Last name: Insignificant
I'm smiling like a proud dad; I got the birth certificate
Go to the house and here's my 
And I looked around and nothing's good enough for her or him
So my 8 hour days became 9; 9 slid up to 10; a subtle slip up to 11 and then
And after a 12 hour day, I too little energy to say 'I love you' to my baby
Or play daddy to J, and I thought this was the way 
O be a husband and a father
I guess I could've looked in her eyes, and seen I lost her
But it wasn't my fault, I'm workin' hard, it couldn't be
I've been successfully existing as a member of this family
I was so convinced the household had to always be complete
I didn't realize the only thing that's missing is me

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lif]
There was never any talk of divorce
I can't believe how focused I was in the face of such a huge potential loss
Thought I signed a grievance with the boss
In fact, I was mad at my wife, as if she's trying to knock me off course
But I still visited the florist, to get her flowers
(When the last time I did this?) Hmm, not since our wedding shower
I got home and I was greeted by the fact we'd been deleted
I was someone that my wife and child thought they no longer needed
And before I could say, 'Where's John?'
I looked down and he was clingin' to her arm
I realized-ed that I'm wrong
I blacked out and by the time I came to, they were gone
But somehow I sat and shook my head, and then I carried on
And I still completed 3 weeks of work, before my breakdown
The ambulances came and I got medicine to take now
And it's hard to get a job when you been treated and released
So both my relationship and my career had deceased
It took years to put myself together, piece by piece
And thank God I found a woman that's propitiate with me
And I'll never let this happen again, it's not to be
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

Her partner can't hardly hold her
Because she never gets any older

And the famous singer sang and bowed away
When the stars were gone she screamed and yelled hurray

Five thousand tongues are screaming out ""More"" and ""More""

I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Spinning yarns that were so lyrical

That in the beginning were hard to accept

I put down to experience

Who tried to change my point of view

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so exited.

I was chokin' mad with thirst

Was our good old grinnin', gruntin' Gunga Din

An' he plugged me where I bled
An' he gave me half a pint of water green

I'm most grateful to the one from Gunga Din

To where a dooli lay
An' a bullet came and drilled the beggar clean
He carried me inside
An' just before he died
I hope you like your drink said Gunga Din
So I'll meet him later on
In the place where he as gone
Where it's always double drill and no canteen
He'll be squattin' on the coals
Givin' drink to poor damn souls
I'll catch a swig in hell from Gunga Din

And it's cleaner than the Board of Health""

I head out on the street

Too many years just for one little fight

Is just waitin' to get a convict in his sights

You can bet I'll never stop
Cause I'm goin' home tonight

And at night the walls grow tighter
Do you feel like there's a shackle around your mind? 

Now those guards are on my tail

That they were not the nice kind

Country Sunday mornin's
Dusty haze on summer highways
Sweet magnolia callin'

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
That we were walking in
The Alabama rain

Drive in movies, Friday nights
Drinkin' beer and laughin'
Somehow things were always right
I just don't know what happened

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
When we were walking in
The Alabama rain

We were only kids
But then I've never heard it said
That kids can't fall in love
And feel the same
I can still remember the first time
I told you I love you

On a dusty mid July
Country summer's evenin's
Weepin' willows sang its lullaby
And shared our secret

But now and then I find myself
Thinkin' of the days
That we were walking in
The Alabama rain

Jim Croce,"Don't you know I had a dream last night
That you were here with me
Lyin' by my side so soft and warm
And we talked a while
And shared a smile
And then we shared the dawn
But when I woke up
Oh, my dream it was gone

Don't you know I had a dream last night
You were here with me
Lyin' by my side so soft and warm
And you said you'd thought it over
Said that you were comin' home
But then I woke up
From my dream it was gone

I'm not the same
Can you blame me
Is it hard to understand
I can't forget
You can't change me
I am not that kind of man

Don't you know I had a dream last night
When everything was still
And you were by my side so soft and warm
And I dreamed that we were lovers
In the lemon scented rain
But the I woke up
Oh, I found that again
I had been dreamin'
Dreamin' again
I had been dreamin'
Dreamin' again",Dreamin' Again,1977
Jim Croce,"Well, I know it's kind of late
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I got to say can't wait

Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kind of strange
Every time I'm near you
I just run out of things to say
I know you'd understand
Every time I tried to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Every time the time was right

Jim Croce,"Seems like such a long time ago
I was walking on a lonely road
Getting tired of dreaming alone
Like all the lonely people I have known

Seems like such a long time ago
There was no one who would share my song
I was just a boy far from home
I became a man when you came along

We spent the whole night talking
You said you'd like to see the sunrise
But in the gold of morning
T'was nothing that I had not seen in your eyes

I was so afraid to touch you
Thought you were to young to know
So I just watched you sleeping
Then you woke and said to me
The night is cold it frightens me
I could sleep so easy next to you

Wasn't very long ago
You said that you would like to share my road
Then you started singing my songs
Spent so many nights a waiting
Let's not spend the moments wasting
Time for me has very far to go
I will go if you would take me
I have never had a lover
I am young but I am so alone

But in the gold of morning",A Long Time Ago,1977

All that I have are these
To remember you

Memories that come at night
Take me to another time
Back to a happier day
When I called you mine

But we sure had a good time
When we started way back when
Morning walks and bedroom talks
Oh how I loved you then

Summer skies and lullabies
Nights we couldn't say good-bye
And of all of the things that we knew
Not a dream survived

And you were looking for a friend

After all your nighttime lovers had gone
The way they came
Someone who knew the way
To help you play
Your daytime game
It's not the same

Well, I started out pretending
That I ought to mean enough to you
To make you want to change
Then I came to realize
That there was just too much of you
You had to rearrange

And I couldn't bear to wait around
For all your nighttime lovers to go
The way they came
And it came to hurt too much for me
To have to play your daytime games

Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone

But I fell in love last Friday evenin'
With a girl I saw on a bar room TV screen
Well I was just gettin' ready to get my hat
When she caught my eye and I put it back
And I ordered myself a couple o' more shots and beers

[Chorus]
The night (you know) that I fell in love with a Roller Derby Queen
(Round 'n' round, oh round 'n' round) 
The meanest hunk o' woman
That anybody ever seen
Down in the arena

She is a five foot six and two fifteen 
A bleached-blonde mama with a streak of mean
She knew how to knuckle
And she knew how to scuffle and fight
And the roller derby program said
That she were built like a 'fridgerator with a head
The fans called her ""Tuffy""
But all her buddies called her ""Spike""

[Chorus]

Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round 
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round
Round 'n' round, go round 'n' round

Well I could not help it but to fall in love
With this heavy-duty woman I been speakin' of
Things looked kind of bad
Until the day she skated into my life

Well she might be nasty she might be fat
But I never met a person who would tell her that
She's my big blonde bomber
My heavy handed Hackensack mama

That bred the mighty men
That we read about and we dream about
The men who built this land
And the farmers and the lumbermen
And the men who work the mills
And the poor hard workin' miners
Who died inside the hill

[Chorus]
While the rivers that flow
Are the blood of our land
And the trucks they keep rumbling
On the great concrete band
And the railroads keep pushin'
To be all they once were
And nature is calling
No one's listening to her

And the immigrants by the boat load in a dozen different tongues
Sang of freedom in the new land
Climb the ladder rung by rung
Some to Boston, some to Pittsburgh
Philadelphia and St. Paul
And the old ways led to new days
They were welcome one and all

[Chorus]

With the railroads and the riverboats
And the breadlines far behind
And the days we sang together long gone but still in mind
And the men who came before us
Men who brought us to today
And the story still unravels from the dreams of yesterday

Nothing seems to be the same
Have we forgotten all the things we knew

Things don't seem to be the same no matter how I tried
There's no rhythm to the rain
Wind still whispers through the leaves on high
But they no longer sing your name

We got to find the answer, let the secrets fly
Enough of telling stories and our well meaning lies
We got to try to build what we had in the past
Trying's half the battle if we lose it, we can't last

I heard myself just say the things, I could never say before
And listen to the rhythm of the rain
Wind just whispered through the leaves on high
And I thought, I heard them sing your name

I'm gonna make up for all of the hurt I brought
I'm gonna love away all your pain

And no more empty nights
'Cause tomorrow mornin' everything will turn out right

Well, there's something that I've got to tell you
Yes I've got something on my mind
But words come hard
When your lying in my arms
And when I'm looking deep into your eyes
But there's truth and consolation
And what I'm trying to say
Is that nobody ever had a rainbow baby
Until he had the rain

It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day
It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day 
It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna be a brighter day

Christmas cards you sent to me
All that I have are these
To remember you

Memories that come at night
Take me to another time
Back to a happier day
When I called you mine

But we sure had a good time
When we started way back when
Morning walks and bedroom talks
Oh how I loved you then

Summer skies and lullabies
Nights we couldn't say good-bye
And of all of the things that we knew
Not a dream survived

Photographs and memories
All the love you gave to me
Somehow it just can't be true

I'd sit by the tracks on a long summer day
And I'd wave at the brakesman
And he'd wave back at me
While the thunderclouds rolled
Out of East Tennessee

But the dreams of a boy disappear when you're grown
And though I may dream, the railroads are gone
The ties they are rotten
And the tracks shot to hell
Along with my dreams and the old railroad bell

In my dreams I ride the rails to California
Workin' diners and farms along the way
Or I'd hop a ride to hide across the border
With a black eyed girl beside me all the way

Now the mountains are silent
And the railroads are gone
And the coal towns no longer hear the miners at dawn
But the train whistle shrills out her memories to me
While the thunderclouds roll out of East Tennessee

Tinseled afternoons
And the sidewalk bands that play their songs
Slightly out of tune

And oo that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her

'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

Big dreams make big stars
Don't forget who you are
Although I live for today

[Mr. Mo]
I ain't ???? I'm ????
???? bed dream
On the camera scene know what I mean
Get the bitch out your blood stream
See the green make some niggaz cake
Some buy a house on the lake
I'm a cheapskate like chocolate shake
And an ???? for the bath tub like the last love
Hundred and twenty seconds of that ????
Begging me to do whatever I would when I could
And I should but I can't in the hood a nigga ain't
Is it wood is or is it paint
Can't thaink because of the drank
Because of the cheese
Naw it's the jeans won't let her breath
These dollars keep burning quicker than the weed
Nigga please I take it day by day
Day by day

[Polow]
{Talking}
Hey what's up nigga
Damn you don' came up boy
Remember you used to play in the marching band
You was a nerd nigga

{Rap}
Now you was lame growing up you ain't had no hoes in high school
Niggas used to take your shoes at the swimming pool
Used to kick it with the bustaz in the marching band
But you was wicked with the flute so you kept playin'
You got your first big machine when you was sixteen
Now the record label say you on fire like a kerosene
Money changed the scene
Oh you a star now
Got yourself a hundred thousand dollar car now
Damn you big time you don' came up
Go to the strip club every night get your thang sucked
Changed up your bifocals to Versace shades
But you still that lame nigga from the tenth grade
You bitch made and you can't hide that for moneyz
And them hoez got you putting snow in your nose
You dummy, but hey it's just a phase that you goin' through
You think you got it made if you only knew

Chorus x2

[Cutty Cartel]
Picture perfect our stylez
For those who rumor
Only leaving themselves blind to see if you ask me
Should be drug on concrete
Thus few less with heart
Then not to repeat buddy you weak
How it start as an art
A ritual that hasn't evolved
I say y'all meaning you
Check em like some girls
Coming from lunch on be	 hall
Telling your buddies 'bout who you do
Your self help from school like it's cool
You talk too much
You told my girl who I'm drilling and cutting
Yet it's all for nuthing
Still ain't got to deal with that shit
Fuck pain and suffering 
I got to get it and get more
Politic connect with the next
To get this Jim Crow shit jumping like some sex
I'm hot flesh I see y'all niggaz hating cause we fresh
Some expose yourself lollygaggers and coat checkers
Pay your fare cause I just can't share it's all there

Chorus fade",Big Dreams,1999
Jim Crow,"now i don worried fo da last time

One of these days
And it won't be long
You'll look for me
And I'll be goin' home
Gotta hold on
Gotta be strong
'cause people don't live that long no more

Now I been off in the cut
I wish I knew from the git
Plenty money on the table
But this thang is a bitch
And can't see nothin
See you blind as hell
This change that I got
Don't mean shit if we don't sell
Forget what ya tell, Playboy
Lookin forward to buyin my momma a crib
And tell it like it is
That's the deal
Decatur been hea'
Stay down what ya feel
I miss my boy every damn day, for real
Seem like last week that ?????? was here
At the crib gettin blown
Damn, I wish I knowned
How this woulda turned out
To have a nigga stressin
I'm prayin every night to thank the Lord for my blessin
Confessin to change, just ain't the same
When it's me
That's hard as steel
I had to lose my folk to see
Resevoirs run dry where ya knees don't bend
I could poor a fifth of Hen
But it ain't enough in the end, 'cause

Hook

Look around
How many people here
How many people gone
How many times you done sang that song
It's so hard to say goodbye
That's what we say when the kinfolks die
My homeboy Twain
Oh, he goin through a thang
So let it be known
When momma gone, shit gon' change
I feel his pain
But it don't rain, everyday
Everybody got a life to live
Some choose to play
But regardless how ya live it
Man, we all got to give it
Ain't no need to fight it
Just let God handle his business
Can I get a witness, ha?
I know sometimes I call girls hoes
And I be cussin when I'm bustin my flows
I try to tighten up
But dollar signs keep lightin up
In front of my face
And I can taste it so I'm on this paper chase
Waistin, my precious time
Tryin to paste my grime
Unaware of the finish line
Niggas dyin, 'cause

Hook

Now my past is gone
And my future ain't shit
Might as well hit a lick, 'cause time tick
And split second decisions decide if I live or die
Forever rest face to the sky
Life is like a motor burnin out
You done heard it word a mouth
And in the south everyday a title bout
Between myself and I
Eye to eye without a clue
If it angers me it endangers you
To the point where you got to smoke a joint
'Cause you frustrated
Cussin out the girl you was datin
Nigga, that girl trippin, leave her
She feed you good, keep her
Or smokin on this reefer
I teach her, how to be seen and not be seen
The phone ring, broad tryna' sell me dreams
It's just a fling, but some, don't understand
Some, won't understand
Hash in the hand better than ass in the jean
I gotta get the cheese by any means necassary
Bullshit done got my cousin buried
The way ya carry, done got his life took
The love of money niggas get hooked
Quicker than crack
And that's a fact you find in no book
And you can sho' look
But you won't find none
Life's a card game with no shuffle
I got the bad hand, tryna' bluff
Touchin pain, flushin shit down the drain
Train ya girl to run trains
Now who to blame?

Split a check firt a real man Chula furs
Try to make it home but he struck on third

Down to lie for the baby, in a ride like y'all
To many ladies is jealous of the Mercedes
And how close we are lately, that's why I don't like broads
Either you chickens like all in the business
Asking y'all who did it, them inquiring type broads
Intimidated cause I could be the misses
But I'm like a little sister and I'm tired of liking y'all
I only ride shot gun cause it's rightful
Make her hope in the back just to be fightful
Just because I know it's tight when my eyes closed
Just as soon as these niggas drop me off she gone be out though
Both times I co-signed the whole nine
Proved to be ya third eye when you go blind
Know I'm, Miss Cha Cha sadiddy
Off the top and many, pop them any
And the Crow out to get him

We in the middle of the streets, it's midnight
You got a problem wit me my nigga, then get right
But sit tight, hold on I got shit up on my mind
And every time I rhyme I represent niggas that grind
And I find that these gold digging hoes, they out to get a nigga
Fuck up my foes and enemies, I'm bout to hit a nigga
Let a nigga mettle wit not cheddar, will I kill a nigga?
Just because he jealous of the fellas got him drinking liquor
Thinking that a nigga is slipping, but I ain't shorty
Damn what you keep money for?
In the bank shorty, (Wanna get some)
Well I can't doubt it, might as well forget about it
Lot of folk talk I'm talking shit about him
Jack move, get up out it
When we pull the ball out to test, so bitch I been bout it
Mama said attend college
Make it big, my friends doubt it
In 5 years I'm gone buy myself about 10 houses
Get chin from 10 shorties at the same time
Jump in my whip, hit the strip then shine

Jim Cuddy,"Walk along with me for just awhile
This town can beat you down
It's mile after lonely mile
With so many faces and unfamiliar places every day

I started out, I came here all alone
Now win or lose I know I never can go home
'Cause they'll laugh while they're drinking
And say what were you thinking anyway

Down into the hole that I just finished crawling out of
I'm down on my knees
I will keep watching
I will keep waiting to see
I will keep waiting right here to see

I spent a little time out west
A year in Calgary
Tried to go up north, but that was not the job for me
No I'm made for the city, and it's right here in the city I will be

Help me, help me, I think I'm falling
Down into the hole that I just finished crawling out of
I'm down on my knees
I will keep watching
I will keep waiting to see
I will keep waiting right here to see

I met a ballerina in the market by the sea
She told me it was complicated but she wasn't free
I said I'm right here beside you if you ever change your mind
And want to be

Help me, help me, I think I'm falling
Down into the hole that I just finished crawling out of
I'm down on my knees
Waiting til somebody
Somebody takes the best of me

Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so

When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms

With inspiration, in your arms

Why shouldn't we surrender

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

Hear the tuba play that 'Oom Pah Pah'
Oh my, ain't it driving you crazy?
Don't you be so darn lazy
Better hurry and join that big parade

Up outta your seat, down off-a the stand
Step out to the sweet, beat  the bugle plays
A sound that you'll remember all your days
And when you see that leader proudly raise his hand
Just follow the band

Hear the trumpet blast, heat the cornet blare
Hear the boom of the bass and the rattle of the snare
With the sweetest burst of melody I know goes the piccolo

Hear the silver tone of the xylophone
Hear the glide and the bellow of the slide trombone
Then a burst of crystal, listen to it peel, it's the glockenspiel

With the most majestic manner
You'll remember all your life
Comes mellophone, comes saxophone
Comes sousaphone, comes fife

Then the brass sings out the woodwinds sigh
The trumpets shout and the drums reply
With a crash and a bang as the whole she bang goes by

See the pretty lady toss that baton high

Watch the fella with the big base drum go by

And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red

The silver gray of [Incomprehensible] the dappled green of trees
Amber of a wheat field, hazel of a seed
Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Jim Dandy,"If you believe, I mean really believe
Follow me and find your way back through
Time
From the power I possess I can see through
The maze
I can see man's progress cause earth's
Dyin days
But if we go back to nature and live in 
The wilderness
Just another animal pure, earth'id live
Longer and we'd live less

Why do we need to live to be so old
When we could live free to die young and
Bold
Man is an animal gone mad
Yes he's turned into a monster
Our generation is his offspring
Yes mutants of the monster

My power is magic
From a wish on a star
Yea earning the wish is karmic
To help what good spirits there still are

But when you've been granted the
Privilege of bein heard
Yea take great care with this power and
Watch every word
For when you know someone's listenin
Your words can mean a great deal yea
They can be the key to magic thoughts
Havin never been revealed

Why do we need to live to be so old
When we could live free to die young and

We're mutants of the monster

No one to talk to I got no telephone

I know the road I must take, with a wink of my eye
I leave old friends behind like old alibi
I take all they throw against me I make a stand
For truth and justice and for the common man

Jim Dickinson,"On the outskirts of town, there's a little night spot 
Dan dropped in about five o'clock 
Took off his jacket, said, the night is short 
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart 

He hollered, rave on, children, I'm with you 
Rave on, cats, he cried 
It's almost dawn, the cops are gone 
Let's all get Dixie fried 

Well, Dan got happy and he started raving 
He pulled out a razor, but he wasn't shaving 
And all the cats knew to jump and hop

They all ran in to see what it was about 
And I heard him holler as they led him away

He hollered, rave on, children, I'm with you

It's almost dawn, the cops are gone

He let us all know, he wasn't scared of the law

By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her

When the stars seem to shine

I swear that I love you

Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me

Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you

Cactus lovelier than orchids blooming in the patio

When setting sun says the long day is done sweet music starts to fill the air

He loved someone who loved him too
Who walks with him alone in memories
