George Beverly Shea,"Shackled by a heavy burden,
'Neath a load of guilt and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same

He touched me, oh He touched me,
And oh the joy that floods my soul!
Something happened and now I know,
He touched me and made me whole

Since I met this blessed Savior,
Since He cleansed and made me whole,
I will never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls

He touched me, oh He touched me,
And oh the joy that floods my soul!
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole",He Touched Me,2008
George Beverly Shea,"The love of God has been extended
To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

The love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Oh, the love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

His power is eternal, eternal
His glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love Of God, precious love of God",The Love of God,2011
George Beverly Shea,"Packing up the dreams God planted
In the fertile soil of you
Can't believe the hopes He's granted
Means a chapter in your life is through
But we'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

And friends are friends forever 
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say never
'Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends

With the faith and love God's given
Springing from the hope we know
We will pray the joy you'll live in
Is the strength that now you show
But we'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

And friends are friends forever 
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say never
'Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends

And friends are friends forever 
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say never
'Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends
No, a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends",Friends,2012
George Bogosian,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight

George Bohanon,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,2007
George Bohanon,"You sigh and the song begins
You speak and I hear violins
It's magic
(It's magic)

The stars desert the skies
And rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic
(It's magic)

Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland
Oh, it's magic
(It's magic)

How else can I explain
Those rainbows when there is no rain?
It's magic, why do I tell myself
These things that happen
Are all really true

When within my heart I know
The magic is my love for you?
Why do I tell myself
These things that happen
Are all really true

When within my heart I know
The magic is my love for you?

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

George Brassen,"Je ne suis pas du tout l'antéchrist de service,
j'ai même pour jésus et pour son sacrifice
un brin d'admiration, soit dit sans ironie,
car ce n'est sûrement pas une sinécure,
non, que de se laisser cracher à la figure
par la canaille et la racaille réunies.
bien sûr, il est normal que la foule révère
ce héros qui jadis partit pour aller faire
l'alpiniste avant l'heure en haut du golgotha,
en portant sur l'épaule une croix accablante,
en méprisant l'insulte et le remonte-pente,
et sans aucun bravo qui le réconfortât !
bien sûr, autour du front, la couronne d'épines,
l'éponge trempée dans dieu sait quelle bibine,
et les clous enfoncés dans les pieds et les mains,
c'est très inconfortable et ça vous tarabuste,
même si l'on est brave et si l'on est robuste,
et si le paradis est au bout du chemin.
bien sûr, mais il devait défendre son prestige,
car il était le fils du ciel, l'enfant prodige,
il était le messie et ne l'ignorait pas.
entre son père et lui, c'était l'accord tacite :
tu montes sur la croix et je te ressuscite !
on meurt de confiance avec un tel papa.
il a donné sa vie sans doute mais son zèle
avait une portée quasi universelle
qui rendait le supplice un peu moins douloureux.
il savait que, dans chaque église, il serait tête
d'affiche et qu'il aurait son portrait en vedette,
entouré des élus, des saints, des bienheureux.
en se sacrifiant, il sauvait tous les hommes.
du moins le croyait-il ! au point où nous en sommes,
on peut considérer qu'il s'est fichu dedans.
le jeu, si j'ose dire, en valait la chandelle.
bon nombre de chrétiens et même d'infidèles,
pour un but aussi noble, en feraient tout autant.
cela dit je ne suis pas l'antéchrist de service.",L' Antechrist,1998
George Brassen,"Jadis la mineure

Au moindre faux pas

Tu sois vierge et sage
Fidèle à l'usage

Malgré les exemples

Avec leur crécelle
Au bout de leurs doigts

De ce que tu gardes

George Brassen,"Je chante la petite guerre
Des braves enfants de naguère
Qui sur la plage ont bataillé
Pour sauver un château de sable
Et ses remparts infranchissables
Qu'une vague allait balayer

J'en étais : l'arme à la bretelle
Retranchés dans la citadelle
De pied ferme nous attendions
Une cohorte sarrasine
Partie de la côte voisine
A l'assaut de notre bastion

A cent pas de là sur la dune
En attendant que la fortune
Des armes sourie aux vainqueurs
Languissant d'être courtisées
Nos promises, nos fiancées
Préparaient doucement leur cur

Tout à coup l'Armada sauvage
Déferla sur notre rivage
Avec ses lances, ses pavois
Pour commettre force rapines
Et même enlever nos Sabines
Plus belles que les leurs, ma foi

La mêlée fut digne d'Homère
Et la défaite bien amère
A l'ennemi pourtant nombreux
Qu'on battit à plate couture
Qui partit en déconfitur
En déroute, en sauve-qui-peut

Oui, cette horde de barbares
Que notre fureur désempare
Fit retraite avec ses vaisseaux
En n'emportant pour tous trophées
Moins que rien, deux balles crevées
Trois raquettes, quatre cerceaux

Après la victoire fameuse
En chantant l'air de ""Sambre et Meuse""
Et de la ""Marseillaise"", ô gué
On courut vers la récompense
Que le joli sexe dispense
Aux petits héros fatigués

Tandis que tout bas à l'oreille
De nos Fanny, de nos Mireille
On racontait notre saga
Qu'au doigt on leur passait la bague
Surgit une espèce de vague
Que personne ne remarqua

Au demeurant ce n'était qu'une
Vague sans amplitude aucune
Une vaguelette égarée
Mais en atteignant au rivage
Elle causa plus de ravages
De dégâts qu'un raz-de-marée

Expéditive, la traîtresse
Investit notre forteresse
La renversant, la détruisant
Adieu donjon, tours et courtines
Que quatre gouttes anodines
Avaient effacés en passant

A quelque temps de là nous sommes
Allés mener parmi les hommes
D'autres barouds plus décevants
Allés mener d'autres campagnes
Où les châteaux sont plus d'Espagne
Et de sable qu'auparavant

Quand je vois lutter sur la plage
Des soldats à la fleur de l'âge
Je ne les décourage pas
Quoique je sache, ayant naguère
Livré moi-même cette guerre
L'issue fatale du combat

Je sais que malgré leur défense
Leur histoire est perdue d'avance
Mais je les laisse batailler
Pour sauver un château de sable
Et ses remparts infranchissables
Qu'une vague va balayer",Les Chateaux de Sable,1998
George Brassen,"Honte à cet effronté qui peut chanter pendant
Que Rome brûle, elle brûle tout l' temps
Honte à qui malgré tout fredonne des chansons
A Gavroche, à Mimi Pinson

En mille neuf cent trente-sept, que faisiez-vous mon cher ?
J'avais la fleur de l'âge et la tête légère
Et l'Espagne flambait dans un grand feu grégeois
Je chantais, et j'étais pas le seul, ""y a d' la joie""

Et dans l'année quarante, mon cher que faisiez-vous ?
Les Teutons forçaient la frontière, et comme un fou
Et comme tout un chacun, vers le sud, je fonçais
En chantant ""tout ça, ça fait d'excellents Français""

Honte à cet effronté qui peut chanter pendant
Que Rome brûle, elle brûle tout l' temps
Honte à qui malgré tout fredonne des chansons
A Gavroche, à Mimi Pinson

A l'heure de Pétain, à l'heure de Laval
Que faisiez-vous mon cher, en plein dans la rafale ?
Je chantais, et les autres ne s'en privaient pas
""Bel ami"", ""Seul ce soir"", ""J'ai pleuré sur tes pas""

Mon cher, un peu plus tard, que faisait votre glotte
Quand en Asie ça tombait comme à Gravelotte ?
Je chantais, il me semble, ainsi que tout un tas
De gens, ""Le déserteur"", ""Les croix"", ""Quand un soldat""

Honte à cet effronté qui peut chanter pendant
Que Rome brûle, elle brûle tout l' temps
Honte à qui malgré tout fredonne des chansons
A Gavroche, à Mimi Pinson

Que faisiez-vous mon cher au temps de l'Algérie
Quand Brel était vivant, qu'il habitait Paris ?
Je chantais, quoique désolé par ces combats
""La valse à mille temps"" et ""Ne me quitte pas""

Le feu de la ville éternelle est éternel
Si Dieu veut l'incendie, il veut les ritournelles
A qui fera-t-on croir' que le bon populo
Quand il chante quand même, est un parfait salaud ?

George Brassen,"Tous les brummel, les dandys, les gandins,
il les considérait avec dédain
faisant peu cas de l'élégance il s'habillait
toujours au décrochez-moi-ça.
au combat, pour s'en servir de liquette,
sous un déluge d'obus, de roquettes,
il conquit un oriflamme teuton.
cet acte lui valut le grand cordon.
mais il perdit le privilège de
s'aller vêtir à la six-quatre-deux,
car ça la fout mal saperlipopette
d'avoir des faux plis, des trous à ses bas,
de mettre un ruban sur la salopette.
la légion d'honneur ça pardonne pas.
l'âme du bon feu maistre jehan cotart
se réincarnait chez ce vieux fêtard.
tenter de l'empêcher de boire un pot
c'était ni plus ni moins risquer sa peau.
un soir d'intempérance, à son insu,
il éteignit en pissotant dessus
un simple commencement d'incendie.
on lui flanqua le mérite, pardi !
depuis que n'est plus vierge son revers,
il s'interdit de marcher de travers.
car ça la fout mal d’ se rendre dans les vignes,
dites du seigneur, faire des faux pas
quand on est marqué du fatal insigne.
la légion d'honneur ça pardonne pas.
grand peloteur de fesses convaincu,
passé maître en l'art de la main au cul,
son dada c'était que la femme eût le
bas de son dos tout parsemé de bleus.
en vue de la palper d'un geste obscène,
il a plongé pour sauver de la seine
une donzelle en train de se noyer,
dame ! aussi sec on vous l'a médaillé.
ce petit hochet à la boutonnière
vous le condamne à de bonnes manières.
car ça la fout mal avec la rosette,
de tâter, flatter, des filles les appas
la louche au valseur ; pas de ça lisette !
la légion d'honneur ça pardonne pas.
un brave auteur de chansons malotru
avait une tendance à parler cru,
bordel de dieu, con, pute, et caetera
ornaient ses moindres tradéridéras.
sa muse un soir d'un derrière distrait
pondit, elle ne le fit pas exprès,
une rengaine sans gros mots dedans,
on vous le chamarra tambour battant.
et maintenant qu'il porte cette croix,
proférer merde il n'en a plus le droit.
car ça la fout mal de mettre à ses lèvres
de grand commandeur, des termes trop bas,
d’ chanter l' grand vicaire et les trois orfèvres.
la légion d'honneur ça pardonne pas.",La Legion d' Honneur,1998
George Brassen,"Sauf dans le cas fréquent, hélas
Où ce sont de vrais dégueulasses
On ne devrait perdre jamais
Ses père et mère, bien sûr, mais

A moins d'être un petit malin
Qui meurt avant d'être orphelin
Ou un infortuné bâtard
Ça vous pend au nez tôt ou tard

Quand se drapant dans un linceul
Ses parents le laissent tout seul
Le petit orphelin, ma foi
Est bien à plaindre toutefois

Sans aller jusqu'à décréter
Qu'il devient un enfant gâté
Disons que dans son affliction
Il trouve des compensations

D'abord au dessert aussitôt
La meilleure part du gâteau
Et puis plus d'école pardi
La semaine aux quatre-jeudis

On le traite comme un pacha
A sa place on fouette le chat
Et le trouvant très chic en deuil
Les filles lui font des clins d'œil

Il serait par trop saugrenu
D'énumérer par le menu
Les faveurs et les passe-droits
Qu'en l'occurrence on lui octroie

Tirant même un tel bénéfice
En perdant leurs parents, des fils
Dénaturés regrettent de
N'en avoir à perdre que deux

Hier j'ai dit à un animal
De flic qui me voulait du mal
Je suis orphelin, savez-vous?
Il me répondit Je m'en fous

J'aurais eu quarante ans de moins
Je suis sûr que par les témoins
La brute aurait été mouchée
Mais ces lâches n'ont pas bougé

Aussi mon enfant si tu dois
Être orphelin, dépêche-toi
Tant qu'à perdre tes chers parents
Petit, n'attends pas d'être grand

L'orphelin d'âge canonique
Personne ne le plaint bernique
Et pour tout le monde il demeure
Orphelin de la onzième heure

Celui qui a fait cette chanson
A voulu dire à sa façon
Que la perte des vieux est par fois
Perte sèche, blague à part

Avec l'âge c'est bien normal
Les plaies du cœur guérissent mal
Souventes fois même, salut
Elles ne se referment plus

George Brassen,"Calme, confortable, officiel

Sa petite résurrection

Les vieux morts, les vieux ""ici-gît""

Insistèrent pour qu'il revînt
Sur sa décision mais en vain

L'ayant astiquée, il remit
Sur pied sa vieille anatomie
Et tout pimpant, tout satisfait
Prit la clef du champ de navets

Chez lui s'en étant revenu
Son chien ne l'a pas reconnu
Et lui croque en deux coups de dents
Un des os les plus importants

En guise de consolation
Pensa faire une libation
Boire un coup de vin généreux
Mais tous ses tonneaux sonnaient creux

Quand dans l'alcôve il est entré
Embrasser sa veuve éplorée
Il jugea d'un simple coup d'il
Qu'elle ne portait plus son deuil

Il la trouve se réchauffant
Avec un salaud de vivant
Alors chancelant dans sa foi
Mourut une seconde fois

Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
'cause it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
""What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
guaranteed, we can fuck em both on the spot""
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill
I want to let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
'cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I want to buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
""Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day""
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you

The lovely presents you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,

You put me up on a throne

Always thought it'd be the same
But leaving I'm still believing

That childhood dream I'll have someday
Slowly starts to fade away

So very close I could almost taste
Seems those years have been a waste
Decieving it's been decieving

Time has past but I still feel
The ocean breeze it seems so real
I'm hoping, just hoping
Someday soon if it all works out
Nova Scotia is where I'm bound
Believing, I'm still believing
I'll hear the waves against the shore
Seagulls cries at the fishing warf
I'm hearing
The mackerel runs and the dory boats
The simple ways I love the most
I'm dreamin' just dreamin'

I see her when I close my eyes
The Scotia land I once despised
Longing, just longing
It's been ten years or more it seems
But I've still got my memories
I'm holdin', just holding
Through the years I've wondered why
The grass seemed greener on the other side
But I'm learning
When I set my feet on that Scotia ground
Then I know I've surely found
The meaning, the meaning

Well it don't matter where I go
'Cause in my heart my Scotia home is waitin'
Just waiting
Good Lord knows I regret the day
I packed it up and moved away

They're hangin' lights in the trees downtown

Couldn't measure his love

Her colors are all wasted here

And the dream that I was lost in slips away
Of a young son and his mama so innocent back then
Would she even recognize her boy today

And I've spilled blood, with these two hands
And in my heart I wish I could believe
That who I was, is who I am

I've crossed mountains, hills, and valleys
From sea to shining sea, barren sands to blinding snow
I held my brother as he laid dying
Beside me in some field, said a prayer, and let him go

And I have fought into the darkness
And I've spilled blood, with these two hands
And in my heart I wish I could believe
That who I was, is who I am

Would you make a speech that would

Would you be the Babe, pointin' that bat

Maybe Moses, partin' the waters
Saying, ""Children follow me""

Kicked off in Indiana, no idea where he was

Took him by the hand, said, ""Boy, now you listen.""

She could tell he had a good heart 
She said, ""I don't know where I'm going.""
He said, ""I've been where you are.""

She could wait to share the good news
When a drunk driver stopped her out on route '62
Not knowing where to turn, he left that cemetery
Trying to out run the pain that he couldn't bury
He ran out of gas beside a little country church 
And through an open window he heard these words

Don't need much more than what you got on
Come on, let's get gone

Say goodbye to your daddy and bye to your mama

Leave the bills and the worry
And the fuss and the hurry behind

George Canyon,"Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

",Ring of Fire,2007
George Canyon,"He looked down into her brown eyes
Said,""Say a prayer for me""
She threw her arms around him
Whispered, ""God will keep us free""

They could hear the riders comin'
He said,""This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive""

There were seven Spanish Angels
At the alter of the sun
They were prayin' for the lovers
In the valley of the gun

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish Angels
Took another angel home

She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smokin' in his hand
She said, ""Father, please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""

And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
Her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again

There were seven Spanish Angels
At the alter of the sun
They were prayin' for the lovers
In the valley of the gun

When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish Angels
Took another angel home

George Canyon,"My little boy came to me last night
He said ""daddy, I wish I could drive that big old truck""
Just like you
You can stay up as late as you want
Watch t.v all night long
Nobody tell you what to do

I know I'm everything he just can't wait to be
But if it was up to me

I'd ride my bike down the old dirt path
Hands in the air going way to fast
Make the morning last all afternoon
In a tire swing over Beaver Creek
Man that water was cold and deep
Lie on the bank and stare up into the blue
Ya son I wanna be just like you

He said ""dad when you going to take me to work?""
I said let's stay here and play tonka trucks
Trade baseball cards
He wants to travel the world like me
Ya, I'd rather stay home, climb a big ol'tree
Catch fireflies, in a mason jar

He's just a breath away from standing in my shoes
But if I could stand in his, here's what I'd do

I'd ride my bike down the old dirt path
Hands in the air going way to fast
Make the morning last all afternoon
Sit around and make up silly songs
Build sandcastles all day long
Eat candy bars and watch cartoons
Ya son I wanna be just like you

I look down at him with a smile in my eye
I can see myself standing by my fathers side

I'd ride my bike down the old dirt path
Hands in the air going way to fast
Make the morning last all afternoon
In a tire swing over Beaver Creek
Man that water was cold and deep
Lie on the bank and stare up into the blue
Ya son I wanna be just like you

George Canyon,"Now, who'd of thought, we'd end up this way,
Talkin' to each other, like the enemy
There's really only three words, I should say
But even if I did, would you hear them any way

We should have read the signs
We could have made more time
Why was I so blind
To what was out in front of me

I never thought I'd be the last to know
I never thought you'd be the first to go
Forever never lasts too long enough for us to have a chance to hold

So take me by the hand I'm on my knees
Together we will stand now I believe
Somewhere in that plan there's gotta be 
A second chance for you and me.

There was a time when we made history
But the dream we tried to keep became the casualty.
We traded paradise for misery
What was once a house of love, is now a battlefield

It's not about what we want 
It's all about holdin' on

I never thought I'd be the first to cry
This doesn't have to be our last goodbye
Forever's gonna wait just long enough for us 
To fight for one more try

So take me by the hand I'm on my knees
Together we will stand now I believe

We fly, we fall, we run we crawl
We laugh, we cry
Can't stay alive between the lone
And goodbye
So we win some, we lose some
We lonesome

How easy it would be
To close her eyes and
Just let go just let go

But I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration

So evil girl, if one of us has a date
With the undertaker, which one will it be?
You can cry  forever, but you'll get no sympathy
This is the best day of my life

George Clinton,"So wide you can't get around it 
So low you can't get under it 
So high you can't get over it 
Can't get over it 

Ready or not  here we come 
Getting down for the one which we believe in 

Nineteen ninety three much more be ounce 
Ice Cube comin' with the half ounce 
Not just knee deep jeep fulla' smog 
Atomic dog 
Like your behind  heard it through the grapevine 
How much longer will you be mine? 
And I'ma tell ya, I don't like drama 
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama? 
'cause nothin' but did her damn boogie with my crew 
But I'd rather be with you, boo 
And make you say humdrum, Tweedledee dumb 
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, fuckin' hicks 
One nation under a groove gettin' down for the funk of it 
Tear the roof of this mother like we did last night son 
And hit you with the bop gun 

Here's my chance to dance my way 
Out of my constriction 
Gonna be freakin' up and down 
Hang up really late 
The groove I only got 
Wish you all be moved 
Ready or not, here we come 
Gettin' down for the one which we believe in 

One nation under a groove 
Gettin' down just for the funk of it 
One nation and we're on the move 
Nothin' can stop us now 

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys 
Playin' with our toys 
M-1, 'cause everybody's gotta have fun 
Under the sun, under the sun 
So rough, so tough when I get down 
The disco fiend with the monster sound 
I wants to get (whistle) when I'm chillin'
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in 
You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best 
Comin' from the west 
Kickin' them hits 
We occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips 
Hittin' them dips, cd skips but I'm straight 
As I bounce, rock, skate 
Now I'll toast to that 
If it's rough, make the girls say ""Do that stuff! Aw do that 
Stuff!"" 
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week 
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun 

One nation under a groove 
Gettin' down just for the funk of it 
One nation and we're on the move 
Nothin' can stop us now 
One nation under a groove 
Gettin' down just for the funk of it 
One nation and we're on the move 
Nothin' can stop us now 

Do not attempt to adjust your radio 
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong 
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride 
As the buffalo girl go round the outside 
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip 
Got Dayton's on the mother ship 
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass 
The doja on the left hand side for the sale 
'cause nobody knows where the nose goes 
When the ? dog child got the 
Lookin' for the theme from the Black Hole 
Now I'll big bang you with my black pole 
A flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike 
Just made bail tonight 
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail? 
I'm gonna have some fun with the bop gun

Bang them other fools cuz them busters don't know me

Yeah, I was born and raised in the ways of a ridah
Representin mines to be a true Eastsidah

Pop, niggas drop once I pops the clip in
Pimp wearin khaki suits and stacy biscuits
And known like Capone to them gangsta bitches
Keep em workin somethin everywhere we go
Either dope or the stroll if the bitch is a hoe
West coast to the fullest but I bang the east

So, low you can't get under it
So, high you can't get over it
I, can't get over it

Ready or not, here we come
Getting down for the one which we believe in

1993, much more bounce
Ice cube comin' with the half ounce
Not just knee deep, jeep fulla smog
Atomic dog
Like ya behind, heard it through the grapevine
How much longer will you be mine?
And I'ma tell ya, I don't like drama
So do I have to put my handcuffs on your mama
'Cause Bertha Butt did her damn boogie with her crew

But I'd rather boo you
And make you say humdrum, tweedee dum
Humdrum don't succumb when I'm done, buckin' hits
One nation under a groove gettin' down for the funk of it
Tear the roof of this mother like we did last night, son
And hit you with the bop gun

Here's my chance to dance my way
Out of my constriction
Gonna be freakin' up and down
Hang up really late
With the groove I only got
We shall all be moved

Ready or not, here we come
Gettin' down for the one which we believe in
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys
Playin' with our toys
M-1, 'cuz everybody's gotta have fun
Under the sun, under the sun
So rough, so tough when I get down
The disco fiend with the monster sound
I wants to get funked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill in

You let her funk me 'cause my funk is the best
Comin' from the west

Kickin' that hits be occupied
Dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin' them dips, CD skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say, ""Do that stuff! aw, do that stuff!""
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun

One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now

Do not attempt to adjust your radio
There ain't nothin' wrong, so hit the bong
Waitin' on the double dutch bus for a ride
As the buffalo go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
Got daytons on the mothership
And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale

'Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the black hole
May I'll big bang you with my black pole
So, flashlight, red light, we don't like cops on the bike
Just made bail, tonight
So whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna have some fun with the bop gun

Ready or not, here we come
Getting down on the one which we believe in

One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move
Nothin' can stop us now
One nation under a groove
Gettin' down just for the funk of it
One nation and we're on the move

I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave 'till I see the
Morning sun creep through your window pane
Cause love won't let me wait (not one more minute, baby)
The time is right
Turned down the lights
And take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night
In a wonderland
Now move a little closer to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait 
 (No , listen girl)
I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We will explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame
That love won't let me wait, no

When the world is at peace

I can see the day when it's safe to walk the streets
When we learn to care for those lost in poverty
There would be no need for our daughters and our sons
To march up and down the streets, singing we shall overcome
(Do it to me now)

When the worlds at peace will it still be in one piece
I pray for the day when the bombs and the bullets cease
Come let's make a change or leave the world in dust
Lets be the world of love for the ones that follow us
(Do it to me now)

If we learn to love the way we learn to kill
Then love will rule the world and hate would soon be still
Some may say they love but loves a sacrifice
Love is not a state of mind, loves a fact of life
(Do it to me now)

Hate be still
Love get behind me
Peace, what we need
Ha ha, peace is what we need now

Da, da, who's got me? Who's got me? Ha
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, dayah, da, da, da, da, da, da

You've found someone else

This strangest thing is buggin' me
Without your face around
You've found another to do your lovin'
Me you have put down

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms
I just can't go on

My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
I can't even force a smile

I'm trudging water all through the house
I thought was from a leakin' sink
I phoned the plumber to rush right over
See if he could fix the leak

He rushed right in and he took a look
Much to my surprise
He said, my son it's not your sink
It's teardrops from your eye

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms

Only got one to go
And until I see your face again
Nails I have no more

In this loneliness
And until I see your face again
My poor heart won't rest

We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough

I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She said, ""Father, father it's for the kids (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Any and every thing I did.
Please, please don't judge me too strong.
Lord knows I meant no wrong.
Lord knows I meant no wrong.""

Then the devil sang

""Would you like to dance with me? (Ooh-ahh-ooh)
We're doin' the cosmic slop."" (Ooh-ahh-ooh)
(x3)

She was well known through the ghetto
Tricks would come and then they'd go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that she was catching hell, hey!

Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call (Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh)
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call

Was pre-ordained a mighty plan
That I should walk with Him alone
The cords of trust unbroken


But fate foresaw my wandering eye
That none could yet restrain
To violate the friendship I
Would cause Him so much pain


Chorus:
And everytime I close my eyes
I see the nails, I hear the cries
He did not keep Himself away
He was no stranger to my pain
He walked a mile in my shoes
He walked a mile


Feet so dusty cracked with heat
But carried on by love's heartbeat
A man of sorrows filled with grief
Forgiveness was His anthem


No feeble blow from tongue or pen
Could ever sway my love for Him
Across the echoed hills He trod
And reached into my world.

George Cotsirilos,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2006
George Dalaras,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you
And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?
They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you
And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love
A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you
And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust,
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you",Mad About You,2001
George Daly,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998

I watch them bloom for me and you

And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, how do you do?""

George Davidson,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

The poet won't write any verses tonight.
He may sing a sweet serenade.
So pull up a chair and forget about life.
It's a good thing to do now and then
And if you like it here I have an idea
Tomorrow let's all meet again.",The Red Rose Café,
George Donaldson,"Like a bird without wings
That longs to be flying,
Like a motherless child
Left lonely and crying.
Like a song without words,
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me.

I get so lonely, when you're away
I count every moment, I wait every day,
Until you're home again
And hug me so tight
That's when I know
Everything is alright.

Like a bird without wings
That longs to be flying,
Like a motherless child
Left lonely and crying.
Like a song without words
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me.

You're my guardian angel
My light and my guide
Your hand on my shoulder
And you by my side.
You make everything beautiful,
You make me complete.
Everything in my world
I lay at your feet

Like a church with no steeple,
Where a bell never rings.
In a town without people,
Where no voice in the choir ever sings.
If a boat on the ocean
Would be lost with no sail,
Then without your devotion
Surely all that I dreamed of would fail.

Like a song without words
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me

I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me",A Bird Without Wings,2008
George Donaldson,"You're sleeping son, I know
But, really, this can't wait
I wanted to explain
Before it gets too late
For your mother and me
Love has finally died
This is no happy home
But God knows how I've tried

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

I know, it's hard to understand
Why did we ever start?
We're more like strangers now
Each acting out a part
I have laughed, I have cried
I have lost every game
IÃ¢??ve taken all I can take
But I'll stay just the same

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy

And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Sleep on, you haven't heard a word
Perhaps it's just as well
Why spoil your little dreams
Why put you through that hell
Life is no fairytale
As one day you will know
But now you're just a child
I'll stay here and watch you grow

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

Because you're all I have, my boy
You are my life, my pride, my joy
And if I stay, I stay because of you, my boy

And he will gently lead you
By the arm

The hardships that were had

Can't wait to be on my way
To see once more the folks I've been missing

Can't wait to get that old feeling
Being back where I belong

It's Christmas and I'm going home

Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way

And they've frozen up my ears

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found

And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear

Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling low

And hums in soft sweet undertones

Why you really really want to know the 4-1-1
Is it cause that my game's tight
I can scoop a bitch and fuck her on the same night

It was a, Saturday evening bout seven at night
White T, white thongs pockets feeling alright
I got a, call from one of my caramel chicks
She said I mean be careful I think they talking on some hate shit
Despite the talk of the town, I'ma be there
For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the Cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front

Foul, god damn you hagging
Sixteen block my wall you want to block my magic
Now you wondering no what Nitty be doing
While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot

And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's

[Chorus x2]

And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody
Know you no G when it come to the money put some g's up
Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you

Got the misses and the bitches want to know my name
They want to know what I'm on

Let me try to find the words I want to say to you
I been searchin' my mind
I got to find the reasons I feel the way I do
Let me emphasize that I recognize
What I should and should not do
And though I know it's wrong
Every now and then I phone
Just to talk to you

Sometimes love
Has no rhyme, and no reason
Even if we try to be cool
At the strangest times
Love can make a connection
If you trust your heart to choose

Sometimes you cross my mind
And I don't know why
But I hear from you
And though I want to stay close
I realize the most we'll ever be is good friends
I got kids at home 
I can't leave them alone
This I'm telling you
I've got another life
Cause I still love my wife
Though I still want you

Sometimes love
Has no rhyme, and no reason
Even if we try to be cool
At the strangest times
Love can make a connection
If you trust your heart to choose
Even when you trust your heart

Sometimes love
Has no rhyme, and no reason
Even if we try to be cool
At the strangest times
Love can make a connection
If you trust your heart to choose

Sometimes love
Has no rhyme, and no reason
Even if we try to be cool

George Duke,"How about you?
Will you see this through?
How about you?
Will you be strong or am I wrong?

Have I stayed too long
And sung the wrong song, oh baby
Come home too late, put you in a state
That you can't see your way through

Oh, how about you?
Will you even try not to deny
That that is right with us
Baby hold on, before it's gone, oh

How about you, baby?
Do you say we're through?
Oh, how about you?
Have you moved on, found a new song?

Oh, how about you?
Should we start anew?
Won't you answer me please? I'm down on my knees
Beggin' you to make your move

Do you feel the same or am I insane?
Blinded by cold-hearted love
Is this a game, that both of us lose?
Baby, please, please choose

How about you?
Do you feel like I do?
How about you

How about you?
This tango's for two
Oh, how about you?

Will you even try not to deny
That, that is right with us
Or am I insane
Blinded by cold-hearted love
Is this a game, that both of us lose?
Come on, just choose

Everyone on the line, no other way to choose
The whole world is in our hands
We can make a better place it's in the
Master's plan
We can do it if we try
And if others ask you why say

It's our world
Far too many just don't care, a living negative
It's our world
And we know right and wrong
But far too many close their eyes and hide
Their fears at home
It's our world
And we must keep our love alive

We've done so much and come so far
But yet we still can't get along and don't
Know who we are
War and pain, I read somewhere
Said they will always be with us until He comes again
Does that mean we shouldn't try
Should I just lay on down and die

Our world
Only world
It's our world, it's a gift

(Celebrate life) we can find a better way
We can change it (rearrange it)
And there's really nothing else to say

It's our world, just keep it goin', do it
It's our world, we better try, honey
It's our world, just show your love
It's our world, don't let it get you down

Such precious time with you
Walkin', talkin', holdin' hands
Lovin' this laid back Sunday with you

Smiles across a cool summer glass
Sharing this laid back Sunday with you
Waiting so long
To spend this day with you

Groovin' on this laid back Sunday with you
Checking out the band on the town
Diggin' this laid back Sunday with you

Perfect day with you

George Duke,"Love songs, sweet love songs
Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love

Hasn't every way to write a love song been written
And hasn't every way to tell the story been told
Hasn't everyone been moved and soothed by the melodies
Aren't there other tales to be told, other stories to unfold

Haven't we anything else to say
Or are we merely trapped to find another way
To say the same things
Don't we have other thoughts, other dreams

Girl it seems every time I search that quiet place
I find myself with you face to face
In my mind there's nothing left to say except, ""I love you""

Love songs, sweet love songs
(I love you)

Hasn't every way to sing a love song been sung
And hasn't every way to phrase the message been done
Haven't all the great ones sung the melodies that've wooed you
And aren't there other songs to be sung with messages untold

Seems that we've lost our will to challenge the mind
And be a unique kind of art it's been for me
Oh a teacher or prophet by pen
Girl but wait, don't get me wrong, I love a good good love song
One that gets me real good, when I close my eyes
I only seem to find the words ""I love you""

""I love you"", girl I can't help myself
(Love songs, sweet love songs)
And as long as you keep needin' them
I'll keep servin' 'em till my last breath
(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
No, I'm not alone, there're others like you and me
'Cause there's always someone who wants
To tell their story of need

It's a simple story, one as old as time
(Love songs, sweet love songs)
And we all know that sometimes
Love don't have no reason or rhyme
(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
Hingin' on to those love songs

And though we cry, this can't go on forever

Service today

""Oh, boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you""
Girl, I'm thinkin' about you, too
You've become so special, someone I don't
Want to lose

""Baby boy I'm thinkin' 'bout you, your love""
I need you in my life

Sometimes the simple things are the best
Things to say
And sometimes it's what you least expect
That will make your day
And sometimes it's not words at all but a
Glance saying ""I'm okay""
Sometimes a simple ""Hi, it's me"" will set
You on your way
Like a warm breeze
A memory that stays in your head
One that feels so good you'll wish you could
Live it instead

You do for love, no matter what they say
You'll swallow your pride

And find what is true and what's real

Self respect and the will to rise above
Whatever happened to the right thing to do
Love your brother, let peace abide with you

Whatever happened to live and let live
Tolerance and a willingness to give
Whatever happened to the goodness in a man
Was good ever there or has good lost its hand

Whatever happened to the drive to learn
To better oneself just because one yearns
Whatever happened to the unique voice
The one of a kind giving us a greater choice

Whatever happened to striving towards goals
Seems we're our own worst enemy and foe

But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

George Duvivier,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1979
George Duvivier,"I'll love you dear, as long as I live.

It was easy said the night we parted
That we'd forget we'd ever met

As long as I live if it be one hour
Or if it be one hundred years
I'll keep remembering forever and ever
I'll love you dear, as long as I live.

Oh, I never thought that night we parted
That life alone would be oh, so bad

Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

George Duvivier,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.

George Dvorsky,"This is hard to say, but as I wandered through the lea
I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.

George Faye,"He would spend it on the ponies,
He would spend it on the girls,
Buy his mother gin and roses
For her poor old henna'd curls.
And when his wife said, ""Hey now!
What did you get for me?""
He socked her in the chopper,
Such a sweet sweet guy was he!

And her tears flowed like wine,
Yes her tears flowed like wine,
She's a real sad tomato,
She's a busted valentine.
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind.

How he loved the old race horses,
He would bet them every day.
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay!
He indulged in fancy spending,
Ordered rings, cars and furs,
But alas, alack,
Like a stab in the back,
She found out they were not hers!

And her tears flowed like wine,
Yes her tears flowed like wine,
She's a real sad tomato,
She's a busted valentine.
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind.

He got mixed up with a Maisie,
He got mixed up with a Flo,
So Flo shoved him in the river,
He'll not get mixed up no more!
His wife then draped herself in black
That showed her figure fine,
Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy,
No insurance could she find.

George Feyer,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

George Feyer,"I sit alone in the golden daylight,
But all I see is a silver sky,
For in my fancy I sweep away light,
And keep my image of the sky,
Just the way we like it, you and I.

All through the day I dream about the night,
I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,
Until the time when I'm here with you.

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you,
The evening mist melts away,
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.",All Through the Day/Long Ago (And Far Away),1991

I once won first prize two and six, I know all the dirt track dirty tricks
I'm a marvel when I'm out to win.
In a fifty mile race I am the best, I ride five miles and skid the rest.

So come along and see me riding in the T.T. races
Easier than hop scotch, beating all the top notch aces.
I've been riding all my life, I started quite small.
I've ridden fairy cycles, aye, and scooters and all.
Hear the people cheer me when they see me steering backwards.
Down the hill I go at break-neck speed,
See me coming down the street with the winning post on the pillion seat.
Oh! Come along and see me riding in the T.T. race

Everybody's scaring, I am such a daring rider.

I don't care if I do spend a pound, I'm rather rash I know.
See me dressed like all the sports, in my blazer and a pair of shorts.

It may be sticky but I never complain, it's nice to have a nibble at it now and again
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.

Somehow lost his baton - it flew out of his hand
So I jumped in his place and then conducted the band
With my little stick of Blackpool Rock

With my little stick of Blackpool Rock, along the promenade I stroll,
In my pocket it got stuck I could tell 
‘Cos when I pulled it out I pulled my shirt off as well
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.

A girl while bathing clung to me, my wits had to use
She cried, ""I'm drowning, and to save me, you won't refuse""
I said, ""Well if you're drowning then I don't want to lose
My little stick of Blackpool Rock.""

With my little stick of Blackpool Rock, along the promenade I stroll
In the ballroom I went dancing each night
No wonder every girl that danced with me, stuck to me tight
Every day wherever I stray the kids all round me flock.

I said when it was done, ""Is that supposed to be me?""

George Formby,"Now I go cleanin' windows to earn an honest bob
For a nosy parker it's an interestin' job

Now it's a job that just suits me
A window cleaner you would be
If you can see what I can see
When I'm cleanin' windows

Honeymoonin' couples too
You should see them bill 'n coo
You'd be surprised at things they do
When I'm cleanin' windows

In my profession I'll work hard
But I'll never stop
I'll climb this blinkin' ladder
Till I get right to the top

The blushin' bride, she looks divine
The bridegroom he is doin' fine
I'd rather have his job than mine
When I'm cleanin' windows

The chambermaids' sweet names I call
It's a wonder I don't fall
My mind's not on my work at all
When I'm cleanin' windows

I know a fella, such a swell
He has a thirst, that's plain to tell
I've seen him drink his bath as well
When I'm cleanin' windows

Oh, in my profession I'll work hard
But I'll never stop
I'll climb this blinkin' ladder
Till I get right to the top

Pyjamas lyin' side by side
Ladies nighties I have spied
I've often seen what goes inside
When I'm cleanin' windows

------ banjo ------

Now there's a famous talkie queen
She looks a flapper on the screen
She's more like eightie than eighteen
When I'm cleanin' windows

She pulls her hair all down behind
Then pulls down her... never mind
And after that pulls down the blind
When I'm cleanin' windows

In my profession I'll work hard
But I'll never stop
I'll climb this blinkin' ladder
Till I get right to the top

An old maid walks around the floor
She's so fed up, one day I'm sure
She'll drag me in and lock the door
When I'm cleanin' windows

George Formby,"I can laugh
When things ain't funny
Ha ha, happy-go-lucky me

Yeah, I can smile
When I ain't got no money
Ha, ha, happy-go-lucky me

It may sound silly but I don't care
I got the moonlight, I got the sun
I got the stars above

Me and my filly, we both share
Slappy-go-happy
Happy-go-lucky love

Well, life is sweet
Sweet as honey
Ha ha, happy-go-lucky me",Happy Go Lucky Me,2002
George Fox,"Every morning I go out there just a walking
I see that heavy iron marking up this land
There was a time when nobody would've lived here
My dad, he bought a hundred acres for a grand

Now them hills are all tied up in blacktop
So the people can get away 
They drive the miles and and get to where they want to be
The old express line  don't ever, ever stop

There's no trespassing on this land 
I just want to keep working these fields
And doing the best I can
So you can build your backyards somewhere else 
'Cause here I am and there's no no no trespassing
Well there's no no no trespassing
Well there's no no no trespassing on this land

Yesterday when somebody made a living
Well, less of everything was something that they had
Sometimes I wish that I could turn back the pages
And find a place where I can be an honest man

I climb that hill and watch the bough break baby
Tear it down to make some living room
Somebody sold out thinking they could walk away
But someday, well, they're going to have to say


There's no tresspassing on this land
I just want to keep working these fields, like my old man
So you can build your backyards somewhere else, 
'Cause here I am And there's no no no trespassing
Well there's no no no trespassing
Yeah there's no no no tresspassing on this land",No Trespassing,1990
George Fox,"You look pretty as a picture
With those flowers in your hair
Years from now I will remember
This vow I made to show I care
Even as those flowers fade to brown
I will love you then as I do now

I give you my word
I swear that I will love you until time stands still
Forever I'm yours, for better or worse
I stand before God and give you my word
Oh, I do give you my word

There must be somebody watching
Over me from up above
'Cause they've sent me an angel
Knowing we'd make a perfect love
I don't know if words can go as deep
But here is my promise I will keep

I give you my word
I swear that I will love you until time stands still
Forever I'm yours, for better or worse
I stand before God and give you my word
Oh, I do give you my word

As God as my witness
Let the lightning strike me down
If I ever break this promise
Made on sacred ground

I give you my word
I swear that I will love you until time stands still
Forever I'm yours, for better or worse
I stand before God and give you my word
Oh, I do give you my word
Oh, I do give you my word
",I Give You My Word,2005
George Fox,"I'm gone, I'm history
She get's the best of me
My mind drifts away and I'm instantly
Off into another world
Wishin' she was my girl
And nothin' else matters at all
I'm gone like yesterday
To another time and place
One sweet smile and I get swept away
She gives me just enough to dream on
And I'm gone

Sittin' at a table, conversation
Me and my buddies, I follow what they're sayin'
One hundred percent, of the daily events
But the minute she walks in my direction
Well there goes my span of attention
One look in her eyes and I'm goin' for a ride

I've been comin' in here for quite some time
I got it all figured out in my mind
What I wanna say and today's the day
Oh here she comes, heart be steady
Play it cool, I got the words ready
She says hello, and here I go

I'm gone, I'm history
She get's the best of me
My mind drifts away and I'm instantly
Off into another world
Wishin' she was my girl
And nothin' else matters at all
I'm gone like yesterday
To another time and place
One sweet smile and I get swept away
She gives me just enough to dream on
And I'm gone
",I'm Gone,2005
George Freeman,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1972
George Freeman,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
