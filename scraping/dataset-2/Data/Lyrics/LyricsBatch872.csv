Intimidation never reached to my breadskin
Especially when them ben franks rapped in rubberbands
In the club I'm in the corner boy
Why you haters still broke on the corner boy
I can run rap when I'm on the track with Corey boy
Back on snap behind the base more the noise
When I 2-step you can't even join the boy
the moon goin up your girl makin all the noise
when the moon go down she still on the boy
Mona Lisa Mona Lisa on the boy

And I get nervous every time you speak

Death, oh baby,
You know that dying is fine, but maybe.
I wouldn't like death if death were good,
Not even if death were good.

Ra Ra Riot,"Come on, force it down
I'm imagining
Come on, force it down
I'm imagining

Imaging a place where homes are built on frames
And where they plant new bulbs along our graves
With the fall each year
With the fall each year
Each year

And if you think you might
Yes, but if it's not so bright
But if you're a part of my

Trials and coy displays

You can't see when it's much too far
All that mist in your eyes
Oh, in the night

80 years isn't enough time
50 more isn't more enough
Oh
To right the wrongs
What you're hiding in your back yard
Is turning innocence to apathy
And accusations at another man
Oh
'Cause you don't have a prayer
To put your life into a Christian's hands
Never mind what your
Daughter is taught in school
What she remembers is
What she has learned from you

Ra Ra Riot,"With every little thing
Your owner's lookin' back
At you it starts to mean
Less than it ever did

Oh ever, on every inch of stone
Skin and bone.
Made to leave you

Here you are, you are breathing like little ghosts under rocks
That don't sound in pockets
Folks found your problem
Its lost and forgotten

Oh, oh, oh
You soak in one dream
You've spent there, you are gonna dream there

Right, now you ask your baby
""Why? why? why?""

Forget the the frequent fliers
Leading an honored life
To give us this much more
Safe from a cut and cheer

On ever, on every inch of stone
Skin and bone.
Made to leave you

Here you are, you are breathing like little ghosts under rocks
That don't sound in pockets
Folks found your problem
Its lost and forgotten

Oh, oh, oh
You soak in one dream
You've spent there, you are gonna dream there

Dry
Now you ask your babies ""Why? Why? Why? Why?""

And if you cant decide
You will do either weep or moan
Your wasting in a moments to
Anyway you want it to
Oh, but you could have had
Turn it into broken wood
Takin' off a Saturday
I'm gonna fan a parasol
Am fairer than a clown, oh no
Maybe there were two again
And if it ever was at all
I'm taking you up as an offer, up as an Offer.

Here you are, you are breathing like little ghosts under rocks
That don't sound in pockets
Folks found your problem
Its lost and forgotten

You've spent there,
You have gone and dream there

Ra Ra Riot,"All my days, they end too slow.
And I wonder where I've left to go.
Anyway, there's no such thing as company.
I've discovered all I've got to do.

What is it that gets you through
Another day when I'm not there?
Wish we could be more open.
I don't have time to think of how you are.

All my days, they end too slow.
And I wonder where I've left to go.
And besides, I've got no one but myself to blame.
I've discovered all I've got to do

Is run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.

When I dream, it's not of you.
Something in your voice that I can't hear.
But some company it is.
Because it feels so close when I wake.

And in fifty years no one will care
That I was once there.

All my days, they end too slow.
And I wonder where I've left to go.
Anyway, there's no such thing as company.
I've discovered all I've got to do

Is run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.

Never wanted time for looking back.
For a moment I looked down and wondered.
And of what's to come today.
Girl, I wonder where you are.

All my days, they end too slow.
And I wonder where I've left to go.
And besides I've got no one but myself to blame.
I've discovered all I've got to do

Is run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.

Run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.
Run my mouth off.

Ra Ra Riot,"If I go to Gloucester you know
I will wait there for you
The Rhumb Line is waiting there too
You know it's worth the nights we wait there
It all falls apart, apart, come on, come on

If I go to Gloucester you know
I will wait there for you
The Rhumb Line is waiting there too
You know it's worth the nights we wait there
It all falls apart

Don't you think by now there's truth
In all she's said to us
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, let us in

If the heather is wet then
I might be accustomed to walk
It might be the way that we talk
The river and the rock that fell there
It all falls apart

When I arrive
Will you wake if I open the door?
A tone that was taken before
The cusp and the fjords we wade through
It all falls apart

And it won't take long
Oh, and you're right
Once or twice
Sawney bean

Oh, don't you think by now there's truth
In all she's said to us
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, let us in

Arms wide, arms too wide
But oh, there comes a tide

A little more
I'm finding a way from what's dark
In your eyes, once or twice
It's a feel

I've a little fawn
And it won't take flight
Oh, for the brightest
Oh Christ, it's a farce

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, let us in

Is it the tone we defend on the phone???

But they couldn't tell
The way or a change???
The way that we are
I can't tell if I'm asleep or awake

Ice covers from the lake to where I lay
In a state
In which I dream

If you were here
Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
And if you were here
Then I'd have a choice to live, not be alone

But instead I sit atop the crest
Looking down on the valley
Where the dead rest
And every morning I wake beside myself
But I digress

If you were here
Winter wouldn't pass quite so slow
And if you were here
Then I'd have a choice to live, not be alone

Someone is coming to harm
I press my hands to my ears
It's easier here just to forget fear 
And when I squinted
The world seemed rose-tinted
And angels appeared to descend
To my surprise
With half-closed eyes
Things looked even better
Than when they were open 
Been waiting for the night to fall
I knew that it would save us all
Now everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality 
Been waiting for the night to fall
Now everything is bearable

But I don't wanna make it out
I don't wanna make it out

You would grab my hand
You'd say you'd never listen to it without me

I think I hear you singing the refrain

On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in the store
Morphine city slippin' dues, down to see that

We don't even care, as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope

Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls

Revolution in their minds - the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?

So you children of the world,
Listen to what I say
If you want a better place to live in
Spread the words today
Show the world that love is still alive
You must be brave
Or you children of today are

The ones I started there and somehow ended up over here
My way home is just a long and winding road

I - I didn't know what else to do
I was busy hiding from you
I - What am I supposed to do now
All of this is wearing me out
I gotta be honest with you
I'm never gonna make it without you

Why is it the things I choose
In the end I find
I've only got nothing to lose
So here I go
'Cause it's the only thing I know

Maybe this is something I gotta do
Maybe this is just how I know I'm alive

And in your words I'll find the things I could not say.
Oh how I've longed to write a love song just for you.
But on my own I've found it's just another thing I couldn't do.
Whisper the reason when the sun just hides away.
And how do the seasons know exactly when to change?
Who on earth could find a language or a line;
Or count the ways to best describe the beauty found in your design?

No other one
There is just no other like you.
No other one
There is no one else but you.
It's in the way you will the wind to calm the ocean.
That's who you are to me.
There could never be another one.

So amazing, kind of crazy, but it's true.
That my affection is obsession when it comes to you.
And let me say as I am falling on my face
That I am lacking better words, but I just write them anyway.

There is just no other like you.

Make it move, we can prove

We can work the room, make a boom, turn it into
A place where future finds something from our time

All we have to do is come into a place anew
Where we can blur the lines, elevate our minds
In my head I see a kinda dream a place where we
Can live, move, have our being give take it one step higher

Should I go or should I wait for a sign
Following your voice, walking through a desert night
Looking for a silent storm in the sky
And I stand in my emotion and I let it be my own
'Cause I know I'm not forsaken
And I'll never be alone

When I fall
When I fall
I know where I'll be landing
When I fall
When I fall
You will still be standing

Somewhere in the silence I can hear your broken voice
Like a radio station fading out of range
Somewhere in the crowd from the corner of my eye
I thought that I could feel you walking by
And when I get this feeling like I am not so strong
I still can feel you with me
Yeah, you've been there all along

Somewhere I'm alone
Won't you take my empty hands
And fill them with your love
Won't you take me as I am",When I Fall,2004

I'm looking for the signs waiting for the signal that you're there

You never know when life will turn around
One day your faith's strong the next it can't be found 
And you're not looking
And all I know it's outta my control
And you never know
I try to figure in the time 
When miracles should happen to appear
And when it comes down to it
There's nothing more that I can do down here
I want to place it in your hands
Even though I want to understand
You never know when life will turn around

You find grace
Raise your eyes so you can see

Rachael Leahcar,"If I could tell the world just one thing
It would be that we're all OK
And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful
And useless in times like these
I won't be made useless

I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own
And I am never broken

Poverty stole your golden shoes
It didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But I knew it wasn't ever after
We'll fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

My hands are small I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own

In the end only kindness matters
In the end only kindness matters
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
I will get down on my knees, and I will pray

What if I'm destined to only see myself
In my own reflection, instead of loves eyelash.

And it rains in my heart until my goddess built an ark.
And she fills it with all the animals that she can possibly find.
Still she's bleeding, still she's bleeding inside.

Still she's bleeding inside, so much bleeding inside.
Oh, bleeding inside, still she's..

What if there's no one who I would put up with.
What if there's no one who'd put up with me.
What if I'm destined to always remain alone.
What if this question's as stupid as it seems.

Rachael Schunk,"Something always brings me back to you.
It never takes too long.
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

You hold me without touch.
You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're everything I think I need here on the ground.

You got your ticket too soon 
Holy Water

Too long, waiting 

Everybody's cleared the room

Stand you in all the right places 
Words like honey
Smile as they change your faces
With no regard to you at all
And you find they treat you like a paper doll

And they'll dress you up for the flight
Like Ophelia, you wave goodnight
With the earth and sky you cheer and cry
Writhe as all your days go by
And laugh as you die

Sweet softer shoulder, oh sweet sugar safe

Everybody's got their own life philosophy
And I can't wait 'til I find one coming from me

And fallen right outta the window

Ooh well, how can I tell?
Shoulda called the operator maybe she know the info
But whether or not my message you got was too much or a lot to reply

Why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back I'd relax and feel relieved

He could pick up a habit or get in trouble
That might be affective

And working against one another
Two bad souls are destroyed
It's the nature of business
You know how this part is

Oh look, they're trying to bite the helping hand that feeds them
We put clothes on their backs
And they try to take the money up front

So lets up and leave them

We would have done what they are doing anyway

You can flee with your wounds just in time or lie there as he feeds

Rachel Bay Jones,"It was a February day
When your dad came by, before going away
A U-Haul truck in the driveway
The day it was suddenly real

I told you not to come outside
But you saw that truck
And you smiled so wide
A real live truck in your driveway
We let you sit behind the wheel

Goodbye, goodbye
Now it's just me and my little guy
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I felt so small

That night, I tucked you into bed
I will never forget how you sat up and said
""Is there another truck coming to our driveway?
A truck that will take mommy away""

And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I
And I knew there would be moments that I'd miss
And I knew there would be space I couldn't fill
And I knew I'd come up short a billion different ways
And I did
And I do
And I will

But like that February day
I will take your hand, squeeze it tightly and say
There's not another truck in the driveway

In this one horse town
You make your own luck

Always running with you, always
We're gonna be always together
Always running, always
Always

Same old dreams of escape again
Our same old dreary fate again
That one horse town belays again
Lets take to the streets so we can breathe again
And we scream our names to the heavens and the plains
Then we'll run like hell and get clear of this place
We'll have more of raging hearts than graves

I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes

Through the sleepless nights through every endless day

Wished ever after would be like this

I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

But that's the price we paid
And through it all we kept the promise that we made
I swear you'll never be lonely

Rachel Haden,"I hear a voice callin'
It must be our Lord
It's comin' from Heaven on high

I hear a voice callin'
I've gained a reward
For the land where we never shall die

The Savior has paid a great price for me
He gave His life on Calvary
So I'll follow His footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that day

I hear a voice callin'
It must be our Lord
It's comin' from Heaven on high

I hear a voice callin'
I've gained a reward
For the land where we never shall die

He died on the cross, the old rugged cross
That we would be saved from sin and not lost
So I'll follow His footsteps up the narrow way
And we'll pay our debts on that great judgment day

I hear a voice callin'
It must be our Lord
It's comin' from Heaven on high

I hear a voice callin'
I've gained a reward
For the land where we never shall die",A Voice from on High,2008
Rachel Holder,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,2009
Rachel House,"I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd
She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are
The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
Moana, you've come so far
Moana, listen
Do you know who you are?

Who am I?
I am a girl who loves my island
I'm the girl who loves the sea
It calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me
I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me
And the call isn't out there at all, it's inside me
It's like the tide; always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way
I am Moana!﻿",I Am Moana (Song of the Ancestors),2016
Rachel House,"Moana, make way, make way!
Moana, it's time you knew
The village of Motunui is
All you need

The dancers are practising
They dance to an ancient song
(Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need)

This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do (make way!)
Don't trip on the taro root
That's all you need

We share everything we make (we make)
We joke and we weave our baskets (aha!)
The fishermen come back from the sea

I wanna see

Don't walk away
Moana, stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief
And there you are

There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is
Where you are

Consider the coconut (the what?)
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut
That's all we need

We make our nets from the fibers (we make our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (the water is sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we use the leaves to build fires)
We cook up the meat inside (we cook up the meat inside)

Consider the coconuts (consider the coconuts)
The trunks and the leaves (ha!)
The island gives us what we need

And no one leaves

That's right, we stay
We're safe and we're well provided
And when we look to the future
There you are

You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did
You must find happiness right
Where you are

I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous (ha!)
I like how it misbehaves

The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well
There you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside is
Who you are

We make our nets from the fibers (we weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (and we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we sing these songs in our choir)
We cook up the meat inside (we have mouths to feed inside)

The village believes in us (that's right!)
The village believes (ha!)
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves

So here I'll stay
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are

I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together
Where we are

'Cause every path leads you back to
Where you are
You can find happiness right -
Where you are
Where you are",Where You Are,2016

For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river

One more down in accordance with my fate

One more trip that I must create

A blood red line
Through the sonisphere
I can't resolve where it's coming from
I sense it's the great pandemonium

One more, just one more
Just one, just one more day
One more day by the pits of hell
Just one more when even yesterday was too late
One more thought that I have to sow
One last trick that you can't debate

War

On a silent shore
I confronted fear
I spoke to god
But he wasn't there
The sun is down
And the war begun
Assemble the great pandemonium

Break down
Got to break down
Break down

Loneliness
Like a love song or an old cliche
Has it's hideouts but it's never far away
Look around you've found
It's only loneliness

So stay awhile
We've worn the night away and now it's almost done
If you could stay a bit of breakfast might be fun
It's too much work for one
And though it's just a simple guess
We're stronger now we've made the best of
Loneliness
Waits in silence while the shadows grow
Waits and wonders if it's finally time to go
The yes in our hello said no to

You cannot find the light
You feel your dreams are dying

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",Sound of Silence,2003

On the line where blue meets blue
And I bet that silver lining,
Well I know it'll find you soon

I can't know when
You will slip in
And lean against my door
And I will try to hide my eyes,
Seal my voice,
Try to deny,
How long I have 
Waited here for you

Now I'm broken, hoping
That you'll glue me up again

[Chorus]
All I seem to do
Hold my breath,
Waiting here for you
And all I seem to want
Is the warmth 
Of your hands on me
I can't bear to think
Of you leaving me again
And all I seem to want
Is the warmth of your skin

I wait to hear
Your car switch gears
Last night's glasses
Steam like cheap red wine
Your warm face
A thought misplaced
I sink into assorted grace
I pull up my shades
And finally sleep

Now I'm broken, hoping
That you'll glue me up again

[Chorus]

Oh, I will eat up
Every word you say (oh)
And if you love me 
Let me stay (oooh)
(oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-oh oh)

And all I seem to do
Hold my breath 
Waiting here for you
And all I seem to want

Of you leaving me again

Rachel Platten,"Poets and painters and daytime escapers
Tell us a story of what we once knew
Paint us a picture of some great excuse
Cause we lost the truth, when we stopped the music

We are everything we own, right?
And the second that we don't fight
Is the moment that we own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days
We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days

With our feet in the sand and sea in our hands we don't stop
We remember to drink in everything and it's easy when the beat drops
We pulse and we sway and keep morning away from here
Cause nothing exists but love on our lips and beat on our hips
The only real moment is this

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh, love what we got because love is a lot
Life fools us into thinking that we're broke but we're not
Bring your body in to the beach again
Recognize the moment that you're free again

You are everything we own,
And the second that you don't fight
Is the moment that you own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days
We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days

With our feet in the sand and sea in our hands we don't stop
We remember to drink in everything and it's easy when the beat drops
We pulse and we sway and keep morning away from here
Cause nothing exists but love on our lips and beat on our hips
The only real moment is this

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

So they lead you to the beach again
Heat is getting to your head you think
Someone pulls you in and the lights are dim
But you recognize the rhythm crawling through your skin and

You are everything you own, right?
So the second that you don't fight
Is the moment that you own life
Keep it up, keep it up, oh

We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days
We don't care what time it is
No one here is fightin' this
If the DJ keeps on finding hits
We could keep this going for days

With our feet in the sand and sea in our hands we don't stop
We remember to drink in everything and it's easy when the beat drops
We pulse and we sway and keep morning away from here

Rachel Platten,"She dreams of where she's never been
Her story starts where it should end
And she keeps a bible close
And folds the pages down she needs the most
Hmm-hmm hmm-hmm hmm-mm

The faded walls are closing in
So in her head she leaves again
And they've painted ceilings blue and green
And brilliant colors she's never seen

And nothing ever happens if you stay in your room
Nothing ever happens if you leave the party too soon
You'll never be a winner if you're not in the game
Nothing ever happens if you always play it safe
Make a little space and get out of your own way

A ticket out sits on her shelf
But gathers dust upon itself
'Cause chasing chance is for the brave
Maybe soon she'll feel that way

But nothing ever happens if you stay in your room
Nothing ever happens if you leave the party too soon
Nothing ever happens if you don't get hurt
Nothing ever happens if you never get dirty
Make a little space and go on, get out
Go on, get out

Leave what you don't need
You're free and the pieces will fall into place
You and you only
Who can make a little space and and get out of your own way
Eh eh eh, eh eh eh, eh eh eh, eh eh eh 

She sees the sunlight through the cracks
It's only her who holds her back and
And so she takes her deepest breath
Shuts the door and walks down the steps

And nothing ever happens if you stay in your room
Nothing ever happens if you leave the party too soon
Nothing ever happens if you're not in the game
And nothing ever happens if you always play it safe

Rachel Platten,"We make patterns out of stars
And we whisper little prayers
To be somewhere that we're not
And if we're good it will take us there

But then the light comes through the dark
And our questions fall apart
It's just the beating of our hearts and the still of the midnight air

And I get so overwhelmed till it's hard to tell
What I'm thinking

We get down down down
We feel sorry for ourselves
We get down down down
We all need somebody's help
Let's get loud loud loud till there's love and nothing else
'Cause the more that you give the more that comes back around

So we hide away our hurts
And put bandaids on our fears
And we lie to all our friends
Move along there's no problems here
But then the orchestra will start
And the violins appear
And a simple little melody has us fighting tears

And I get so overwhelmed till it's hard to tell
What I'm thinking

We get down down down
We feel sorry for ourselves
We get down down down
We all need somebody's help
Let's get loud loud loud till there's love and nothing else
Cuz the more that you give the more that comes back around

But the hardest part is the way things are
And how quickly fingers will bleed
And the grace we need is not in magazines,
It's just space, in between, when we breathe

I am down down down I feel sorry for myself
And I get down down down and I need somebody's help
Let's get loud loud loud till there's love and nothing else
Cuz the more that we give, the more that comes back

I want someone to laugh when I act like I'm thirteen
I need someone to stay till I can fall asleep
Make being awake like living in a dream

And at the end of everyday no one can take these things away
We all want love and that's okay,
Maybe there's someone.
When my song has slipped away
And the darkness swallows the day
Another one's not very far away, so baby just hold on.
Baby just hold on

I want somewhere to go when it's too noisy in my head
Verbal vertigo I want to hear my voice instead
I need some way to lose this fear of falling down
Cause I can still dance when my feet are on the ground

And at the end of everyday no one can take these things away
We all want love and that's okay,
Maybe there's someone.

Rachel Platten,"I try to take it slow
But this guy just moves me so
If his hands move anymore
I think that I might lose control

I'm shaking through these clothes
He's breathing like he knows
That my heart's a little unsure
But my body still wants more

And I'm hoping, praying, something will rescue me
Before I give up the rest of me
Can I? Am I? Thinking this

You don't have to go,
Stay the night and we'll take it slow
We don't have to know how far we're going
If you want to stay,
Well, we could go all the way
We can just forget it in the morning

And the other day,
I might not be an easy lay
And you can't call it luck
I bet sometimes a girl just need a friend

And I'm hoping, praying, something will rescue me

It's never gonna feel the same

And all the times it heard me pray,

There's two trees in Becky Hill's front yard,
One big, and one small
That big oak's been there for ages
And they planted that willow last fall

He bought it for their anniversary,
So they could watch it grow like their love
Well each day she looks out the window,
To see it not growing that much.

And she cries like that weeping willow,
Every time the wind starts to blow
One of these days she's gonna be strong,
Strong like the oak.

Now she hates the thought of leaving,
She hates to stay,
But somewhere in her heart she still needs him,
But not as much as she did yesterday.

And she cries like that weeping willow,
Every time the wind starts to blow
One of these days she's gonna be strong,
Strong like the oak.

She'll walk out that screen door and hold her hand high,
Won't look back, won't shed a tear
Right now she's afraid of being alone,
Oh, but she's been alone for years

She cries like that weeping willow,
Every time the wind starts to blow
One of these days, she's gonna be strong,
Strong like the oak.

Yeah one of these days, she's gonna be strong,
Strong as an oak



",Strong as an Oak,2004
Rachel Proctor,"We were way too young a couple of crazy kids
They said it was a fairy-tale land we were livin' in
And lookin' back you know we were pretty green
Aren't you glad we were smart enough to be that naive
Steppin' out on the limb
Just think if we had listened to them

[Chorus]
We'd never danced under the stars in Colorado
Or took that drive across the Rio Grande
We'd never laid eyes on that California sunset
Or dipped our toes in that Monterey Sand
There'd be no yesterday and baby we couldn't say
HEY, HEY We did it our way
HEY, HEY We did it our way
Everybody Tried to tell us where to plant our seeds
They just couldn't understand why we had to spread our wings
All we needed to pass life's little test
Was a second-hand car and a place to lay our heads
I thank God for you
Baby, I know our aim was true

[Chorus]
We'd never walked the streets of Albuquerque
Or took that trip anywhere bound
Must've been fate forgettin' that road map
We got lost and found this little town
What a perfect place and we can sit back and say
HEY, HEY We did it our way
HEY, HEY We did it our way
We were way too young a couple of crazy kids 
They said it was a fairy-tale land we were livin' in
HEY, HEY We did it our way ey, hey
HEY, HEY We did it our way

Rachel Proctor,"I've wished a million wishes on a big empty sky
And I've spent too many endless nights alone
Wondering if I was broken and why everything felt so wrong
And where do I belong
I see beyond the end of time when I look into your eyes
It's so much bigger than this life and everything's right
I feel so safe, safe as a child in your arms
This is where I belong
I've seen my share of troubles
And tears I've shed in vain
Watched my dreams crumble
But all along the way
Someone heard me pray
The house is quiet now and my, my heart is full
And all the ones I love lay fast asleep and I am complete
I turn out the light and I whisper goodnight
And I know, this is where I belong",Where I Belong,2004

Hey Tony, won?t you pour me another glass of wine?

Yeah, I think I might

Stay awhile tonight

I could always take a taxi home

It?s not that far at all, I might even walk,

It?s a nice night?


Na, Na, Na, Na, , yeah?


David who? He?s a thing of the past, I don?t talk about him

He met some artsy chick, and I haven?t seen him since

Maryann? She?s doing great; she might stop by in a little while

I knew that?d make you smile

Yeah, I love this band, I followed them in college

My friend Rebecca dated the drummer?

Are you kidding? Of course it didn?t work out...

Who?s that guy on piano? I don?t remember him at all

No thanks, not in the mood to meet somebody new


I, I look around this room

and think of all the people in this world

And I, I know I?m not the only

I?m sure I?m not the only lonely girl

Na, Na, Na, Na


Yeah, my mom still asks me every single day if I met someone

Talks about my sister?s kids? blah, blah, blah

Yeah, I?ll take another glass, but just one more I think

?Cause I can get sentimental when I drink

Our chance could be gone

On the tip of our tounge

Rachel Rachel,"Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say
 
Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say

Carry on my wayward son,
For there'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely heaven waits for you

He's the president, but I don't care
He's a business man, he got business ties
He got dollar signs in both his eyes
Got a big airplane, take him everywhere
Got his limousine, when he get there
Everywhere he goes, make the people mad
Makes the poor man beg, and the rich man glad

He's the president, but I don't care
Ooh, ooooh, ooh

At the factory, never been so slow
Got a big fourth down, ninety nine to go
And down on the farm, nothing growing there
But the debts they owe and their gray hair
In the desert sand, and the jungle deep
He thinks everything is his to keep
He's a real cowboy, with his makeup on
Talks to kings and queens on the telephone

He's the president, but I don't care
Ooh, ooooh, ooh

He's a movie star, if you stay up late
And he'll search your car, if you don't look straight

And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey

And patted my back for something done right

But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands

Wrapped around your finger
You grabbed a hold of me
And turned my world around
Upside again

They got me falling
There's nothing I could
Ever say or ever do

Who lives her life in plastic (plastic)
A secret kind of world
It sounds a lot fantastic, yeah

She lets you think that she's acting kind of stupid

Her dance with diamonds brings a sparkle to the music
Her laugh is sleeping under her skin

And all she wants is love
And all she wants is dumb da da dumb
Searching for a touch
That's more than just a dumb da da dumb
Hides behind her heart
And all we see is dumb da da dumb
You could give her love, love, love
Love

Behind the mascaraed
Between the smoke and mirrors
Her tear drops will explode
Into the night that glitters, yeah

You see she sacrificed her image for her beauty
But looking deeper you can see that she's unhappy
You can kiss her, you can wake her from her sadness
Her laugh is living under her skin

The sweeter you taste
The bitter I feel
The slower I play

Just because I wanna
You step over me, oh

I want every little thing that you don't
You're standing in a different corner
You're trying to get the best of me
You want every little thing that I don't
You seem to want to make things harder
Harder than they ought to be

The faster I ride
The more that you stow
The lower you fight
The higher I fall
Right down
(Down, right down)
Down on my knees
(Down, down)
(Ah)

The sting in your kiss
The twist in my touch
You had me so hard
But you want me so much
Oh bitch, anything for me

You can't hide
Baby, don't deny it
I'm your fantasy

I want every little thing that you don't
You're standing in a different corner

Rachel Sumner,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Rachel Sweet,"You wanted me to write you a letter,
Here it is, it's left down river on the boat
As if these things I feel around me could reach you,
But they never will, you're much too remote

Women walk in the shade with water jars
It's so different here, so hot, no phones or cars
It's so different here

This afternoon we fall asleep, the people mend their nets
They'll be on their boats at sunrise
I watch them at their lives, they teach me much,
I could not tell you moot, until you've seen my eyes

Of our affairs and ups and downs
And now my job has brought me here

Rachel Sweet,"This never was one of the great romances
But I thought you'd always have those young girl's eyes
But now they look in tired and bitter glances
At the ghost of a man who walks 'round in my disguise

I get the feeling that I don't belong here
But there's no welcome in the window anyway
And I look down for a number on my keychain
'Cause it feels more like a hotel everyday

There's a stranger in the house; nobody's seen his face
But everybody says he's taken my place
There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see
But everybody says he looks like me

And now you say you've got no expectations
But I know you also miss those carefree days
And for all the angry words that passed between us
You still don't understand me when I say

There's a stranger in the house; nobody's seen his face
But everybody says he's taken my place
There's a stranger in the house no one will ever see
But everybody says he looks like me

And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing 
And feel what it's like to be new
'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far-off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place where they're far more suited then here

And I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels 
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

And I do believe it's true that there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you then I hope it takes me too

who lost his love through his indifference
a heart that cared, that went unshared,

And every road that takes him takes him down
While love goes on around him everywhere

Goes without saying

And Lord knows I still really love you
‘Cause you are the only, the one and only man for me
And I'm the woman that you need, yes
A million tears would not change my mind
You see, it doesn't matter what you do
I'll be right here waiting for you! 

Repeat Chorus
",With Open Arms,1992
Rachelle Ferrell,"There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul that snaps my control
It's a funny thing but every time I'm near you
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
Music all around me, crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on
Come and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just met me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky
How I worry bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love
So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again so baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you and get a release from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, oh baby please
Pull yourself together, got to do it very soon
My heart's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling
Oh, pretty baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so crazy mama
Never knew what love was all about
James Moody would you come on hit me, you can blow now if you want to, we're through",Moody's Mood for Love,1999
Rachelle Ferrell,"Lemme tell a story 'bout an old man and woman I know
They were in the desert so dry, diggin' ditches, deep
Waitin' for the rain to flow
Well, the people came from miles around
Wantin' to know why they did what they did and how
""Faith is the key"" he said, ""to what can't yet be seen""
Then he looked at the sky, winked at his wife and said,
""That's why baby, baby, baby?""

I'm so satisfied
I know that this joy can't be denied!
Make me sing in the morning
Make me smile at night
Laugh for no particular reason
Just 'cause everything's alright!
I'm so satisfied

No doubt about it, there's a higher power working in here!
There's a way to anything, anytime, anyway and anywhere
But it won't work if there's fear
If we put our trust in what we feel
Instead of what we think in our heads, hmm
Then we'll remember to keep it real
So the soul will be nourished and the spirit is fed!
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm so satisfied
I know that this joy can't be denied!
Make me sing in the morning
Make me smile at night
Laugh for no particular reason
Just 'cause everything's alright!
I'm so satisfied

Life is only what we allow it to be
There are no accidents and no mistakes
It really just depends on the choices we choose to make
Everything is everything anyway!

I'm so satisfied
I know that this joy can't be denied!
Make me sing in the morning
Make me smile at night
Laugh for no particular reason
Just 'cause everything's alright!
I'm so satisfied

In a world of choice
'Tween the forces
I'd rather be with light, satisfied!

In a world of choice
'Tween the forces
I'd rather be with love, satisfied!",Satisfied,2000
Rachelle Ferrell,"You got that certain thang that can't quite be described
Copied all over the world, it can't be denied
And when you walk into a room the brothers be slippin' all up out they swerve?
Incredible woman, you're still my girl!

Sista
You know you got a friend in me
Sista
We're sharing the power of femininity!

You brought my spirits up when everything was low
You helped me to heal my heart and continue to grow
And now I'm feeling so much better that I can do
Anything I choose
With you in my corner I just can't lose!

Sista
You know you got a friend in me
Sista
I'm giving you props, respect and dignity

You don't know what you mean to me
You're the light of my life
Strength in my fight
The stand in my feet
And Ohhh, sho' do like the way you roll
Auntie, Mama, Grandmom, Daughter?

Sista
I'm giving you my heart and soul
Sista
Because it was you who helped to make me whole again

Sista
You know you got a friend in me
Sista
We're sharing the power of femininity",Sista,2000
Rachelle Ferrell,"Never dreamed that it would be like this
Never knew that I could ever miss
I've been thinkin' bout the way it was
How we used to share each other's love

I can feel you callin' out to me
I can sense the love you really need
Don't know how we got to be this way
But I do know something's got to change.

I wanna' be there for you through the thick and thin
To the very end
So when you feel the need for love
Reach out and call me.
I'm gonna' be by your side day and night
Through the rest of my life
So open your heart for me
I'm coming back for you.

I'm coming back just to give you my love
There's a part of me that lives in you
I'm coming back just to give you my love
Loving you's the best thing I can do.

Was a time when lovin' used to be
All the subtleness of you and me
Now with every passing day I find
It was a fool's mistake to run and hide

I can feel you in the air I breathe
You're the center of each thought I think
Now there's only one thing left to do
And that's to find my way back to you.

I wanna' be there for you through the thick and thin
To the very end
So when you feel the need for love
Reach out and call me.
I'm gonna' be by your side day and night
Through the rest of my life
So open your heart for me
I'm coming back for you.

I'm coming back just to give you my love
There's a part of me that lives in you
I'm coming back just to give you my love
Loving you's the best thing I can do.

I'm coming back just to give you my love
There's a part of me that lives in you
I'm coming back just to give you my love
Loving you's the best thing I can do.",I'm Coming Back,2011
Rachid,"It's funny how quiet can be so loud
We're too ashamed to talk
'Cause we're too damn proud
Pretending not to know about him
Pretending not to know about her
We fell and got our feelings hurt

Oh well, it's over now
You say you're walking out
He's waiting for you in the car outside
Oh well, it's over now
And I'm breaking down
But I'll never bring myself to cry

[Chorus:]
You can take all the records
You can even take the damn goodbye
Better take what you can
'Cause I'll never let you take my pride
I'll never let you take my pride
Gotta put my tears aside
Because I'll never let you take my pride

It's cruel how she needs to see me ache
She'll know that it's real if she sees the hate
Did you really need to bring him here
Why can't we part with dignity?
It's a pity bout your insecurity

Can't believe it's over now
No need to work it out
I'm so relieved we never had a child
Well, it's over now and I'm breaking down
I gotta clean up this mess you made inside

[Chorus:]
 
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la la la
Oh well, it's over now
And I'm breaking down
But I'll never bring myself to cry

[Chorus:]",Pride,1997
Rachid,"When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems
What'd you see on a night so clear
In the sky so very dear

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

Shining star come in to view
Shine its watchful light on you
Give you strength to carry on
Make your body big and strong
Born a man child of the sun
Saw your work had just begun

Found I had to stand alone
Bless it now I've got my own
So, if you find yourself in need
Why don't you listen to these words and heed
Be you giant or grain of sand
Words of wisdom are ?Yes I can?

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be",Shining Star,2001
Rachid,"C'Ã¨ sangue dentro il video,
Lampeggianti, Ã¨ un fatto serio.
Gente tranquilla dicono
Riversa dentro un rosso fradicio.

Cronaca incomprensibile 
Di lame e di follia inspiegabile.
Buona famiglia giurano
Travolti da una notte che non vuole finire.

Quanta obbedienza, quanta osservanza,
Quella misura che si deve ottenere
Tra le pareti che ingoiano violenza
CosÃ¬ invisibile che non vuoi sapere.

L'intransigenza, l'intolleranza,
Servite a tavola son pugni sul cuore
Di chi ti ascolta e poi soffoca in silenzio
Vite represse incorniciate d'onore.

A porte chiuse l'incubo
Domestico imprevisto Ã¨ gelido.
Gente tranquilla giurano
Gente che chiedeva dove andremo a finire.

E ogni certezza Ã¨ brivido
Che massacra la tua quiete attorno al televisore. 

Quanta obbedienza, quanta osservanza,
L'educazione che si deve ottenere
Tra le pareti che ingoiano violenza 
CosÃ¬ invisibile che non vuoi sapere.

L'intransigenza, l'intolleranza,
Servite a tavola son pugni sul cuore
Di chi ti ascolta e poi soffoca in silenzio
Vite represse incorniciate d'onore.
Un demone tascabile un'ombra clandestina un crimine
La colpa indispensabile per sopportare un incubo che non vuole finire.
Un demone tascabile un'ombra clandestina un crimine
La colpa indispensabile per sopportare un vuoto che non vuole finire.

Racionais MC's,"Um homen na estrada recomeça sua vida
Sua finalidade a sua liberdade
Que foi perdida, subtraída
E quer provar a si mesmo que realmente mudou
Que se recuperou e quer viver em paz
Não olhar para trás
Dizer ao crime: nunca mais!
Pois sua infância não foi um mar de rosas, não

Na FEBEM, lembranças dolorosas, então
Sim, ganhar dinheiro, ficar rico, enfim
Muitos morreram sim, sonhando alto assim
Me digam quem é feliz
Quem não se desespera vendo
Nascer seu filho no berço da miséria
Um lugar onde só tinham como atração
O bar, e o candomblé pra se tomar a benção
Esse é o palco da história que por mim será contada
Um homem na estrada

Equilibrado num barranco incômodo
Mal acabado e sujo, porém
Seu único lar, seu bem e seu refúgio
Um cheiro horrível de esgoto no quintal
Por cima ou por baixo, se chover será fatal
Um pedaço do inferno, aqui é onde eu estou
Até o IBGE passou aqui e nunca mais voltou
Numerou os barracos, fez uma pá de perguntas
Logo depois esqueceram, filhos da puta
Acharam uma mina morta e estuprada
Deviam estar com muita raiva
Mano, quanta paulada!
Estava irreconhecível, o rosto desfigurado

Deu meia noite e o corpo ainda estava lá
Coberto com lençol, ressecado pelo sol, jogado
O IML estava só dez horas atrasado
Sim, ganhar dinheiro, ficar rico, enfim
Quero que meu filho nem se lembre daqui
Tenha uma vida segura
Não quero que ele cresça com um ""oitão""
Na cintura e uma ""PT"" na cabeça
E o resto da madrugada sem dormir
Ele pensa o que fazer para sair dessa situação

Desempregado então
Com má reputação
Viveu na detenção
Ninguém confia não
E a vida desse homem para sempre foi danificada
Um homem na estrada
Um homem na estrada

Amanhece mais um dia e tudo é exatamente igual
Calor insuportável, 28 graus
Faltou água, ja é rotina, monotonia
Não tem prazo pra voltar, hã! Já fazem cinco dias
São dez horas, a rua está agitada
Uma ambulância foi chamada com extrema urgência
Loucura, violência exagerada
Estourou a própria mãe, estava embriagado
Mas bem antes da ressaca ele foi julgado
Arrastado pela rua o pobre do elemento
O inevitável linchamento, imaginem só!
Ele ficou bem feio, não tiveram dó
Os ricos fazem campanha contra as drogas 
E falam sobre o poder destrutivo delas
Por outro lado promovem e ganham muito 
Dinheiro com o álcool que é vendido na favela

Empapuçado ele sai, vai dar um rolê
Não acredita no que vê, não daquela maneira
Crianças, gatos, cachorros disputam palmo a palmo 
Seu café da manhã na lateral da feira
Molecada sem futuro, eu já consigo ver
Só vão na escola pra comer, apenas nada mais
Como é que vão aprender sem incentivo de alguém
Sem orgulho e sem respeito
Sem saúde e sem paz
Um mano meu tava ganhando um dinheiro
Tinha comprado um carro, até Rolex tinha!
Foi fuzilado a queima roupa no colégio

Abastecendo a playboyzada de farinha
Ficou famoso, virou notícia, rendeu dinheiro aos jornais
Ha!, cartaz à policia
Vinte anos de idade, alcançou os primeiros 
Lugares superstar do notícias populares!
Uma semana depois chegou o crack
Gente rica por trás, diretoria
Aqui, periferia, miséria de sobra

Um salário por dia garante a mão-de-obra
A clientela tem grana e compra bem
Tudo em casa, costa quente de sócio
A playboyzada muito louca até os ossos
Vender droga por aqui, grande negócio
Sim, ganhar dinheiro ficar rico enfim
Quero um futuro melhor, não quero morrer assim
Num necrotério qualquer, como indigente
Sem nome e sem nada
O homem na estrada

Assaltos na redondeza levantaram suspeitas
Logo acusaram a favela para variar
E o boato que corre é que esse homem está 
Com o seu nome lá na lista dos suspeitos
Pregada na parede do bar

A noite chega e o clima estranho no ar
E ele sem desconfiar de nada, vai dormir tranquilamente
Mas na calada, caguetaram seus antecedentes
Como se fosse uma doença incurável
No seu braço a tatuagem: DVC, uma passagem, 157 na lei
No seu lado não tem mais ninguém

A justiça criminal é implacável
Tiram sua liberdade, família e moral
Mesmo longe do sistema carcerário
Te chamarão para sempre de ex-presidiário
Não confio na polícia, raça do caralho
Se eles me acham baleado na calçada
Chutam minha cara e cospem em mim é
Eu sangraria até a morte já era, um abraço!
Por isso a minha segurança eu mesmo faço

É madrugada, parece estar tudo normal
Mas esse homem desperta, pressentindo o mal
Muito cachorro latindo
Ele acorda ouvindo barulho de carro e passos no quintal
A vizinhança está calada e insegura
Premeditando o final que já conhecem bem
Na madrugada da favela não existem leis
Talvez a lei do silêncio, a lei do cão talvez
Vão invadir o seu barraco, ""é a polícia""!
Vieram pra arregaçar, cheios de ódio e malícia
Filhos da puta, comedores de carniça!

Já deram minha sentença e eu nem tava na ""treta""
Não são poucos e já vieram muito loucos
Matar na crocodilagem, não vão perder viagem
Quinze caras lá fora, diversos calibres
E eu apenas com uma ""treze tiros"" automática
Sou eu mesmo e eu, meu Deus e o meu orixá
No primeiro barulho, eu vou atirar
Se eles me pegam, meu filho fica sem ninguém
É o que eles querem: mais um pretinho na FEBEM
Sim, ganhar dinheiro ficar rico enfim
A gente sonha a vida inteira e só acorda no fim
Minha verdade foi outra
Não dá mais tempo pra nada

'cause if nobody knows then they might go away
Walk away, walk away, walk away
Without me

You cover your lies with stories and smiles
Walk away
You're scared what to find so you just run and hide
You run away
If you play with a gun then you will shoot someone
When you sit in the fire it's your ass getting warm
Walk away, walk away, walk away
Without me, without me, without me, without me

Why do yell, you can whisper as well
Walk away
These teardrops of rain, they're masking your shame
You walk away
In this midsummer storm you see a midsummer fight
Put your head in the sand if you can't make it right
Walk away, walk away, walk away,
Without me

De alguien que no te correspondió
Eso no te impidió dejarlo de amar

Y le prometí que siempre estaría ahí

Radam Schwartz,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

The yard held dead machines behind its fences
Like they were it's kids
Broken down, but still worth a lot to someone
It made me stop and grin

Light from a dying moon
It blurs our eyes
And we wear a cape of fireflies
And after the world's in bed
All the ghosts come sing along
But we'll forget them
When the morning comes

You split my skull and reached inside my head
And pulled out the pictures I'd been wishing I'd forget
And you stitched me up then
And wiped the blood from off my chin

Now I sit on the rooftop's edge
The muddy street beneath my swollen head
Trying to forget you
To believe we've never met

And the sky is wrecked, full of rotting clouds
From chimney mouths spewing smoke around
And I can't stop coughing

As I was idle on the porch
She slept-walked from your house down the walkway
As though she'd done it all before
And the moon was out

And in her gown beside the riverbed
She got down on her knees
And wrapped her long hair up in vines
And leaves, and branches and with the wind beneath her feet
Oh, she waltzed with the dead

And everything was bathed
In light white as milk
As the impossible began
She danced across the water's edge
But her feet, they didn't sink as though she flew

I ran out in the water
With a lantern in my hand
I was waste deep and shivering
I took her wrist and walked her in
I was loathe to interrupt her
But I had to get her home
If people were to see this
They'd gather up, raise hell and burn her alive

Don't you mind, don't you mind, she'll be fine
Tie a bell around her ankle
Before she lays down at night
And the sound of her footsteps
Will wake me in time
Don't you mind, don't you mind
I'll watch over her
As though she were mine",The Dead Waltz,2011
Radical Face,"So we start with my father as a boy barely spoke a word of English 
Fell in love from a distance. 
He watched her working from the back fence
He learned some words and some clever turns of phrase from his father's book of poets
She wasn't taken in that instant, but grew impressed with his persistence

They met each other out by moonlight
Made love in the nearby woods
Then her folks became suspicious when her cycle broke that settled it
They stole away without their goodbyes
Got married in a foreign town
Made their way as best as they could
Found jobs and settled down
And then time moved on

I was born in a river of blood on sheets from the wedding day
The room was dark and the stench was thick
My father couldn't stand the smell of it
Mama died in the night cause the nearest doctor couldn't stem the blood loss
Father cried out on the back porch
My sister held me at the neighbor's house
Oh my there was a storm then, there was a flood of a different kind
Father's eyes were often vacant, but his hands were rarely quiet
Sister learned to take her hits well, both from life and the physical kind
But I was never one to lie down, despite picked the fight
So we designed our hells

Father turned into a drinker, a dark bastard with a wooden heart
Sister learned to be a mother, before she never played another part
And I became a little terror, I lashed out at whatever's around
Took some time before I settled, to find a mind that was somewhat sound
And like it always does, time rushed on

Six years later father dies in the very same bedroom
Many said it was the grief that did it
I have to say it's cause he hung himself
To be honest neither sister nor myself ever much regret his passing
But I admit it was a nice thing, to always know that we could feed ourselves",Family Portrait,2011

I still think of you
But everyone knows

I've seen more places than I can name
And over time they all start to look the same
But it ain't that truth we chase
No, it's the promise of a better place

But all this time, I been chasin' down a lie
And I know it for what it is
But it beats the alternatives

And I could hear his ragged breathing like the wind along a knife
There beside him through the night, in the hum of candlelight

Brother woke just after midnight
And he didn't make a sound
And as he climbed from out of bed with severed rings around his head
His feet didn't touch the ground

I could feel it then
A tiny miracle
So I followed him
Into the woods
Crossed beneath the trees
But only I left my prints in tow
He was afloat
Found a lonely tree
And tied himself within its limbs
And he said to me these words
Don't you fear for me

I started out a long, long, long time ago
But my journey held most things I did not know
But I was sure and believed the plan You gave
Was so secure inside of me

In latter days I found failure down
And complacency came to pull me down
They wrestled deep inside of me, now the passion's gone
Staring me right in the face, asking me if I am sure

Now when I need strength to endure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through
I anoint myself

I anoint myself, bring my mind back
And talk to the Father, yeah, plan again
Keep the love, that I gotta do
'Cause I'm here to serve You

My heart it says, it's not too late
Before I waste another day
Kneel and pray
This is how I remind myself

Now my savior's gone, it seems like I have it down
I've stood through it all, it feels still to rise and come around
Trying to guarantee this day I'm going forward
And the battle starts all over again

Now when I need to know for sure
There's one thing that I can count on
To help me make it through

Sometimes in this world, challenges come
And emotions get carried away
But in faith be strong and to His word hold on
And when if doubt comes, guard up yourself
Stand there and say I remember

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes I gotta remember, oh yeah
That you called me, Lord
Yes, you did and I'm at your disposal

Sometimes gotta remind myself
What I've been called to do
Is first to be with you

Sometimes, gotta remind myself
That you called me, called me

Por eso un viento partió de una oscura nube aquella noche 
Para helar el corazón de la hermosa Annabel lee 
Luego vino a llevársela su noble parentela 
Para enterrarla en un sepulcro en aquel reino junto al mar. 

No luce la luna sin traérmela en sueños 
Ni brilla una estrella sin que vea sus ojos 
Y así paso la noche acostado con ella 
Mi querida hermosa, mi vida, mi esposa. 

Nuestro amor era más fuerte que el amor de los mayores 
Que saben más como dicen de las cosas de la vida 
Ni los ángeles del cielo ni los demonios del mar 
Separaran jamás mi alma del alma de Annabel Lee. 

No luce la luna sin traérmela en sueños 
Ni brilla una estrella sin que vea sus ojos 
Y así paso la noche acostado con ella 
Mi querida hermosa, mi vida, mi esposa. 

En aquel sepulcro junto al mar 
En su tumba junto al mar ruidoso. 
Hace muchos, muchos años en un reino junto al mar 
Habitó una señorita cuyo nombre era Annabel Lee 
Y crecía aquella flor sin pensar en nada más 
Que en amar y ser amada, ser amada por mi",Annabel Lee,1998

Walking the streets in the rain.

To find the shadows again.

I feel the touch of her hand
I hear her voice say ""I need you""
I guess I can't understand

One fom the heart
So she'll come back for me

Could be the turn of a key

It's you I'm hoping to see

You play a cruel cool game

You leave me calling her name

No love no laughter

À casa que gostaria
De poder chamar lar

Encafuadas na bagagem
E uma sensação esquisita
Que me deixa meio à toa
Ora cá estou eu de novo
Então bom dia Lisboa
Já palmilhei meio mundo
Já andei por todo o lado
E quando a angústia me agarra
Vêm-me aos lábios o teu fado
Já adormeci cansada
Em tanto sitio diferente
E acordo como se tivesse
Sempre o Tejo à minha frente
E é sempre a mesma saudação
Que na minha cabeça ecoa
Como um sonho persistente

Ora então olá Lisboa
É sempre tão bom voltar
Quem sabe haverá um dia
