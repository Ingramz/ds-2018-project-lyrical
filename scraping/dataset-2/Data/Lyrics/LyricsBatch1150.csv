The J.B.'s,"Try me, try me
Darlin' tell me
I need you
Try me, try me
And your love will always be true
Oh I need you
Hold me, hold me
I want you right here by my side
Hold me, hold me
And your love we won't hide
Oh I need you

Oh I need you
Oh oh walk with me
Talk with me
I want you to stop my heart from crying
Walk with me
Talk with me
And your love stops my heart from dying

[Homeskillet]
From the beginnin, head-spinnin hip-hop
The never-endin, don't stop
be	-boy religion. I'll rock and claim position
Maim the opposition, tradition, got 'em on lock
Follow the greater mission, freedom marks the top
Beat 'em off the block, now cock-wrap they bop
Number one on street spots, Homeskill' the hard rock
I drop steady, cripplin non-believers like Teddy
Pendergrass, tense up ya tender ass, you're not ready
Hold steady, think first, my ink burst floods and blunder
Crown Hi-Tek sound thump pounds of thunder
Street hunger, the universal man works wonders
Mic and hand breakin land, rockin up from down under

[Crunch Extraordinare]
I got sound control and I'm kinda slick wit it
Heads know I get down like that, can you dig it?
This is the way how I roll or how I deliver this packages
Turn the other cheek, 'cause this track I be smackin it
But don't clap, 'cause this style'll bust caps
I'm jiggy and all that, black and get control back
But fuck that, control over mind, body and soul
The MC regulator, microphone detonator
My real live want to battle niggas take a vouch
Eighty Shieks, throw them joints and +Let Da fuckin Monkey Out+
Not ""Hell yeah"" but ""Hell, yeah"" in Cin' City
When I spit this here it's easy as.. {""1-2-3""}
+You Can ""Huh?"" You Can Hear Me+, you ain't heard nuttin yet
I'm +Live+ and +Fortified+ like Kweli and Mos Def
Practice the incredible, shit ain't even competable
Due to that I'm technical, TKO's I got those
I got control but I'm wreckless in studios
I got Harmony and Thug tendencies all in my Bones
No need to be flashy, for heads to recognize me
Hi-Tek throw them joints that magnetize me
We global, East, West, North, South, we robo
Hands that touch mic's get smacked 'cause that's a no-no
Who rock the mic? Yo, we take the whole show
When heads hear this piece they call off with no shows

[Donte]
I struggle more in tug-of-war, writin rhymes by the score
Before I lived the hustle, swore this poor man would give the law
As a testament it goes, it was destined in my soul
They tested but questioned weapons rest in my foes
Blessed in my flows and obsessed with my scrolls
Midas Touch as it's told, writin nuttin less than gold
My journeys, I march through madness like atorneys
Send you out on a gerdy talkin 'bout yo' eternity
Can't stand it, search for your wind like Ban Enti
One man band on the MP and a nigga ran simply
Hi-Tek, all these other niggas can exempt me
Say he's the nicest out loud and gently
Have it your way, a freestyle mean no pay
If you sign a wack contract that mean.. (no weight)
Got your John Hancock on the paper to say
""The band locked and don't know, dough flow your way"" {x4}

[Main Flo]
Woes out my treasure box, seven locks, pressure to plot
Measurin blocks, releasin this live like Desert Fox
Hear spiritual, remain plentiful, same generals
Train criminals to get the most plus the minimals
Rob past, raw cash, facin the God last
Spot grabs, sure pop laugh, jump out of stock caps
For cop cash, watch taps, eyes on my top hat
Flop fast, stock crash, how when I drop math?
This rare rap, air vac', exit and fair fact
We share packs, stare back, cover our bear tracks
Ya peeps move, each choose, jump in our Jeep smooth
Unleash two and leak fumes, studyin Hebrew

The J.B.'s,"You're a fish out of water on the wrong side of the tracks
Gather up the boys to come and get back
We stand all together against the opposed
We'll die for our brethren that we have chose
On the wrong side of the tracks
On the wrong side of the tracks
Escalation, war in the streets
Catch one sucker and he gets beat
What you see is what you get
Soft motherfuckers will soon meet their end
On the wrong side of the tracks
On the wrong side of the tracks

You best watch your back

Wanna see me hang
Well, I had my bells rang on the wrong
(Side of the tracks)
Strapped, a broken pact
Caught in a trap on the wrong
(Side of the tracks)
Wrong or right, I had to fight
I ran for daylight to the right

A lesson to learn
When the tables are turned
You might get burned on the wrong

I can make my lover reach for the stars when the sun is out
And I can make my man forget what he’s thinkin' about

But if he wants some lovin', I can be a painkiller

In other words, what I’m tryin' to say is don’t be a teaser
Be a love pleaser, be a love pleaser

Be a love pleaser, forget about the others and all the rest
Whatever you be, gotta be the best

It’s time for everybody to get ahold of yourself
You see, life is too short and I’m afraid we just don’t have enough time left
'Cause that’s why they call me mama feelgood, 'cause I do my thang
And I’m telling you it’s about time you started doing it too

I can make my lover reach for the stars when the sun is out
Men, let me hear you say somethin'
Guitar, let me hear you spank it

I can take a four-dollar dress and let off the funky heels
I can look plump and if he wants I can look slim

I'm mama feelgood, mama feelgood

I can [pull up this suit?], do anything, yes I can

Oh
Maybe I could leave you but I don't know how
And why should I be lonely ev'ry night
When I can be with you
Oh yes
You make it right
And I don't listen to the guys who say that you're bad for me
And I should turn you away

And they've never heard of love

Still they get nowhere

So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you and you hold my hand 
'Cause they don't know about us
And they've never heard of love
Why should it matter to us if they don't approve?
We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose
Baby
There's no need for living in the past

Now I've found good loving gonna make it last
I tell the others
Don't bother me
'Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see

No
I don't listen to their wasted lines

Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs

The Jacks,"Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day,
My heart was yearning.
I promised I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart
And left me yearning

As we walked into the room,
There were faces
Staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
And said this is the place,
You said meet you right here at noon

Heartbreak hotel
Heartbreak hotel

Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other

Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought in beguile
To hurt me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me

We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue,
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through.

With my little girl who was back in the states
I was stranded in the jungle afraid and alone
Tryin' to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know there was a record jump my plane
Had been picked up and spotted my girl in lovers lane
And meanwhile, back in the states

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle flat as he can be
So come on pretty baby just you and me
Meanwhile back in the jungle

The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear
I smelled something cookin' and I looked to see
That's when; I found out they was a cookin' me
Great Cuckoo let me outta her
Meanwhile back in the states

[Chorus]

I jumped outta the pot and finally got away
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
But my chance of survival was gettin' mighty slim
So I thumbed down a whale who was headin' my way
And I reached the states in bout a half a day
And when I got to lovers lane I was almost dead
When my soul was gone, here's what I said

Baby, baby, your man is no good
Baby, baby, he should've understood

But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.

No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

The promise of love was written on your face
You led me on with untrue kisses
You held me captured in your false embrace
Quicker than I can bat an eye
Since you were telling me goodbye

You gave the illusion that your love was real

From the kisses you only pretended to feel
And now our meetings you avoid
And so my world you have destroyed

By showing love that wasn't there

Those petals, petals, tell me what will it be today?
Will she walk into my arms or will she walk away?

She'll wake up some day and see
You're the only one she needs
Don't give up, just stick around
You'll be up instead of down.

She keeps telling me she wants me near
But half the time it's far from crystal clear
Fickle-heart must be her middle name
'Cause loving her is just a guessing game, oh
She calls up to say
Be there right away
Then leaves me sitting home
All alone and

Throwing all those petals, petals, tossing petals on the ground
Yesterday she picked me up just to throw me down
Those petals, petals, tell me what will it be today?
Will she walk into my arms or will she walk away?

She loves me (loves me, loves me)
And I feel like a king!
She loves me not (loves me not, she loves me not)
Huh! I've lost everything!

You have inspired
A teenage symphony

Because of you (you, you , you, you)
You touched our souls and then sparked this melody

We're singing this symphony especially for you

What are you doing out there sugar, tryin' to bring my spirit down?
'Cause I've heard that you've been sneakin' around with ev'ry guy in town.
What are you doing out there baby? You're acting like you're fancy free,

So keep your love for me.

What are you doing out there baby? I guess our love will never be,
'cause you, you don't want to keep your love for me.

You, you don't want to keep your love for me;

Always, please be not always.

Did they touch you?
Have you felt such pain?

Is not life but lame?
But time has made promises, just promises.

Mothers cry, babies die helplessly in arms while rockets fly 
And research lies in progress to become.
But what of men are flesh and blood?
We turn our backs on life.
How can we claim to stand for peace when the race is armed in strife, destroying life?

Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises

The songs of the chill that only brings me tears

And say a little prayer
You'll be waiting there for me

Is someone's death in another place.

Is hunger and strife to another child.

In promising salvation, is near

Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning 
I promised I would never ever be returning 
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning 
 
As we walked into the room, there were faces 
Staring, glaring, tearing through me 
Someone said welcome to your doom 
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me 
This is scaring me 
 
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom 
There were two girls sitting in My room 
She walked up to my face 
And said this is the place 
You said meet you right here at noon

Heartbreak hotel 
Heartbreak hotel

Hope is dead 
She thought that I had cheated for another lover 
I turn my back to see that I am undercover 
Now I can`t convince this girl there ain`t no other 
 
Someone`s evil to hurt my soul 
Every smile`s trial thought in beguile 
To hurt me 
Then the man next door had told 
He`s been here in tears for fifteen years 
This is scaring me 
 
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell 
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel 
There was Sefra and Sue,

And my baby said love is through

But baby, you can bet your bottom dollar
That you never hear me holler

You didn't speak a single word
But your eyes
Your eyes said you wanted me
Your touch said you needed me
And my heart said tenderly
Darling
Ooh, my darling
Make me yours
Let your kiss touch my face
And tell me love has let me
To this place to your warm embrace
And our hapiness
Thanks to you my search has ended
And I want the world to see
How gently love has shined on me
With everlasting love
That I been forever dreaming of
At last
Ooh, at last

The Jacksons,"Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then happy came one day, chased my blues away

Sweet, like candy to a child

Let happy be where sadness was

Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Quiet as the sea on a good calm night
In your tranquil shadow, I try and follow

Or take you over for the rest of your life

Joined in the race to the rainbow's end
No fears, no worries just a golden country
Woke at sunrise, went home at sunset

We lose our innocence, we lose our very soul

He's heading for the Waterloo line
To catch the 8 a.m. fast, it's usually dead on time
Hope it isn't late, got to be there by nine

Stops off at the corner shop, to buy The Times

'How's the wife and home?'
'Did you get the car you've been looking for?'
'Did you get the car you've been looking for?'

Let me get inside you, let me take control of you
We could have some good times
All this worry will get you down
I'll give you a new meaning to life, I don't think so

Sitting on the train, you're nearly there
You're a part of the production line
You're the same as him, you're like tin-sardines
Get out of the pack, before they peel you back

Arrive at the office, spot on time
The clock on the wall hasn't yet struck nine

'I hope it's the promotion you've been looking for'

'Come in Smithers, old boy'
'Take a seat, take the weight off your feet'
'I've some news to tell you'
'There's no longer a position for you'
'Sorry Smithers-Jones'

Put on the kettle and make some tea
It's all a part of feeling groovy
Put on your slippers turn on the TV
It's all a part of feeling groovy
It's time to relax, now you've worked your arse off
But the only one smilin' is the sun-tanned boss

Backstreet's and all, I wanted to leave there
But no matter how fast I ran, my feet were glued 
I just couldn't move there

I heard my name called above the noise
I tried to speak but my tongue was tied
Bumped into emptiness and started to cry, oh no

I saw the lights and the pretty girls
And I thought to myself what a pretty world
But there's something else here that puts me off
And I'm so scared dear, my love comes in frozen packs
Bought in a supermarket

Streets I ran, through wind and rain,
Around this place amongst streaming sunshine.
Scared I was, sweating now.
Feeling of doom, my bowels turned to water

I felt hot breath whisper in my ear
I looked for somewhere to hide but every wheres closed
I shut my eyes pretend not to be here
This feelings much to real to ever disappear, oh no

And those golden faces are under twenty five
They wanna say, they gonna tell ya

And I know what you're thinking

You still think I am crap
But you'd better listen man
Because the kids know where it's at

And I've heard they now have the right to kill a man

Covered in shit and aches and pains
Too knackered to think so give me time to come round
Just gimme the living room beat to the TV sound -

My hard earned dough goes in bills and the larder
And that Prince Philip tells us we gotta work harder!
It seems a constant struggle just to exist
Scrimping and saving and crossing of lists -

From this window I've seen the whole world pass
From dawn to dusk I've heard the last laugh laughed

The Jam,"I was hoping we'd make real progress -
But it seems we have lost the power
Any tiny step of advancement
Is like a raindrop falling into the ocean -

Though we keep piling up the building blocks
The structure never seems to get any higher
Because we keep kicking out the foundations
And stand useless while our lives fall down.
I believe in life - and I believe in love
But the world in which I live in - keeps trying to prove me wrong.

Out in the pastures we call society
You can't see further than the bottom of your glass
Only young but easily shocked

Just like sheep - little lambs into the slaughter
Don't fully grasp what exactly is wrong -
Truth is you never cared - still -
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked -

Intelligence should be our first weapon

Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kid's new gear
It's a big decision in a town called malice, ooh yeah

The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going round and round, oh
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze

How the other side wants to take away
All the things you ain't got no more
Keep us divided with their greed and hate
Keep you struggling to put the food on your plate.
Imagine if tomorrow the workers went on strike
Not just British Leyland but the whole world
Who would earn their profits?
Who would make their bombs?

Why am I here and what have I done?

And mans supposedly is made of sand
It seems that man cannot survive at all

Release me please from this mortal jail
One shrug or smile can determine my fate,
I'm lost for days and have myself to blame

Of baked beans on toast, technology is the most

And everyone seems just like me,
They struggle hard to set themselves free
And their waiting for the change

What have you done for me

You've gone and got yourself in trouble
No you want me to help you out

These days I find that I can't be bothered
These days I find that its all too much

Shoot shoot shoot and kill the natives
You're one of us and we love you for that

Think of honor queen and country
You're a blessed son of the British empire
Gods on our side and so is Washington

Come out on the hills with the little boy soldiers
Come on outside I'll sing you a lullaby
Or tell a tale of how goodness prevailed

We ruled the world we killed and robbed
The fucking lot but we don't feel bad

It was done beneath the flag of democracy
You'll believe and I do yes I do yes I do
Yes I do

And its always at the back of my mind.
The place I love is overgrown now
With beautiful moss and colorful flowers
And goldfish that swim in a pool, there's a small brick wall

With neon lighting controlled by lightning
I'm making a stand against the world

Not within a mile of those trendy dos,
Where dogs bodies pick you up, and graciously give you a lift,

cause they're all going through their own private hell

And catalogs and numerous cups of coffee
In the afternoon the weekly food
Is put in bags as you float off down the high street

To a closet ghost a picture of your fantasy
A victim of your misery and private hell

You see it smash inside you crack

People have no use for - amongst the smoldering embers of yesterday

And when or if the sun shines
Lighting our once beautiful features
We'll smile but only for seconds
For to be caught smiling is to acknowledge life
A brave but useless show of compassion
And that is forbidden in this drab and colorless world

The ones overshadowed by the monolith monstrosities

Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's paper
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""
And I said, ""I've a little money and a takeaway curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery, you know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
Filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth, it blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw as I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British rail poster read ""have an away day, a cheap holiday
Do it today""

'Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me

Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday

Opening the windows and breathing in petrol
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
Watching the telly and thinking about your holidays

Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away

Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude

Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear

It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going round and round

Lost laughter in the breeze

We want a direction, all over the country

Because this is your last chance

Can't dismiss what is gone before

You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the onlooking fool who believed your lies
I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows, yeah

When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
Now I watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room

Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's paper
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""
And I said, ""I've a little money and a takeaway curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery, you know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
Filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth, it blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw as I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British rail poster read ""have an away day, a cheap holiday
Do it today""
I glanced back on my life, and thought about my wife
'Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

There's a row going on down near slough
Get out your mat and pray to the west
I'll get out mine and pray for myself

But you didn't take a peep in their artillery room
All that rugby puts hairs on your chest
What chance have you got against a tie and a crest?

Hello-hurrah, what a nice day, for the Eton rifles
Hello-hurrah, I hope rain stops play, with the Eton rifles

Thought you were clever when you lit the fuse
Tore down the house of commons in your brand new shoes
Compose a revolutionary symphony
Then went to bed with a charming young thing

Hello-hurrah, cheers then mate, its the Eton rifles
Hello-hurrah, an extremist scrape, with the Eton rifles

What a catalyst you turned out to be
Loaded the guns then you run off home for your tea
Left me standing, like a guilty (naughty) schoolboy

We came out of it naturally the worst
Beaten and bloody and I was sick down my shirt
We were no match for their untamed wit
Though some of the lads said they'll be back next week

Take five it heals in time

I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs

They say don't know, don't care and I've got to go, mate

They worry themselves about feeling low
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow
They all ignore me 'cause they don't know
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs

You've got to move in a straight line
You've got to walk and talk in four-four time
You can't be weird in a strange town
You'll be betrayed by your accent and manners

You've got to wear the right clothes
Be careful not to pick or scratch your nose
You can't be nice in a strange town
'Cause we don't know, don't care and we got to go, man

Rush my money to the record shops
I stop off in a back street buy myself a snort
We got our own manifesto, be kind to queers
And I'm so glad the revolution's here
It's nice and warm now!

I've finished with clubs where the music's loud
'Cause I don't see a face in a single crowd
There's no one there
I look in the mirror, but I can't be seen
Just a thin, clean layer of mister sheen looking back at me
Oh, oh

Found myself in a strange town
Though I've only been here for three weeks now
I've got blisters on my feet
Trying to find a friend in Oxford Street

I bought an A to Z guide book
Trying to find the clubs and YMCAs
When you ask in a strange town
They say don't know, don't care and I've got to go, mate

Worry themselves about feeling low
They worry themselves about the dreadful snow
They all ignore me 'cause they don't know
I'm really a spaceman from those UFOs

Strange town, strange town

Break it up, break it up
Break it up, break it up
Break it up, break it up
Break it up, break it up
Break it up, break it up
Burn it down, shake it up
Break it up, break it up",Strange Town,1997
The Jam,"Tonight at noon, tonight at noon
When we meet in the midnight hour,
I will bring you night flowers (coloured)
Like your eyes
Tonight at noon, I'll touch your hand
Held for a moment amongst strangers
Amongst the dripping trees
Country girl
Walking in city squares in winter rain
Walking down muddy lanes or empty streets
Arranging a time and place to meet
Tonight at noon, you'll feel my warmth
You'll feel my body inside you
We'll be together for hours
Time and tears
Won't wait for evermore

Why waste the world outside

Life is timeless, days are long when you're young
You used to fall in love with everyone
Any guitar and any bass drum
Life is a drink and you get drunk when you're young
Life is new and there's things to be done
You can't wait to be grown up
Acceptance into the capital world
You pull on some weed, then you pull on someone when you're young

But you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to comprehend
Why you set up your dreams to have them smashed in the end

But you don't mind you've got time on your side
And they're never gonna make you stand in line
You're just waiting for the right time

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
You're fearless and brave, you can't be stopped when you're young
You swear you're never-ever gonna work for someone
No corporations for the new-age sons
Tears of rage roll down your face
But still you say it's fun

And you find out life isn't like that
It's so hard to understand
Why the world is your oyster but your future's a clam

It's got you in its grip before you're born
It's done with the use of a dice and a board
They let you think you're king but you're really a pawn

Whoa-oh, whoa-oa
Whoa-oh

You're fearless and brave, you can't be stopped when you're young
You used to fall in love with everyone

will it ever stop or will I just lose touch
What I want to say, but my words just fail

Like a hungry child, I just help myself
And when I'm all full up, I go out to play

But I don't mean to bleed you dry
Or take you over for the rest of your life
It's just that I need something solid in mine

Quiet as the sea on a good calm night

The Jam,"Where the streets are paved with blood
With cataclysmic overtones
Fear and hate linger in the air
A strictly no-go deadly zone
And I don't know what I'm doing here
'Cause it's not my scene at all
There's an 'A' bomb in Wardour Street
They've called in the Army, they've called in the police to

I'm stranded on the vortex floor
My head's been kicked in and blood's started to pour
Through the haze, I can see my girl
Fifteen geezers got her pinned to the door
I try to reach her but fall back to the floor

'A' bomb off in Wardour Street
It's blown up the West End, now it's spreading through the City

'A' bomb in Wardour Street, it's blown up the City
Now it's spreading through the country

Law and order takes a turn for the worst
In the shape of a size-ten boot
Rape and murder throughout the land
And they tell you that you're still a free man
If this is freedom I don't understand
'Cause it seems like madness to me
'A' bomb in Wardour Street
Hate bomb, hate bomb, hate bomb, hate bomb

A Phillistine nation, of degradation
And hate and war there must be more

And the taxman's shouting, 'cause he wants his dough

Every heart would have a new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring
If I ruled the world, every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word we would treasure each day that occurred
My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
My world would wear a smile on its face
Like the man in the moon has when the moon beams
If I ruled the world every man would say the world was his friend
There'd be happiness that no man coud end

* Lovesweat

Blue for the blue - I feel when I'm feelin' down
On the ground - feelin' down that could be most anyday
Green for the eyes - take a look around
When the sun goes down - and the sun goes down
In the strangest way -
Red for the light - gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say - meant to say -
Pray for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done to the bad
It's too late to see
Two of us make it easier, to read the signs
Memorize the lines - you play with me
One for the road - I'll be on my way
Come another day - when the things we say
Find a way to be - way to be -
Solo:
Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringin' winter near us - greens are brown
And disquise a sign -
Wintertime is a razorblade - that the devil made
It's a price we pay for the summertime
Springdays come it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from - where the children go -
It's a nursery rhyme - nursery rhyme

The Japanese House,"I saw you in a dream
You had stayed the same
You were beckoning me
Said that I had changed
Tried to keep my eyes closed
I want you so bad
Then I awoke and it was so sad

Haven't talked to you in months
And I thought that I might cry
But I'm not that kind of guy

I saw you in a dream
You came to me
You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision
There was no reason, no explanation
The perfect hallucination

All good things come to an end
But I thought that this might last
But you came alive so fast

And when I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
(It isn't the same but it is enough)

I saw you in a dream
Then it came tonight
I wonder if you'll come and visit me again
You take your time to reappear
I'm starting to believe that when I call your name

You just don't hear me anymore
And I know that I shouldn't even try
It's a waste of time

And when I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough

The more we see, the more we try, the more we show
The evidence of our confusion, life has left its mark
The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide
As we walk into tomorrow
(Turning away from the path we know)
Holding the future with our hands
(We carry the weight of the world, we go)
It's up to you and I, we hold the key, we hold the answers
All our thoughts of doubt and fear are leaving one by one
The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know
For each of us the road is clear and life has just begun
The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow
It's time to reach the goals we've set for ourselves
The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide
All we need is just to believe in ourselves
We face the truth, we see it clear, with no disguise
Cast away our doubt and sorrow

Day?
Like a bird, you left your robin's nest and-a just like all the rest you flew away

But a little bit of soap will never wash away the memory
Of your name in the night that I call through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never wash away my tears

I'll never lose the memory of your name in the night that I call through the lonely years

Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?

Gates left swinging by your dear one's hands,

The sidewalks you slept on held no rest.
Gave away the money you saved
In your trust, you're sorry now.
Light hits you funny at the time.

Hoping my sweets will lead to you

Heard you could get a pretty good sandwich
For fifteen and a dime

Down to the Bayou

The mere smell of speculation conjures up hell
Feel the touch of oil from the tankers upon the breeze

Hide behind the cottails of your father

You put me on that throne
Up into the sky
Thought I saw Nick Cave down at the laundromat

You put your hand in my hand and that was that
Your perfume on my sleeve
You lit my life like a Christmas tree
Up into the sky

While the maids vacuum the hall outside my cheap hotel room

Destitute and shaken
Looking for a sign
Left hung out to dry

In my window, you look so right

Shoot up the sky high
White bold from the blue

Of how it's gonna be the day that I am free
Once I settle like the dust upon the table

The Jazz Crusaders,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

I hope some day you'll join us

The Jazz Crusaders,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

No football hero or smooth Don Juan

distinguished in each direction

The Jazz Renegades,"Do it the hard way and it's easy sailing
Do it the hard way and it's hard to loose
Only the soft way has a chance of failing
You have to choose

I tried the hard way when I tried to get you
You took the soft way when you said, ""We'll see""
Darling, now I let you do it the hard way
Now that you want me

How could we end it all this way?

And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

Though life is empty, since you have gone
You're always on my mind, though out of sight
It's lonesome through the day and all the night

Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

The Jazz Three-O,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Makes no diff'rence where you are,

The Jazztet,"Your my funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine, 
You make me smile with my heart, 
Your looks are laughable, un-photo-graphical, 
Yet youÂ´re my favorite work of art 
 
Is your figure less than Greek? 
Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak, are you smiling? 
But donÂ´t change a hair for me, 
Not if you care for me.

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1986
The Jazztet,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'

But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

He's a real bad cat, forget I told you so
Silk on the corners of his fancy threads
Double breasted pin stripe coat top press
Fast talkin' good looking flim flam jive
Why he's the kind o' cat that'll make a dead man cry
So look out for Killer Joe!

Killer Joe - Killer Joe 
Killer Joe - love dough

Love of gold
Has made him very cold

I hit the big town an'he turned me roun'
He dazzled me with some pretty jive
Prettier jive than I've ever heard from
Any man alive
He called me ""Baby,"" 'n ""Honey""
Messed wit m'head, tol' me he'd show me
A whole mess o'money
An' what did I get?
That's somethin' I ain't figured out yet

Each woman I meet is like a bead
That's strung on a string
An' I wear 'em like I'm wearin' a necklace
Women love me, n'think lots of me
Really! How can they be so reckless
I tell 'em in front, that I do love money
So - later on - then they won't get funny
When I tighten up an' the scene gets heavy
Times when I laugh they're over
Now they're gonna' feel a draf'
Tell y'truth, if y'mus know
Only thing can save y'is t'bring me lots o'dough

Then goof her carpet ride
She was cute, he had class
Y'knew he had 'er soon s'he made his pass

Big cities are jungles an' men're like leopards
An' women are lost lambs who've
Strayed from kep' herds
An' them leopards - are real wolves
Actin' jus' like shepherds

He's lookin' so han'some
Guaranteed trouble
Y'think you c'n stan' some
He'll furnish it double
