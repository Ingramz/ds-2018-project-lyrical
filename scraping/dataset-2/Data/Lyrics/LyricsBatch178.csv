Dry Kill Logic,"A broken man that waits to die
It's no good but I wonder why
You have left me here
My pride, forgave, rise

Give up, give in, lie down
I never will

As I lay, how I have dreamed of this day
All the things I thought I would say
Now all I can do is pray and wait
Rise

Give up, give in, lie down
I never will

Crucified, I alone lay here
My pride, forgave, rise

Give up, give in, lie down
I never will, never will","Give up, Give in, Lie Down",2001
Dry Kill Logic,"And I will wander on alone, the strength that I will call my own
Inside my mind, there is something left to find
It's like this focus, not no hocus pocus
Bullshit, don't quit before I have to throw a fit
You want this, need this, don't miss all this
Lies, lies, lies, lies

And I wander on alone, the strength that I will call my own
Inside my mind, there is something left to find
It's like this focus, not no hocus pocus
Bullshit, don't quit before I have to throw a fit
You want this, need this, don't miss all this

Your hostile lifestyle contributes to my profile
And this shit, that shit, all a bunch of bullshit
You sit back, lay back, enjoy your fuckin' kickbacks
Explode, unload, just like you're told
Lies, lies, lies, lies

And I will wander on alone, the strength that I will call my own
Everything I say comes back to haunt me
Everything I say will come back to haunt me
Lies, lies, lies, lies
And I will wander on alone, the strength that I will call my own",The Strength I Call My Own,2001
Dry Kill Logic,"I have nothing-everything's taken from me/ Force what's inside out on those that try to hide/ No give all take –this will bend but never break/ I see I hate all the love you try and fake

Chorus: These are the things and the ways that will blind you All alone inside so you follow On your knees do you spit or you swallow? Without you I'm…Lost

3 things ring clear Truth be told is what you fear/ So is it true indifference has spoiled you?/ How can you fed- ignorance in bliss is real?/ Soon you'll be gone and the rest will carry on/ 

Chorus

See the ways I've/ Gone and I've tried/ Never dismissed/ With only one wish/ To be seen/ Having to be heard/ Cause it's never been the same/ Since you ignored all this/ Life passed you by having seen the well is dry/ All in due time-feeding off the compromise/ Fuck that-fuck you/ Careful what you wish is true/ Who will fall last?/ Having seen the failure pass

Chorus",Lost,2004
Dry the River,"'Lo and behold your mother is drinking again
This might be the coldest winter since records began
You were alone and steady with wintry calm
Leading the children softly across the fold

In the morning you march your sisters like soldiers to school
'Cause lo and behold your father has drunk quite a few
You were alone and steady with wintry calm
Somewhere inside the fire of your youth went dark
But you swear blind there is no weight in the water pail
There's no guiding light arcing a line to Bethlehem
And you say 'my love, you take the cards that you're dealt'
And when it's dark outside, you light the fire yourself

Darling when the ice caps melt
When the devils in the bible belt
Don't you cower in your bed
I'll be at the five-four-five
You can meet me at the railway line
Don't look so staid

'Cause we've been through worse than this before we could talk

And the trick of it is, don't be afraid anymore
Oh, the trick of it is, don't be afraid anymore",Bible Belt (Field Recording),2011
Dry the River,"You've made your decision
Now get up and leave
The familiar sting of the woodcutter's swing to the tree

I'll fall in the forest
To elbows and knees
And it won't make a sound
Since there's no-one around here to see

I was prepared to love you
And never expect anything of you

If the spirit has left you baby
Don't lie to yourself
Put them old records on
And admit that it's gone somewhere else

Just because we're beasts of blame by nature
Doesn't mean that you should carry it again
It's a question of needs and not rosary beads in the end

I was prepared to love you
And never expect anything of you
There's no patron saint of silent restraint
Baby there ain't no sword in our lake
Just a funeral wake

You were the coldest star in the sky
Only I couldn't see it: I was blind.

And in comes the black night
Calling your name since you were born
Only I couldn't hear it: I was empty as a drum.

I was prepared to love you
And never expect anything of you
And there's no patron saint of silent restraint
Baby there ain't no sword in our lake
Just a funeral wake",Weights & Measures,2011
Dry the River,"At the bottom of our rotten 
Boat there is a lake.
Things with many limbs are creeping 
Round my teenaged legs.

Late October, old wives' summer, 
I'm all arms and legs.
Spread out like an adolescent 
On my shallow bed.

So, with animal skins around us, we go home.
Home we go",Animal Skins,2012
Dry the River,"Lo and behold! Your mother is drinking again
This might be the coldest winter since records began
You were a low moon, steady with wintry calm
Leading the children softly across the farm

Each morning you'd march your sisters like soldiers to school
Cause lo and behold! Your father had drunk all the fuel
You were a low moon, steady with wintry calm
Somewhere inside the fire of your youth went dark

But you swear blind there is no weight in the water pail
You say ""My love, you take the cards that you're dealt
Cause there's no guiding light arching a line to Bethlehem
If it's dark outside you light the fire yourself""

Darling when the ice caps melt
When the devil's in the bible belt
Don't cower in your bed

I'll be on the 5:45
You can meet me at the railway line
And don't look so scared

Cause we've been through worse than this before we could talk
The trick of it is, don't be afraid any more",Bible Belt,2012
Dry the River,"Two young hearts will meet in the middle,
And a light will flicker on, where there once was none.
Where does love come from?
The bodies in the firmament are spinning like a plate;
I was lost in the fission before you came.

If every constellation above us has a counterpart below,
How are we to know, dear? How are we to know?
Fortune hangs around us like a funerary wreath.
I was down in the heart of the ground beneath.

I could write this down, I could turn this car around.
In the land of mistakes I should lay my crosses down.
And I pray for your health, and I tell myself
""It's the chambers and the valves that pump the sentiment around.""
But I swallow the words and I close my mouth.

Two old hearts will meet in the middle in the autumn of their years.
How did our love grow, dear? How did we get here?
The bodies in the firmament are spinning like a plate;
I was lost in the fission before you came.

I could write this down, I could turn this car around.
In the land of mistakes I should lay my crosses down.
And I pray for your health, and I tell myself
""It's the chambers and the valves that pump the sentiment around.""
But I swallow the words and I close my mouth.

Dry the River,"You are the string in my bow.
Biblical Mary to Joe.
The North isn't true 'til it's leading me to you.
You are the way that I know.

Under the weight of belief
You shiver and shake like a leaf.
But death is a force, not a man on a horse
I'll keep you safe while you sleep.

We fight those demons day in and day out,
Day in and day out, day in and day out
And fight those demons day in and day out
Day in and day out, day in and day out
And fight those demons day in and day out
Day in and day out, day in and day out

Day in and day out, day in and day out",Demons,2012
Dry the River,"Share
Like faithful oxen through the chalk,
With dragging tails of history walk.
Soon confuse the compass and the cross.
Carefully and cursively we fill our traveling diaries with loss.

Beneath an angry Bible flood,
Did you and I first learn to love.
In my father's car we came to know.
And shivered in our painted clothes and paired like every animal below.

As heavy as a history book can be,
I will carry it with me, oh Lord.
And maybe when the bitterness has gone,
There'll be sweetness on our tongues once more.
Barefoot in a rowing boat,
You lose your shoes and freeze your toes.
And say I wear my sorrow like a crown.
And throw your arms around my head, and see it there in gold and red and brown.

As heavy as a history book can be,
I will carry it with me, oh Lord.
And maybe when the bitterness has gone,
There'll be sweetness on our tongues once more.

We'll soon forget our parents' names,
Like dogs will drive the wolves away.
And weep with fingertips opposed,
Like a church where nobody congregates.

But sweetness sings in the pasture,
We throw ourselves on the mercy of the earth.
If sand and salt have the answer,
Then the act itself will be louder than the word.

And I'll be on your side.",History Book,2012
Dry the River,"Night descended like a blanket, on the house
Where I miss you like a limb.
I close the curtains, shun the working and
I put your record on.
I put your record on.

I, the lonely tax collector, never had
Such a feeling before you came.
You descended, I amended
And I need it like a hole in the head.
I need it like a hole in the head.

[Repeat: x2]
You took me to the lion's den
And waited for the beast to begin.",Lion's Den,2012
Dry the River,"I waited by your bedside
And didn't close my eyes all night
I named you like a prayer

It's anybody's guess how
The angel of doubt came down
And crept into your bed

But after we danced to the shipping forecast
The words escaped your mouth
""I know it's gotta stop love, but I don't know how""

Now the stairs forget your shoes
And the gate don't creak for want of you
But the jury's out on me

We're wise beyond our years
But we're good at bad ideas, my love
Or so it seems to be

Shine a little light
Don't wrestle with the night
Don't think about the future now
I know it's gotta stop love but I don't know how

My little one
My kettle drum
I know I had a message at the start

My babel tongue
My come-undone
I know I had a message at the start

My prison kiss
My dying wish
I know I had a message at the start?
But it up and abandoned us, when we were sleeping in our beds

It's anybody's guess how the angel of doubt laid down
Sand beneath our house
I know it's gotta stop love, but I don't know how",New Ceremony,2012
Dry the River,"I used to be a king alone
Like Solomon or Rehoboam
And in the eaves, the Corvidae
Did jealous keep my picture frames
And everything did oxidate in place

But then you came, a single cell
With astrolabe and carousel
And algebra and symmetry
And none of this was lost on me
And I could see how still I'd been before

If I don't eat, I don't sleep at all
Like limbs in procession
Like so many birds
Stampeding like oxen
Our hearts are a herd

I loved you in the bed
I loved you in the best way possible
I loved you in the bed

Did you see the light in my heart?
Did you see the sweat on my brow?
Did you see the fear in my heart?
Did you see me bleeding out?

I loved you in the bed
I loved you in the best way possible
I loved you in the best way possible
I loved you in the best way possible
I loved you in the best",No Rest,2012
Dry the River,"With my family on the right hand side
And your family on the left
We got married in a single bed
We sang shaker hymns

When your warhorse grandfather had sung
The whole damn Song of Solomon
We toasted health in the front room
We whiled away the afternoon

Ma fleur struck down with sickness
The young medicine man's got his face in a book
There's more bottles than the trees in green England
Not one of them will do my love no good

In the morning I'm light
But in the evening I'm heavy now
Try as I might I just can't keep it steady now

My love",Shaker Hymns,2012
Dry the River,"I'm burning like an effigy in here:
The summer's come to haunt me.
And I know I'm not the sacrificial deer,
But I wish you could've warned me

Of the Phrygian Lion,
With his excellent eyesight,
At the gate of our love.

I understood the chemistry of peace;
You covered me in warpaint.
When Moses was a whisper in the reeds
I carved you in the floodplain

By the Phrygian Lion,
With his excellent eyesight,
At the gate of our love.

Under sweet autumnal skins is our myth dispelled.
In your strange and simple way.

[Repeat: x2]
And the Phrygian Lion,
With his excellent eyesight,
Is what makes it our love.

With his excellent eyesight,
At the gate of our love.",Shield Your Eyes,2012
Dry the River,"They're cutting up the bodies
In the med school basement
And I am only watching
On an academic placement
I regulate my breathing
But I can't escape the feeling
That I should not be watching today

Earlier on the stairwell
I couldn't hear your speaking
So I wandered in the hallway
With the ?
But if I knew for certain
That I'd keep my cool in person
Then I would not be watching today

Help me
Whisper it for me
Now that the time's come
I'm losing my nerve, love
Under your spell

I ain't got no reason
To hang around the library
Cause I sure as hell ain't reading
But you might sit beside me
When the streets are wet with darkness
When I walk to your apartment
Then I will only watch you change

Help me
Whisper it for me
I'm losing my nerve, love
And the power of speech

Maybe you'll wanna take me
From the back of the classroom
From all of the geeks

And tell me your secrets
And teach me to speak
And break off your spell
And break off your spell

And now this is over
I promise you I'll go
Wandering tonight
And never come home

And now this over
I promise you I'll leave you
And wandering tonight
Needing you and me

Maybe you'll wanna take me
From the back of the classroom
From all of the geeks
And tell me your secrets
And teach me to speak
And break off your spell
And break off your spell",Med School,2014
Dry the River,"I knelt at the sink,
Like a priest or a prince
Maybe I'm to be a king
And they're waiting for me at Westminster

And the walls are paper thin
I hear the neighbor's arguing
Could you lower your voice?
I would sail my unborn daughter (maybe)

We didn't stage a passion play
Didn't change our given names
Or waltz to our bed
Or need to make a sense

But I see your skin, paler now
Than the host in your mouth
Where the truth never seems to be

Now the burning branch never speaks to me
It whispers like

I don't wanna be your vessel any more
I don't wanna be your vessel any more
These are my words, this is my mouth
I don't wanna be your vessel now

And I may not see the future
But I see its lonely architect
At the door of my house
I don't wanna be your vessel any more
I don't wanna be a vessel of your doubt

Truly I never dreamt
Of all the dumb accoutrement
I would want for myself
For the shelf

I laid it all at your feet
On your neck and your cheek
But the burning branch wouldn't speak to me

I don't wanna be your vessel any more
I don't wanna be your vessel any more
These are my rules, this is my house
I don't wanna be your vessel now

And I may not see the future
But I see its lonely architect
At the foot of my bed
I don't wanna be your vessel any more
Didn't wanna be your vessel anyway",Vessel,2014

DSB,"I've been thinking in between breaks from drinking
About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

CHORUS

We could fake the world out (x3)

Dschinghis Khan,"Der Nebel war so dick und dicht -
Man sah die Hand vor Augen nicht.
Das Schiff fuhr lautlos durch das Meer
Der Steuermann sah gar nichts mehr.
Die Angst ging in der Mannschaft um
Und alle tranken zuviel Rum.
Damit kein Unheil heut' geschieht
Drum sangen sie das alte Lied:

Sinken wir mit Mann und Maus

Denn sie hat nur einen geliebt

Dschinghis Khan,"The boy was asleep in his parents' cabana 
He woke to the thunder of guns in the night 
And there in the dark he saw three Mexicanos 
His father was shouting, ""Boy run for your life!"" 
He prayed and he wept at the sight that he saw 
His mama and papa lay dead on the floor 
They laughed as he ran and they rode on their way 
But how will it be if they see him today 

Oh, Pistolero 
Like an angel of death, you go 
Desperado from Mexico 
Never more will he run 
Oh, Pistolero 
Riding up through the wind and rain 
With revenge burning in your brain 
And your hand on your gun 

A quiet little village was just south of Reno 
Where someone had told him he might find the men 
And there in the stairway, they're guzzling the vino 
The three Mexicanos were laughing again 
He pushed his sombrero away from his face 
His cool cigarillo was pounding in place 
The Mexicans stared at the man they can see 
And wondered who this Pistolero could be 

Oh, Pistolero 
Like an angel of death, you go 
Desperado from Mexico 
Never more will he run 
Oh, Pistolero 
Riding up through the wind and rain 
With revenge burning in your brain 
And your hand on your gun 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooohhh
Pistole, Pistolero
You're the devil's compaÃ±ero 
And the devil's what you see 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooohhh
Pistole, Pistolero
Death will be your compaÃ±ero 
While you follow your dream 

He looked with contempt at the cowardly killers 
His eyes were as cold as the hate in his heart 
""Get ready to fire and viya con dios."" 
He lowered the hand that would blow them apart 
Then suddenly somewhere, the voice of his father 
Was shouting, ""Forgive them and put down your gun!"" 
He knew in his heart that the madness was over 
He climbed on his horse and rode into the sun 

Oh, Pistolero 
Like an angel of death, you go 
Desperado from Mexico 
Never more will he run 
Oh, Pistolero 
Riding up through the wind and rain 
With revenge burning in your brain 
Now it's over and done 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ooohhh

As they sat and sang auld lang syne by the light

And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you

On the field she lay her down to rest
In the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look just to
Feel to touch her long black hair they don't

We don't die, we multiply 'cuz there's a strength in numbers, baby
So I brought some of my family members here today
To talk to y'all about celebrity chicks
So Ching-a-ling, why don't you go ahead
And start this thing off for, what up?

From the moment she wake up, so Hollywood puttin' on her makeup
Can't save her but it's always a fool to keep her caked up
You ask the chick out, tike the say where you gon' take her
And see the, to Vegas or Cali to see the Lakers

She brought that paper, getting over on Cat's major
This at the Billboard's I seen for real name in the pager
Say what, most of these balls they can't fade her
She stay fly, Dolce Gabbanna and Marc Jacobs

You can catch a Melrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats, so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

She got a loan and can't pay the rest
So she got another brother writing a check
I'm talking if she want it bad enough, she will get it glad enough
She can run it, run it at the same time standing in place

And got a long list of giving me
And who will be buying tables man, I'm out of here
But it's to late now, she can see I'm paid now
That I can make it rain now, say now I think I lost a girl

You can catch a Melsrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs
She don't mess with broke cats so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

I see some celebrity chicks everywhere that I be
Everywhere that I've been, the selection or celebrity chicks to see
I see Meeg and I see Mia, I be wantin' to meet 'em
I can see them in the sheets when I imagine me between 'em

I'm straight up off the streets the MC
And I've been waiting to see Heaf
So I could shred it to him rough ride
And I leave it to the back seat of the Beamer

And hear that heatin' and give lil' mama the reason
To send papa to a region, as hot as a pot steamin'
I wanna be the secret that me and Trina keepin'
I'm hood enough for the girl I keep and every toe I Keisha

Good lord Jesus, she can go and pet the jeezer
I just want it for the weekend
I got the power to be 'bout it, I'm not a weakling
I'm trying to fly out to see Jessica Alba in bikini's

Big Smallworld, Ludacris, Steph Ginga
Holla at us when you see us, if you want us, how I need us

You can catch a Melsrose on her shopping spree
Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs.
She don't mess with broke cats, so please have some cheese
Oops, my fault she only mess with celebrities

Celebrity chick, be at the awards in the zone
Celebrity chick, all about them diamonds customs
Celebrity chick, they have to keep them small world steps on
Celebrity chicks, celebrity chicks, celebrity chick

That's right, we don't die, we multiply
Strength in numbers baby we just gettin' started

All new celebrity chicks, anybody with money can relate, baby
Watch your pockets fellas

And it's another Sunday mornin'
Mom's cooking on the stove
And you know where I'm goin' back to the park
Know we gonna stay till it get dark
Homey's cruisin' they rides because they rides is sharp
Hittin' switches, lookin' at all the fly shi...
Drinkin' what we drinkin' and you know it ain't apple juice
Remember those days when we used to kick it
From cruisin' on with you late late when we kick it
Paint the flex, and never want to go home 
Even when the streets lights came on
We still rode till dawn
Three wheel motion, slidin' and coastin' 
Smell the bar-be-que kids running around just acting like fools
It's all good cause it's easy like a Sunday
Sunshine at sunrise, rollin' down a one way all day
And you know it's how we liven it up
And everybody got love and they given it up come on

Let's take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Like they do every Sunday morning
Easy, easy, easy

Everybody just chill, carne asada on the grill
Pop the top on the Cuervo, me and the homey's keep it real
Early Sunday morning waitin' for these ladies to come
No guns, nothin' but fun, one love underneath the Sun
See it's not where you from but how you kick it
Remember back in da days 

On a Sunday afternoon
Me and the crew, just jammin' the oldie tune
The weather was cool and the sky was blue

Daily spinning, hit the fire, chasing pretty woman
Stack loot, and tryna live life flush like crushed lemon
From the beginning to the end this Mexican always puts it down
Point Blank with the lighter shade of brown
Low rides squeak the ground with this pound
With familia all around is how we all get down
No scrappin' you know it happenin'
Keep the heat burning, rainy or stormy
And keep it easy like Sunday morning

Let's take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Like they do every Sunday morning
Easy, easy, easy

I remember those Sunday mornings, shine up the ride
Puff the good feel cause we chill all night
Hit the streets from (?) to Manobello
Bumpin' them oldies and everybody's mellow
Roll down the window, feel the cool air breeze
Envision all the homey's around making g's
Let's kick on that Sunday cause tomorrow's Monday
L.A. liven homey cause it's the realest homey
From glocks to blocks all the streets be hot
Tricks jock chrome spinnin' if your car is hot
Bumping down, side to side pancakin' the street
System bangin' down the Paramount with cops by me
Phat Bandit with the homey D double T 
On a Sunday marinate and rollin' through streets
No tickets played it cool, just got a warning
'Cause everybody's laid back on a Sunday morning

Let's take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Like they do every Sunday morning

Closer the better

Why we keep coming back for more

Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
Woah, we are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're making me to go, you're begging me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way, or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love, and I'm chained to your side

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

And if I'm losing control will you turn me away or touch me deep inside?
And before this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this could die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
No promises, no demands love is a battlefield
We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long, both of us knowing

Be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

Wouldn't listen when they warned me.

Wouldn't stand back, for neither love nor money.
 
Thirty minutes after my ship set sail,
She put up a sign and my house began to wail.
But, why, why, why I couldn't see it in my little girl's eyes?
She had such a way to fool me, Lord she had a way to fool me.
And I would ask the woman, ""Can you find it in yourself to please stand back?
You ain't gonna rule me.""

I reached out, threw the Ace of Spades.
I put her on a train to the Everglades.

And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say ""cuckoo""

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Regretfully they tell us Cuckoo, cuckoo
But firmly they compel us Cuckoo, cuckoo
To say goodbye

Cuckoo!

To you

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I´d like to stay and taste my first champagne

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye

The sun has gone to bed and so must I

Duane Chase,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I´ve heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I´ll sing once more",The Sound of Music,1965

Duane Chase,"Let´s start at the very beginning
A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-be-see
When you sing you begin with do-re-mi

The first three notes just happen to be
Do-re-mi, do-re-mi

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do (oh-oh-oh)

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
So-do!

Now children, do-re-mi-fa-so and so on
are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads
you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up
Like this

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re

Can you do that?

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Now, put it all together

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re, So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Good!

But it doesn´t mean anything

So we put in words
One word for every note
Like this

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Together!

When you know the notes to sing

Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995
Duane Eddy,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony

Duane Slaymaker,"There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, Brandy, fetch another round
She serves them whiskey and wine

The sailors say: ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea""

Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of the man that Brandy loved

He came on a summer's day
Bringin' gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

The sailors say: ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea""

Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its ragin' glory
But he had always told the truth, Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say ""Brandy, you're a fine girl"" (you're a fine girl)
""What a good wife you would be"" (such a fine girl)
""But my life, my lover, my lady is the sea""
It is, yes it is,

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love,2004

Duane Steele,"The trouble with you
You're always looking down that highway
For a better place to go
The trouble with me
I'm always looking back behind me
On the shoulder of the road

The trouble with love is it has no sense of direction
Our paths were never meant to cross
The signs were so clear
But in a solitary second we were lost

The trouble with hearts
You never know where they will lead you
Until you're long gone
One day I woke to realize how much I need you
Though that may not be what I want

The trouble with love is it don't care what you were planning
Or what you thought you were waiting for
I'm shaking my head from side to side
But I'm still praying for more, oh more trouble with love

Love couldn't see we were a million worlds apart
It simply reached across the night, and baby here we are

The trouble with love is it has no sense of direction
Our paths were never meant to cross.
The signs were so clear
But in a solitary second we were lost

The trouble with love is it don't care what we were planning
Or what you thought you were waiting for
I'm shaking my head from side to side
But I'm still praying for more,  oh more

Na na na naaa na na

A word from the wise, don't try to make life on your own
Remember that Jah Jah's by your side 

For I was a soul who lost 
And my life was in dismay
For among evil forces in which I played, oh

Guns and ammunition 
Were my chosen way of life
With God-fearin' people I choose to strife

For all of the lives that are taken 
They can never be replaced
But still Jah Jah chose to remember my face

Though I never lived like he wanted 
I'm still mindful of what he taught me
So now I beg and plea 
I'm on my bending knees
God Father you rescued me
I've got the scars to show 
I barely made it along life's road 
'Cause when my life got dark he was the only spark
He was the light at the end of the road

When I was young boy 
Growin' up in August Town 
We ate from the same pot 
We were idlings all around

From corner to colour and corner
From rockers to jungle Kintyre
Rising to dread heights and river all around 

And then the footbal ground became my battlefield
And my life seemed so surreal
People were fallin' all around
But Jah helped me to stand my ground
Only Jah, only Jah 
Could've helped me to stand my ground

Though I never lived like he wanted 
I was mindful of what he taught me
So now I beg and plea 
I'm on my bending knees
'Cause Father you rescued me
And I've got the scars to show 
I barely made it along life's road 
'Cause when my life got dark he was the only spark
The light at the end of the road

Never lived to please him 
I never lived like I should
Oh, Father you rescued me 
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I've lived and I've learnt 
I've made mistakes along the way
Now I beg for forgiveness
Each day as I try to pray

So take it from me son 
You can change the world today
And I'm living proof 
Living proof that crime doesn't pay

For I'd never lived like he wanted 
I was mindful of what he taught me
So now I beg and plea 
I'm on my bending knees
'Cause Father he rescued me
And I've got the scars to show 
I barely made it along life's road

How could this be

Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

How did love slip away

That you are not alone

Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms

Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

It never works out, so he smiles, fakes it
And for my brothers overseas, playing in the sand
Cause they can't afford a degree, I do it for the
For the father, that gets laid off so
Now that light bill never gets paid off

Because she works three jobs and can't afford to quit

Dub Inc.,"J'ai envie de métissage pour des hommes vrais
Et tous ceux qui ont de la rage, vas-y laisse les
Ouvre ton rivage à la différence qu'on aime pour des hommes vrais

Car demain sera métis, nous sommes la première esquisse
Intolérance, racisme il faudra bien que cela finisse
Enfant couleur réglisse, ou clair comme de l'anis
Il y a tant de saveurs de quoi rester optimiste
Mais entre deux cultures comme un équilibriste
On marche sur un fil et on subit leurs lois
Ici face de paria, là-bas tête de touriste
Montre moi le bon chemin pour chez moi
Non ce n'est pas un fardeau
Même si parfois j'ai peur
Que la couleur de la peau
Remplace la vraie valeur
Pourtant cela coule de sens comme une évidence
C'est lorsqu'on mélange les différence que les cultures avancent
Donc j'en ai fait ma force, qu'ils restent dans leur ignorance
Car je sais qu'est c'est une chance, quoiqu'ils pensent

La France est métisse c'est pour ça qu'on l'aime
Faut qu'on réagisse sur le monde quoi qu'il advienne
Une souffrance, un supplice mes angoisses sont les tiennes
J'lève très haut c'foutu drapeau ma terre d'exil mes idéaux
Mes couleurs et mes peines pèseront sur vos fardeaux
J'métisse les styles, j'maîtrise les flows, mes origines et mon ego
Mes racines sont toutes celles qui porteront le flambeau
Mon nom est inscrit sur une pièce d'identité
Mon coeur a deux pays qui suis-je en vérité?
Bénin, France, Algérie, oh laissez moi chanter
Que là-bas ou ici je suis toujours étranger
Fraternité à fleur de peau est-ce une habitude?
Liberté, égalité trop d'incertitude
Comment guérir les maux? La haine en nous s'est forgée
Et tous deviennent raciste la France a changé

Libre de vivre en laissant en bas
Les regards hostiles, enfant de la terre regarde en toi
Ils ne sont pas crédibles, la génétique défie ces lois
Têtes A.D.N. bientôt des recherches pour la foi
Human race

Citoyens du monde, restons groupés
Que les nationalistes soient débarqués
Car ceux-ci ne voient pas que le monde a déjà changé
Et que même leur sang s'est maintes fois mélangé
Il n'y a qu'une seule race, celle de l'humanité
Le monde est un village fait de communautés
Si les frontières s'effacent, ne sois pas effrayé
Nos gènes s'entrelacent, c'est pour évoluer!",Métissage,2008

Je ressens souvent ta bienveillance même au coeur du chaos
J'ai perdu l'insouciance mais je reprendrai le flambeau

Forgive him if he didn't care

With on beyond old ""how are you""
With on beyond old ""I love you""

And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo beach, I watch the sun go down

From nine till five I have to spend my time at work
The job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach some day

On a silent summer evening
The sky's alive with light
Building in the distance
Surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach
There's not a soul around

Too big to fit in this skin, this skin I'm in, because I'm a lover
Bring my freedom!
I won't live locked up dead, until life again, because I'm a lover

For the first time I opened my eyes, and feel alive that's 'cause I'm a lover

We're not alone in this psychrodrome, but I know that I don't want to lose ya,

Be that king and try to be that queen and I wouldn't save ya!

Bring my freedom!
Got to save this poisoned feeling, my mind ain't clean because I'm a lover
(A lover)
Dreaming won't heal, here's a clue, I am here for you, I'll be your provider

We're not alone in this psychrodrome, but I know that I don't want to lose ya,
Afraid of the walls behind closed doors well I'm just a baby in your arms
I'm not alone I've got this microphone and I know that I ain't gonna fool ya,
We watching fear, read a magazine, just to keep our minds erased
Keep our minds erased!

Dubble Trubble,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love is gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?

When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more

Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here

Can I get a hell yeah?

Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase

We've been through it (yes)
We got real shit (yes)

Would you lie? (no)
Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
Cause I didn't know you
Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in

But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'

So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record, what
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second, bump. bump
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist

Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races

Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

And plenty honey's involved
The sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return
Of the-the Doc and Shady, no one could do it better

We'll come through the side

'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

Yeah, haha, still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha

Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch

I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I skeet it up, straight beat it up..
... And I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n

Guys want to wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything

Dubee,"Well let me introduce myself
A young go getter mind locked on havin' wealth
Livin' wild with this thug style, I got these hoes
Tuggin' all on my Avirex clothes
A young brown Mafioso, I put my foot through the door
Infrared light smilin' title, desert eagle 4-4
Layin' Cubans on the floor, 
I send my ghetto troopers to the mother load 
To snatch a bottle of A-1 yo,
I'm hearin' rapid fire through the house
Eternal warfare with heavy weaponry
Me and my soldiers ain't scared,
You get a bullet to the head in trainin' if you don't aim for the head
So I know my young shooters left somebody dead around the corner
Plus got the yola out the trunk bendin' over
Its daytime I can't wait till it turns to night 
Cause that's the time when ghetto stars come out and shine

Quicker than outlaws I draw on haters with glocks and techs
Buckin' at undercover agents dippin' off quick in the lex
That's my trigger finger fuck 'em lets bring the heat to the street
Gave him one to the head and there he dead eternally asleep
Deep in this cold world where there's no love, what the fuck should I do?
People be killin' they family for yola not trustin' in you
But now I'm teachin' you some ackrite 
With forty-fives and flashlights
Fuckin' around with thug niggas
And drug dealers
Manajetuahs and jaguars getting chopped in the drop
Killin' haters that act hard nigga like it or not
Cause it's a hold up, your hands go up real slow
Should've told ya that I'm a soldier who kills hoes
Pullin' no mercy on these busters ain't no callin' the cops
And my nine is comin' to fuck you nigga ballin' or not

I'm off in this shit like Mr. Hanky, Janky, but when it gets stanky
Time to rape fiends, my niggas take G's, make G's, but it ain't free
Pimp niggas laced me when I was a baby, how to slang D
And stained me, a suck ya up nigga lip locked but I can't speak
Now it's crazy, niggas be lazy, imbecilic, milli vanillic, 
Can't speak on it but I feel it, I'm the villain stealin' scrillion
Convo be thrillin' your brain waves get to healin'
Just to reach out and touch you 
train of thought make a killin', Soldiers willin', 
So I do it for thug niggas and drug dealers through the snow and rain
Focused on fetti fuck how it came, steady remain
Paper over hoes, and stay on my toes 
And air these niggas out like sandals, 
Blow 'em out like candles
Handle my business and listen to my theezo
And in this thuggin' category I keep it sharp as a needle
Breathe on busters and bust the tech and make it go blah blah
Funkin' with cops and duckin' the law play boy it won't stop",It Don't Stop,1999
Dubee,"[ VERSE 1 ]
I been tryin to flip the script and take this rap thing to the next page
But the federalies got me travellin on _Con Air_ like I'm Nicholas Cage
Did 4 years, 4 months in the feds, but couldn't get no peace
Released from the belly of the beast, but the 'ralies put a nigga on a leash
The rules and regulations they inflicted, had me restricted, paroled
Kept me from blowin bomb, knowin and I'm hooked and addicted for sho'
Now how am I to be an MC when I can't get my travel on?
Can't bring no babby home, cause every morning I'm gettin sweated by Babylon
The only way out is to max out and give these fools back they lease
Fuck parole, probation, piss test and supervised release
I'ma bring a calendar, bounce, blow up like Chernobyl
Kirk out and get mobile and do this thing global
Worldwide rompin, stompin in other nations
Blowin bomb with Jamaicans, and sippin Dom with them Haitians
Kickin major flows, have Asian hoes, play the romp, maxin for 'ternity
Kick gravel, travel, see what they know about me in ???

[ CHORUS: Dubee ]
	We be global
	Touch land and that sand over the seas
	Blew off of coco leaves, releasin verbal telekinese
	For sheez, clickulate with players
	Under the stairs, to the Himalayas
	Kinda thick, layer for layer				(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Sometimes I sit and reminisce about life in '87
When I was doin my thug game, brain ten miles higher than heaven
One-track minded, blinded by the game and quick change
Not knowin across the way-way niggas were doin big thangs
And it's a shame, cause before I hit the f-e-d's
I didn't know about them niggas in Cuba and them sisters in Belize
Now I'm curious - is Belizan pussy the bomb?
When they blow, do they hum, and how quick do they come?
Boy, it's time to hit the friendly skies and fly like a seagull
Post up in spots where the pot's good and legal
Eat tacos in Mexico with cats named Flaco
And catch a red-eyed flight the same night to Morocco
Top-nacho, chasin superbad scrilla villains
Then bounce to the Philippines and get mo' head than guillotines
Boy, life ain't nothin but fat checks and head sex
So I'ma get mobile, stay global like FedEx

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I was a cell dweller, eatin Top Ramen and sardines
Now it's Taiwanese Japanese cuisine
Barefooted, fitted, sippin on sake
Blow on big hashis while I feast on teriaki
International is how I'm smashin, hoe
A cutthroat nigga that will blast and roll
I took a trip to Queens to see Jazz and Preme
They had a nigga blowin brown, said it wasn't no green
But that ain't no thang, cause in Tacoma
I blew bomb till I was in a coma
And in Seattle my partner Chilly Chill
Got that purple leaf dank that really real
I'm global, boy, I be travellin
Gettin further in the air like a javelin
Chirpitch, kirkitch, finna bounce to San Coy
Mac Dre, global, holler at your boy

Dubee,"Man I'm a coke rap spitter
A hair pin trigger
A crime rhyme dealer
Is illa but on the rilla
Spit around tornado lust
For the words
Rap it up like dope,
Fly like a bird
Nothing but baking soda the
Motorola do it well
Up in your face man with something
To sell
I'm like a chronic vision pigeon tiga
Just spinnin time with 45, 357s
And 9's
My figure 8, its real its not fake
Strawberry soda garlic bread and
Steak
Ahead in the chase and hide
Behind the wheel
You talk more money and we can
Make a deal
(make a deal square ass n*)

I'm not a screw face, I keep my
Boots laced
And listen to the homies brag about
They gun case
They off taste, crank beat with more bass
My court date, and I came in hella late
The cross game, wear rings with no chains
Holla at the guard if you a rap cat mane
Nickel plated, now the engergys penetrated
I put that on my life I'm glad you never made it
Raw hide, all in my blood line
You never find a drug like me and no kine
Don't hide, cause it makes it more divine
To put you in the firing line on valentines
February, or was it January
I lose my memory when it come to you canaries
Its necessary, on guard with what you carry
Split the middle of the swicher then add the blueberry

I'm not a damn fool, I live bay rules
Bay slang, and I'm doin my bay thang
Make change, get bread to kick game
I knows you got ass but yous a lame freak dame
No shame, and I'm greedy to the brain
You know the pit bull is off the chicka-chicka-chain
Crate-a-lane, on the freeway of pain
I don't spend dollars on expenseive champagne
Rip hearts and I pound the sky larks
Petal to the medal in my wu-tang clarks
New suede, from the stage to the grave
Hot days, means pistols in the shade
It ain't strange, motherfucker you sell cane
Add a little color to the picture frame
The rhyme cheetah, throw on the wife beater
T-shirt jeans tennis shoes didn't see ya

And this analogy, is a new strategy
And this academy is headed for a tragedy
It sounds to me that you're tryin to break free
And snakes like me don't allow that see
At close range you can see my vertigo
Venom in the soul and I'm ready to let it go
With no control, man it can grow like a rose
And I'm standing right there in my Filmo' pose
When a child cries, in the heart a father dies
Punch you in the eye to let you know that you alive
Lethal, multiply to equal
Bumpin see-bo on the way to Tahoe
I'm stage left, at the store remian chef
Man cook it up and keep it from the A-T-F
The barracuda, yo the rhyme roof shoota
Runnin down the stairs of the project do a
Kamakaze, rip your stargens for a hobby
And rip it in the lobby man while kickin it with bobby
You say the word, then here come the words put

Dubplate Drama,"Ohhh..
uh ha.....

[Verse One]
I grew up in H-town living life on the blocks
From then that's when I became unorthodox
I use to tie knots in ma socks
filled them with rocks And I'd swing your jaw if you gave bad looks

Now I, haven't changed still slightly deranged
Still slightly outraged and I feel insane
At way I contain so much pain
like a feen Life is real do you know what I mean?

Its like, ever since the days I was young
man was bussing full clips and the run of your tongue And
in my hood I see mans get worked
Then ah man would come back n say that man got murked

Yea, I can say that my live's been hard
Six of us lived in ah two bedroom yard
So I keep this in mind full well knowing I know where I've been
so I know where I'm going

[Chorus]
You don't know where I've been
You don know what I've been through
So how can you judge me?
You don't know about the life that I got
You don't know what its like to live in my slot.
this worlds gone mad and it don't seem right
every night I pray to god please turn out the light
that would be my one wish!
(that would be my one wish)
(that would be my one wish)
that would be my one wish

[Verse 2]
I got that H-A-see blood in me
I rep my east side I'm that ghetto gully mind chick
born in E5 And I've always moved
with mans ever since I was young
'cause these girls are too bitchy and their mind set is long

Yea I learnt how to move and stay wise on the street
'cause my older boy's showed me how a girl should roll deep
I saw moves get moved, watch man move what they move
To survive out here you got to do what you do

Hustling on the corner shotting work
'cause when your grinding you gota make shit work
'cause life is hard and life is real
And mans now ah days don't care when they kill

Boys young as sixteen
life's taken and gone and I sit back and sigh
what the fuck is going on This is wrong
to the families of lost ones I'm sorry R.I.P to babys Jessica and Holly

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse three]
The hood holds loyalty
the hood holds faith The hood holds struggle
and the hood holds rage
The hood holds haters that wana grudge me
But I don't watch you only god here can judge

So I don't care if you like me or hate
'cause lately a lot of heads wana vibe crazy
But I ain't here to make new friends
Shystie is jus here to make ah means to ah end

So, ima be the reason why you step up your pace in this race
Ima take every chicks fan base
And ima be the realist girl in the game
Ima be the reason people forget your name

'cause I'm big inner dis
big bad inner dis
And I don't care who likes me and whose pissed
'cause Shystie's here and I'm repping it for London
I'm never gona be ah pop Emcee, you must be dumb man

Your letter warm, I'm holding tight
Said you want to see me soon
I phoned you late this afternoon

The bar we first met seems alive
I'll see you there at eight tonight
Shouldn't think like this
But is there something in us meeting now?

All this time, I've waited knowing
Though I've changed my heart's still showing

I'll wear a new dress, wash my clothes
I'll wear the earrings that you chose
If the man you've grown to be
Is more Morrison than Morrisey
I'll tell you straight as we undress
That things got better when you left
And though I've banned your name since then
I'll call it with my dying breath

No one else would have me
So I've made this day of all days

And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say
 
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely heaven must have sent her my way
Skies above me never were as blue as her eyes
And she loves me, who would want a sweeter surprise
 
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Now truthfully, I believe that I'm the tightest nigga musically
Usually I wouldn't brag but I've been bustin since my puberty
In a Cadillac that ride with five guls and they nudity
You can bring yo' best words, I bet I still outrep you brutally
Low down dirty and beautiful, who want to test my verbal side?
Boy I'm fly-n-tie(?), especially when I let that herbal fly
Southern fried, cool kid, some of that country culture
Leave you dead, peep your bread, a value meal for them busters

{Bubba Sparxxx}
Shit I'm steppin off in the tunnel with a funnel of Keystone
Ate a ten-strip of blotter, been wiggin all week long
y'all keep on, with that jibbery jabbery slippin out happily
Expose you pretty hoes with a dose of this hospitality
Gravity in yo' trunk while yo' producers forgot the bump
We introduce you to these high hats like that, yo' spot is krunk
This blunt, I put the fire to, I really do admire you
But even though Bubba dirty, he certainly fin' to shine too

{Chorus: Duddy Ken}
I hope you can swim if you want to battle
You're up shit creek without a paddle
Whatcha gon' do now, grab my pen and slaughter
Bubba Ken and Duddy Ken, take'm to the water
I hope you can swim if you want to battle
You're up shit creek without a paddle

See momma named me lil' devil, that ain't no relation to Satan
Ain't got no patience for hatin, I'll be at the station awaitin
the arrival of that DJ that don't replay unless we pay
I stormed the beach like D-Day, now that bitch play, when we say
I'm with D.K., ain't no N.Y., and we been fly, since gin (?)
Sips bourbon with a twist, Bubba lurkin in your midst
Without my dick perverted this cause y'all was smellin vaginal
Been bumped wrong, one too many times for actin rational

{Duddy Ken}
D.K. I bomb folks, man I throw heat like I was John Smokes
But mine from a gun though, change yo' name to John Doe
Shit, have your whole family Mourning like Alonzo
Then go back to my condo, so I can let my kind grow
Is you blind folk? Why you can't see bigger thangs?
Don't rup on this stage, cause ain't no bitch-ass nigga mayn
And my mob ain't either, don't make me have to play a song
with my lil' chrome heater, bet that and (?) punk nigga
Now get it get it crunk, like jumpoffs, B.K. they trippin
I'm fin' to go on and take one of they lumps off, cause I ain't slippin
Just hippin you to this real shit, so get in where you fit
Sittin on lean, off that Jim Beam, fin' to throw a fit
From A.T.H. to Atlanta, Louisiana, Savannah
Sippin gin and Tropicana while Georgia play Alabama
Might stumble over a freestyle and pick up like a scanner
Turn the mics off lost, somebody call the light boss

::Chorus::

{Bubba Sparxxx}
Aww shit
Boy I'm out here chasin daddy lucid, shit Satan produced it
Switched from duce-duces to substance abuse nuisance
Fuckin these loose gooses, raw dick, we all sick
I'm goin skinny dippin after y'all hit (aww shit)
That country fuckin Bubba hit his head and lost his mind
Eight grand for a Roley? That only just bought you time
I'm in line waitin to grind, it's too cloudy for me to shine
I'ma keep this bitch krunk, get rowdy, while you recline
And in time, I'ma jump this fuckin ship, and run and get
my crown in every town, I lay it down, when I spit
This shit, is so much more than white folks and white thangs
or black folks and black thangs, just bounce if the track bangs
You lack game, Bubba got that shit goin two for fifty
Communicatin cool with them country folk, strictly
Just hit me, on the beep, whenever, cause I don't sleep
Two thousand, every week, take a peep, before you leap

The heart for humility, that ego perplexes
Strength, will and honor, a hero's possessions
On the road to destiny I need no directions
Far to Southerners, the best man the winner
And only this morning does the best man remember
Fighters seen the weak, more success than inventors
And a saint never ever suffers less than a sinner
But I'm proud to admit that this shit no longer
Phases or amazes me, I only grow stronger
At any given moment this world can so long ya
Box you up, drop you in the dirt and slow song ya

Man it's funny how God can be when you work hard to achieve
It's still slaw nigga (*vocal scratch*), spittin that Pac liquor
This is straight up pocket party, your summer that not nigga
classical rhymes got most cats tryna battle with Ken
Bet they won't ""go up shit creek without they paddle again""
Come down to my town, bet you won't visit Athens again
And I write that hard har, roll like I got crack in my pen
But since your so happy that things go exactly as planned
Don't clack if we land, then it's crack a lackin again
Then most of these clowns up outta the pay
All I need is a stout, clean your coolatta and day
And the day that I'm able to finally get outta the game
What this hip hop has become is what the New South gotta change
Bring it back

What difference does it make, who I'm affiliated with
Cause if you love 'em, how could you have really hated this
All the groundbreakin these hillbilly maders did
Wasn't no room for +Bubba Talk+ until we made it did
I flow for Jimmy Mathis on that bus route daily
And for momma June and all she fuss about lately
I'm a get it white, if your hairless for Governor
I'm tellin y'all the yanks ain't prepared for this southerner
see-Dub certified, DF, dignitary
Beat Club, they applaud, New South, visionary
In spite of the efforts y'all made to pigeon hole me
I rose from the pig shit without a smidgen on me
At 15, 90, Adam's drive makin miracles
For these many much, yes and everyday is pivotal
I'm no entertainer so what I say is literal
You say you ""New South"", faker tat it on your genitals

There goes that man
Girl this ain't no kind of allusion, it's really that man
There goes that man

[Verse 1 - Duddy Ken]
Hey, when we step up out the play man
We bring that monster A game
Switchin or say through lanes
Green on my shirt like Tulane
Drunk and drivin in two lanes
Dirt Reynolds, that's the new name
Dip out and handle a few thangs
Bet I come back a rich man
Some of these cats is bitch made
My shift be like a switch blade
The doors, open this way
That man, went that a way
Chase cheese like a rat race
Push my button like there
And that's gonna get you nowhere
Just like you fuckin yourself
I've been all over the globe and hit a lot little spots (spots)
Met bitches that love the nigga, that's if she fucked me or not (not)
Trappin what's in my spot (spot)
Not movin, just got me no dough
It's like my money was slow mo'
I bought a car and got Mobile
My city's up on my shoulders
I'm takin life as we know of
Tranformin into a whole 'nother world and time
Beat up tracks and murder rhymes
Don't dare close the curtain, cause I'm just beginnin
Bubba was the beginnin but bitch I'ma end it
Hey, I'm that man, man

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit, I'm a Dodge Rammer, god damn if I ain't two and 0
I'm competin and momma's eatin, so am I losin? No
But shit was movin slow, I had to switch machines up
Destiny don't always match with the shit you dreamed up
But Bubba ain't no cream puff
In my life, I've seen much
Held the thrills and the spills
Through it all, I kept it trill
Guarantee I never will ever feel as helpless
As I did these last couple years, I know you felt this
Really don't expect no forgiveness for ""Deliverance""
Then again I offer no apologies, I meant the shit
Cause I lived the shit, truth is truth and that's the end of it
I'm up and runnin, bet my jersey's in the rafters when I sit
Watched it when I get a hit, everybody benefits
I'm far removed from innocence, a year older than twenty-six
Pussy just remember this, I ain't chose the path I'm on
If you want it, come and get it, as that man I stand alone (oh!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Duddy! Haha
Uh huh, hey say, hey let the guns play
I just came with ""Me, Myself, and I"" like Beyonce
Let these suckers run they coffee coolers, I'm the truest
Country motherfucker, bust and kill the talk, it's time to do it
Everything your idol do it, I can do it cock eyed
Three albums supplied, once I have not lied
That should mean a lot right?
Maybe when they open up the books, I can get a look
You must admit, I'm dope as fuck, true I ain't devoted much
Of my raps to dope, I'm just a little to preoccupied with the truth, you know what's up
Sorry but I know this much, Bubba K is sen-sat-ional
That shit ain't no bull
Ain't no bull that I can't pull, I am him
That'll be the case, if I'm ridin rims or shinin them
Bubba baby, more trouble baby, ha I love you hate me
Ask your lady, is it maybe her that I've been pluggin lately

Dirt Reynolds, that's the new name
Dip out and handle a few thangs
Bet I come back a rich man
Some of these cats is bitch made
My shift be like a switch blade
The doors, open this way
That man, went that a way
Chase cheese like a rat race
Push my button like there
And that's gonna get you nowhere
Just like you fuckin yourself
I've been all over the globe and hit a lot little spots (spots)
Met bitches that love the nigga, that's if she fucked me or not (not)
Trappin what's in my spot (spot)
Not movin, just got me no dough
It's like my money was slow mo'
I bought a car and got Mobile
My city's up on my shoulders
I'm takin life as we know of
Tranformin into a whole 'nother world and time
Beat up tracks and murder rhymes
Don't dare close the curtain, cause I'm just beginnin
Bubba was the beginnin but bitch I'ma end it
Hey, I'm that man, man

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit, I'm a Dodge Rammer, god damn if I ain't two and 0
I'm competin and momma's eatin, so am I losin? No
But shit was movin slow, I had to switch machines up
Destiny don't always match with the shit you dreamed up
But Bubba ain't no cream puff
In my life, I've seen much
Held the thrills and the spills
Through it all, I kept it trill
Guarantee I never will ever feel as helpless
As I did these last couple years, I know you felt this
Really don't expect no forgiveness for ""Deliverance""
Then again I offer no apologies, I meant the shit
Cause I lived the shit, truth is truth and that's the end of it
I'm up and runnin, bet my jersey's in the rafters when I sit
Watched it when I get a hit, everybody benefits
I'm far removed from innocence, a year older than twenty-six
Pussy just remember this, I ain't chose the path I'm on
If you want it, come and get it, as that man I stand alone (oh!)

[Chorus]

Duddy! Haha
Uh huh, hey say, hey let the guns play
I just came with ""Me, Myself, and I"" like Beyonce
Let these suckers run they coffee coolers, I'm the truest
country motherfucker, bust and kill the talk, it's time to do it
Everything your idol do it, I can do it cock eyed
Three albums supplied, once I have not lied
That should mean a lot right?
Maybe when they open up the books, I can get a look
You must admit, I'm dope as fuck, true I ain't devoted much
of my raps to dope, I'm just a little to preoccupied with the truth, you know what's up
Sorry but I know this much, Bubba K is sen-sat-ional
That shit ain't no bull
Ain't no bull that I can't pull, I am him
That'll be the case, if I'm ridin rims or shinin them
Bubba baby, more trouble baby, ha I love you hate me
Ask your lady, is it maybe her that I've been pluggin lately

Dude Mowrey,"Elroy was an old man
And I was only thirteen
But he was my best friend
And he could make a guitar sing

On hot summer evenings
I'd play along with him
Settin' up on his front porch
While the june bugs beat on the screen and I'd say

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

The ring finger of his left hand
Was buried out in texas
From the time when his work glove
Got hung in a cotton gin

But it didn't slow him down none
He could play like lightning
He'd fly through a breakdown
And then sit back and grin - when I'd say

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

I said ""I've been workin' on that lick you played last week
I think it goes like this
He said, ""Sakes alive, son, I think you've flat got her down""
Now you can work on this""
And I said

Hold on
Hold on Elroy
Hold on Elroy - run that by me again

Now the years have gone by
I play along with the best now
And owe that old man
For this good life of mine

When his heart was failin'
I flew back home to see him
We set up on his front porch
And I said one last time
Won't you

Go ahead and keep beating around the bush, beating around the bush
I see with my own blue eyes also and take care for what I see
Believe me I've seen a lot, I participated in wars
I've seen so many, so many things
With the help of us could have been set right

Don't you wanna enhance your intelligence
Don't you wanna stand up for your own
Don't you wanna see with your own two eyes
Only you can lift you up, by the will of God
The powers that be, the energy within your soul

I hang on the edge of this universe, singing off key
Talking too loud and bracing myself to cushion the fall
I shall tumble into deep space never in this former with this feeling
To return to earth, it is not tragic

I shall spound to the black hole losing scared limbs
Internal organs, severing my naked soul
That in the next galaxy with only my essence embracing myself
As I fall into the ill minded mode

No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, oh, we're all alone

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be all right
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Owe it to the wind

Dudu Fisher,"There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone

Here they talked of revolution
Here it was they lit the flame
Here the sang about tomorrow
And tomorrow never came

From the table, through the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
And I can here them now

The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
And the lonely barricade
At dawn

Oh my friends, my friends forgive me
That I live and you are gone
There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on

Phantom faces at the window
Phantom shadows on the floor
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will meet no more

Don't ask me what your sacrifice was for
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will sing no more",Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,2009
Dudu Nobre,"Judia de mim, judia
Seu eu não sou merecedor desse amor

Se eu choro
Será que você não notou 
É a você que eu adoro 
Carrego esse meu sentimento
Sem ressentimento

É, a cana quando é boa
Se conhece pelo nó
Assovio entre os dentes
Uma cantiga dolente
Entre cacos e cavacos
Sobrei eu, duro nos cascos
Bem curtindo pelo cheiro dos sovacos

Judia de mim
E quem dança qualquer dança
A bonança não sabe o que é
Desconhece a esperança
No falso amor leva fé
Quem de paz se alimenta
Se contenta com migalhas
Não se aflige e corrige
As próprias falhas",Judia de Mim,2004
Dudu Nobre,"Esse feijão tá cheiroso
Foi Dona Nenem

Deixa o feijão cozinhar
Bota lenha na fogueira
Nenem
Não deixa o feijão queimar

Entre a cana e o tira-gosto
Era mês de agosto
Lembro muito bem
Fui na favela do Rato
Como convidado de Dona Nenem
Estranhei o movimento
Mas pensei por dentro
Vai dar tudo bem
Mas tropecei num tijolo
Esbarrei num crioulo
Que caiu também
Cheio de fome o negão
Lá no chão esperando
O feijão da Neném

Bota lenha na fogueira, Neném
Deixa o feijão cozinhar
Bota lenha na fogueira, Nenem
Não deixa o feijão queimar

O negão queria briga
Porém a fadiga não deu condição
Vi que era malandragem
Era pilantragem, era tudo armação
Pediram uma ajuda
Me deram a bermuda
A pá, a enxada e o carrinho de mão
Onde se lia a mensagem
Primeiro a laje depois o feijão",O Feijão de Dona Neném,2004

Muitos negros fugitivos
Afugentaram a cor
Ai meu Deus, que paraíso
Onde não havia tronco
E nem trancador

Trilha de mato fechado
De pés descalçados
Descansavam das perseguições
Dos barões do café e do capitão malfeitor
É negro intocado no mato
É difícil de achar meu senhor

Mas um dia, o negro véio disse
Que Zumbi ficou ferido
Houve uma grande batalha
E o guerreiro foi traído
Era 20 de novembro quando o Céu anuviou

Um rei na defesa do negro
Um rei por total liberdade
Um rei que do início ao final
Só buscou igualdade

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

E dove c'era Giuda sò che c'eri tu 
E dove il piombo buca garantisci tu 
C'è mia sorella nuda nella tua tv 

E ci si creda o no per me sei il diavolo

Tu resti a casa e mandi a uccidere

Io e mio fratello separati dalla nascita 
Casualità geografica in equità scolastica 
Futuro disegnato sulla plastica 
Nella porta del cesso tra un cazzo ed una svastica 
Io e mio fratello la differenza d'età che sta 
Tra ascoltare punk e guardare bim bum bam 
Tra occupare un csa e andare all'acquafun 
Tra la militanza e il mito dell'america 
I miei amici con le nike e I suoi con le clarks 
Prima pere e poi I trip ce ne han fatti fuori la metà 
Sopravvissuti per pagare la vita ad ore 
Tutti illusi che sia il male minore 
Figli psicopatici della famiglia cuore 
Che tagliavano le gomme al professore 
Ma uomini d'affari che sanno tagliare gole 
E non diciamo che non funzionano le scuole 

Io e mio fratello su una strada che è troppo stretta 
Finisce che ti vuoi spaccare la faccia in fretta 
Prendi la storia di una guerra fredda che non è per scelta
E mò non ne voglio neanche mezza 

È la ballata dei fratelli di picche 
Che han fatto strada e di cose ne han viste 
La festa del paese, vino e salsicce

È la ballata dei fratelli di picche 
Che han visto tante stelle scendere a strisce 
La mano del padrone quando colpisce 
Le femministe, le veline, le troniste 

Qua da noi, si applica la legge dell'odio 
I cani nell'arena si scannano 
Gli squali ai piani alti scommettono, si divertono
Ma a volte noi 
Capiamo chi dobbiamo combattere 
Che insieme si potrebbe anche vincere 
Però le gradinate reclamano l'odore del sangue 

Io e mio fratello c'eravamo tanto odiati 
Uno contro l'altro come soldati 
Per questo eravamo programmati 
I capi non volevano che fossimo alleati 
Non volevano prendessimo I mercati 
Ci siamo scannati come due primati in tre metri quadrati 
E parlavamo dialetti diversi 
E poi ci siamo accoltellati a un derby 
Abbiamo tutti e due rubato all'autogrill 
E a tutti e due c'hanno accollato il pil 
Promesso il lusso mò ci danno il lastrico 
E ci rimbalza tutto come un elastico 
Ritratto odierno dell'italiano classico 
Fuori dal palazzo e fuori tempo massimo 
Io e mio fratello siamo I due di picche nazionale 
E più picchiamo assieme e più facciamo male

Tu ami l'italia e dici che chi preferisce l'America sbaglia 

I love you baby 

Ed è il tuo uomo che te lo ripete (baby) 
Che più ti vede e più gli viene fede (baby) 
E più ti beve e più gli viene sete (uouououo) 
Ripete 

I love you baby 
(Squilibrata come me) 
I love you crazy

I love you naked 
(Nuda in una mia t-shirt forever) 
I love you baby 

Sei la dimostrazione vivente 
Per tutta quanta quella gente 
Che giocava dentro la mia mente 
E dicevano sempre ""tu non vali niente"" 
E non sono i soldi quello che voglio 
Ne la fama per servire il mio orgoglio 
Neanche tutto l'oro del mondo vale un secondo di un giorno con te 

Ho il tuo nome tatuato sulla mia pellaccia 
E ti amo perchè non ami twilight 
E sei bellissima si ma non vuoi bellocci 
E sei rimasta quì quando ho finito i soldi 
Una regina può trasformare un uomo in re 
Per questo ero un bastardo con quelle prima di te 
E dicevano che non saremmo durati 
Invece io e te ci siamo pure sposati 
Con la chiesa i fiori il riso e trecento invitati 
Tu pensa cosa eravamo predestinati 
Vecchi tossici stempiati al peggio 
O se va bene calcio sky e il sabato ubriachi 
Insieme per paura di star soli 
Sopportare lavori che non ami e donne che non brami 
E uomini bugiardi infedeli nati 
Noi ci siamo salvati 
Baby we got it 

I love you baby 
 
Ed è il tuo uomo che te lo ripete (baby) 
Che più ti vede e più gli viene fede (baby) 
E più ti beve e più gli viene sete (uouououo)

Due di Picche,"Oh 
Se avessi dato retta alla professoressa 
Adesso sarei quello che ti pompa la benza 
Che sputa nei piatti quando lavora alla mensa 

Che torna col coltello quando lo si licenzia 
Se fosse andato dietro alla massa e i suoi gusti 
Che con la faccia giusta fanno cassa a tutti 
Seguire la bella vita 
Una boccia, una riga 
La fantasia di chiamarla movida 
La consapevolezza è una condanna 
Prima non mi sentivo in colpa a fare l'alba 
Adesso sò quanto è corta la fiamma 
E nessuno può convincermi a vivere con calma 
Sai questa città che ti scanna 
E sto clima d'ansia 
Sono mio padre e mia mamma 
Tubo di scarico e profumo di Ganja 
E succo gastrico che brucia in pancia 

Una ragione buona non c'è per chi non può compredere 
Che dirla con un semplice Prendiamo treni a perdere 
 
Io vengo da un brivido 
Io vengo dal tempo perso 
Io vengo per dire no 
Tu prendimi come sono 
Io sò che è reciproco 
Se il mondo mi vuole diverso 
Io sono un equivoco 
E il mio risultato è incerto

E Babilonia me l'han costruita attorno 
Io c'ero il primo giorno ed ero puro anche se sporco 
Adesso sono tutti porno 
In videochat che si strappano la carne da dosso 
Perchè tra poveri si punta dritto al collo 
Come due cani si contendono un osso 
Se non hai niente allora venditi il corpo 
Che poi lo trovi sempre in un nuovo hotel del porco 
Io sono brutto e non posso 
Scelgo rubare 
Credo in una canzone 
Il ruolo del giullare 
E' facile fare il ribelle a scuola 
E poi dopo il diploma scivolare nel coma 
Dov'è la rivoluzione 
Quando la verità è già qua alla luce del sole 
Costa poco ma nessuno la vuole 
Muore 
Non c'è mai una buona ragione

See, a lotta dudes like to act a fool
And all get all loud but that ain't my style,
And he who he gonna get and what he gonna do,
Run up on me if he want to,
Out there impressin' his homies,
But he stood up in front of his mama,
I mop up the flo' wit em,
And I kick in the door and let the .44 get em,
I got fools that'll go get em,
That's for him, his crew and the dudes that run wit em.

Gotta spit for the murderas and the
Killas and the thugstas,
That be fuckin' up the ballas and
The dealas and the hustlas,
Got me comin' at you bokas in the
V.I. while they bumpin' Lil' Jon I'm a brush ya,
Its the psycho nigga twista from
Chicago rollin' with the Miami nigga that'll crush ya,
We already been lookin' for drama
If a nigga try to get it to then we still gotta get em,
Feelin' fury from my tough shit that cant never be true
And the penicillin
I'm telling you Trick of in and still em
Got me swingin' Crysie and Hennessy bottles,
In the club with my thug homies goin' for the skrilla,
Don't get it twisted with that
Overnight celebrity you better be scared
Of me in my city I'm a killa.

[Chorus]

I ain't that rappin' type alright,
And I that actin' type alright,
This sulphane in my script,
I'm a play on you and you just a square,
See, once that Hennessy into
Me the whole industry is my enemy,
If you ain't no ten to me or friend to me,
Bitch don't pretend to be,
I'm strictly for the thugs,
I'm part of the streets and straight out the hood,
That moments ghetto (ghetto),
Got me deep in gats for you wheezly cats,
I'm straight out the county of Dade,
Played on fire nigga M-I-A,
Never gone south of the border,
Americas most wanted you gonna get slaughtered.

Señores que paso en el barretal
Un hombre y una mujer ya se han muerto
En manos de un criminal

La luna se daba gusto brillando
Cuando aquel hombre llego
Su hijo estaba en la cuna llorando
Y a su mujer no encontró

Bajo las ramas de un árbol muy grande
Dos cuerpos se dejan ver
Uno era de aquel traidor y cobarde
Y el otro el de su mujer

Se acerca tan silencioso el villano
Que ni quería resollar
Iba empuñando una daga en su mano
Iba dispuesto a matar

Mas de sesenta ocasiones su mano
La daga lograba hundir
Y no dejaba de hundirla el villano
Hasta que los vio morir

Cuando vio a su esposa muerta
Le dijo traidora mereces mas
Que dios se encargue del mundo de tu hijo
Que tu pal infierno vas

El juez que dicto sentencia
Le dijo tu crimen probado esta
Al daño que ellos lograron hacerme
Que nombramiento le das

Yo se que voy a la cárcel
Por eso voy mi delito a pagar
Y si en la cárcel me dicen que han vuelto
Salgo y los vuelvo a matar

I was old enough to want it but younger than I wanted to be

Bad tendency to get burned

Ah wonder what you do to me

When I had nobody to call my own
I told her I was looking for somebody to appreciate
And I just couldn't do it alone

So for awhile we conducted experiments
In an apartment by the River Road
And we found out that the two things we put together had a
Bad tendency to explode

Won't you show me everything you've learned
I'll memorize everything you do to me so I can
Teach it when it comes my turn

Sweet Pacific scenes through the

Why can't you understand

He offered me a friendly face
To wipe away my frown

But I won't talk to strangers
There words are all the same
So I drowned inside this drinking glass

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Tu temblabas pues llovía
Te abrace, te hice mía
Nuestros sueños se cumplían
Con la más buena intención
De cumplirte con mi amor
Fui a tu casa, fue un error

Quien diría que tus padres
Nuestro amor no aceptarían
Sin pensar cual fuera el daño
Te alejaron de mi vida
Nunca olvido que llorando
Prometiste que algún día volverías

Me fume tres mil cigarros
Mil botellas de esperanza
Me tome para esperarte
Con un nudo en la garganta
Ya cambie diez calendarios
Esperando tu llegada
Pero nada, de ti nada

No, lo nuestro no puede morirse, no
El tiempo no me hará rendirme y
Mientras respire aquí te esperare

Loco, no me importa que me llamen loco
Cuando al acariciar tu foto
Lloro y les hablo de ti

Loco, resucitando la ilusión perdida
Sé que muy pronto sanara la herida
Que me dejaste aquella noche fría
Pues sé muy bien que volverás

No, lo nuestro no puede morirse, no
El tiempo no me hará rendirme y
Mientras respire aquí te esperare

Loco, no me importa que me llamen loco
Cuando al acariciar tu foto
Lloro y les hablo de ti

Loco, resucitando la ilusión perdida
Sé que muy pronto sanara la herida
Que me dejaste aquella noche fría
Pues sé muy bien que volverás",Loco,2006

Hey, you, in the black boots
Knee high with the Dazzey Duks
Looking real fly while in cahoots
In the park where I can meet you
I'm Snow, here to relate to you
What started the trend of them Dazzey Duks
Ever since the summer of the 90s
Girls had a deal with the future behind
See many terms they use to express
We're talking about the butt cheeks not the breasts
Baby got back, junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo, need some fries with that shake
See many terms they use to relate
I love the girls with the big old booties
Right up front they call em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks hanging from the jeans
Even city girls can be country things
So if you get it got it good to dip to dug out
Dem damn Dazzey Duks are turning out
Sing!

Say look at them girls with the Dazzey Duks on
They really got it going on
Yeah they be kicking it sweet
While all the brothers show their freak
And check out the way they step
Make a brother want to think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
And they're tan to the top all the way
But it don't matter what kinda legs you like
Still be kicking if those legs are lily white
So it makes no difference to you
As long as you're kicking them Dazzey Duks

Come on baby kick those Dazzeys
Look at them girls with the Dazzey Duks on
I want you to look at them girls with the Dazzey Duks on

And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night

Sing the saddest kind o' song

From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I been in some big towns
An' heard me some big talk

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Duke Bannister,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind
The summer wind
The summer wind",The Summer Wind,2007

Duke Bootee,"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so-so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""you want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge

And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

Duke Bootee,"New York New York, big city of dreams 
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much, Raaah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high 
Built to shelter the rich and greedy 
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows 
Looking down on the poor and the needy 
Miles of people, marching up the avenue 
Doin? what they gotta do, just to get by 
I'm living in the land of plenty and many 
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, too many people, too much 
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump 
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump"" 
?Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed 
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through 
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought 
He got nothing to eat, no shoes on his feet 
She even left his clothes out in the street 
He keeps hearing noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone 
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib 
In this man's world, so much for Women's Lib

But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly 
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes 
They're sugar and spice and everything nice 
But when you get ?em home ain't no telling what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eating dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat 
I barely can stand, on my own two feet
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it 
Something?s on my mind and I just can't shake it 
I need some time, and I want some space 
I gotta get away from the human race?

Too much, too many people, too much (aha-ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Raaah!

Staring at a skyscraper reaching into heaven 
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell 
Just play ball or be an entertainer 
'Cause niggaz like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares 
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare 
Paranoid schizo, set back, snowbound 
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh
Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, Huh, Hee, HUH!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes 
I might find the strength to make another day 
If I didn't have to get up and do my thing 
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin' bout ice cream 
Whipped cream, fruits and a cherry on top 
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh 
The pressure is on, It ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind 
I don't want to be kissing nobody's behind 
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk 
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash 
Should?a been thinking and tried to fake whiplash 
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat 
Who you lookin' at with a face like that?

New York New York big city of dreams 
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin' for some action 
Women standing on the corner selling satisfaction 
One young punk just leaning on the fence 
Tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster 
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands 
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up 
One dead punk, killed by the man

New York New York big city of dreams 
And everything in New York ain't always what it seem 
You might get fooled if you come from out of town 
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Too much, too many people, too much (ha ha ha ha) 
Too much, too many people, too much! Huh!

A baby cries and a mother dies 
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes
Because in this room, on this day 
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh!
The gift of life really means a lot 
And in the ghetto your life is all you got 
So you take to the streets, trying to exist 
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch on TV tells you what life is supposed to be 
But when you look outside the only thing you see 
Is the poverty stricken reality, Heh!
Abandoned places, angry faces 
Much hate and hunger throughout the races 
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own 
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talking on the phone 
Doin' ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone 
They never took the time to tell you ?bout sex 
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there 
And the Nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!"" 
You don't have enough money to help feed two 
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was crying, rain and hail 
When you put your baby in the garbage pail 
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid 
And you tried to forget what you just did, Huh!
The muffled screams of a dying baby 
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy 
So she ran in the rain trying to ease the pain 
Huh huh, And she drove herself insane

I try to be calm breathe easy, it don't seem easy
I'm on my Ps and Qs, Ys and Zs, .45 on the side of me
Plus, four guys on the side of me, with .45 on the side of them

We can play now, this is a war not a playground
We came here to lay or get laid down, spray or get sprayed down
Wills for us anyday now, cops with their wall to wall raids down
I'm ducking and weaving, running and leaving

Not trying to feel the cuffs when they squeezing
Or the plugger they stuck to Lumina
So I'm stuck with this nina, I'm stuck with this finger
Itchy as f***, you're f***ed if I leave ya chump

Went to school, but ain't stay in cla**, hated cla**
Only for period, yep, I could relate to math
Played games, but the games was bad
You know, cops and robbers, laser tag, see what I was aiming at

Hop scotching on n****z faces kept my ankles bad
That ain't stop me from working I got me a worker
Gotta him to work, and yeah, chopping the work up
Keep him on my clock, clocking my work up, n****z know me

Taught him how to cook, livin his work up
Told him it's not the pot, it's the worker, gotta mix shorty
Gotta do it like this shorty
Clockwise, counter-clockwise, it's all in the wrist shorty

The pain I feel, I really wont show man
The game is real, I really don't know Cam
If I'm a make it or not

But my plan was to take it straight to the top
Bring my fame to the block, with me
Harlem's my home, so I'm making it hot with me
'Til the day I'm layed on the block, with shots in me

Stay weeded, stay cheifing a blunt
Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting homes, you wont do nothing homes
Killa locked this, I'm what's up and coming homes

You better believe, one thing I was always taught in my household you better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me
So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen

Base tripping on the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it
This is the Matrix, I take it we live in

S***, I'm seeing the sun, I'm Neo the one, believe me
Hand picked like cotton, I've been sent here not to be forgotten
My hands grip the dots in, I get ya poppin'
Shoot s***, s*** is poppin'

Move bricks get it rocking, y'all know me
Ya young homie from the block, y'all forgot me already?

If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

Yet, every night,

Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me!

I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

It's no fun when you're alone

My car broke down, dead battery
I've been blocked off my Uber
The drivers a dickhead if you ask me
'Cause I was smellin' like an ounce
Like a zapp, watching summertime bounce
I came here to get lifted
I'll be surfing on clouds

Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

Then you know that Tennessee is not very far

Oh, what a couple in love
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

He was her man
But he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are coming back

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

Now this is the end of my story
And this is the end of my song

And she cries the whole night long

When you taught me how to say

When we're apart, the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But, please, do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will",Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me,1953
Duke Ellington,"Who's the loving daddy with the beautiful eyes
What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size
I'll just tell him, ""Baby, won't you swing it with me""
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely ""Darling may I intrude""
He said ""Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood""

First I held him lightly and we started to dance
Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said ""Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me""
""Well"" he answered ""Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood""

In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skipping
It didn't take me long to say ""I'm in the mood now""

In the mood for all his kissing
In the mood his crazy loving
In the mood what I was missing
It didn't take me long to say ""I'm in the mood now""

So, I said politely ""Darling may I intrude""

Duke Ellington,"Savoy, the home of sweet romance,
Savoy, it wins you with a glance,
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.

What joy, a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you

Duke Ellington,"Buddy Bolden tune up
Blowing horn was his game
Born with a silver trumpet in his mouth
He played the horn before he talked
Born on the after beat
He patted his foot before walked

When Buddy Bolden tuned up, you could hear him clean
Clean across the river, clean across the river
He woke up the working people and kept the easy living
Call on Buddy Bolden; call him Buddy Bolden

Watch it; he's calling his flock now
He's calling his flock now; here they come
Call him Buddy Bolden; he's calling his flock now
Here they come, here they come
Come on, Buddy Bolden, here they come","Hey, Buddy Bolden",1956

Is day dreaming just like me

Duke Ellington,"Summer, you old Indian Summer
You're the tear that comes after June time's laughter
You see so many dreams that don't come true
Dreams we fashioned when Summertime was new
You are here to watch over
Some heart that is broken
By a word that somebody left unspoken
You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray
Fading too soon, that's why I say
""Farewell to you Indian Summer""",Indian Summer,1956
Duke Ellington,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1956
Duke Ellington,"My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet your my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's day

Duke Ellington,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1956
Duke Ellington,"All too soon
We had to part
The moment you had touched my heart
And with you went my dream
All too soon

All too sweet
Was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there
What a shame that it's gone
All too soon

I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring
And as I reached the heights
The bottom fell from everything

You should know as well as I
Our love deserves another try
For we whispered goodbye

Rocks in my bed

Of all the people I see

So how can I sleep
With rocks in my bed?

There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble

Duke Ellington,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room?

I think of you
Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me

But I can't remember where or when

Duke Ellington,"They say into your early life romance came
And in this heart of yours burned a flame
A flame that flickered one day and died away
Then, with disillusion deep in your eyes
You learned that fools in love soon grow wise
The years have changed you, somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow, nonchalant
Diamonds shining, dancing, dining with some man in a restaurant
Is that all you really want?
