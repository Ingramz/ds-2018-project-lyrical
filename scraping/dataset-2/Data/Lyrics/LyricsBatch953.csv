Rosalía,"Ese cristalito roto
Yo sentí cómo crujía
Antes de caerse al suelo
Ya sabía que se rompía (¡uh!)
Está parpadeando
La luz del descansillo
Una voz en la escalera
Alguien cruzando el pasillo

Se ha puesto la noche rara
Han salí'o luna y estrellas
Me lo dijo esa gitana (¿qué?)
Mejor no salir a verla (no)
Sueño que estoy andando
Por un puente y que la acera (mira, mira, mira, mira)
Cuanto más quiero cruzarlo (¡va!)
Más se mueve y tambalea

Aunque no esté bonita
La noche, ¡Undivé!
Voy a salir pa' la calle
En la manita los aros brillando
En mi piel los corales
Me proteja y me salve
Me ilumine y me guarde

No voy a perder ni un minuto en volver a pensarte

Rosalía,"M'an dicho que no hay sali'a
Por esta calle que voy
M'an dicho que no hay sali'a
Yo la tengo que encontrar
Aunque me cueste la vida
O aunque tenga que matar

Ay, el querer
Que en un momento quisiera
Estar loca y no querer
Porque el querer causa pena
Pena que no tiene fin
Si el loco vive sin ella

No le temas al camino
Es como una maldición
No le temas al camino
Si la alumbro, la confirmo
Ya lo sabes, es lo que pasa
Y ninguno quie'e decirlo

He deja'o un reguero
De sangre por el suelo
He deja'o un reguero
Que me lleva al primer día
Que te dije que te quiero
Pa' saber lo que decías

Ay, el querer
Que en un momento quisiera
Estar loca y no querer
Porque el querer causa pena
Pena que no tiene fin
Si el loco vive sin ella",Maldición,2018

Que dicte mi sentencia

Tu inicial porque es la mía

Rosalía,"Me da miedo cuando sales
Sonriendo pa' la calle

Y del aire cuando pasa
Por levantarte el cabello
Y del oro que te viste

Hasta del agua que bebes
Cuando te mojas los labios

Tan bonita que amenaza
Cuando callas me das miedo
Tan fría como la nieve
Cuando cae desde el cielo
Cuando sales por la puerta
Pienso que no vuelves nunca
Y si no te agarro fuerte
Siento que será mi culpa

Pienso en tu mirá, tu mirá, clavá, es una bala en el pecho

De Mucama com feitor
Meu pai dormia em cama
Minha mãe no pisador

Meu pai só dizia assim, venha
Minha mãe dizia sim, sem falar
Mulher que fala muito perde logo seu amor
Deus fez primeiro o homem
A mulher nasceu depois

Por isso é que a mulher
Trabalha sempre pelos dois
Homem acaba de chegar, tá com fome
A mulher tem que olhar pelo homem

E é deitada, em pé, mulher tem é que trabalhar

Te tienes que dar
Si no hay viento en la orilla 
Habrá que remar

Y llevar a buen puerto la felicidad

Nunca viene mal que te vaya bien 
Y si el tren se va dile hey, hey, hey! 
Que es mejor jugar 
Que vivir preguntando por qué? 
Todos somos una pieza 
Del mundo y su rompecabezas 
Si te encarcela el amor y te mata la condena 
No te rindas que al final 
Por buena conducta sé 
Que te reducen la pena 
A la callando 
Te vas olvidando de hacerte saber 
Que la vida es un baile
No dejes que el tiempo te pise los pies 
Cada día es como una canción 
Al ritmo del concierto de tu corazón 
Yo la vivo cantando
La canto bailando y le presto mi voz

Te deseo corazón
Sólo cosas buenas a tu alrededor 
Que no se acaben los besos en la boca
Que no terminen de bailar las mariposas 
Que no amanezca un solo día con la luna rota 

Si te encarcela el amor y te mata la condena 
No te rindas que al final 
Por buena conducta sé 
Que te reducen la pena

No te rindas que al final no te vas a arrepentir

De los tiempos pero creen
Que la luna allí se enamoró de él... ye ye ye ye
Dice el viento que ella se acercó
Tanto que su rostro ardió
Why por eso esconde su dolor Deray
La cara oculta de la luna es Deray

Que la noche es mejor que tu

Zarandee los recuerdos
Dando vueltas en la cama
Y en una de tantas vueltas
Me encontré la madrugada

De un salto me fui a buscarte
Por donde solías venir
Y te vi, ¡maldito seas!
Igual que te vi partir

Un soplo de amor di al viento
Por si te lo hacía llegar
Pero hasta la misma brisa
Se canso de ir detrás

Nunca supe los motivos
Todavía los ignoro
Y aunque no lo creas, ¡por Dios!
Te juro que aun te añoro

Me abandono la cordura

Como el tiempo a las paredes

Dime, dime
Que quiero saber, donde voy a caer
Donde estas que no encuentro, las alas del viento.

Que quiero saber, como puedo volver
A encender la luz, apagandome

Dime donde va la fe
Cuando no queda nada que creer.

Brindar con las mareas
Cansarme de sembrar

Puedo esparcir la luz

El futuro y la imaginación de un planeta 
Que gira en un camino enredado
Por la guerra, el hambre, y el dolor
Si aun te fuera posible encontrar la salida 
Para darle cobija a lo que queda de vida?

Que podría pasar si cayera en tus manos
El latido de ese corazón
Que agoniza dejando el universo encerrado
En un cuarto donde no hay amor 
Si aun te fuera posible entender que es de todos
Y que todos los hombres pueden mas que uno solo?

Si tu fueras el mundo y yo fuera tu amante! 
Mimaría tu cuerpo por tenerlo a mi alcance
Dibujando una huella que excitara tu mente
Hallaría la lluvia en el sudor de frente!
Si tu fueras el mundo y yo fuera tu amante
De mi boca marea que en tu boca se esparce
De mi alma caricias sin llegar a enredarte 
Si yo fuera tu amante!",Si Yo Fuera Tu Amante,1998
Rosana,"Tu sonríe y veras
Como todo lo que hay en tus ojos parece que brilla
Que la vida es legal

A poquito
Que sonrías se contagia la mía
Y los ratos oscuros se harán de colores
Mientras sobre alegría no falten canciones

Sonríe, sonríe, sonríe
Sí, sonríe, sonríe, sonríe, eh, eh, eh

Tu verás
Si prefieres llorar de tristeza o llorar de alegría
Se me antoja pensar
Que llorar de tristeza no es malo si encuentras salida
Y a poquito
Que sonrías llegará la alegría
Sí, de los ratos peores germinan los buenos
Sonreír no se compra no vale dinero

Sonríe, sonríe, sonríe

Tu sonríe y verás
Que terminas feliz como acaban felices los cuentos

Que sonrias se descorchan los días
Sonreir es tan fresco como un aguacero
Un diluvio de risas cayendo del cielo

No me quedan ganas de llorar
Recoge todo y hecha andar
El mar ya se perdió

Trozos de ti veo caer
Soy un huracán destruyéndote
Trozos de ti mojándome
Que va ser de mi desterrándote
En silencio romperé trozos de ayer

En tu voz se entremezclan las mentiras
Con mil palabras de amor que están sin vida
Pido al mar que golpee contra tu alma
y te salpique de mi cuando me vaya
La magia se esfumo y todo se quebró sin mas
No me quedan ganas de llorar
Recoge todo y hecha andar

Rosana,"Lo cuenta la historia 
Lo cuentan los cuentos 
Lo cuenta la gente y juro por todo que no me lo invento 
Algunos amores 
Se acaban rompiendo 
Y viene de viejo que tanta tristeza termina diciendo: 

No ves que pierdo la vida 
No ves que me estoy muriendo 
Que cuando aprieta la soledad 
Es cuando ahoga el recuerdo 
No ves que estando tan lejos 
Se nos marchitan los sueños 
Entre los brazos del desamor, se esta apagando este fuego 

Te come la pena 
Te matan los celos 
Te sangra la herida y la vida se escapa por un sumidero 
Lo cantan las hojas 
Lo silban los vientos 
Y viene de antaño que el mar se hace llanto y el mundo desierto

No ves que pierdo la vida 
No ves que me estoy muriendo 
Que cuando aprieta la soledad 
Es cuando ahoga el recuerdo 
No ves que estando tan lejos 
Se nos marchitan los sueños 
Entre los brazos del desamor, se esta apagando este fuego 
Y aunque no quiero morir de amor 
De amor estoy muriendo 

Y de entre amores perdidos, llegan amores eternos 
Y viene de siempre que tanta tristeza se va con el tiempo 

La ra la la que cuando aprieta la soledad 
Es cuando ahoga el recuerdo 
La ra la la entre los brazos del desamor 
Se esta apagando este fuego 
No ves que 
Y aunque no quiero morir de amor 
De amor estoy muriendo",Cuentan,2001

Es quien une y separa 
Eso que a pocos sobra 
Y a ti te falta 
Se llama corazón 

El tuyo es tuyo 
Y el mío de los dos 
En este amor 
El tuyo es tuyo 
Y el mío de los dos 

Es tristeza es deseo 
Es tan frágil como tierno 
Y tan libre como quiero 
Tan desnudo tan ligero 
Es quien dicta cuanto escribo 
Quien sentencia cuanto digo

Quien me cura tus heridas 

Es quien une y separa 
Eso que a pocos sobra

Que me araña por dentro

Donde ya no te tengo

Donde ya no te tengo

Despedirse de mí
Y hay un trozo de alma
Donde ya no te tengo

La vida es una vela
Que va apagando el viento
El mar se ha vuelto llanto
Se me ha empedrado el cielo
Y me duele tanto el día

Que yo, no puedo
Arráncame la vida
Con todo lo que tengo

En brazos de este amor

Se hizo pesadilla

Antes de seguir con esta historia
De todo lo mejor
Lo guardo en la memoria
Antes de seguir y castigarnos
Prefiero el corazón
De pie que arrodillado

Y si tus besos no son mi orilla
Naufragaremos toda la vida

Antes de acabar de despedirme
Tienes que saber
Que no me marcho triste
Que no quiero herirte aunque me pierdas
Ni que me hagas daño aunque me quieras

Y antes de seguir con desengaños
Te dejo esta canción

Navegaremos en otra orilla
Y si tus besos no son mi orilla
Naufragaremos toda la vida",En la Otra Orilla,2001
Rosana,"Yo tengo un corazón que se despereza 
Que cuando siento amor pierde la cabeza 
Que sabe cobijarse por mi 
Y me hace desnudarlo ante ti 
Que pasa si te pierdes la noche en vela 
Que quiere ser amante la vida entera 
Que sigue siendo un loco feliz 
Y me hace despertar y sentir que 

Gira la vida en cada mañana 
Envuelta en tu calor mirando tu mirada 
Jugando a ser cometas en la madrugada 
Nos vamos entregando y 
Gira y gira la vida y gira la magia 
La luna se descuelga el sol se desbarata 
La noche es una puerta entre sabanas blancas 
Que abre la pasión cuando arde el alma 
Y girando entre los dos 
El aire se descalza 

Yo tengo un corazón que se desparrama 
Se vuelve una marea cuando me amas 
Que enciende la ilusión cuando se me apaga 
Que late y de latir por tu amor no para 
Tengo un corazón que te pertenece 
Que puede parecer medio raro a veces 
Que sólo pide sangre enamorada 
Y días para despertar y ver que 

Gira la vida en cada mañana 
Envuelta en tu calor mirando tu mirada 
Jugando a ser cometas en la madrugada 
Nos vamos entregando y 
Gira y gira la vida y gira la magia

Como aquella noche, era la primera
El invierno se ancló en una esquina de la primavera
Fueron pasando las noches pasaron noches enteras

Pasaron mil y una noche
Mil y una noche de cuento
Y descorchamos la luna para bebernos el cielo
Y nos bebimos el mundo entero

Y nos bebimos la noche
Y nos quedamos despiertos
Y derrochando caricias
Brindamos tan solo con agua de besos

Y nos bebimos la noche
Y comprendimos bebiendo
Que es tan grande el querer
Que nos da de beber y seguimos sedientos

La primera noche de cada estación me la bebo contigo
Como aquel verano que se deshojaba
Prometiéndonos mil y una noche cuando regresara
Llovieron hojas de otoño para abrigar el invierno

Del jardín del infierno navegantes el día del juicio final

No me cortes las alas ni me tires del cielo 
hoy no llego a la gloria ni de un salto mortal

siento que no que no hay sabor a besos en el aire

Es el mapa de un suspiro,
Es lo que hay cuando te miro,
Es el duende del latido de tu corazón y el mío
Es la meta y el camino,
Es la suerte y el destino,
Es la fuerza del latido de tu corazón.

Magia es probar a volcar
Lo que hay en el fondo de ti,
Magia es verte sonreír
Magia es probar a saltar sin mirar,
Es caer y volver a empezar

Magia es probar a volcar
Lo que hay en el fondo de ti,
Magia es verte sonreír
Magia es probar a saltar sin mirar,

Rosana,"Te voy a dar una casa de amor
Pa' que la vivas conmigo
Un corazon en la puerta
Una cancion al oido

Una mirada bonita
Un sufrimiento prohibido
Y un arco iris de luna
Pa' cuando sueñes conmigo

Te voy a dar la guarida que tiene la vida
Pa' seguir viviendo
Pa' vivir queriendo

Lo mejor de la vida es vivir
Es vivir el momento y asi te lo cuento
Pa' que tu la bailes, pa' que baile el viento
Pa' que bailes conmigo lento

Toma la cara y la cruz de mis sentimientos.
Quiero. Empezar en la tierra y seguir
En la orilla del cielo

Quiero y sigo queriendo
Que quererte sea el onde de
Los diez mandamientos

Te voy a dar la linterna de dios
Pa' que la enciendas conmigo
Un tendedero de estrellas
El cargador de cupido

Caricias para el invierno
Besos para un descosido
Y una ventana en el aire
Pa' que te aomes conmigo

Te voy a dar la guarida que tiene la vida

Quiero, darte amor a puñados
Darte amor sin veneno, quiero
En una gota del aire
Darte las alas del viento

Quiero empezar en la tierra
Y seguir en la orilla del cielo
Quiero y sigo queriendo
Que quererte sea el once
De los diez mandamientos

Rosana,"Ser feliz, es gratis, sé feliz
Solamente tienes que sentir
Que tú podrás soñar
Y tu sueño se hará realidad
Agarra tu vida

Vivir por vivir, volar por volar
Reír o llorar de felicidad tu verás
Si quieres llegar al final llegarás
Agarra tu vida, y tira

La vida irá poniendo todo en su lugar
No dudes, abre los ojos
Despierta y ponte a soñar
Ya verás que llegarás

Sentir por sentir que puedes llegar
Solamente tienes que querer
Querer es poder, si quieres probar
Y ya verás, si lo intentas ya verás

Tu verás, si quieres llegar
Al final llegarás
Agarra tu vida y tira
La vida irá

Guarda los buenos recuerdos
Para los malos momentos

Y escucha, apúntate a la vida
A decir lo que sientes
A sentir lo que vales
A soñar lo que quieres

Y a saber que te sobra
Con tener lo que tienes
Ser feliz es gratis
Sé feliz

Al final llegarás
Agarra tu vida y tira

Es algo que llega y se va cada día
Te hace llorar, te llena de alegría
Te clava un puñal y te lame la herida
Te quita, te da, te sube, y te derriba

Es lo que tiene, a ver si adivinas
Te deja entrar en el mundo
Gozar del amor, respirar muy profundo
Perder el control hasta encontrar el rumbo
La puedes usar, pero no te la quedas
Se mide en edad, se cuenta en primaveras

Mira los siglos que lleva
Es un segundo en la eternidad
Es mucho más que una cuenta atrás
Es un legado de Dios, o una ilusión
Pero esto es, vivir la vida

Te da billete de ida
Se paga de noche, se enciende de día
Se vuelve canción en una melodía
Será tu dolor, tu mejor medicina
Será del color con el que tú la miras

Es una caja de sueños
Es un segundo en la eternidad
Es mucho más que una cuenta atrás
Es un legado de Dios, o una ilusión
Pero esto es, vivir la vida

Es la vida que vives
Es la vida que llevas
Es el mundo que mueve
La vida, que juega

Vida para vivir
Vida para sentir amor
Vida para brindar
Por la vida en tu corazón

Vida para querer
Vida para seguir aquí
Vida para saber
Que no vivo sin ti

Vida para vivir
Vida para sentir amor
Vida para brindar
Por la vida en tu corazón

Vida para querer
Vida para seguir aquí
Vida para saber

Me quedo este sueño

Trocitos al tiempo
Y así comprendemos
Lo mucho que vale un momento

Sentada en el aire
Colgados del viento
Miramos el mundo
Que es distinto si tú no estás dentro

Si está dentro de ti con ganas de volar 
¿Quién va a amarrar el viento cuando quieras despegar? 
Si está dentro de ti, forrado con tu piel 

¿Quién va a decirte no es posible? 
¿Quién te va a romper lo que sueñas tú? 

Desperézate, endereza el rumbo
abre el corazón, despierta al mundo
Sal a alzar la voz y a librar batallas

¿Quién le pone a la verdad fecha de caducidad? 
Si está dentro de ti con ganas de volar 
¿Quién va a amarrar el viento cuando quieras despegar? 
Si está dentro de ti, forrado con tu piel 
¿Quién va a decirte no es posible? 
¿Quién te va a romper lo que sientas tu? 

¿Quién va a amarrar el viento? 
¿Quién te va a romper por dentro? 
¿Quién? Si el mundo está despierto
¿Quién lo pone contra la pared? 

¿Quién en nombre del amor pone en jaque al corazón? 

Si está dentro de ti con ganas de volar
¿Quién va a amarrar el viento cuando quieras despegar?","Buenos días, mundo!",2013
Rosana,"Aún ni siquiera te tengo 
Y ya tengo miedo de perderte, amor 
Qué rápido se me ha clavado 
Qué dentro todo este dolor

Es poco lo que te conozco 
Y ya pongo todo el juego a tu favor 
No tengo miedo de apostarte
Perderte sí me da pavor

No me queda más refugio, que la fantasía 
No me queda más que hacer
Que hacerte una poesía

Porque te vi venir y no dudé 
Te vi llegar, y te abracé 
Y puse toda mi pasión para que te quedaras 
Y luego te besé y me arriesgué con la verdad 
Te acaricié y al fin abrí mi corazón 
Para que tú pasaras

Mi amor te di sin condición 
Para que te quedaras

Ahora esperaré algunos días 
Para ver si lo que te di fue suficiente 
No sabes qué terror se siente 
La espera cada madrugada 
Si tú ya no quisieras volver 
Se perdería el sentido del amor por siempre 
No entendería ya este mundo 
Me alejaría de la gente

No me queda más refugio, que la fantasía 
No me queda más que hacer

You say you're looking for something you might've forgot

I'd close down this heart tonight
Leave without a fight
Say goodbye to your sweet memory
If I can lie in your arms tonight
If I can lie in your arms tonight

Was I the fool to think you would see me
When all I wanted was you
Then I saw your eyes go through those changes
And wondered how you knew

I hear your name in slow conversation
I close my eyes and knew
I'd never find a way to deceive you
I just can't let you go

I'd close down this heart tonight
Leave without a fight
Say goodbye to your sweet memory
If I can lie in your arms tonight
If I can lie in your arms tonight

Between our hearts and minds
Every day a drama
Dragging by in quarter time

By summer it was over
I couldn't see it through
Trying not to lose my mind
While I was leaving you

Our friends are in the halfway house
You're still on the mend
Don't know if I've changed at all
But I'm in love with you again
We're all in the halfway house
Or so it sometimes seems
Trying to find the truth inside
Instead of getting by on dreams

In summer we were blinded
We thought it couldn't last
Crying 'bout the future
And fighting 'bout the past

The summer was no bargain
And look at us today
Running from the memory of
The price we had to pay

Our friends are in the halfway house
You're still on the mend
Don't know if I've changed at all
But I'm In love with you again

Or so it sometimes seems
Trying to find the truth inside

Until that sometime, somewhere,
We could show the world we have each other
Sometime, somewhere we need not hide out feelings,
We just keep on believing that we both have the time together
Sometime and somewhere, our lips would be free at last
You say the words we've hungered to say

And we won't have to worry, we smile we won't say sorry
One look and we have cast our fears aside.
Sometime, that sometime will turn to forever, for all time.
Somewhere, our somewhere would not be just one place,
But everywhere

Until that sometime, somewhere,
We just have to be content with stealing glances
Somehow, content with saying nothing, smiles that are

Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him ""Don't stop.""
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box. 

And he would play

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

Rosanne Cash,"We crawled night and day through the tears and debries
Now I'm reaching out to you but I'm keeping my hands clean
The tables are turning the tempo slows down
And we're gettin' off this misery-go-round
It's a brand new world baby now things have changed
A brand new picture in a brand new frame
A turn of the page with a blink of your eye
Our two steps in rhythm our hearts beatin' time
On the inside it all happened on the inside it all went down on the inside

A critical moment I know you'd agree both of us separate but neither one free
We traded our papers for new walking shoes
But I had no idea how I'd feel without you
We watched it unravel we heard it unwind imprisoned by anger embittered by time
No one could tell me we'd be standing here today
Steeled by the fire and sealed by the pain
On the inside it all happened on the inside it all went down on the inside

I'm holding on to you and I know you're holding on to me too
We gave it one more chance and found the key to romance
Now none of it happens like we think it should be
Hey it'd all be disaster if left up to me
By the power of love and protection divine
We found we hold hands through the darkness and then there was light

It all went down on the inside

It all went down on the inside",On the Inside,1990
Rosanne Cash,"On the surface everything seems right no one notices the dimness of the light
For the world outside our door our smiles are oh so bright
On the surface everything's all right
We have the grace of actors on the stage
We orchestrate the moves that complement the play
But the things that we believe in we just throw them away
On the surface everything's okay

We say goodnight and then we close our eyes
To drift in different worlds far from each other's sight
Dreaming of yesterday when we held each other tight
And on the surface everything's all right
What are you thinking tonight I don't know you (I don't know you)
My words disappear in the night and there's no one there to notice
Maybe our lives will never be the same
But we can face tomorrow if we can just get through today

But on the surface everything's okay yeah on the surface everything's okay",On the Surface,1990
Rosanne Cash,"I picked up the phone, you were both on the line
Your words to each other froze me in time
A lifetime between us just burnt on the wires
Dissolved in a dial tone, consumed in your fires
Your footsteps beside me, the phone in my hand
I can't move
I can't stand

Our faces in pieces, facades on the floor
The pretense between us for a moment destroyed
I don't want to go on with these words in my heart
But the ghost of your anger will tear us apart
How my little world just went up in smoke
I'm too young
I'm too old

One day soon I'll know
One day soon I'll just let it go

I run from the bedroom with legs paralyzed
I carve out my future part prophet, part blind
It's nobody's business, no one is to blame
We'll meet in the distance, new numbers new names

I'll move on
I'll go higher",Paralyzed,1990

I don't want to check my appearance in your eyes

I don't need to play the princess all the time
I want to be a real woman changing every day
I want to be a real woman real in every way I want to be a real woman
I don't want to be admired I don't want to take my smile
I don't want to use my charm to disarm you
You don't have to spin your wheels oh baby I know how that feels
You don't have to pass some test just to impress me
I want to be a real woman...
Real is how I deal with what I deal with
Real is how I feel when I know how I'm feelin'

I don't want to be a man I just want to be what I am

This is such a surprise to see you
Girl, your looking so good; it's been a long time
Since you've crossed my mind 
It's such a small world

Just one night on the town,
I came looking around for something to do 

Just a change of my plans on leaving, 
And I stay around and I run into you
Which just goes to prove it's such a small world

It's such a small world

I've lived alone for awhile

Let go of your mind

You know just what to say
You know just what to do

I'll be gone once again come morning

Strap yourself
To the tree with roots

Now we've made a trail of tears for her to follow
And we've thought of every line that she might swallow

Rosanne Cash,"This is the place where I made my best mistakes
This is the place even angels don't understand
I've seen the disappointment in her face
And the collection of engagement rings on her right hand

She sits alone apart from the crowd
In a white dress she wears like a question mark
Friends speak of her fondly
Enemies just think out loud

You think you're man enough to please her
And you're fool enough to start
But you're not gonna do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinkin' tonight that tomorrow won't change

Now the cabaret is frozen
And the laughter comes in cans
And the lonely hearts club clientele
Don't know what to do with their hands

You think that you'll be sweet to her but everybody knows
That you're the marshmallow valentine that got stuck on her clothes
And you're not goinna do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinkin' tonight that tomorrow won't change

So you mix your drinks and words
You make bad jokes, you make bad time
The floors are there to walk over
The walls are there to climb

You swear you'll never go back again once you're inside
You're never the bridegroom she's always the bride
You're not gonna do a thing to our little angel
There's nothing you're thinkin' tonight that tomorrow won't change

You'll come in a sweetheart and you'll go out a stranger
Well, you try to love her but she's so contrary
Like a chainsaw running through a dictionary
So get your mind off the sweet behind of our little angel

You're not gonna do a thing
You're not gonna do a thing
You're not gonna do a thing to our little angel

For it isn't to the palace that the Christ child comes
But to shepherds and street people, hookers and bums
And the message is clear if you've got ears to hear
That forgiveness is given for your guilt and your fear
It's a Christmas gift you don't have to buy

I can no longer run.
I cannot be who I was then
In a way, I never was.

I watch the clock and sun.

To a place where I can rest.

In this modern world we're livin' in
The rules ain't like they've ever been
Speakin' of spreading it thin
That's what you do, flashing your soul
That ain't no way to treat your lover
Ain't no way to act with feelings

Hanging out, out on the rock'n'roll fringe

Sure is rainin' like this feeling in my heart

Rosanne Cash,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend

Unfaithful servant, you don't have to say you're sorry,

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,

When the rivers freeze and summer ends,

If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,

Rosanne Cash,"Well I woke up Sunday morning,
With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast,
Wasn't bad so I had one more, for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet,
For my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair,
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before on cigarettes and songs 
That I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first, and watched a small kid cussin' at a can 
That he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell 
Of someone fryin'chickin
And it took me back to somethin' that I had lost somehow, 
Somewhere along the way

[Chorus]
On the Sunday morning sidewalk, wishin' Lord that I was stoned
Cause there is something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone
And there is nothing short of die'n, half a lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks, Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy, 
With 'w(?)' laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school,
And listened to a song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams 
Of yesterday

In a south Texas boarder town
Sat a boy and his guitar
And the people came from all around
And all the girls
From there to Austin
Were slippin' away from home
And puttin' jewelry in hock to take the trip
To go and listen
To the little dark-haired boy who played the

Well he couldn't ride or wrangle
And he never cared to make it dime
But give him his guitar
And he'd be happy all the time

And no one ever saw him 'round

To never have sunlight on your face
You've been content to let me shine
You always walked a step behind

I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
Only a face without a name
I never once heard you complain

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know I know the truth
I would be nothing without you

With these rickety old legs and watery eyes 
It's hard to believe that I could pass for anybody's prize 
Here's what I know about the gifts that God gave 
You can't take 'em with you when you go to the grave

Back when down on my luck kept me up for days 
You were there with the right word to help me crawl out of the maze 
And when I almost convinced myself I was hipper than thou 
You stepped up with a warning shot fired sweet and low across the bow 
No you don't walk on water and your sarcasm stings 
But the way you move through this old world sure makes a case for angel wings 
I was halfway to the bottom when you threw me that line 
I quote you now verbatim, ""Get your head out of your own behind""

Rosanne Cash,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run

The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand

There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso

Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery

Can pull me up from the rabbit hole

To show me the road that bends
The love that wins
You're an honest friend
And you'll give me that night of peace
Blessed relief
You can make me see

That you with your light and glory
With your old dreams and epic stories
You seal all the darkened doors
And pull me up from the rabbit hole

I just want a road that bends
A love that wins
An honest friend
I'm looking for a night of peace
Blessed relief
You could make me see

That you, with your soldier's honor
You kind man and plainsong scholars
You sound like a million dollars
You pull me up from the rabbit hole",Rabbit Hole,2018
Rosanne Cash,"All those who go before us
The mothers and the kings

You can stray far from the track
So goodbye, my friends
It's my turn to won't look back

The ghosts have had their moment
Now they fade into the sun
Shining like a carousel
When summer's just begun
Bonded for their silence
And I threw away the key
Someone's going down
But it's not me

All because I'm thankful for what we don't understand
The undiscovered country between a woman and a man

All those who follow after
Are children who we pledge
To a story of some sailors
Who float beyond the edge
To their
We want them to retire
Just beyond their grasp
And plain desires

The old men never helped us
They took our every vow
Turned them into money
And look where we are now
Waiting for a savior
But she walks alone to sea
And someone's going down
She went down for me

And still she says she's thankful for what we don't understand
The undiscovered country in every woman, every man

Some day will come the questions
With no answers, but we ask
Just the same when we were children
Which was sweet but doesn't last
From the undiscovered country
We hear the old refrain
The sky is blue
For the few who remain

All because I'm thankful for the things we never planned
The undiscovered country in every woman, every man
Raise a glass, be thankful for what we don't understand
The undiscovered country between a woman and a man",The Undiscovered Country,2018
Rosanne Cash,"This is our great migration
Our mountain and our stone
Turning ourselves inside-out
To find we're already home
This is our deal with the sinners and saints
The law and up above
We'll be crossing to Jerusalem
With nothing but our love

Birthdays and the babies
Bourbon and the tears
Roaring like the hurricane
Tearing up the years
Who we are is who we were
And all of you were there
We're crossing to Jerusalem
It's nothing we can't build

The towns through tiny windows
The rooms that look the same
We lost the hands we didn't play
But somehow won the game
Look how the curtain rises
It courses through our blood

With nothing but our love
We'll be crossing to Jerusalem
With nothing but our love",Crossing to Jerusalem,2018

It goes by real fast

Fade and turn to dust

Piss holds a million deceits
And lifetime goes up in smoke

This is my least favorite you
Who floats far above earth and stone
The night that I twist on the rack
Is the time that I feel most at home

And the rustle of falling leaves
A bird on the edge of a plate
Lost now forever, my love in a sweet memory

The blue pulls away from the sky
The whisper of two broken wings
Maybe they're yours, maybe they're mine

The one where you're just out of reach

The love that fades to black

The ignorance we once forgave
[In/and?] the future if we don't decide to change
The things we cannot save
But it slows to shine upon your face

Rosarinos,"Silbo en la oscuridad
Animal sin reposo
Torres de la vigilia
Candela de los ojos
No sé qué pueda ser
Si una curva del tiempo
O un hueco en el corazón
Atento

Trigo sobre el brocal
Para que coma el hambre
Y abajo el peligroso
Agujero de la sangre
No hallo, no puedo ver
Más que la noche alerta
Y el misterio detrás
De las puertas

Sueñero, jinete sin descanso
Sueñero, sobre un papel en blanco
Sueñero, centinela de mi alma
Sueñero, duérmete y dame calma

Llevo cada mitad
Como dos ríos gemelos
Uno cruza la tierra
El otro fluye en el cielo
El de la oscuridad
No conoce el olvido
Desvelado en seguir
Lo perdido

Ay, este toro azul
Fatigado y sediento
De correr tras la nada
Como la luz y el viento

Ardo sin preguntar
Igual que lo hace el fuego
Tal vez halle cantando

Sueñero, espina de las estrellas

Rosarinos,"Rosario es el Parque Independencia
Un silencio que huele a poesía sobre el rosedal
Es el gris del cemento que arrulla un río somnoliento
Que despierta al llegar un domingo de Newell's y Central

Rosario es de mercurio en la avenida
Es un viento que peina palmeras en el bulevar
Y en el centro es la mesa de un bar que añora al poeta
Cuyo vuelo a menudo se estrella en un suelo industrial

Rosario es mi infancia y mis amigos
Mis viejos cantando a dúo alguna canción
Mi primer cigarrillo intentando sentirme más hombre
Para ver si lograba impactar a mi primer amor

Rosario es el colegio y las rabonas
Una cita en aquel Sol de mayo función matinée
Es el ciego Manuel delirando en un mundo de plástico
Con la magia que sus ballenitas suelen poseer

Rosario es el anochecer de un barrio
Un mendigo que cuenta estrellas desde algún umbral
El compás de un tambor que siempre sonará en mi alma
Donde el Topo Carbone jamás dejará de golpear

Rosario es el arte y su condena
Cuando sabe que la indiferencia lo va a perseguir
Y como tantas mis manos se hartaron de golpear las puertas
Y por no derrumbarme con ellas me tuve que ir

Rosario es ese invierno que partimos
Mi mujer, nuestros miedos, la vida, la música y yo
Y un dolor que crecía a medida que el tren se alejaba
Y unos ojos de almendra tratando de darme valor

Pero algo mío se quedo en sus calles
Hay un duende que en las madrugadas canta con mi voz
Y cruzando Echesortu aquel sueño de mi adolescencia
Que atrapó la leyenda de pablo El Enterrador

La pucha que es difícil la nostalgia
Pero es bueno si puede ayudarte a intentar ser feliz
Y es tanta la gente y las cosas que uno siente que ama
Que no existe tiempo ni distancia para estar allí

Y así fue que la paciencia de Floresta
Me enseñó a ver a través del corazón
Y me dio un balcón para inventarme un cielo
Y ahí estás Rosario, sos le sol Rosario
Porque aún no pudiendo abrazarte
Te siento igual",Tema de Rosario,1997
Rosarinos,"Después de buscar en los rincones del ayer
Me encontré con el destino
Después de subir y de tanto bajar

Recorriendo al sur
Llegaré, llegare, llegare, llegare

Y todo a mi favor ye

Questa stanza non ha più pareti
Ma alberi,
Alberi infiniti
Quando sei qui vicino a me

Che restiamo qui, abbandonati
Come se non ci fosse più
Niente, più niente al mondo.

Cosas al oído
Que me hacían olvidar

Y me quitaba to' el sentio
Era un garaje
Y con luces muy mágicas
Y voces de princesas

Y colores que me raptan
Pieles de aceitunas
Cantes de mi raza, llores donde vive
Y ese duende que me canta a mí

Lerele, lerele, lerele

Vente conmigo
A escuchar este buen son
Que la sangre grité
Y llegué fuerte al corazón

Vámonos prontito
Que la fiesta empieza
Deja el relojito
Que el tiempo no cuenta allí

Cantes de mi raza
Flores donde vive

De ver la estrella de la paz

Mira, esos planetas van diciendo
Que hay una estrella en el firmamento
Que brilla más que las demás

Mira, esos cometas que van viniendo
A presenciar el nacimiento
Que al mundo entero cambiará

Porque aquella estrella, será especial
El mundo entero alucinará
De ver la estrella de la paz

Para sentirte bien por un momento

Donde allí pueda soñar
Dibújame esos
Castillos de corales

Un cruce de miradas
La segunda vez pudo ser la fe

Que mi destino estaba atado a esa mujer
Y como iba saber
Que mi destino estaba atado a esa mujer

Y paso a paso, beso a beso

Pero ya estabas dentro

Y al rozar tu piel
Supe que esta vez
Sobraban las palabras

Tú forma de sentir

Y hoy me cuesta aceptar
Que todo terminó

Parte de un pasado

Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Que me lleve un diablo viejo
Que está dentro de mi espejo gris
Saco mi bandera negra con la calavera

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

I'll come back on my knees some day?

If I could just get away 
With my man

For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

'Til it went, and it wasn't no more. 

In my sweet little Alice blue gown,

And the world seemed to smile all around. 
'Til it wilted, I wore it, 
I'll always adore it,

Just made that much silk and then crawled in the ground,

And I don't care to hope there will be any more! 
And it's gone, 'cause it just had to be, 
Still it wears in my memory.

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Juliet she felt the same

Fever yea I burn forsooth

""Fever, I'm his missus""
""Daddy won't you treat him right?""

Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!
Hou! Hou! Hou!
Cot' damn!

They just can't understand or fathom my demeanor
Unapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas
Out of two, clipse they say malice the meanest
Got love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us
You mistook me for a rapper, huh
Well that makes me an actor, 'cause I would rather clap a gun
And buck on them niggas who hate
Who wanna be in my shoes, live my life, but can't carry my weight
I understand that the envy is part of the game
But make no mistake, you and i, we are not the same
Naw, bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit
Light up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit
And I leave it to y'all, to freestyle and battle and shit
That's not me, I'm more at home wit the chrome
Or at play wit the yay, moving 12 for a zone, I'm gone

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!

God damn, when that white hits the pan and
Comes back hard, I can account for every gram and
The streets molded the man I am
The pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, go-rilla
Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla
I'm the torch that, carry the game
The flame I throw, crack change came from blow
Push the o's, six lay close
Hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows
My hearts on a sleeve-a
Nigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you
Nigga told, they breaking my heart on the streets so
Watch the phonies, watch ya homies
We pop-pop, drop you homie

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!

They call me pusha for one reason
'Cause I keep that sniff all seasons
Whether the price is up or down
I keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around
When it come to that money, I get stealth
Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth
Dog, I know about life
I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say
From that panama sun, to france's champs-élysées
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic
Hear what I say, please don't confuse it
My verses heal, like curt mayfield's music
(I'm your pusha!), damn right
I treat ya nose to hook ya
And only pull back to cook ya, partner

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!

I be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is
So I bangs my cabbage, do you not know the most effective
Way of gettin' money, pull yo gun, rapidly
And watch you see the situation be corrected
Lord heavens, why must I live so devilish
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times
I shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around wit two nines
Who wants to be a millionaire, me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police
'Cause every move you make, I'mma throw a slug
And hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take
Not to be broke, cause coldchain fate witness
Naturally spitting from me, human gat, field to the limit
Head to diminish, loud niggas talking gibberish
Grind beef, I deliver it, with complimentary service, for certain
Live in the living room, searching to hurting you

I ain't just up here, rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit, naw, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you rapper, I'm not you, Pusha

I keep that ziploc bustin' at the stitches, culinary chemist
I serve the malicious to break the fiends fixes
One give you the sniffles, the other leave you with the itches
Transport, airport with the vaseline

So I can fulfill my dreams of passion as green
More cash then ya seen within Ashton it's green
Me drivin' up fast with the lean, zonin' family
Keep youngin's in them rented Camry's

Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Naw, bitch we don't believe in air bags

Cars turn tricks like them Ringling brother skits
Whether bitch hop out or the glock pop out
Ya know, what I'm about
Blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out

Whoever said birds fly south for the winters, a damn lie
Got 'em right here and if I don't like you the grams high
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend, taste it, they need it
They could smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it

Prolly think, I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lota shots, A I style
Jada, the name is filthy but so what
The motherfuckin' game is filthy

You know, what? My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the Cane the built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker

When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, ya own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

I'm far from a noodle, nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sex
Nigga, that's funny you say you a killa, how?
What is it the return of the killer clown?
You don't put no fear in my heart

I make ya people say, 'wow', that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit wit ten rounds at pointblank and pointblank
Coldchian left that nigga stankin'

Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em
A chance to blink when I dodged up on 'em
Pressed the forty up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby I rocked 'em

The Coffin, the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end and you a thug that pretends
Carl Coldchain, suit the nigga, I got a great vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers wit' bullets that go through men

Fuck wit S P, that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll grape ya chest, no sleep like I hate the rest
I'm in the hood like it's my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step and I love gettin' slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope fresh outta Africa that never been stepped on

Dog, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the ghost the main reason why ya set gone
Why I love riffin', the war you wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours

If the world spin in a circle, I want 'em to learn move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for creepin' through the hood
And shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a baller
Want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

Rappers is talking to me as if, come on
We in the same boat, I tell them quick, no, I move Coke
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms, no

It shames me to no end to feed poison
To those who could very well be my kin
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs at the same time cry

Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat, so sorry

And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit, I ain't shit
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live from my kids and their's and them youngin's after that

Flow more sicker, so much shake in the street

Delta '88 on rims man, wit mirror tint 
And four of my most militant men whose trying to stay sucka free
That's why they hang around me, cause I ain't print
Left em for diamonds and pearls, I'm not no bitch
I choose a mack before that attached 100 shot clip
I scare the shit outta bank tellers so I can become rich
That's how I make my living, I give em encouragement, ""you're doing great!""
Keep chillin while I'm flashing the glock in their face
I show em I can be appreciative, I tell em thanks for giving I'm sinning!
But the Lord knows I have three children
Now I'm somewhere in +Utah+ relaxing to +Jazz+ with a broad
Quarter mill in a stash, avoiding the law from far!

Pay close attention when Boo' spit

And don't care who you'll come back through with, been around

Window drop block pop spin around 
Niggaz stand up looking for 'em sit em down

What you spend on a home is a golden piece
On the chest of a biz-oss, it's a must I fliz-oss
My dream team wrestle for cheese like Eric Bischoff
From the kickoff to tip off, I give off rays from the VVs
Ice glazed like lip gloss
Thinking they can see me, I beg to diff-arr
Look up in the skiz-eye, it the big dip-arr

The nine will get most of you, turn yourself around
For he who want to run up and earn himself a crown
Meanwhile study something nigga, this Gucci, Parker
From France where the kids sing Frere Jacques
If not there, I'm somewhere mixing vodkas
In a far off land, where they shake maracas and shit
Keep it moving like in KIs of coke

Californ-I-A, why-A, where everyday it's Friday
They call me Young Roscoe the Philly Fanatic
Out in the West Coast showin' my bad habitts
I give the people what they want keep the party crackin'
This are my homies out in the club tryin' to make it happen
And all the girlies want to creep at least one time
And see if true what all they Homegirls be sayin' about my blood
line
And it ain't nothin' like a sunny summer day 
In the city of LA 
Livin' bussy gettin' pay
That's how we do it on the West
We sip liquid and spit it like fluid in the West
And I can make you love if you don't
Bump it if you won't
Nothin' like bomb music from the West
Layin' under palm trees wit lil' mamas feelin' the breathe
And I don't think I ever want to leave
I Love Cali in the Summer Time!

What we doin barbecuin' a leg
Doin' it under the air fluence so the music got you movin' in it
Nobody on the wall
Nobody sittin' at all
It's like a protacall
The way I got it 'em all waxin' their fos up
Ridin' around wit twenties on their donuts (Donuts)
Pancakes wit enough bass
To insinuate earthquakes
While the sun just bakes 
Havin' fun up in the sunny states
 
Bumpin' the brakes at the yellow light
My seatbelt on tight 
Don't need no cops on my tail tonight
And when you go to the club 
I'm in the back wit a bad mamacita massagin' my back
Party people tear the club up
And make 'em feel it from LA to the Bay
Now put your dubs up 
I Love Cali in the Summer Time

[Chorus 2X]
Come on
You know you got me movin'
I'm rollin' dippin' smashin'
I'm gonna show you how G's do Baby!

Is G's up, is Cali in the summer when it really heats up
It gotta be the hood Homie throwin' heats up
And G's up you got a Benz on flows on a movy put your keys up
Pedals to the floor and ease up
And when the bookies aproach you gotta speed up
You might see Roscoe the Young Gaud 
In the club sippin' wine and if you don't we carris up
We go shanties zeros on my contract 
I might sign six fig spittin non wax
I got my mind on money, women, and fo's
Hot boxin' the Benz all rollin' the windows up
Roll wit the tint glow 
Homies roll wit me ten in the most when I'm outside or posted in
the G ride
Flonse it Lorenzo
But tempo is faster then when you drive so fast 
Your rims glow off from the moonlight and is fear slow (Slow)
Yeah, yeah we do just like this
Ah, we do just like this

Got me facin prison chasin the feelin
I give from the I taste of scrilla, to eighty children in the cold
Before we can arrange a building, then lost in gold
And all the police crooked
To put a slug in me and I took it
A minor, judge say I got no case
He knows my face; he got a grudge from the old days
He won't accept my apology, just don't feel it

And it ain't nobody that he won't bite
I post on the stoop all night
Getting toast of the flow with my troops all night
Layin a foot down I keep hand on the swess tight around the fo pound
I got a bulletproof vest to support now
But some how I don't think it's gonna help when it goes down
Man up, control your smiles and cries
Stand up, and never lay down and die
Cus the cops don't want to help out
They want to see ""The animals wipe themselves out""

Shells reing from the sky like hell

Unless we sell out, so they stuff us in the YA jailhouse
And good cops get fired and silenced
More crooked cops hired for violence
Assignments to investigate
All profits being made in the Section 8
It's to the point where some brothers go to jail
just to get off the streets and eat
Undercovers try to take me under
But I shake 'em off with my Schwin
I can lose them narks in the projects
They won't know what building I'm in

Roscoe,"I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night 
Let me take the time to understand 
And I will 
Set your spirit free 

If you get down on me 
I'll get down on you 
I will do anything 
That you want me to 
It's a game of give and take 
To make it through 
So if you get down on me 
I'll get down on you tonight 

Nighttime turns to day again 
And you are on my mind 
Winter turns to spring and then 
Life has passed you by 
Right now we are so young and free 
But we're runnin' out of time 
So while we've got each other here 
Let's treat our bodies right 

I want to know exactly what to do, so that 
You'll never get me off of your mind 
Communicate and I'll go under cover, gonna 
Make you come tonight 
Over to my house 

I'm not the type to change your mind 
If you want to take it slow 
No pressure to go all the way 
There are often places we can go 

Anytime is the right time to reveal it, when 
Two people fall as deep as you and me 
I want to know every inch of your body so I 
Can set you spirit free 

I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night 
If you open up to me I'll make you realize 
The things that you could never see 
Let me take the time to understand and I will 
Set you free",Get Down,2003

Rippin 'em up after sherds and YA it up from top to bottom
(Rocks!)Yeah we got that but we don't wear 'em
(What about Glocks?!)Yeah we got those bu we don't carry
(What about Plots?!)Fo sho we got those, but we don't ever share 'em
We bury 'em in the back of our mind until it's time to smash
Only in it temporary for cash
And stearin clear from the phonies, cus they scary to blast
But where were the mass murderin Young Assassins murderin tracks
To linguish and we all know how to act
It's YA till we die, do or die, homocide
When we rob, when we ride, nigga side
We oblide by the rules, ride by the fools
Throwin up my squad, holdin up high for the crew
You know how we do...

Yeah, it's plain, simple, I got a plan, go get this money and shake...
Oh 5 seconds

I'm breakin 'em off like the umbilicle cord
Takin 'em off the billboard
Chargin through at full force
And first to walk in, torch 'em, I'm hot to death
Ready scorch 'em, I'll leave 'em all stiff like starch
I noticed a lotta y'all pups like to bark
But don't never hit the fence at night when it gets dark
You better hope the pitbulls never get loose
CUs best believe we comin to get you shitzu
I'm scopin so many sheep in wolves clothin, it's pitiful
Analyze the situation, hypocritical
Sinical criminals, indispicable individuals
Supplyin the heat rock bumpin through yo digital
Whenever you dippin through the ghetto
Whippin the 6-2 Chevy, blowin heavy, goin 70
With one hand on the steering wheel tryin to hold it steady
Hittin the switch

If you a rider, nigga let's roll
If you a hustler, let's get doe
If you a soldier, let's get low
But keep it gangsta anyway ya go

I'll ride with my brothas, die with my brothas
Drive by pull a homicide with my brothas
We fight amongst each other, but we ride together
And soak up all the game that Gotti tells us

Like let's get low, flip that whole
If one of us gets signed we split that doe
Catch me in the kitchen thousand grammer
I keep it flippin', need more arm and hammer

I can cook and ship and I'm good with numbers
I'm the one they run to when they coke start crumblin'
Gimme that work watch how quick I twerk it
Gimme a bird and I'll flip it to a turkey

Y.G. ya heard me on the block servin'
Everybody says that my momma don't deserve me
Go get the word out, I gotta bird house
With a hole in the wall so I serve out

Yeah, Yeah, uh, uh
Let's go get 'em, let's go chop 'em
Let's go hit 'em, let's go rob 'em
Pockets gettin low, that's a fa sho' problem

Heater ready to blow problem solver
Chromed out forty-fo' mag revolver
Guaranteed not to leave a track if I off him
Next thing you know, back to coffin

Smoke a nigga like a Zig Zag now I'm coughin'
Two to his neck, two to his noggin'
Didn't touch his vest, I left his head throbbin'
Red beam out, shots ring out

Get away car while my lead streams out
Guerilla in the mist so my tires peel out
A heehaw with alist, who's next to cross out
Dealing with the gift to flip and rip this

Bizzle in this bitch! (Bizzle in this bitch!)
Whoa!

And everythang be everythang
My momma nerves is bad, she don't want me servin that
She heard me rap and told me to work with that
So I racked up my soldiers headed to tha battlefield

Light up tha block just like a candle will
Voted most likely as to handle steel, that's why I handle steel
I gotta plan to build buildings in tha hood

For all tha innocent children living in tha hood
I ain't a bad person snatching purses acting worthless
Cracking the surface with an accurate verse

AWOL, headed back to the block to the first spot
Where I can get fronted an 8-Ball's
Block livin', cop ditchin', the clock tickin'
Tock tickin' pop the clip in the plot thickens

Shots lickin', stop trippin' the rocks hidden
My glocks glisten and whistle for my pot to piss in
I'm in an awkward position, quixotic and persistent
I rock it with precision, my squad on a mission

Demolition men of vision with semi's any sippin'
Crop deficiency, watchin' my enemies penny pinchin'
Positively not in the city only robbin'
Squabbin', survivin', maintainin' striving and gang robbery

See me caught up in the twist as I bust this dream
Too fly when we cruise by
Me and my Westside riders and plus my original squad
In PA sippin E & J
Dippin the everyday Chevrolets candy painted
Got my eyes wide shut
Kick back for a minute
Let my high rise up
I can't be faded tough guys wise up

You want to party with a DPG
Come and holla at me
I'll be up in Dark House with all the homies
Poppin' my call happy
Doin' it big as ever
In the City of Angels, Devils and pretty weather
The shark packed with bumper to bumper traffic
All bouncin' and 40 ouncin'
Hydraulic wit it, alcoholic wit it
Bumper paint and polished demolished
But we ain't trippin' we got heavy wallets
Sittin' on dubs, rollin' on three wheels
On the four with mugs and four with big wheels
Just breezing, and all the non-believers eventually end up believing

When the Yak in my cup spills, I get a refill

I put it down like a G supposed to
And show you something that only a G could show you
Makin' all the cheese leavin' mice with tofu
Young but I'm cool laid back and old school
Come here girl let me show you how to G Walk
And maybe after we could sneak off
Talent scout with a casting couch
If you ain't got no talent ya gotta get out
Let me rock the breezies one time
With my bump rhyme
I show them how to do the snake with they jaw line
I'm DP'ed out
With every piece of love in the club that could follow me out
And they all mine

The one ya'll love to blow back
I'll got five fingers, it ain't no riddle
By the only one showing is the one in the middle
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the dog
Going at it over kittle out in the back yard
I drink yak hard, ya'll ack hard
Now I gotta touch up like a Mack card
Everybody packing a strap or spark
But don't everybody wanna strap or spawl

All I know is flow and rappin'
They call me young roscoe the Philly fanatic
Silly sporadic, dippin in traffic, grippin the matic
Sharp as a guillotine, still a teen
The California sun just beaming as I lean
Pull out my cigarettes feigning for nicotine
Straight of the Philly scene, Made for the silver screen
And I beam, my foot on the gasoline
Tell me I ain't the fliest M.C's you seen
And it's all smooth sailin'

Accurate with a maculate bash, The cake masher
Def Jeff let me borrow the keys
The great master
Young and I'm buck wild label as a luck child
Running them up wild laying hell of cuts now
I get the clubs shut down with this thug style
I puff clouds and touch crowds what now
Sick rhymes strict nines running thru my bloodline

Rollin down the 101 counting dead bugs on my windshield

[Verse 1: Roscoe]
I just rolled up in my Benzo
I just rolled up some of that you-know
I just popped out of nowhere like whaddaya-know
And I ain't going nowhere you know
y'all don't know half of my scenario
I got niggas all up in my cereal
And don't know if its Applejacks or Cheerios
y'all don't hear me though
It ain't no clothes in your ear to scope
See I just took over your stereo
18 year old college material
Puttin Philly on the map, philly on my cap
The imperial superior
And all the skirts want to give it to Sco
Till these shirts mix skirts want to give it to Sco
Stick works skinny work
But I'd rather have a fatter
If she pay em like she weigh em give it to Sco

[Chorus: Roscoe] 2x
See me my crew ain't- nothing but trouble
And we be coming through like- nothing but trouble
And niggaz tell us we ain't- nothing but trouble
Especially me I ain't- nothing but trouble

[Verse 2: Roscoe]
Yeah Philly in the house, Philly in this mount
Fitted on perfect, vest on the surface
I did it on purpose, fresh out the circus
I spit it so murderous, I'm crazy
Going through a tough time, got me sippin JD
Seeing in 3-D, see me in a G3
Coastin postin roast it toast it off
E & J G & J
I hit the VMAs with THC
All in my DNA I'm be	-A-D
Till the bone with the chrome
Once again its on
Club hoppin once we in the zone
We gonna BLAZE, GUZZLE, RAY, BUBBLE, SHIZZLE
Misbehave and start trouble
SPARK, CHUG, BARK, BUZZ
Dippin smashin why-A'in it up

[Verse 3: Roscoe]
I rock the party that rocks the body
Me Young Gotti we rock the party
Now we all in the cleezy no ideezy
Young Sco Gotti help me somebody
High loaded fly molded
Fry floatin shining glowing
Signing flowing rising blowing
Crackin poppin stackin dropping
Platinum product alive in your ride up
For all my survivors and riders
We gets wasted faded
Nice today enough for the rest of the night
Triple XT but my vest just right
Tech to my right with my neck full of ice
I'ma link up with you later, aight?
Take it or leave it I'm a playa for life

Intro:

Yeah, yeah, yeah (This is Scoedelic)
We don't play games
We take game to spray flames (Y.A.)

Hook:

Now what I look like?
Some type of lame or somethin'?
And look like niggaz thinkin' it's a game or somethin'?
Givin' me that look like what's your angle cousin?
I look left, look right, might be danger comin'

Verse One:

What I look like, if not a million dollars?
Bazillion stages and a billion hollas
What I look like, pushin' that new Impala?
Without 22's on it, is that a true baller?
What up with you baller? What cha bank book look like?
But here's another question: What I look like?
I been around the world Japan to Amsterdam
Spins around the world expandin' that's the plan
Radio Scoe with da radio flow
Rakin' in the dough, blazin' drough
What I look like anything less than three X's?
What I look like anything less than three Tec's?

(Hook: 2x, with variations)

Verse Two:

Now what I look like?
Eddie Cane or somethin'?
Like I don't spit flames or somethin'?
(The way you gratin on me)
Damn, it's like you know me by name or somethin'
Take a picture put it in a frame or somethin'
What I look like? A bird brain or somethin'?
I can see it in your eyes y'all came for somethin'
Your stories are all faulty, you're changin' somethin'
You must want some of my Mary Jane or somethin'
Numbskullz too much novocaine or somethin'
Get left with numb skulls migraines, concussions
And you can see it in me, Gotti trained me somethin'
Like Bin Laden Saadam Hussein or somethin'
I'm known for causin' spontaneous combustion
Constantly jumpin' through miscellaneous subjects
Actin' like you all insane or somethin'
Get wet like you ain't potty trained or somethin'

(Hook: 2x)

Verse Three:

What I look like comin' out droppin' floppin'
Girl what I look like, stoppin' and jockin'
You're best day you might catch me hoppin'
A 4 pancaking, no hand wavin'
Now here go the Feds, you know the routine
You see that blue and red, it ain't no red or green
Only a little lean up on the gasoline
Say hello to my little friend with the little beam
Now imagine me not saggin'
Not packin' a magnum
What I look like?
Now imagine me takin' a bad one
To the pad with no magnums
What I look like?
I can't imagine me gettin' out rapped
It won't never happen
Fool what I look like?
I keep it crackalackin'
I'm all about them plaques and figures
I'm a platinum nigga

First came the wishin', then came the bitchin'
Wanna know the secrets comin' from the kitchen

I was fine dinin', you was eatin' chicken
I'll bust a bad ho, nigga take your pickin'
Like a slut callin' bitches on my cell phone
But my bitches, try to take my fly bitches
I ain't just trippin', I can't trust niggas who ain't us?

Bringin' niggas who can't bust
I'm A+ wid it, I'm anxious to crush ya
Half tustla mixed with you just a busta
Bitch ass niggas get me rich fast quicka
Now don't tricka this supa ass kicka

Why do you hate on me?
'Cause I don't be trippin' off you
My image is stuck on G
Try to fuck with me this year
Get the 'beep' outta here
I'm so up on my shit
These bitches ain't gettin' my grip
So I still remain a G
But why do you hate on me?

How you gone hate on me? And I'm that nigga
That ride beats smoother than Ron Isley
Talkin' bout fuck Damani but steady eyein' me
Steady tryin' to see how good sex with me could be
Why won't you let me fuck?

And I'm the best thing goin', and you the best thing hoin'
Plus we got you on tape givin' head in slow motion
Undercover ho's be real soft spoken, why would you slash my tire?
And I got stock in Goodyear, bitch I'm all good year
Tryin' to fuck up my clutch so I'm forced to change gears

Dark skin, go tee with no beard
I change ho's like I change clothes
Young devil in the city o' angels
Keep it ghetto like cups with staples
Live from L.A. gettin' head from Rachel, now

Why do you hate on me?
'Cause I don't be trippin' off you
My image is stuck on G
Try to fuck with me this year
Get the 'beep' outta here
I'm so up on my shit
These bitches ain't gettin' my grip
So I still remain a G
But why do you hate on me?

Why do bitches blow dicks? I don't know that
But I can tell you dis, you simple trick
Now you get it all you want
We roll joints we don't fuck with blunts, fuck a blunt now
Some niggas is worse than ho's

Holdin' somethin' on your chest let it go
I'll make a bitch blow balls like a ball and sing that song, but naked
Most o' y'all niggas be break and hatin' records
The most hatin' done in 8.5 seconds
Why you hatin' Snoopy, you hate Nate and hate me

Why you hatin' stupid and hatin' on Warren G
Why you hatin' Rasco, why you hate Damani
'Cause he wanna fuck Armani and don't wear Armani
Hatin' Gondee and hatin' Tredee, Tredee is like fuck' em
If they hatin the G, fuck y'all

Why do you hate on me?
'Cause I don't be trippin' off you
My image is stuck on G

From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night 
Let me take the time to understand 
And I will 
Set your spirit free 

If you get down on me 
I'll get down on you 
I will do anything 
That you want me to 
It's a game of give and take 
To make it through 
So if you get down on me

But we're runnin' out of time 
So while we've got each other here 
Let's treat our bodies right 

I want to know exactly what to do, so that 
You'll never get me off of your mind 
Communicate and I'll go under cover, gonna 
Make you come tonight 
Over to my house 

I'm not the type to change your mind 
If you want to take it slow 
No pressure to go all the way 
There are often places we can go 

Anytime is the right time to reveal it, when 
Two people fall as deep as you and me 
I want to know every inch of your body so I 
Can set you spirit free 

I will be the one to love and comfort you 
From now until the day I die 
I will take you places that you only think 
About when you're asleep at night

And niggaz tell us we ain't- nothing but trouble
Especially me I ain't- nothing but trouble

[Verse 2: Roscoe]
Yeah Philly in the house, Philly in this mount
Fitted on perfect, vest on the surface
I did it on purpose, fresh out the circus
I spit it so murderous, I'm crazy
Going through a tough time, got me sippin JD
Seeing in 3-D, see me in a G3
Coastin postin roast it toast it off
E & J G & J
I hit the VMAs with THC
All in my DNA I'm be	-A-D
Till the bone with the chrome
Once again its on
Club hoppin once we in the zone
We gonna BLAZE, GUZZLE, RAY, BUBBLE, SHIZZLE
Misbehave and start trouble
SPARK, CHUG, BARK, BUZZ
Dippin smashin why-A'in it up

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Roscoe]
I rock the party that rocks the body
Me Young Gotti we rock the party
Now we all in the cleezy no ideezy
Young Sco Gotti help me somebody
High loaded fly molded
Fry floatin shining glowing
Signing flowing rising blowing
Crackin poppin stackin dropping
Platinum product alive in your ride up
For all my survivors and riders
We gets wasted faded
Nice today enough for the rest of the night
Triple XT but my vest just right
Tech to my right with my neck full of ice
I'ma link up with you later, aight?
Take it or leave it I'm a playa for life

Intro:

Yeah, yeah, yeah (This is Scoedelic)
We don't play games
We take game to spray flames (Y.A.)

Hook:

Now what I look like?
Some type of lame or somethin'?
And look like niggaz thinkin' it's a game or somethin'?
Givin' me that look like what's your angle cousin?
I look left, look right, might be danger comin'

Verse One:

What I look like, if not a million dollars?
Bazillion stages and a billion hollas
What I look like, pushin' that new Impala?
Without 22's on it, is that a true baller?
What up with you baller? What cha bank book look like?
But here's another question: What I look like?
I been around the world Japan to Amsterdam
Spins around the world expandin' that's the plan
Radio Scoe with da radio flow
Rakin' in the dough, blazin' drough
What I look like anything less than three X's?
What I look like anything less than three Tec's?

(Hook: 2x, with variations)

Verse Two:

Now what I look like?
Eddie Cane or somethin'?
Like I don't spit flames or somethin'?
(The way you gratin on me)
Damn, it's like you know me by name or somethin'
Take a picture put it in a frame or somethin'
What I look like? A bird brain or somethin'?
I can see it in your eyes y'all came for somethin'
Your stories are all faulty, you're changin' somethin'
You must want some of my Mary Jane or somethin'
Numbskullz too much novocaine or somethin'
Get left with numb skulls migraines, concussions
And you can see it in me, Gotti trained me somethin'
Like Bin Laden Saadam Hussein or somethin'
I'm known for causin' spontaneous combustion
Constantly jumpin' through miscellaneous subjects
Actin' like you all insane or somethin'
Get wet like you ain't potty trained or somethin'

(Hook: 2x)

Verse Three:

What I look like comin' out droppin' floppin'
Girl what I look like, stoppin' and jockin'
You're best day you might catch me hoppin'
A 4 pancaking, no hand wavin'
Now here go the Feds, you know the routine
You see that blue and red, it ain't no red or green
Only a little lean up on the gasoline
Say hello to my little friend with the little beam
Now imagine me not saggin'
Not packin' a magnum
What I look like?
Now imagine me takin' a bad one
To the pad with no magnums
What I look like?
I can't imagine me gettin' out rapped
It won't never happen
Fool what I look like?
I keep it crackalackin'
I'm all about them plaques and figures
I'm a platinum nigga

Of white blood and red blood I came
I travel the saddle I follow the cattle
Down on the range where they graze
And I just ride in from a hard south western drive
My lips parched and bloodied
My face torn by sand storms and pride
Loyalty riches and inner bred ditches ?
Was the brew that I drank as a child
So rebellious a lover
Don Juan as a my cover
They die cast my type called me wild ?
And I just ride in from a hard southwestern drive
The hanging tree is waiting for me to arrive

Structured political our children they ridiculed
They teach them of sins and to lie
Their schools build't by fools but by breaking the rules
Like A fox I am forced now to hide
And I just ride in from a hard south western drive
My lips parched and bloodied
My face torn by sand storms and pride
Pepper tree spreads taking many mans heads ?
But the one they would want most is mine 

To the mission I go I
In San Juan and I kneel
And I pray for the love of my life
And I just ride in from a hard south western drive

You should just go and throw a cape on
And it's just so amazin'
So amazin'

Take it to the car, bloop, bloop,
That shit look like I'm speed racing
Leave 'em with me, it'll boost your reputation
Westside is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, lets just pace it til its

Tell me is it the fame or the money
Either way this people all think there must be something about me - stunning

Like a game of badminton, I’m so out of reach
I’m at the finish line, give my winning speech
It goes ""ahem , um""
But all y’all said I couldn’t do it
I hope every time you grab a … you forced to hear my music
You’re so cubic, I’m so coolest
Got your girlfriend playing nudest
I’m, with no script, but I don’t trip
Trust me I give a bat pri sa , means like aristocrat
No lady and the tramp but they were gifted cats we tripled that
I used to have problems, until I learnt to deal

I do, I do, I do, I do
Oh, oh, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

What I do, and I do, and I do, and I do, and I do (3x)

Do It

Stumble in the elevator, drifting down the highway
Drunk texed all my numbers, don’t know who the fuck is calling
Feeling extra reckless I could probably use some counseling
It’s a party at the condo, I don’t really feel like talking
Feel like killing the party and these hoochies in Air Jordans 
And pissing off all the bitches who wish that they could afford them, see um don’t brag a lot
'Cause when you, have a lot
You don’t, talk about it
You just, laugh a lot
And you just, walk it out, pop it out and stock it out, 
But ya'll bitter bitch ass haters don’t know what I’m talking bout
Do you? Cause I do
The best I can me and my crew - the best of friends
And the niggas that ride for me will put to sleep the best of me
And stay in your place, pass the ace, and put a smile back on your face
'Cause it’s a blessing to be next to the best dressed bitch up in this place
But I failed to mention that , um , I do this shit
While you other candy-coaters on that other .. box of goober shit
I rap  sing and do it on another box of .. shit
And if you ask my haters probably tell you I’m a super bitch
Yeah , uh huh, that's cause I do this shit 
'Cause I do it so right, and I do it so good
And I do it just like I said I would
'Cause I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

I'm in an awkward position, quixotic and persistent
I rock it with precision, my squad on a mission

Demolition men of vision with semi's any sippin'
Crop deficiency, watchin' my enemies penny pinchin'
Positively not in the city only robbin'
Squabbin', survivin', maintainin' striving and gang robbery

So rida, slangin' snow powda
Whoa partner, Scoe Gostra
I'm so proppa, I won't drop my dope for no coppa
Calidro copper, Calico poppa

Metallic coat rocker, staticy Scoe shocker
Block-A-Wear tucked in my Roc-A-Wear
Get caught slippin' not aware and you're out there
Now everytime you see me I'll always got my Y.A. ridaz there

Youth Authority, true loyalty spit watery
No blows hit split rip and chipped arteries
Triple X Atari, Sweats and Ferrari's
Y.A.-warty, we came to party

Why'all niggaz hardly half of this army
We all G's and hustlas and car thieves
Quick to start beef

Yeah we back in bizzle my nizzle
We all lifted, we all gifted, we all splifted

I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,
Roscoe Orman,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you see

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

You may not believe this but
He is making a list and checking it twice
Going to find out who is naughty and who is nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Your town and my town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you are wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Believe me I'm ready for him

From France where the kids sing Frere Jacques
If not there, I'm somewhere mixing vodkas
In a far off land, where they shake maracas and shit

Rose Banks,"I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream

And you run for cover 'cause you know you've made me sad

Searching for a dream 
As the tide rolled in 
It brought a memory 

I can’t comprehend 
All the places I’ve been 
I’m growing so old 
I’ve got a eulogy 

When I saw you 
Everything changed 
My numbness did fade 
I could feel again 

If just for a moment 
Things ended too soon 
All that’s left is a bruise 
That only time can mend 

I wanna be the kiss of life that sets you free from pain 
I wanna be the kiss of love that makes you feel again 

I sought you out 
To learn the lies we were told 
I gave you my truth 
You would’ve never known

In my search for answers 
I found it all 
Everything that I’d wanted 
But was never shown 

But you were too broken 
So downright abused 
I had to pay 
For things I didn’t do 

And now I’m swimming in circles 
Between hopeful and doubt 
But as much as I drown 
I won’t accept the help 

I wanna be the kiss of life that sets you free from pain 
I wanna be the kiss of love that makes you feel again 

 And if you’d only open wide 
You’d see all the signs 
That brought us here 
Let’s disappear 
I want you for the rest of my life 
The rest of my life

Our families are falling to pieces 
over monetary disputes 
When did we lose our focus 
and trade in our dignity and our truth? 

The world seems like it's ended 
when whores earn more than an honest day's work 
Our religion has crushed down upon us 
when fathers subjected kids to their abuse 
Our schools are scaring teachers 
Discipline's been put in the hands of the youth

we had rolemodels to look up to?

There’s no tomorrow, no tomorrow, 
It’s a mad world, it’s a mad world) 

The world's become so scattered 
we'd rather have diamonds, and pearls over love 
And when did gratuitous violence 
become a subject we daily discuss? 
Our children are growing up too fast 
the pressures of beauty are upon us all 
Our future's looking uncertain 
we need someone to just speak up 

Oooh speak up, ooooh speak up

I couldn't see what the truth was 
Nothing more than a bet, I was just your pet 

No one understood, I kept it deep inside

Young men wrote to me 
Everybody seemed to have time to devote to me 
Everyone I saw all swore they knew me 
Once upon a song 
Main attraction, couldn't buy a seat 
The celebrity, celebrities were dying to meet 
I've had every accolade bestowed on me 
And so you see 

If I never sing another song 
It wouldn't bother me 
I had my share of fame 
You know my name 

If I never sing another song 
Or take another bow 
I would get by, but I'm not sure how 

Always posing, but you love it all 
Though you have to learn to act like you're above it all 
Everything I did the world applauded 
Once upon a star 

Framed citations, hung on every wall 
Got a scrapbook full of quotes, I can recall them all 
There were times I felt the world belonged to me 
And so you see 

If I never sing another song 
It wouldn't bother me

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rocking and a-rolling
Oh I said I wish you were mine.",Dizzy Miss Lizzy,1987
Rose Of Rose,"眠れないのね ほら抱いてあげるわ
悲しい言葉 たくさん 知ったのね
でも きっとねあなたが思うよりも
美しいはずよ この先の世界は
恐れないで 見たものは全て
明日へ
続くための 道しるべだから
微笑んでいけるよう...
Shine Sunshine in your life
朝が来るわ いつの日にも
Day and Night in your world
すべてが 今 あなたを導いていく
もう行くのよ この瞬間を逃さず
ここにいるから
ここで見ているから
忘れないで 間違うことさえ
いつでも
過ちにはならないの そうよ
微笑んでいられるわ...
Shine Sunshine in your life
朝が来るわ どんな日にも
Day and Night in your world
すべてが 今 輝きはじめてる

Rose Parenti,"I will follow Him
Follow Him wherever He may go
And near Him I always will be
For nothing can keep me away
He is my destiny

I will follow Him
Ever since He touched my arm I knew
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away, away from His love

I love Him, I love Him, I love Him
And where He goes
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow

I will follow Him
Follow Him wherever He may go

A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away

We will follow Him

Follow Him wherever He may go
There isn't an ocean too deep (too deep)
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep us away, away from His love

Oh yeah, I love Him

I'll follow

Rose Parenti,"Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy,
(My guy)
Nothing you could do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy.
(My guy)
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter,
Like birds of a feather we stick together,
I'm tellin' you from the start I can't be torn apart from my guy.

Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy,

Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy.

I gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful, and I'm gonna,
You best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy.

As a matter of opinion I think he's tops,
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop;
As a matter of taste to be exact he's my ideal as a matter of fact.

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.
(My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy.

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.

No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.

He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.

Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout

Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to shout for joy

Let it all out
These are the things I can do without

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

If I could change your mind
