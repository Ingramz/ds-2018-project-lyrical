Brooks & Dunn,"Maybe it was the moonlight, the scent of you on the breeze
Maybe it was your shadow that fell over me
Such a beautiful stranger, eyes darker than coal
Your first look crossed the desert into my soul

Mi corazon es perdido a ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
My heart is lost to you

Maybe it was the music, the way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment that hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing, mesmerized by your gaze
There was some kind of magic that led me away

Mi corazon es perdido a ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
My heart is lost to you

Oh la, la, la    la, la, la     la, la, la
Forever I'm under your spell

Oh la, la, la    la, la, la     la, la, I can tell

Mi corazon es perdido a ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
My heart is lost to you

Brooks & Dunn,"Sun coming' up over New York City
School bus driver in a traffic jam
Staring out at the faces in a rear view mirror
Lookin' at the promise of the Promised Land

One kid dreams of fame and fortune
One kid helps pay the rent
One could end up going to prison
One just might be president

[Chorus]
Only in America
Dreamin' in red white and blue
Only in America
Where we dream as big as we want to

We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Sun goin' down on an LA freeway
Newly weds in the back of a limosine
A welder's son and a banker's daughter
All they want is every thing

She came out here to be an actress
He was a singer in a band
They might just go back to Oklahoma
And talk about the stars they could have been

We all get a chance
Everybody gets to dance
Only in America

Brooks & Dunn,"I know you know
Just how it goes when it goes
And how it feels
To be lost and left alone on your own
And what it's like
To give all you got and have to stand and watch it 
As it walks away
So everyone deserves a chance to live and learn 
From mistakes
That we make and hearts that break and bridges burn
Starting now
From this moment on nothing's gonna go wrong
Love is here to stay

You'll never be without
You'll always have enough
When you're in my arms
You'll never go unloved
As long as there is time
And for all of it to come 
No matter where you go I want you to know
You'll never be unloved

So in this life we lead 
Some things are guaranteed
You can count on the fact that hearts won't act responsibly
Now and then
Comes a love that's heaven sent and meant to be
So baby look at me

You'll never be without
You'll always have enough
When you're in my arms
You'll never go unloved
As long as there is time
And for all of it to come 
No matter where you go I want you to know
You'll never be unloved

You'll never be without
You'll always have enough
When you're in my arms
You'll never go unloved
As long as there is time
And for all of it to come 
No matter where you go I want you to know
You'll never be unloved",Unloved,2001
Brooks & Dunn,"Saw an old friend last night I hadn't seen in a couple of years
Stopped in Galatoire's had a couple of beers
Talked about the price of oysters, the coach at LSU
Then like I knew it would the conversation turned to you

He had to go and I looked at my watch, it was 1:45
I headed down canal, the quarter was coming alive
A man on the corner told me that Jesus is coming soon
But I was lost in the music and the crowd and the smell of cheap perfume

It's not good for a man to be alone
But a women needs someone that she can count on
And I walked down by the river in the cold gray dawn
Love is like the Mississippi
When she's gone she's gone

The line was long at Cafe do Monde so I walked out on the pier
Thought about all the winds and turns and mistakes that got me here
Might as well try to change the course this old river takes
Than to go back in time when you were mine, pretend it's not late

It's not good for a man to be alone
But a women needs someone that she can count on
And what I'd give to go back but the current's just too strong
Love is like the Mississippi
When she's gone she's gone

It's not good for a man to be alone
But a women needs someone that she can count on
And what I'd give to go back but the current's just too strong
Love is like the Mississippi

Yeah she's gone","When She's Gone, She's Gone",2001
Brooks & Dunn,"I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when the blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue Christmas

You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas",Blue Christmas,2002
Brooks & Dunn,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey
And some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although' it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you?
Merry Christmas to you?",The Christmas Song,2002

Waitin' for you dear

Well, I've waited all year long
Now the year is almost gone
Hangin' round the mistletoe
Hangin' round the mistletoe

But if that's what I got to do
Just to get a kiss from you
I'm hangin' round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

Christmas is a special time
To give and to receive
For every little kiss you give me
I will give you three

You ain't gonna miss one kiss
That's one thing you'll never miss
I'm hangin' round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

I've had my eyes on you
For a long, long time
So I'm asking Santa please
Make that pretty girl mine

Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas,
You can plan on me

Shadows are dancin' in the pale candelight.
Life should be a rainbow, but it's blue:
It won't be Christmas without you.

I wrapped up all your presents,
Wrote my name on every card.
I just can't help it, baby,
Takin' this so hard.
You tell me: what's a man to do?
'Cause it won't be Christmas without you.

I stare into the flames: all I see is your face.
All this joy an' happiness seems so out of place.
As far as I'm concerned, it's just a day I must get through.
But it won't be Christmas without you.

Brooks & Dunn,"I wrote a letter to Santa last night
Told him what I want to make my
Christmas right
If I don't get it, I'm gonna be blue
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you

I don't want no tinker toys
Don't wanna waste my time drinkin' with the boys

Brooks & Dunn,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Brooks & Dunn,"It seemed like just another Christmas Eve
The kids had left some milk and cookies to eat
We cuddled up and read 'The Night Before Christmas' again
I headed down for one more holiday snack
I saw this fat man with a pack on his back
Call me crazy but there's toys and stuff all over the den

[Chorus]
Santa's coming over to your house
Christmas coming down the line
Santa's coming over to your house
I know 'cause he just left mine

He left a Barbie and a video game
He filled the stockings with the red candy canes
He hid a skateboard and a football up under the tree
I heard him holler and he pulled out of sight
""A Merry Christmas and to all, a good night""
I know what you're thinking
But I'm telling you, ya got to believe

There's never been such a day in 
Beverly Hills, L.A.
But it's December the twenty-fourth
And I am longing to be up north

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

""May your days be merry and bright
and may all your Christmases be white""",White Christmas,2002
Brooks & Dunn,"Got a wife and two kids, all gathered around
A twenty-pound turkey, snow on the ground
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus

Eric wants a glove, he tears into a box
His eyes are wide with wonder,
I sit back and watch
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus

I haven't heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my children's eyes and there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says there's no Santa Claus

Molly gets a doll, Momma's camera clicks
Guess we all get the puppy, he's getting in his licks
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus

I?m trying to read a card in crooked red and blue
Only part that really matters is ""Daddy, we love you""
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus

I haven?t heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my children's eyes and there I see my proof

A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night

Love knows no season
Love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open
We're walking and hoping together

[Chorus]
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No, man""
But you can do the job while you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

[Chorus]

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way

I can pull the shades and feel your lips they're touching mine again
I can watch the shadow of the moon slow dance across your skin

Brooks & Dunn,"I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to Johnson's fence

That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside picking blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car,
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned,
I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

Her daddy didn't like me much
In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window

We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car,
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers

I've come to know

Give our love a chance (just one more chance)

And if we walked away
Would it make more sense

Goin' 'round and 'round and never getting anywhere

Brooks & Dunn,"Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Momma used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers out on his old porch swing

Says he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
How ya keep from going crazy
He said I'll see my wife and son in just a little while
I asked him what he meant
He looked at me and smiled, said

I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what I can see
Oh I believe

Few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Getting all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said oh by the way son, old man Wrigley has died.

Later on that night, I laid there thinkin' back
Thought 'bout a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man who looked me in the eye, said

I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what I can see

In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live

No, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is

I could see me getting left behind

And she started rolling those nines
Stacking up the chips half way to heaven

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.

You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.

You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""

You're stratosphere.

Where they've got you by the clause
I'm the fly that build the spider's web
That's what the people on the first floor said

It's just another teat falls on my pillow
A frozen emotion that dries on my face
Sleepless nights just contemplating 
Just another tear that leaves no trace
(They call it, call it) Just another tear
My night times not for sleeping
(They call it, call it) Just another tear

When you shake hands, cross your fingers

I scratch your back and you stab mine
Now I know that the winner is judge by time

A soft breath, a steamy window

As I wipe it away the water's on my hand
A lonely man, a winters day

I will never love again
You were my only love, my only friend
I will never love again
Now that you broke my heart it will never mend
Never mend

I say, little things like the beauty of touch
I said, I need you so much
I'm living in slow motion
You are my world my picture to paint
This is the one time that I disagree with fate

I will never love again
You were my only love, my only friend
I will never love again
Now that you broke my heart it will never mend
Never mend

Two people can't always be the same
Opposites attracts I feel so much pain
Tears that don't dilute the past

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1993

This song is about young children
who live in single family homes and
their mother or father chooses their 
boyfriend or girlfriend over you. Remember
parents, kids don't ask to be born.  So I'm tell this
story and it starts back in '88.

Yo, this nigga named d-rugs
My moms dates him
Swear to God I hate him
If I could I would break him
When he comes around, her brain sizzles like a Steakum
Damn, can't jakes take him
She neglected me
Run around with this punk nigga recklessly
Had him in her tongue
Guess she was in ectasy
For her love
Took the best of me
O-d'd excessively 
That's her boyfriend 
Or her toyfriend see
Let me specify 
The last man 
Took the money
Left the guy
Desert dry
And gave it to d-rugs
He kept her high
Runnin around 
He's a facial
Smelled like a fragrance
She sniffed it in her nasal
Beggin her to listen
I told her he ain't faithful
Fuckin wit Aunt Rachel
Ya'll so dumb
Makin me look disgraceful
He got a girl named Hazel
And another white one
But wit him
he ain't racial

[Chorus]
I'm your mother 
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga 
In the alley
I'm your doctor 
When in need
I'm your Coke
I'm your Weed
You know me
I'm your friend
Your main boy
Thick and thin
I'm that monster in your dreams
For my love 
You will feen.

[Cam'ron]
What the deal dun?
It's '91
Moms still strung
On this nigga d-rugs
His game's tight
Every night she tries to go pursue him
Then she screws him
But my man Un knew him
Schooled me to him
Said he got mad hoes
He used to pimp him
Said he can get you mad doe
What you mean?
He just ain't wit your mother
He's got other partners
He's a foreigner though
The cops don't like
Illegal alien 
Can't even say his name on the phone
But you can get money with him
Then leave him alone
Or you'll be inside the new cuffs
Plus a news rush
Said some more about him
Then he introduced us
Took me to the block where everybody get him off
Showed me his clientele
Ever since--Hit it off
He was right
D-rugs got dumb freaks
Men and women love him
Got him 10 grand in one week.

Chorus

[Cam'ron]
Now it's 98 
D-rugs, he payed me well
500 S-E-L
Got me land in A-T-L
It's all swell
Way before a felony
But now that we together
It seems that moms in jealous
Cause he wit me now
And everyone time I g him
But when it comes to her
She even pay to see him
Eh yo, money excites me
But my niggas on the block
They got shysty
Cause I'm wit d-rugs
They don't like me
Tried to snipe me
Right before the damn feds had indicted
And my mother 
Her nostrils wide
Too much of d-rugs left her hospitalized
We both was arrested
Stars of the block
Her by cardiac
Me by the cops
But for my mother
Man there's nothin but love
But that's what we get--Fuckin wit Drugs.

The only one who ever saw my face, I must erase, had to get filthy dirty
Left him in his driveway soaking wet, hope nobody heard me
I'm out that muthafucka with about 4 pounds of that shamrock
Zip lock, body bag, toe tag, wet t-shirt, black mask
In and out fast, murderous, vast vigorous
Stroke that nigga like a zig zag rolled cigarette,
And I do it to get my dick wet
Brain grain rotten, I was a 12 year old gettin' raped by my momma's partner
So I've been in pussy since I could start nuttin'
I'm off that cloraseptic and that robatussin
Had a appetite for the wrong nigga, said he was real meat but I knew he wasn't
Had me dumpin' out the back of cadillac's on walter
Got a stinky smell to him, can't even hug my momma
I'm so sick I can't sleep at night, might swallow my tongue
Get all the gas deposits out the closet, let the water run
Get the flame thrower, lighter fluid, paper plates, 'cause we barbacuin'
In a funky situation that's how we do it

I fuckin' realize it's a situation of sin

Smebbin' in a high performance zooped up nova, pushin' crank
Callin' shots on my gossipper, faulty chip
1-800 locker number, on the left side of my hip
Neighborhood watch better watch that ass
I'm a paperboy and I collects that cash
One more muthafuckin' complaint and your ass ain't gon' last
On a block where I clock cash so fast
This is a stick up, nigga, don't even try it
If you go as far as to blink an eye, muthafucka you gon' die
Pressure I apply, no lie, I got just finished doin' 10
For what? for killin' my best friend
And I'll murder again if I'm forced, then I must
After the first time the second time was a rush
What about the third time? the third time felt like sex
What kind of guns did you use? choppers, uzis, teks
Whatever one works best
I'll make a mess upon shooting flesh, 'bout 15 holes in his chest
Vandalism, taggin' all muthafuckas names on the wall
Scandalism, dyin' over all kinds of senseless shit that's small
Auto theft, stealin' cars for fun
Snatchin' purses 'cause I'm young and dumb
If you a tourist check yo' map, don't make the wrong turn
Might end up in the hood where you gon' be learnin'

I don't need a bitch, society done fucked up and cheated that bitch
Now she lookin' for a nigga like me to feed her and shit
Dumb bitch better quit, that muthafucka first degree keep a leash on his dick
Take notes, sit by the poor folks, I tell you 'bout my strokes
But I done been gave that up, ain't healthy no more
'cause a this yappin' and feelin', she strapped with the homies
And her weak mind got all of Sacramento in a bind
Lizzy ann must die, the situation just ain't right

Peniles at my door, three in the front, nigga, four through the back
Talkin' bout takin' me down to the sac town county jail,
Strapped up 'cause I did a jack
Armed and dangerous, waited 6 months to come and get me
Knowin' I'm into straps, 'cause every time I get caught one was sittin' with me
2 time before this, now add one more to the program quick
Shackled down, now I'm on a mission to a one man cell with the quickness
Think about the work that I did that night and what went wrong,
To get a rider caught
30g bail cost to get me off, fightin' on the street, fuckin' watched
Every 2 weeks another court date, thinkin' I can win, that's no lie
Kept on goin' on for some months, lookin' the judge right in the eyes
Feelin' his anger,
Watched fools before me do petty crimes and he's givin' 'em time
Bein' a bitch about muggin' on me, nigga talkin' shit to me, heated like
Pointing guns at individuals, huh, I despise muthafuckas like you
So it ain't no love for me judgin' you, watcha gon' do?
Take it to another court room?
And that's the first step for me, my lawyer knew the d.a.
You know, so he tried to hook a brother up, you see
If I did take a deal, it's only one year guaranteed
But I'm bout to give work for dough in a couple more weeks
Tryin' to give 10 years, if I go to trial and lose the muthafucka
Then I messed around and had to go back to the first judge,
Sayin' don't work for ya
I wasn't gettin' off that easy, my case had a little substance
And the odds are stacked against me, no frontin'
Choices need to be made on the 7th
A catch 22 in my midst, 'cause either way I'm fucked
Go to trial where I'll probably lose, or take my ass on the run
Or take a deal to a lesser charge, either one I'm gettin' struck
'cause doin' time is a mando thang and that got a muthafucka stuck

So page a nigga quick so I can serve you some of that shit
And have you murderin your biatch, violently
I've been keyed for 20 minutes and feel like killin
Loadin that milli-milli its that infant killa
Nigga Lynch, Mr. Doc, D-O double M and hella heat
Niggas unload, I need another dose of human meat
Outlive the creek, and black market death by the scene
As that nigga that nigga that nine millimeter punch you in yo spleen

You lay yo eyes up on my 4-4
And notice every curve in my strap
As them tears roll down
Flash yo life as ya fade to black
If that gat wasn't all up in yo face
Reminisce of yo folks, yo bitch, yo kids, yo fate
Replace, take it down to the South, get deep
Think of mobs at your funeral locc, and all ya family
Huh, its kind of crazy you could lose all of these things so quick
And what's worse, nigga shot you for the fuck of it, yeah
Never know I'd be the one to have your life in my hand
[Brotha Lynch: That Ruger 4-4 Mac]
That niggas life won't last
Keep listenin while I guide right down into your throat
Dig that barrel in your neck, watch your bitch-ass choke
No hope, no joke, I'm savin you the pain of old age
All I ask for is yo muthafuckin grip in exchange
One to the brain, in the throat out the skull
From the big chrome gat, peeled cap relation, so
Now ya niggas know, one mo dead muthafucka on the street

I stay solo like a black cat
Fuck a bad wrap

I'm like the Dirty Dozen
Wrapped up in buns
?He said he was buzzin?
But you know he wasn't
Cause if life was free I would say fuck money
You can douse me in monkey blood 
Fill my pockets wit drug money and duck from me
You was a fuck homie only wanted the plug nigga
Cut yo shit off like smud nigga
I gotta say fuck niggas and buck niggas
And wit a passion and keep smashin'
Get away before the task bend the corner
On a mission for rippin niggas up like toilet tissue
Wit the German issue
Now yo family gone have to miss you
I'm sicker than racism
It's everybody killa 
Hit you wit the fully issue 
Like PG&E lit you
See me in 3D git you
Hit em up git rid of 
Did em up like dirty draws
He was a jealous mothafucka
As the story was told 29 years old
350 Gs in the bank but nobody knows

You must be the type that like surprise 
I'll rise out the hood on chrome skates
Pull a top notch bitch and fuck her ass hard on the first day
Throwin it at me wit no debate (none)
But I ain't the one to be trustin em
Ain't finna get me for rape
Punk bitch tried to hand me a case
Until I dropped her on her face
Bitch!! Take that shit and skate

Cause when I tell yo ass one time it's all it takes
How many rhymes i'mma have tell a cat

I know, you remember Holiday Inn
Had to hit it from the back drinkin OE and gin
I used to eat pussy up, I can't lie, 
that's really real, really real, really real
See I met you through the homies
That homie was like 'cause, won't you jump up in the cutlass
Come and get you some butt
Came through swervin off OE like I always do
Same two straps in the trunk 'cause where you at ain't coo
I was like boo hold up its midnight and I got the eyes tight
Knew it was on just as long as I rub the thighs right
Next thing you know, we disrespecting the couch
Feel the pressure in my nutts
Its about to come out
You was like inside, whoride, I don't give a fuck
We can fuck until I throw up all the way to sunrise then cut

It was crackin like an omlet

But shiesty bitch you know what
You gon get back , you gon feel it nigga
I heard the FBI tried to shut you down said you done been the nigga
Said you (???) violent thoughts

Heard the pussy picked up a forth the Henessey bottle
Now everybody thinkin nigga fuck, leavin them whiteboys in Colorado
But fuck it, let a hoe be a hoe is my motto
can't let it rest
Gotta get it off my chest just to express my sorrow
I guess your pimp had you impressin ???? stories
Actin the sweet, said fuck ya man,

Gave you the fame without the fortune
Get you under the sheets
Bitch if you always on your back, then you can't get on your feet
I used to love this rap game!

(Shotgun)
I bet you didn't know that she used to be my main hoe
Back in the days
When I was runnin up in houses with socks on my hands tryin to get paid
It was like Courvoisier and Alize
Most couldn't fade, 'cause we buck till we both gain 5 6 times a day
How could I walk away from something that seems it's meant to be
You neva trip with me
When I took charge it was just the pimp in me
You was either quick to flex with it
When niggas and they bitches got fat
But look at us now, you ain't around huh
And never in my mind did I think you turned bitch on me
Skip one day and the next
Plottin licks on me
See yous a phony, I ain't fuckin wit you no more
Like Ice Cube said
You da ex-bitch, you gotz ta go
You know the motto, so fuck a hoe
And puttin the bitch before the hustle that's a no

Spendin my last dimes, wastin all my time in my life

Pack ya down in the earth, we put work in like Mad Dirt
Ordainers twistin' like the revolver or the earth
Fuck church, it's a must I burst and curse

Dime piece, gun in her purse, one in her skirt
Cross me, bet ya life that my bitch burst

I got a real crew of niggaz, ain't no punks in my squad 
Bitch, to get away, drive, but don't leave till the bank get robbed

Brotha Lynch Hung,"[Verse 1]
I'm hot enough to make your skin bubble
Packin a Smith & Wesson
Uh oh, trouble, don't say nothin
You can tell that I'm evil
By the arch in my eye bra
But I ain't got no pitchfork
I stick niggaz with this sawed-off
Clear your porch
Hit the floor, duck behind your couch
If I don't hear enough screamin 
I'm burning down your house
Apocolypse the barbarian
I kill humanitarians
Pillage your village
Slaughter your children
And rape your women

[Verse 2]
Bustin through that door like dun da dun da
Bitches hit the floor on the double
Bust off a couple
Rounds and let it bubble
In your belly
Bullets dipped in formaldehyde
So when they hit you
You embalmed and ready
To get carried
Buried up in your grave
Trust me, I'm that deadly
Just test me if you brave
Eklypse I stay sick
Eith Pit, Playboy, and Lynch
Kill a bitch nigga quick
And run a train on his bitch nigga

[Verse 3]
I wish these niggaz would try to rough me for the chips
I got metal muscle with silent tips
And pistol grips give violent trips
First I'm cool with you
Then I'm not
When you run up on me I pop pistols
Gun up on me it's all official
I'm chewin bone grissels
Your family gonna miss you
Do away done with you
You should of had a gun with you
I got pistols
You know cookin utensils
That shit that'll make your skin bubble
Fuckin with these plague niggaz
You gotsta know you in trouble

[Chorus]
Trouble (repeat 8 times)

[Verse 4]
I keeps it real that's the deal
Headbuttin motherfuckers like Evander Holyfield
I makes a full course dinner 
Out of roadkill
Pops some pills
Smoke some sherms
Drunk as fuck
Rollin up a blunt
When I get through smokin it
I'm comin to your house nigga
What's for breakfast
Kickin in your door 
At 3:47 in the morning
I got my ?? yawnin
Time to wake up, so I can do your bitch ass wrong
Hear comes trouble
Hell's angel, some niggaz call me spawn

[Verse 5]
Shit I'm off that ??? again
Ready to load the pump again
Soon as I put somethin in
See i'ma aim it at your chin
Blame it on your friend
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
I can make niggaz follow me like the pod piper can
Arachnophobia, I'm the sniper man
Doom to put 'em in the pan
Heat 'em and eat 'em as fast as I can
Stretch your neck like elastic like plastic
Man I'm first, you last to land
Tephlon bullets they crash and land
Nigga I'm double time
You in trouble time
I'm a bubble mine

[Verse 6]
I'm titani and scandalous
I do random hits
Load up all my extra clips
And lets go handle this shit
Trouble is what we lookin fo
Kick in that fuckin door
Put a gag up on that hoe
Slit that niggaz throat
Light up the door
Smoke until we choke
I wish you motherfuckers would try to locc 
And get his neck broke
Kick in the door
Shotgun up the asshole
Brains blown
Eyes closed
Nothin but trouble

Brotha Lynch Hung,"In a world of misery
Within this, three planets collide
Brotha Lynch, Dalima, Tech N9ne
Bring you along for the ride

Wait a minute, I’m from the West Coast Conference
Like Kobe or James Worthy
You could just call me the King of the Valley
All I need is a game jersey
Nigga nuts and guts get served up
When I get it, I’ll spit enough, aim sturdy
Cut it up, gut it up, with colds cuts
And in a oven I’ll heat it up, came dirty
I be off’a that Crip tonight
Turn ‘em into liquid ice, paint his jersey
Leave ‘em in the back of the alcove
Like Helter Skelt’, stick it to ‘em like velcro
Nigga, I’m a bitch killer
I’m a dig a ditch, quick to rip ya
Paint a murder picture wit'cha
I’m a jack knife, strip ya that night
Split your legs open and dick you
But them quick into rippin’ your guts
Deep heat, deplete you with the meat cleaver
That I didn’t see you either
Phone call or receiver, court order delete you
Tech ordered the meat, I’m bringin’ the seasonage
And a suicide note, do-or-die Loc
Keys in the backseat, cut necks
Some sexist ‘bout to kidnap Brotha Lynch
I’m neckless, expect this

[Chorus: x2]
(Welcome to my world)
Where hearts are broken, and bars
Are open, potions pullin’ me closer
(Welcome to my world)
Dark’s my ocean, my Ark is floatin’
But not livin’ like I’m supposed to

(Lyrical asylum)
‘Cause I be Dalima, motherfuckers hatin’ me for the longest
Could it be critical ‘cause I’m lyrically flawless?
And if I’m heated I cannot be mentally cautious?
(Diggin' the pain) I get deep peepin’ the flame
Only can I be held accountable for makin’ the change
To whatever regards are gonna be (Insane)
In the middle of a stage, I’m bustin’ like a 12-Gauge
You can never bring it to a nigga that’ll hang you up
Slip a couple millions up in your drink for you
Homicidal with the fully-loaded rifle
An undecided of whether or not I can peel brains or guts
(I get spaced out sometimes)
And it’s like I’m a heathen, whether or not you believe it
Everytime I rap a motherfucker stop breathin’
Have you ever been in a dilemma for a reason? (Nah)
Well, let me introduce you to the crucial upliftin’ future (Indeed)
Recruit you and seduce you to the mutual group of (My friends' souls)
Nigga you better get ready ‘cause
We done put together the fettiest chemical frame
Energetic when I let it, embed it in your brain
Tech N9ne, Dalima, Brotha Lynch like

(World)

Fight this phantom, your freakin’ family will fall flat
Bunk Bianca's beat ‘em black and blue with a baseball bat
I might be a small cat, but I won’t use discretion
Hit ‘em with a weapon, if he steppin’ with a mall rat
20 minus 11, I make ‘em all scat!
Not prosperous now, Tech’s not with his crowd
He’s lost in his clouds
Rather be off’ed than soft with his style
I got hopes that my life might get better
But I’ve been broke, so I might swipe your chedder
You better get ready to give me, I got a vendetta
Comin’ to get it, whether weed or money, whatever
Nobody said it was gonna be easy, people deceive me
Or leave me in the dark and buried off in Necropolis
One day you gon' see on me TV, you better believe me
Takin’ over this and never the opposite
Rewrite my life, gimme light, inner fight for what’s right
Allah Liberate, Cuidado
151 Rum is how we run from slim sums, then comes Diablo
I need a medic ‘cause I murder energetic
In the cerebellum never tell ‘em I got
One of the worst problems in the Medulla Oblongata
And you ought to go in one hell of a shot!
No more darkness, how did I start this?

And your about to get dropped, this box is worse than Pandora
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
They're all gonna laugh at you, cause I had to do what I had to do
When tappin' you like shaba do, beatin' 'em up and shootin' 'em up then stab a few
Sad ya knew that your hands are cool and they ass are through
I'm killin' and throwin' 'em back at you

Back up openin', Strange Music Box

See once they open my lid I'mma give it to 'em
Ever since I was a lil bitty kid I've been truly ruined
I reflected on what I did before I ran into 'em
I used to be a fat jerk now I flirt cause the scent of a woman
Now I don't act like, walk like, the nigga that you used to know
Now I sing and rap about the strange life, it's beautiful
Tell it to 'em like a Genu-is, spit it out like I thought you knew
Bubblin', hope you hear me Thizz, prayin' to God I make it through
Kali Baby, check my strange box of tricks
Kaliko alley cat, lyrical, watch his lips
He can go really fast, slow it down and stop that shit
Or make it (Dumb) to make sure you niggas got that shit
I'm just playin' with music, I'm the elite heat speech chief
Play me and watch they feet turn Beat Street
Cause I'm blowin' out they socks, The Freddie Foxxx of my block
Theres somethin' strange goin' on in that box, Kali Baby!

Off of this here we go I get it in
Spittin' that petro, let go, Tech know sets blow (Kaboom)
Come see about me nigga
Figure this I'mma get venomous takin' out ten of us
Niggas is sweet like cinnamon, wait, but then again
I'mma pick up the pen again, bit 'em in half, blood bath
Then I'mma laugh, then I'mma smash
Then I'mma ash, then I'mma blast first
Then I'mma send him his ending cut em up
Fuckin him up the rectum I dicsect the man
I'mma try to eat the neck and hand
Slice him up like a Mexican
Seconds then his body is fricassee shit is bleedin you should see him or you can be him
I got dead human being in the freezer, I'm a believer
I ain't no Wally Cleaver but I carry a meat cleaver
I speek geek to people, I'm lethal, a little strange
I eat it with cream of wheat and some butter thats mixed with brains
I'm the Coathanga Strangla
Hangin' him up, he's fried rice, he tried twice
He's dry ice, tell 'em Tech N9ne

Brotha Lynch Hung,"I told you, hated the way you always used to leave me
I saw you at the club with that motherfucker Ci-Ci
I pulled up, you was in the front of the club
I saw another nigga huggin you you know I was trippin
I had to dip in, order me a dirty martini and best believe me
I really didn't want a bitch to see me
So I put on the spydie's took out my I.D. and
I have to keep the knife right behind me till ya by me
I was in the bathroom shakin the dick off when he came in
I wanted to pull out the N9ne milli and bash his brains in
Grr, you know how Brotha Lynch will do it
Walk up on a nigga with 2 blades and give a nigga 2 slits
Na, my main goal was the same ho
She used to let me put the Ruger up in the anal
I taught her all that shit now the next nigga benefactin
Irv take me to the hook I need an intermission

I swear I love her, I never let her out of my sights

You are my heart, I give you my all

I go to sleep with her then I wake up in the morn
Then she right by me side then we hope in the ride

Theres somethin bout Susan keep haters just lookin
When the sun goes down, we dress up in all black
Matchin outfits, she been down since way back
Back when I used to cook crack at the house
And even though she set ya boy in a cell a couple times thats my spouse
And I love her but I hate her, when she spit at other niggas
Put me in situations where she get at other niggas
Now she got the police askin questions lookin for her

Im bout drill this chick(?) and so much water like a more(?)
This my love train all aboard, till death do us

3 in the morning I can't sleep I'm having bad dreams
I keep seeing bad shit, this was a bad week
I had bad month, shit... I had a bad year
I had a bad life even before she came here
I used to tell them I was married to the music
And I never should've changed that
I Gotta get my strange back!
I used to write every morning and smoke hella weed
I used to be on the road, used to make hella cheese
And now I'm struggling broke
And you could tell I'm heated
Bringing bullshit in my life
And I don't really need it
I think I'm smoking too much
It's like suicide
I won't eat, won't shower
Between you and I
My trust is all fucked up
I'm ready to give the fuck up!
I'm ready to murder everything!
My life is all sucked up!

Yelling ""someone"", and when it's done
I'ma treat it like my daughters and son, we having fun
'till intruders came knocking to come kill everyone

Four in the morning yelling my name so they know it's me
Scramble and try to find my nigga's gun, I'm supposed to be
Prepared for the crazy, my lady screaming don't go to see
Fuck it, I'm going down to the kitchen to get the knife
Invite 'em all in my crib and then take everybody's life

Leave a deep gash, bring the heat fast
Hit 'em with the venom, when I get 'em I'ma keep 'em
Giving them an enema, even if it's ten of 'em
Then I'ma, eat 'em like dinner in the cinema
Then I'ma, shit 'em out, get 'em out
In about twenty-four seconds I'ma fuck 'em in the ass
Tuck 'em in the grass, cut 'em up fast

I can still remember, it was January twenty-third, 1994
And a group of us was chilling at the table
We was drinking with our fingers on the ouija board
Tryna summon spirits asking ""ouija, can you hear us?""
Never thinking what was in store
Then the dogs started barking, in the darkness
All of a sudden it was knocking at the front door
Then we started approaching, cautious as hell as we pulled the door open
Nervous adrenaline, seeming slow motion
No one was there, we went back to the board hoping
That we finally made contact, with the deity
Apparition on the other side
Then it started moving out and soon it was
Spelling out the warning in the morning one of us would die
We decided to stop it, said our goodbyes, and left the apartment
On the way home sarah hit a patch of ice
Lost control of her car, hit the ditch and lost her life

Were they ever really there?

Hit a 50-50 grind and was even more exciting because I did it while riding on a flashlight
Better act right or get your shit sprayed
Don't be no wack rappin' over this way

Brother,"""A tune for a real old friend."" 

Sheridan Square, high as a kite
Beer in a bag, toasting the night
And we dreamed as the Manhattan moon, sunk like a stone
Oh but sooner or later
You're gonna have to stand, and walk back home
Your gonna have to stand, and walk back home

You were good with your hands, good with your heart
Good to your friends, that's a good place to start
You say a man's not a man, if he don't do it alone
Oh but sooner or later
You're gonna have to stand, and walk back home
You're gonna have to stand, and walk back home

Now your fading away, like a freeway mirage
Are you out in the valley, or in your garage?
I know it's hard, every dog loves his bone
Oh but sooner or later
You're gonna have to stand, and walk back home
You're gonna have to stand, and walk back home",Sooner or Later,1999
Brother Ali,"[Verse 1]
I try to always buy final call from the F.O.I
Even though that's not what Islam always signify
y'all gotta love the struggle in 'em
They would get on their knees and shine shoes
'fore they ever let the drugs afflict 'em
Makin taco's and fuckin with McDonald's
Nickel and dime broke, but dignified with high hopes
Some people shoulder the weight of the median, make it look easy
Even though they walkin the tight roads
Immigrants, twelve deep in one bedroom
I'm too cool, I look at 'em like fools
Those fools combine forces and put the resources
And guess who the new owner of the corner store is
Shit, what's stoppin me from doin that?
I probably could with drug smugglers approve of that
Because if one dime sack in the time can climax
Into a billion dollar industry, then look at my abilities
But I'm a dreamer in alotta ways
I feel if you believe in God that you believe in brighter days
Keep my son's heartbeat in my sleep
I'ma walk the Planet Earth with his name carved deep in my feet like

[Chorus x2]
Children growin, women producin
Men go workin, but what's the use
When the real strive hard and stress about the rent
And can still die poor and in debt without a cent

[Verse 2]
Born again christian creatures from the suburbs
Tryin to save souls on Broadway, they got some nerve
Comin here unaware that the one's with no material gifts
Sometimes most spirits leave rifts
Lazyness got me spare the stand back and what was that
That can't hold me back, my man Vast told me that
""Harlem got all that on a bigger scale""
When there's bullets in the sandboxes every bid is real
I see children growin up within a wicked system
Smilin I want to kiss 'em, I see prophet Muhammad in 'em
Poverty's trickin people from my generation
And hands down to world's most creative
I've seen both sides of the fence
Picket a chain link and we ain't all thinkin the same thing but
They teens got so impressed by me
They try to walk, talk, interact and dress like me
We captivated the world's imagination
I used to idolize athletes and entertainers
Cause they never let the situation capture 'em
System gave 'em lemons, made lemonade and sold it back to 'em

Children growin, women producin
Men go workin, but what's the use

Marvin Gaye said it best ""This ain't livin""
No matter your religion the earth keep spinnin
And the sun keep shinin, babies keep cryin
Old folks dyin in beats within you put ya chiming
And here I am, still lower class America
Same room, same view, different cast of characters
Regina got arrested as a late prowler
Couldn't trick, got evicted, lost her section aid voucher
Onward goes my neighbourhood's revolving door
A gang of rental properties nobody owns at all
I guess that's why we call it a hood
Nobody stays as long as it takes to become neighbour

Get yourself together now because it's hit time
Your known as the hit makers
Breaker breakers, party makers
They'll make your back crack, your liver quiver
For all you cats, who never put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut, more glide in your stride
If you don't dig that you gotta hold your soul
If you don't dig this mess, you came to the wrong address
Because singing might be loud and clear

[Brother Ali]
Ayo, the music made ‘em jump back
Fuck that, how y'all gonna come tracks, some fat, without lettin Ali touch that?
Gun whack, read his lips
You're not serious, I got few equals and no superiors (so here he is)
A seasoned veteran, an ego reckon
I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin
Y'all ain't fuckin with the ox so put your feeble session
Double teamin for the evening, so you heed the lessons
So no

[Slug]
Here we go
Lookin at me like they know me
Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me
Do it, somebody's bound to catch it, no breakage
Never that, we keep it basic like breakfast
So taste it, the vitamins are subtle
So tighten up to Sluggo, even try to decipher the puzzle
But shut up though
(Fuck that, sucka jump back)
I hold the game like Notre Dame, I know your dame
(We call her hunch back), Ali run that

[Brother Ali]
From cats lips to gods ears
We mind yall punk bastards and cross hairs
Applying our thug tactics till y'all scared
Don't stop till your drunk ass hits the back stairs (ohh yeah)

[Slug]
Fuck that, jump back, yo, what's that
Drippin off her nuts, wait, why she got a nut sack?
You fuckin rappers are she-males
From the retail to the e-mail, the feel felt cause you need help

[Chorus] x 2
Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y'all it's still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah

[Brother Ali] (Slug)
(Rappers steppin to)
ah yeah they get their shits burned
I throw a roll of quarters and cyphers and then I get learned

We'll take her out for breakfast if you want to let your lips run

[Slug]
Listen, I know your mission, some type of magician that likes to go fishin
On the mic with air tight precision, the leaders in keeping tradition
when you ain't even keeping the rhythm that the DJ is spinnin
Calm down little camper, I've got the answers
You should fuck exotic dancers
You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers
It doesn't matter, turn it up, what the fuck you think that amp's for?

[Brother Ali]
I write poems, write rhymes, write my name in the snow
And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your ho
And I should but instead I'll just pay the waiter and go
But if I didn't have a wife, yo, your kids'd be albinos
Your respect is like a stick in the grass
Mean mugs and tree hugs, I'll go on about it
I wear my toilet paper so that y'all can kiss my ass
with your tongue out and write a love song about it

[Slug]
Write that shit inside of your book full of funny little scribbles
The love comes in vomit, the money comes in dribbles
The Minnesota missiles, self taught
communication, mutilation, holding pictures of your sister naked

[Brother Ali]
Ha ha, You to drunk to walk down the stairs
And now you're standing here choking on my pubic hairs
Telling me your name is if you think the brother cares

If you keep bumping your gums we can fucking take it there

[Slug] (Brother Ali)
Yo Make a room full of bump rocks stop and do the walk
(Rest those shots from a cop, and ask him who's your pops)
Who's you daddy, Fuck that, Jump back and act happy

I like that
One more time, give it to me
This real shit right here
I'm beautiful

Ayo, dependin' on the day, and dependin' on what I ate
I'm anywhere from twenty to thirty-five pounds overweight
I got red eyes and one of them's lazy
And they both squint when the sun shines so I look crazy
I'm albino, man, I know I'm pink and pale
And I'm hairy as hell, everywhere but fingernails
I shave a cranium that ain't quite shaped right
Face type, shiny, I stay up and write late nights
My wardrobe is jeans and faded shirts
A mixture of what I like and what I wear to work
I'm not mean and got a neck full of razor bumps
I'm not the classic profile of what the ladies want
You might think I'm depressed as can be
But when I look in the mirror I see sexy-ass me
And if that's somethin that you can't respect then that's peace
My life's better without you, actually
To everyone out there, who's a little different
I say damn a magazine, these is God's fingerprints
You can call me ugly but can't take nothing from me
I am what I am, doctor, you ain't gotta love me

If you would please turn in your Bible
To beauty tips according to Forest Whitaker
In the third chapter of the third line
Brother Ali, would you please read to the choir for me, son

I'ma be all right
You ain't gotta be my friend tonight (you ain't gotta love me)
And I'ma be okay
You would probably bore me anyway (you ain't gotta love me)

You ain't gotta be my friend tonight (you ain't gotta love me)
And I'ma be okay
You would probably bore me anyway (you ain't gotta love me)

You just don't know what you do to me
If you would just give me a chance then I'm sure you'll see, baby
You just don't know what you do to me
Only God knows what can happen when you fool with me, lady

[ VERSE 1: Brother Ali ]
Excuse me, I mean pardon me
I mean you got me so shook I can hardly see
And I ain't tryin to be foul or disrespectful or nothin
But I feel like the universe should tell you somethin
You somethin, and I don't say that to be sayin it
Many came and went, but baby, you the main event
That's why I stopped ya, it's not just the body parts
That made me watch ya, mama, you got the posture
And demeanor of the Queen of Sheeba
And I'm Prince Charming, girl, pleased to meet ya
I could be your student, you could be my teacher
And I'm majorin your idiosyncrasies
And I please trouble you to use a word with 'w'
The way your lips movin got me pluggin too
You a great ten frame draped in heaven-made skin
And a faint grin, can a church say amen?
But why you catchin the bus?
With your backpockets lookin like they're ready to bust
Got a you and a me, now let's make it a us
Long story short, let me get a phone number, somethin, girl

Third date, can't stop fate
I know you can relate cause I can see it in your face
It's time to take this thing we got to the next level
You know, I mean spend all our waking hours together
Surprise, showed up at your job again
And I took the time to interview all of your friends
I don't think they good enough for a queen like you
In fact, cuttin them bitches off the first thing you need to do
I was thinkin, I want to be everything to you
I'm the only friend you'll ever need, man, that's true
Besides, I bought you a beeper, so I can reach ya
Anytime I need ya, you in the streets just
Cluckin and cluckin, and cluckin and cluckin
Girl, we could be at home gettin into somethin
So don't look at me foul and don't talk to me funny
Won't you come on through, give daddy some of that honey, girl

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Brother Ali ]
Did you have to go and tell the law you scared of me?
They came to mama's house and embarrassed me
Can't no piece of paper keep me away from you
You just don't understand how much I love you
I tried to tell you that I was sorry with a card
But I found it in the garbage in your backyard
Everytime I get involved it's some shit that happen
Girl, you start out nice, then forget your manners
Let me tell you that's what's wrong with these women today
How you gon' have a good man feelin this way?
It's a 30 second message that I left you today
And I know you're home cause your curtains have opened
Quit playin these child-ass games, girl
I mean I got a tatoo with your name, girl
You gon' mess around and get somebody killed
Cause if I can't have ya nobody will

Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free

[Verse 1:]
I don't like my life I gut it, rebuild it, fuck it
Keep nothing but God and my children
I kill the devil wherever he resides
Even if he hotter than me he got to die
I killed little Jason he was only fifteen
Sewd his good traits together, made Ali
Feeled his lungs with the Koran until he breathe
Let him walk but kept him on a short leash
Here he stand now seventeen year old man child
Ain't ask nobody for a mother fucking hand out
He trying to carry heaven on his back
Jumped the broom with a stranger, he ain't never look back
What he know about how the world spin?
Bless his heart he a virgin never even had a girlfriend
Want to be a man so bad that he can taste it
His family fell apart and he's tryin' to replace it
You'll find in him a heart that is second to none
But I know old soul that his lessons ain't done so
I stand willing to kill him again
If to grow he got to shed his skin then let it be done

[Chorus]
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
He'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free

[Verse 2:]
One half of all the two leggeds on the scene are too timid to dream
Cause failure is far too depressing it would seem
So they take what's given
That's your decison, I just don't consider that living
Shit if I'ma die whether or not I try
I might as well let the dice fly
I'm hot knifed through butter in the night sky
It shouldn't take a genius to see there's hunger in my eye
So I use blood and sweat to butter my bread
Cause this cold world couldn't give a fuck if I'm fed
I ain't curled up in my bed
If I don't set the world ablaze trust it ain't because of nothing I did
Listen I don't think God's obligated to touch you
If your ass would rather live in shit than work a shovel
I refuse to let the sun set on me again
Til' the end I'm a one man army, friend

[Chorus x2]
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
See what I see and know that freedom ain't free lord
Ain't no where to run
There ain't nothing here for free
You'll see what I see and know that freedom ain't free

Brother Ali,"""Are you here to confuse me?"" 

Woman I'll give you the grand tour 
There's no reason for you to look closer but you do so I show you 
It ain't pretty here now but it will be 
One day I promise when the sun rays are honest 
I chip away at the tint on the windows 
Stain on the glass it's a pain in the ass 
I scrape and I scratch 'til my arms grow weary 
Meanwhile I warn you not to stand near me 
I think I built the fence a little late 
The deamons were already in now they can't escape 
I been toe to toe with most of em' though 
As a whole they must parish in order for me to grow 
Huddled in the gloomy little cracks that they inhabit 
They pass away the day I deactivate my habits 
Each one gets buried in the back yard 
In tiny little graves marked only by a black scar 
Kindly watch your step 
The silence isn't finished being awkward yet 
Trophies lay in the basement to stay safe 
Today's mistakes are in a lighted trophy case though 


And I want you to know 
I only invited you 'cause I ain't thought you would show 
But I'll be damned if you ain't grab my hand 
And presented yourself on the threshold of the Heartland 


You'll notice antique swordes adorn the walls 
They're really not there for decoration at all 
I saved them shits from old relationships 
And I swing'em at you later if you stay in the mix 
Don't you realise nobody's really been inside here 
Since it was last drenched in dried tears 
Decorating was a senseless idea 'cause only the blind lonely prince resides 
Here 
We dine here on a balanced diet 
Ego when it's loud self hatred when it's quiet 
Inside the castle this is what the life is 
Sign here after you read the fine print 
It's not much but all of it's yours 
Take great caution if you wanna explore 
Watch your head when you opening the doors 
And always remember that the choice was yours

Now take that same party around the globe
And my stories connected with a lot of folks
I hope so cause that's the only thing I know
I know it so well I tell it with my eyes closed
And I go with the feeling from the start
Blind in the eye so I see you with my heart
And to me all ya'll look exactly the same fear faith compassion and pain
And try as we may to mask it remains
Such as your religion or your past and your race
The same color blood just pass through our veins
And tears taste the same when they splash on your face
The worlds getting too small to stand in one place
Its like we're roommates just sharing a space
Can't separate and still carry the weight
Gotta heal get away from the fear and the hate
Gotta shake free from the chains
You see what remains
Just a human being end of the day
Don't matter to me what name you gave your spiritual plane
Close your eyes and you'll see what I'm saying

'Bout the deeply depressing mess we're in
It's home so we better make the best of it
I wanna make this country what it says it is
Still dream in the vividest living colour
No matter how many times my love been smothered
Who's ever above us won't just let us suffer
All of this struggling got to amount to something
This is a letter to my countrymen
Especially those my age and younger than
We're up against an ugly trend
Everybody's hustling don't nobody touch their friends
No group singing and dancing
No anthem nobody holds hands, and
Instead they give a hand held
And make you shoulder life's burden by your damn self

The situation of oppressed people
Shows what we feel it means to be a human being
What does it mean to be American?
I think the struggle to free is our inheritance
And if we say it how it really is
We know our lily skin still give us privilege
Advantages given to the few
That are built into the roots of our biggest institutions
That's the truth in life we got to choose
Do I fight in the movement or think I'm entitled to it
This is not a practice life
This is the big game we got to attack it right
Each one of us is headed for the grave
This old crooked world won't be saved by the passive type

But one among you that's why you call me brother
Ain't scared to tell you we're in trouble 'cause I love you

They tell me I'm a dreamer, they ridicule
They feel defeated, old, bitter, and cynical
Excuse me but I see it from a different view
I still believe in what a driven few could really do
I know that the masses want to sleep
And they would just rather hear me rapping to the beat
But I want to pass this planet to my son
A little better than it was when they handed it to me
So I wrote a letter to my countrymen
I'll be happy if it only reaches one of them
Reporting live A-L-I, your brother
Mourning in America, dreaming in colour

My dear Brother Ali,
I think you know deep down in your soul that
Something, something just ain't right.
You don't want to be just well adjusted to injustice
And well adapted to indifference. You want to be

People can say when you go that you left the world
Just a little better than you found it. I understand. I want
To be like that too.",Letter to My Countrymen,2012

Young girls swinging their hair with every step
Looking for affection, settling for sex

First one is follow the rules and stay in school
Be the square dude, that society approves
Get a little job or a shitty appartment
Sub-prime mortgage in a failing house market
The after your life dedication and hardship
You died just as poor as you was when you started
Fuck that, what's up with the second option?
You could always hit the corner and try to get it popping
Get fast guap when you're out dropping and clocking
But, chances are that you'll probably die violent
The best hope that you got is getting knocked
And end up with a job in a prison metal shop
They ain't paying nothing but three hots and a cotch
Don't you know that's the biggest hustle they got?
Or door three you can get on that welfare
But they ain't trying to help, they'll put you in hell there
Give you just enough so you're not gonna starve
And constantly harass you while you're looking for a job
Do lock up and someone that got you to punch a clock
And they found about it and your check is getting dot
Can't win for losing, dehumanizing

Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see right

God willing I can love 'til there's nothing but you
Disappear inside you every time I clutch you
Tears shed in your presence render walls humble
That separate me from you until I become you
Let 'em fall to rubble, let the darkness crumble
Let your light penetrate me 'til my heart is trustful
I'm afflicted with my chest constricted
And your description is the best prescription
Crack the stone in my chest and let it beat again
'Til every artery become a pharmacy
Let it deliver your love to every part of me
Until the splendor of your presence is all I see
My death wish is to decorate my every inch
With remembrance of your preciousness
Until there's no longer evidence I ever existed
Because until I knew your love, I never did

Is reflecting your light
Cool tears obscure my sight
It's the only way I see right

These two eyes inside of my head have never seen clearly
A whole team of geniuses couldn't seem to cure me
A lot of the time I just resign and just close them completely
And rely on what's inside me to guide me sincerely
Let my heart navigate and pray that the path is straight
Lead me directly to your threshold standing at the gate
I breathed in the sweet breath that you had let go
And somewhere in the distance heard your echo
My soul began to tremble
You resemble every mercy I've ever known
Overwhelmed me so that I began to let it flow
My lenses started welcoming the guests of tears
And suddenly the world revealed itself crystal clear
Colors grew vibrant and the decoration vivid
In that very instant I knew every thing was living
Then they released and made their way down my cheek
And here I am at the beginning, starting to seek

Brother Ali,"At what point did poor European people that used to rebel
Against the ones that forced them to work land 
They didn't own and die with nothing of their own
What was it that turned their hearts so that they start 
To identify with power even though they're powerless
Identify with wealth even though they're broke?
It's the invention of whiteness

They call you white by white standards
Damn what they're talking 'bout human first
Stand and curse the dirty hand that first crafted the plan
Spread it through the land and shattered the damn earth
This is sickest system that ever existed
Since this earth beginning commenced to twisting
How you convince men with red blood to bleed?
Completely devalue what a human being means
Nobody called themselves white several centuries ago
They were living off the land with the trees
They were Dutch, they were Irish, they were German
They were Greek with culture, families, tradition and beliefs
Rich bloodsuckers saw new soil to seize
And they ain't 'bout to get their hands dirty, cracker please
Swindled you to trade in your identity
Showed you pie in the sky and promised you a piece
With symbolic image in the scripture that you're reading
White holy angels and black evil demons
You were so starving that you started to believe it
Now you'll die colonizing for somebody else's greed
Don't you see the overseers are still in the field?
Every breath a warden breathe he still in the jail
You will never own that farm or the prison for real
Terrified of the time when your victims rebel
Listen, you don't fear them, you fear the blood on your hands
All the ugly you done to that man
That woman, that child, that land
That sea, that sky, that they'd look you in the eye
And demand that you tell them why
All them years whipping and lying and killing
Generations of poison and bombing and drilling
All designed to turn the hearts of your children to stone
Got post traumatic slave master syndrome
How the hell are y'all going to heal, be made whole?
You identifying with the people in control
You can't throw a human in the bottom of a boat
Unless somebody got a damn chain around your soul
In that middle passage asking who got stole?
A hot auction block where your blood ran cold
Every day a cop let them shots explode
You're gon' have to find a way to regain your soul

I said the eye can't see itself
It can't sit back, critique itself, and peep itself
It needs help
Take the sword for example
No matter how hard, it can't carve its own handle

The inner city of our cities is like another country, the rules are different
It's almost like you need a passport there, the police treat people differently
When I lived out in the suburbs, if my car broke down on the highway
And a state trooper pulled up behind me, I wouldn't have been scared
I'd have been glad, but young man after young man after young man 
Had been beaten by the police and the only way you know
You've got to be with the people and we live separated
We go in air-conditioned cars and we stick on your interstates 
And hang out with people just like us, well, by God's grace
I was brought into this, and seeing how race plays a part and how poverty plays a part
And my job is to go out to the American people",Before They Called You White,2017
Brother Ali,"Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying, no not dying

There's no suicide like the lie that you tell yourself and believe it
Mask look decent, face is weeping underneath it
Self-hate feasting on our deepest darkest secrets
Warning signs that read help needed, too ashamed to seek it
Seems so easily deleted when you're browsing
But can't erase the history of what your eyes allowed in
The intimately profound ecstasy that gives life's
Stripped of all its meaning 'til it eats you from the inside
The big lie, you just do this to get you through the slim times
One click at a time 'til you prefer counterfeit kind
Seen so many scenes that it would seem you're desensitized
Just to get your fix begin dipping into the sick side
Seeking to feed a demon that you no longer recognize
If you swear it off, you'll never find a place you can hide
Inside your pocket lies a portal to your inner battle
Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple

Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying, no not dying

Don't get it twisted
There's no innocence existing in its biggest business
You create specific demand whenever you click it
Whatever it is you're into someone's got to fill it
Have their lowest moments frozen to be shown infinite
You watch the porn get savager
Box office movies nastier, the TV get trashier
Schoolgirls are flashing the camera
Profile pic look just like the next amateur
Babies get exposed no one controlling how it damage them
You find yourself detaching, retreating, reacting
Deep anger, decreased passion and you keep lashing out
Your sweet family just reminds you of your weak habits
You have no mercy for yourself and so you're relapsing
Your sweet attraction used to drive you to that deep connection
You're feeling so cold and lonely when you least expect it
Atop your desk sits a portal to your inner battle
Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple

Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying, no not dying

Now that I have died I have to taste for life
Or the affairs of the living
Only for love and the affair of the lovers
The affairs of the living are many and assorted
The affair of the lovers is singular and complete
Do not mourn this walking carcass
Some are dead because they are without life
Others are dead because they are beyond life
Yet others have forgotten the affair of life and death altogether",The Bitten Apple,2017

It really isn't anybody's business
Not asking for permission or a witness
It honestly doesn't make any difference
Living in this insane mess
There's only one person that can make me make sense
I've got troubles and my own fears
But as long as you're alive, I'm not alone here
My mirror, when I'm right near you
Your guiding light shines to see my life clearer
You're so woven inside my spirit
Even when you're not around I feel you
Lord knows they don't come no realer

The only reason I believe in me
I'm trying to be what you seem to me

I'll be close forever and a day

Where you're safe I never would betray

And what you made mine is true
Lifetime full of treasures, I'll never repay
They can't take that away

I love you and there's nothing you can do about it
I love you right through all your human problems
I might've got excited at you and shouted
But you never let me down when it truly counted
Nothing could ever break the bond
Whatever page you're on
Celebrate or mourn, babies born or parents gone
No matter how crazy the storm, you won't face it alone
The best part of me is drawn to you
Me and anything I own belong to you
I treasure everything important to you
Any secret I ever had I show them to you
I owe you nothing but the whole truth

Brother Ali,"Dear black son, there's people you've never met
Who fear and hate you for something you never did
And these people are so self-convinced
Sometimes they pull the trigger, call that self-defense
And in that sad insanity
Their fear is realer to them than your humanity
But that's their problem, it's not yours
Listen to your pop for a second
These are the confessions of a father broken-hearted
Who don't know how to pull his only son out of a target
They lied when they said it was the bottom where you started
You were a king long before them ships departed
You are not defined by anybody else's crimes
You don't need to answer for what happens in their minds
You are not confined by their imaginary lines
You don't need permission to exist with the divine
In fact, you don't need permission from no one including me
You need not do anything but be, just breathe
Whatever you dream let it mean you're free
Tears on a cheek never made nobody weak
Sometimes we got to grieve, let it burn, let it bleed
Then let yourself heal, I pray to God it will
You've got a spirit that a bullet can't kill
That doesn't make it any less real

They say it takes a man to raise a man
You're slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man, who's slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last

Dear black son, I can't protect you like I want to
I never judge you, all I can do is love you
And that's all anyone can ever do is love you
All I can do is wonder how can anyone not love you?
They recognize divine you
So they try to find themselves by defining you
They're living in a myth that they don't want to loose
And now they're too terrified to face your kind of truth
But every time you shine, it's proof that they might've threw
A chain around your body, never conquered you
They don't always honor you but they love your culture
Let me show you how to move when the laws approach you
It's best to keep your hands where they can see them
And try to understand that you're not even what they're peeping
They don't see a sweet kid that loves his little sister
Their mind is seeing five hundred years of pictures
In fact, they don't visualize a kid
They see grown man imagery, mythic masculinity
But you are not their fetishes or fears
Nor my ambition and tears, nothing can interfere
We've got to trust our seeds once we sow them
We hold them when they're growing
But we never really own them
We love up on them, play with 'em, pray for them
And cling very closely to those moments

They say it takes a man to raise a man
You're slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And here I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last
Raising a man, who's slipping through my hands like grains of sand
And her I stand, tryna wrestle with the hourglass
Maybe see how long I can make an hour last

Yeah, I know
I'm writing you a song though
It goes something like this

You say one love, you can't unlove
I don't know what it is you're trying to run from
Like you just, you're trying to unfriend me in real life
I want it all real, nothing fake please
I don't want to wonder what your handshake means
I don't need to say everything I think I must
My ego's trying to ruin everything I touch
What I mean though or what my point is
That you're much more important than my point is
If I win an argument and loose your heart Lord
I hit the bullseye on the wrong dart board
I want to thank everyone for being patient with me
It's a journey that I'm on, I pray you take it with me
And to quote myself that's what this is about
""We live learn and figure it out""
Oh my God now

It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it

I want the real love, not the false kind
Not the one that need perfectness at all times
When it seems most difficult to keep me close
Is probably the time that I need you most
I let you down though, I didn't mean to
Even the people who try, we get weak too
And when you said we were family, I believed you
Because I needed so bad for it to be true
Now is my heart that way, would I try to betray?
Is there any such thing as an honest mistake?
If what you need and what I have don't match
That's when we need the love thing to fill those gaps up

It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel

I'm a hot mess and if I'm honest
It's not just one event but a process
If I'm tryna get out here and protest
Let me first save the world from my foolishness
Let me guard my heart from its harshness
Try to rid my truth of its falseness
If your beauty is closer than an arms length
You'd be hard pressed to tell me that its far fetched
I know I hurt you though, you took it personal
But what's love if the essence isn't merciful?
And I see no need for us to live with regrets
I'd rather just forgive and forget
Oh my God now

It ain't easy when it's real
Just don't leave because I still need your patience
And hear me when I say this
It ain't easy when it's real
In my heart you know I feel
All your greatness and baby we can make it

Not to make it about me, but how could you check out
Before you really allow me a chance to sit down and hear?
I think I would've listened
Or were you saying it all along and I just missed it?
You sang your swan song, we all dismissed it

In-between the trigger and the blast
In-between you let go of the wheel and you crash
In-between the moment you swallow the last pill in the bottle
Turn out the lights, roll the dice on tomorrow
Is there a moment to reflect, can there be regret?
Is there a wait not yet, let me reset?
Or is it just too painful to accept?

This that international gang-banging
And my homeland hit Iran with the sanctions
And my credit cards and telephone ain't happening
But I can't imagine a better land to be stranded in
Almost everyone that sees me coming
Want to take me home and they trying to feed me something
But I took the only forty dollars that I had
And headed to the airport in a cab and there I sat
Starving cause there's only one flight a day
I can't even buy a ticket tryna find a way
Somebody seen me on TV and recognized my face
And let me write an email to my wife in the states
I'm in the airport for three days, wondering if I'm even safe
Finally got a seat on the plane
Now imagine my exhausted embarrassment
Get back to America, they interrogate me like a terrorist
Really?

Brother Ali,"Here were are together
Watching the world come down around us
I know my baby girl, she counting on us
If she ask 'bout it I got be honest
Either they forgot about us or they got a target on us
And my nieces shooting amateur porno
Police shoot my nephews in the street like it's normal
They've been doing that a century or like four though
It's horrible, still pains me to my core though
I know that when the dust settles and the smoke clears
And the wretched of the earth living with no fears
All we need is someone here who can remind us how great it was
Before these people had their way with us
I know when I was on the street and struggling
You know you took me in to feed my hunger pain
And now you put me on my feet, look what I became
Even when we disagree that love remains
Listen these people they ain't trying to save your soul
So why we bickering about which way to go?
You know the words are incidental
The hearts are instrumental
As long as we're connected we can make it though
We got

Love
Should I ever call your name
I know that you can feel my pain
You'll be on your way to see me through
We got this
Love
Should you ever call my name
I know that I feel the same
I'll be on my way to see you through
We got this

I'm not grinning 'cause I'm at a loss for opposition
Lot of them don't want me want me livin'
Thank God it's not their decision
I don't hate, not for a minute
A drop in the infinite
Even hate got a small percentage of envy in it
And my enemies are not my teachers
I'm not seeking to adopt ya'll features
I don't want nor need you
My heart has been broken into, but I'm not broken in two
Don't need you to acknowledge the piece of me that lives in you
The truth was never yours to give us, it's always in us
You cut your roots off you're finished
The heart's missing and you're looking at the raw authentic
Ya'll been listening, but ya'll don't get it, you just mimic
I'm grinning cause I hear my echo in it
When you whisper to your infant
I'm glad I could be of some benefit
God bless, but the voice ain't the sound coming out of the hole
That's from deep down inside of your soul
Something ya'll need to know

Late at night I find it harder to rest easy bruh
It's like this heartache has no intention of easin' up
'Cause every twenty four hours is another homicide
And they keep telling me that being emotional is unreasonable
Now I'm just trying to find a way that I can maintain
So I turned this love affair with words into my main thing
Putting all the hope I got left in the vocal expression
And maybe the message will make the world amazing
And finally my daddy can understand me a little better
See why I gave up my B.A. for another set of letters
'Cause if he knew to what degree I sacrifice for the road
He might be prouder of the life I chose to go get us
But time's too precious to be wasted on the grudge between us
Ain't no bond greater than the share of flesh and blood between us
And we can make it through the toughest times together
If we let our guards down and just allow our love to lead us right",We Got This,2017
Brother Ali,"I am not beautiful, I am an elegant beast
A well-mannered monster, a charming barbarian
I will pillage your heart with language so lavishly violent
You will curse me for coming and curse me for going
Your crying and your moaning will share the same sound

Put pen to paper the first time when I was barely eight or
Maybe nine, that was the late eighties, Reagan time
Put in the freshest tape, rewind, wait, let me take my time
The entire landscape of that blank page was mine
Created space to climb inside, escape the crazy times
Reshape the climate, break it down, that was my frame of mind
Thank the divine great designing this as my sacred shrine
I made myself a place to shine, wait, let me spray this rhyme
When I was thirteen I met KRS, he put me on the stage
Suggested I read up on Malcolm X, y'all know the rest
So much pushing down on my chest
Both my folks got laid to rest
Loved ones wishing me all the best
I'm a ball of stress, yet I digress
I've spent my every hopeless dream and my unspoken secret
You hear it floating through your speakers in my old releases
My fanbase began to grow beneath and crowd around me
I never tiptoed 'round here shy, I spit it loud and proudly
The U.S. government profiled me and the sponsors dropped me
Some of my listeners felt away so they no longer got me
I knew that telling that truth is costly, no one alive can stop me
I rolled that flag out on the ground and prostrated my body
This is more than music to me, this is ancestors
Speaking through me at the tomb of Rumi
My mic’s a rifle, I’m honor-bound to fire my weapon truly
Whether they jeer me, cheer me, boo, salute me or just shoot me
Let it be known, my whole life I break that cycle set it in stone
I'd still rather be known as a man that stand on my own
Rather than beg at a throne cold
You know I still honor my own code that go down to the bone
We just want to get it on shooting at the devil
With a megaphone till we dead and gone

But there's nothing I can say to change the things I've done
Of all the things I hid from you, I cannot hide the shame
And I pray someone, something will come to take away the pain

There's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can't be free and I can't see another way
I can't face another day

Tell me where, did I go wrong
Everyone I loved, they're all gone
I'd do everything so differently but I can't turn back the time
There's no shelter from the storm inside of me

There's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can't be free and I can't see another way
I can't face another day

I can't believe the words I hear
It's like an answer to a prayer
When I look around I see
This place, this time, this friend of mine

I know it's hard but you found somehow
To look into your heart and to forgive me now
You've given me the strength to see just where my journey ends
You've given me the strength to carry on

I see the path from this dark place, I see my future
Your forgiveness has set me free
Oh and I can see another way
I can face another day!

Brother Cane,"Sail me down, gently
Out where the street begins
Let me drown, easy
Water wash away my sins
It feels like mercy, and it feeds like fame
I'm losin' my way
If I wasn't too lost would you toss me away
Without a care or word to say
Two tongues get in the way

Bring me round, quickly
Before the big one gets away
Lost and found, maybe
But the searchin' never ends
Stand tall like a mountain
Keep your feet on the ground
Stay true to the dream
A blind man says that faith will make it alright
If it's just the same I'll keep my sight

If I wasn't so lost would you leave me on my own
If it's just the same, I'll keep my soul

And crowned your woman slut of the universe 

Pimping, leaning, fiending, scheming 

Trying to be the cooleest nigga for some frozen other reason 

That spit, it ain't slick on any known planet 

Except for Pluto I believe 

Three billion six hundred and eighty million miles away from something 

That's why you ain't saying nothing 

Heads is fronting, forty ounce and Phillies blunting 

Destructing before your sleepy eyes (ooh-yay) 

Teacher Wise will have you all recognize 

In minutes less than five niggas ain't 'bout this 

It seems as if hip hop's become a species in danger 

Since rappers turned gangsta

Now Vibal Magus in the house I've come to address the drama 

And season up and serve couch potato Godfathers 

Overdose on movies, come up living like a script 

Form an overnight mob getting paid to talk shit 

Niggas please, my nickname is Mr. Freeze 

I ice steel at lockdown and bring master keys 

I'm chain ganging these crews, long lines of emcees 

Come off the final plank, slave ships of wannabes 

I journey to your roots as I burn them Zoot Suits 

Revive the nigga genes revoked while playing cute 

I execute studio gangsters up on the scene 

Strong tug to mic cord, submits my guillotine 

To eat 'em up and split 'em, 'nuff heads is rolling down 

Degrading gangsta lean, black hole is going down 

You're mudbone, and I stand with ranges shown 

Thought you'd build a house, soon find you're home alone 

With full black intangibility 

Translating my heat to unreachable degrees 

Of super burn as my crew holds you in turn 

Lyric armageddon, when will you bunglers learn 

That superfly groupies, braid heads and dreads too 

Watch too much too gallant try to run it like the screw 

Create a revolution says the realm is upon you 

The righteous be the gods and the chosen be the few 

It's like that uh 



[Sluggy Ranks] 



You can't blow breath in the end 

So why you want to take someone's life 

It's not right, no it isn't wise, ooh yay ooh yay 

Gotta move the right way 

Don't let the devil lead you astray 

That is right, whoa that is right, ooh yay ooh yay 

Father send us some blessings 

To wash away our sins 

Stand up for the positive 

Ay, and I'll deal with negative 

Iy, we're killing them with conscious vibes 

Killing them with positive vibes 

It's nothing but conscious style ooh yay ooh yay

Brother J,"[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
And I was told in school I was a fool and money, I'd never gain none
But I used my flow as a tool, they was cruel
Said I'd be no rapper, but I did work and became one
Now it's a cryin' shame, I'm buyin' things and they got debts they got to pay back
I think I know why my teachers would look in my eye and say that
And whys that?

[Chorus: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Cause I'm a Blackboy
Came from nothing, don't mean my life means nothin'
Made it out the game through the pain and sufferin'
Yall don't think I see them purses yall clutchin? (I do)
See I'm a Blackboy
Scared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie
Little white-boys want to be me
But you don't want to go through What I go through
True definition of a Blackboy

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
It must be the way that my pants sag
Or the sparklin' diamonds on the watch my left hand has
I know my appearance is looking like I am bad
In your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag
Made it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you
Even foreigners shop and got big gratitude
I make more than you, but you got the attitude
Like I can't be shoppin' at Saks Fifth Avenue
I'm just tryin' to buy my baby some creed spring flower
But they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power
So they look at me like none of my breed brings valor
Thats why when you see us in passing we seem sour
Last time I checked, my power shockeras
I was on top of the indy charts and not a slotera
But I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera
So why when I'm at Macbeth they wont treat me more propera?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Brother J]
Frontline, shoot, soldiers represent that
Frontline, shoot, Grand Verb, it's the snatch back
Head wrapped in the desert, boombox on the camel back
Escape from the clone lab, fugitives spook black
With finesse in you, its the knowledge from way back
The prophet of the page don't eat right till it all cracks
Blackboy rappin' from the pages torn
Street scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Cracked Corn
A spawn of the movement, keep the music movement
So my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin'
I do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six
For me to know America is still on that bullshit
So people think that black are just ball players and singers
That massa complex is what fuels the street bangers
And street soldiers to stand up
No choice to get it right, so these Blackboys can finally get they man up

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
I'm a Blackboy and always gettin' underestimated
But when I move next door, I know you hate it
You had my whole family investigated
And when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it
Uh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated
Over ghetto life that was designated
You see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it
I don't want to go if I got to integrate it
You know pellot boy, be happy you made it
Just take what you got, and stop complainin'
OK, weather man will stop the rainin'
On my people head, and start explainin'
What your people said, believe in the bible
But you still act barbaric and psycho
My name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael
I'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you

From [the] California to the [Staten] New York Island,

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
And saw above me that endless skyway,
And saw below me the golden valley, I said:

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me , a voice was sounding:
[God blessed America for me.]

Was a high wall there that tried to stop me
A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:

By the Relief Office I saw my people
As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if

Brother Marquis,"Yeah, last year a lot of motherfuckers asked me
Why I didn't do no old sex nasty shit
But this year I went down to Miami and got my nigga from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherfuckin nigga)
Yeah, we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these niggas is havin girl problem, Marq
(Huh, tell them man, tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it

I got a ho from the East, got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North, a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a bitch with hair, a bitch with none
A bitch with a knife, a bitch with a gun
A bitch with a ass big as a TV set
And there's a bitch over there; hey, the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not, she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam her sister, though
Ice in the whole damn herd
I fuck 'em all and leave 'em on the curve
I got a bitch with a mink, who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to fuck me with her ass up on the kitchen sink
Got a bitch with tits, a bitch with ass
A bitch with none, but hey I give her a pass
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit it..
Nah a bitch ain't one

I got a bitch that's old, a bitch that's new
A bitch who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a bitch who's fat, a bitch who's built
A bitch who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a bitch who's funny, a bitch who ain't
A bitch who can sing, a bitch who cain't
A bitch who loves fuckin on a airplane..
I even got a bitch off Soul Train
I got a bitch who rolls a rag-top Benz
Long ends
I got a bitch who's broke as a bum
But she's the most fun
I got a bitch who play piano, a bitch who don't
A bitch who dances naked, a bitch who won't
A bitch who's short, a bitch who's tall
A bitch who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I feel bad for you son
Got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show
These motherfuckers all the over the world; the 2 Live style
Of how the bitches treat a motherfuckin fly nigga like you

I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one of them
I don't trip on hoes, cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hoes suck cock nigga how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick dick in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The nigga the one-nighter, the bitch exciter
I only love my hoes when I'm goin up inside her
Problem number one is gettin money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nuttin cause I ain't offerin
I go hard on my bitches, cause I'm never never softenin
Puttin the demand on 'em, fuck 'em and scram on 'em
The ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" game is ran on 'em
So fuck how you feel, you fuckin cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Gettin pussy's just another expense
If pussy pays the bills then dick pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to cum
I've got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one!

Ha! Yo Marquis my motherfucker you got problems man?
(A bitch ain't one) Aww shit!
Now let me tell you how to do this shit

I got a bitch that loves to G
She'll fuck you right after she fucks me
I got a bitch who loves both
I got a bitch who loves handcuffs and ropes
I got a bitch that's fast, a bitch that's slow
A bitch that's a virgin and a bitch that's a ho
A bitch that lies
A bitch that's true
A bitch who's a man BECAUSE THEY'RE ""Bitches 2""
I got a bitch that's cool
A bitch that's hot
A bitch who loves rap, a bitch who loves rock
A bitch who's lost and one who knows where it's at
She gets up under me and purrs like a cat
I got a bitch that runs, I got a bitch that walks
I got a bitch that yells, I got a bitch who talks
I got a bitch that's dirty, got a bitch that's neat
I got a super fine bitch that I knocked in the swap meet

And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me

I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one - hit me

Aeem to get you down

Has got a hold on me
To guide my destiny

Brotherhood of Man,"I hold your hand and
Gently touch your hair
Then we'll walk
Together hand in hand

The way you smile
And kiss me tenderly
Tears begin to fill my misty eyes
Now you're gone from me

Where are you going to, my love
Will you come back
When the sun shines
Anytime you want to
Come home, it`s all right
Where are you going to, my love
Will our love return tomorrow
Anytime you want to call me

Brotherhood of Man,"You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world
The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should never be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

That believe in unity

Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

Brothers Keepers,"Jetzt ist die Zeit, hier ist der Ort 
(yeah) Heute ist die Nacht, Torchmann hat das Wort 
Denk' ich an Deutschland in der Nacht bin ich um meinen Schlaf gebracht

mein Bruder Adriano wurde umgebracht 
Hautfarbe schwarz. Blutrot. Schweigen ist Gold 
Gedanken sind tiefblau. Ein Bürger hat Angst vor seinem Volk 
Ein Wintermärchen aus Deutschland. Blauer Samt 
Als Kind schon erkannt: hier bin ich fremd im eigenen Land 
Operation Artikel 3 da habt ihr gelacht 
Jungs, das ist mein Leben das ha'm wir uns nicht ausgedacht 
In all den Jahren in denen wir Airplay verschwendet haben 
Man könnte denken, wir Rapper hätten nichts zu sagen 
Doch es rächt sich, ihr werdet sehen, es holt uns ein 
Einigkeit macht stark, Adriano starb allein

Hängt dein Leben auf einmal am seidenen Faden 
Dann blitzen die Warnsignale über die bebenden Leiterbahnen 
Die Zeit ist reif, wenn Köpfe keine Preise mehr haben 
Wir müssen aufhören zu labern 
Und auf jeden Fall strategisch verfahren

Den Feind beobachten und dann ganz langsam enttarnen 
Wörter sind wie der Wind und laut sprechen die Taten 
Wir werden nicht warten, graben Löcher mit Spaten 
Seid euch im klaren: das Karma, das wird euch beraten

Dies ist so was wie eine letzte Warnung 
Denn unser Rückschlag ist längst in Planung 
Wir fall'n dort ein, wo ihr auffallt 
Gebieten eurer braunen Scheiße endlich aufhalt 
Denn was ihr sucht ist das Ende 
Und was wir reichen sind geballte Fäuste und keine Hände 
Euer Niedergang für immer 
Und was wir hören werden ist euer Weinen und euer Gewimmer

Denk' ich an Früher war der Widerstand noch eher müde 
Heut gibt's genügend Brüder mit der rechten Attitude 
Geben sich Mühe um den Sprung zur Macht zu schaffen

indem sie VWL, BWL, Jura zur Berufung machen 
In allen Sprachen, den erleuchteten gefriert das Lachen 
Ist das Erwachen die Veränderung im Jahr des Drachen 
60 Millionen Sklaven von denen es 8 Millionen schafften 
Die besten sind jetzt unter euch; ich hoffe für euch zu verkraften

How many more men must die pass by the public eye 
On both sides of the Atlantic watch the panic multiply 
Walk on by we divided supposed to coincide 
Side line observers disturbers trying to stay alive 
I realised at a young age lifes design maze like 
But its amazing the way hate spreads when its been raised right 
Without day light the truths often hard to swallow 
Why we sending out our love to Amadou and Adriano

Ich rapp' für meinen Bruder, denn ich könnte auch das Opfer sein 
Falscher Ort, falsche Zeit – da hilft dir auch nicht tapfer sein 
Wie viel Blut muss fließen in innerdeutschen Krisen 
Alter, schau die letzten Jahre haben das mir zu oft bewiesen 
Dass die Menschen sich erheben, wenn die Leute nicht mehr leben 
Doch dann ist es zu spät, ihr solltet öfters drüber reden 
Also sag wie ist das möglich? Mal ist es doch tödlich 
Gerechtigkeit 
Denn nicht nur Adriano hat es nötig

Seventh Sunday after Easter a fellow brother's executed in his prime 
Adriano's crime: wrong place, wrong time 
I can still hear the voice of anguish fading through the night 
It was an unfair fight 
Three versus one, god they caught him by surprise 
Xenophobia's on the rise, victims get dehumanised 
Procedures standardised as the land germanised 
Names become numbers whilst death is trivialised

Why oh why, why oh why 
I can feel the mob crawling 
I can hear the horns calling 
You've taken the of an innocent man 
Another blood stain on this barren land

Ich hoff der Track hier ist´n Dildo der die Zone fickt 
Ich will nichts mehr erzählen zum national Befreien 
Ich sage K, sage Z, sage Nazis rein 
Ich will nicht labern, denn ich kenn' mein Vaterland 
Macht es mich krank wie Masern, dann verspüre ich Tatendrang 
Ich fühl mich eingeengt und will statt Prominenz 
Und statt großer Fans, Nazis die wie Poster hängen

Ich hörte schon im Kindergarten Weiße zu mir Nigger sagen 
Die Klischees nicht hinterfragen, jetzt Brüder niederschlagen 
Wir fordern mehr als gleiche Rechte, wir wollen endlich Frieden haben 
Neue Ziele haben und nicht das Image von Dealern haben 
Im Landtag diskutiert man über einen Antrag 
Und währenddessen plant der nächste Nazi seinen Anschlag 
Die Schandtat wird bedauert, doch was ich mich frag
""Warum steht schon wieder 'ne schwarze Familie am Grab?"" 
Das ist der Alltag, die Justiz verdammt hart 
Jungs in Abschiebehaft sind am Schwitzen wie im Dampfbad 
Man merkt die Führung hat Macken. Nach all den rüden Attacken 
Müssen wir Brüder bestatten, da einige lieber hassen 
Die ganzen miesen Drecksratten können ihre Lügen wegpacken. 
Da sie genügend beschatten können die die Typen verknacken 
Zeit sich zu wehren, statt's zu ignorieren 
Das war's von Flame und mir: Free Mumia!

Silly frictions exaggerated hard rocks manipulated 
We pick it up and do it up, know your future like it's on your rear view 
Nothing really matters now because we consume unseen like bobby digital

Und wir Zwo wissen, dass dir das klar ist

Und du in den Spiegel starrst, der dein Elend zeigt 
Hier, deine Seele muss am Arsch sein

Doch find keine Ruh' vor denen die behaupten

Show me how the sun shines

And smile down deep inside
Or could you just kill me?

My angels, my devils, my thorn in my pride.
Are you wanting inspiration
You spill your secrets on me
Then you tell me with a whisper
Of things that will never be.
Do you hear me breathing?
Does it make you want to scream?
Did you ever like a bad dream?
Sometimes life is obscene.

I swore her off, but I'll be damned

We're only in the 7th grade, we only think 'bout getting' laid
Split a six pack between the three of us
Get tore back and ride the mini-bus
Hawkin' loogies at sucker crews
Way back then we knew we'd never lose

Wipe the sleep out my eyes, around eleven brush the Ivory
See Selassie an' everything is peace what
I'm all about space cakes and great legs
In French braids smokin' brown dank in eighth grade
It ain't no ting to cut biology as long as we gaffle the role sheet

So now we're making the drop off
We got dinero and props embarcadero's like a hot spot
Yo, remember that yab that act senseless
There she is round and chunky at the town and country benches
Pretentious princess of sheet less mattresses
With Sealy Posturpedic embedded in they asses

I never toyed pumpin' lyrical steroid
'Cause I protest with paragraphs perverted
Tipper gets offended no matter how I word it

It ain't no thing to walk on water, baby
Long as you know where the rocks is
Pathetic and pitiful, I break fool and vanish
Panic if you want to, I stumble to my hammock

Panic if you want to, give your crew a call

Like pimp casserole so uh, pay me ho

I duck out, scorin' my goods outside Antonio's nut house
Stashed it up real well in the Oldsmobile wheel well
Dropped decoys downtown all the boys found was sea shells
With a note claimin' I collected these trinkets at the beach
With ya daughters now here's my final offer

Nada pig zilch zero
I'd rather go blind drinkin' prune, so salud to you puto
Who holds the upper hand now and whose hands are tied
I'm hittin' all my partners up with the liquifry
Moral to the parable what I need to care for
If assholes could fly this place would be an airport

I used to sell cracks from the front streets to back 
Then I got locked up wicked Jake popped up 
And the Jake he seen my style before 

But I'm stayin lyrical behind my door 
I'm in the yard God where niggas try to test me hard 
But my vocal's too powerful law, it's too potent

we keep it thugged out, catch us at, every show 
Let's get the jump off jumped off, here's the bang out 
Yo at every fuckin club, yo we got octane out

Extra acres, Caribbean seeds with no crabs 
Fuck hunger, I'm gettin no younger, cop this half

Stick you in public and hide the thrills in baby carriages

If you notice, the vultures I bring they sting so swift 
Your quotes is from Maze, my bang'll tip with any rapper 
these days, spittin venom when my wordplay sprays 

and claimin half this cash regardless, dome my target 
from the heart spittin my flow while slow niggas process

Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yea

You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way

Ya, what's going on
Ah, what's going on

In the mean time
Right on, baby
Right on

Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way

I only ride for those that'll ride for me 
I only shoot for those that'll shoot for me 
I used to be in D.C. with my poetry 

Niggers said I'm on some other shit crazily 
I used to sell cracks from the front streets to back 
Then I got locked up wicked Jake popped up 
And the Jake he seen my style before 

But I'm stayin lyrical behind my door 
I'm in the yard God where niggas try to test me hard 
But my vocal's too powerful law, it's too potent 
I kick one verse, the whole cypher stood frozen 

Now them niggas want to parlay with me, general 
I'm smooth like them niggas that, don't blow trial 
I come on home to a new leaf, no beef 
Jose Luis yo I'm ill like an Indian chief 

And my dress code, ill like, indiglo 

[Chorus: x2]
Aiyyo we thugged out what, and we let y'all know 
we keep it thugged out, catch us at, every show 
Let's get the jump off jumped off, here's the bang out 
Yo at every fuckin club, yo we got octane out 

I need, nuttin but cash, I'm out in the stash 
Extra acres, Caribbean seeds with no crabs 
Fuck hunger, I'm gettin no younger, cop this half 
brick til my pocket just thick, sit back and laugh 

with the out of towners, keepin money around us 
Four pounders, flippin wiggies, to the sirens around us 
Cars and jewels, inside moves, three day cruise 
Booted from Beijing, ?brought? our ventures to ?use? 

The entrepreneur, droppin cock in your whore 
Keep pussy open like a nigga sniffin coke in the hall 
I do it all for y'all, basketball, or rims 
Fiberglass that hold guns when I play old friends 

Learn how to act around a playa who spike tracks 
Doublin the pressure if your Empire Strikes Back 
We savages.. break you up like marriages 
Stick you in public and hide the thrills in baby carriages 

[Chorus] 
 
The way I grace shit so swift, play it tenacious 
but smooth like a fugitive who move with a facelift 
I stay lit, passin Branson, finesse no less 
Reppin at random, forever at my best when I'm trancin 

niggas make me want to focus with emotion 
If you notice, the vultures I bring they sting so swift 
Your quotes is from Maze, my bang'll tip with any rapper 
these days, spittin venom when my wordplay sprays 

and claimin half this cash regardless, dome my target 
from the heart spittin my flow while slow niggas process 
Blow the spot rock aggressive, mac eleven shots in

Lovely one, so radio, let's do it
Can you feel it? I know you feel it
I know you feel of that

Let me talk to you, baby, I'm digging your style
The way you lick your lips is like hmm, oww
You driving me wild with your sexy self
Your pretty little face got me hypnotized

All I wanna know, is you down to ride
I can open up the door and you could come inside
I could show you what life could be
I could show you it's just you and me

We can go to the mall, you can have it all
I can tell you're impress by the way I ball
One shot with you and I will trade it all
The girls in the shows, I talk about everything

Your touch is a beautiful thing
We can shine together like a diamond ring
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life and make my dreams come true

All I ever wanted was a girl like you
Someone I can give my heart to
All I ever needed was someone like you
Someone I can give my heart to

[Incomprehensible] papi, if I put you to the test
Would you differ from the rest
Or you wanna be my homey that owns me
And holds owns me only when you lonely, lonely ?

I'll inform you when I'm looking for a friend
Until then, I need a man to take a stand
Hold my hand, I'm just scared of situation, temptations
No hesitation when it comes to us

I got it with single touch
Doesn't take much, so baby, just hush
Trust, everything's gonna be okay
If you do it my way, my way

Hey, you wanna be with me
I'll fulfill all your fantasies, be the girl of your dreams
Holding you tight all through the night
You'll even love when we fight

All I ever wanted was a girl like you
Someone I can give my heart to
All I ever needed was someone like you
Someone I can give my heart to

We can do them things that lovers do
Or we can be friends and keep it cool

Go ahead, baby with yo' bad self
Looking all fine, lollipop in your mouth
Standing on the curve with yo' bad ass curve
One look, whoa and I had to observe

I let my eyes finesse you, my mind caress you
Booty like a tenderoni
If I could make you mine, you'll be my one and only
You make me say oh like Mister Capone

Just one look is all it took
Got me lost in your eyes
And you mesmerized by my lips
Hips and thighs, oh my, oh my

I'm riding by your side, high
Taking my time when I'm working that body
So [Incomprehensible] got you talking naughty
Oh yeah, can you feel it? Oh yeah

All I ever wanted was a girl like you

All I ever needed was someone like you

Brown Boy,"[Brown Boy:]
Girl, Right now I just feel like is not working out
So I think the best thing for me to do is to let you go

[Girl:]
If you love me you got to let me know (you gotta let me know)
And if you don't you better tell me so (You better tell me so)
Cause I could let you go 
Let you be free (I could let you go)
And if it's meant to be you'll come back to me
(If it's really meant to be)

[verse 1]
Let me tell you how I feel this ain't a love song I'm just trying to keep it real
You use to be my lover you use to be my friend I always use to tell you I'm gonna
Love you til the end 
So now in some way some things went wrong we started to fight, and we couldn't
Get along
I tried to make it good but it seemed so bad I tried to make you happy but you seemed
So sad
Not only your man but your baby's dad if you don't love me no more then let me 
Know cause I'm hurting inside but I won't let it show if my heart had eyes it 
Would probably cry from all the pain inside.

[Girl:]
If you love me you got to let me know (you gotta let me know)
And if you don't you better tell me so ( you better tell me so)
Cause I could let you go 
Let you be free (I could let you go)
And if it's meant to be you'll come back to me
(If it's really meant to be)

[verse 2]
Come here pretty mami whipe those tears from your eyes you don't gotta ask why 
Let's just kiss and say good-bye
I don't wanna let you go but it seems so right Like the right thing to do
I know I'm the one to blame for all the shh... I put you through I was acting like
A child running wild I never took the time just to make you smile you gave me your heart
Ans I just crushed it girl you gave me your world and I and I just hurt you girl
And I'm sorry for that if you leave me now would you want me back
Or once your gone then your gone I guess you move on
But I'll leave you in my heart cause it's where it belongs

[Girl:]
Before I go to sleep 
I'll say a prayer for you
Hoping that one day you'll have a love that's true

[Brown boy] 
Baby I know I love you 
But right now I feel like let's just go our own separate ways
And if it's meant to be 
I'll come back to you

[Girl:]
If you love me you got to let me know (you gotta let me know)
And if you don't you better tell me so (you better tell me so)
Cause I could let you go 
Let you be free (I could let you go)
And if it's meant to be you'll come back to me

And promise you girl that I'll never make you sad
Hold you in my arms when things go wrong
Be your back bone when you need to stay strong 
Dance wit you baby to your favorite love song
See imma ride for you if it came down to it girl I would die for you.

You the only one that I kiss and hug

Brown Dust,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

And it would be nice and brown

And I got a big blue Buick Sedan
All that I need
Is just a handy man""

That I could have my way
And do anything I wanted to

But I got fooled, sonny

But I went on and cleaned her house
From the front to the back
Cleaned out every corner
I didn't even miss a crack, uh huh

She promised me a kiss
And a great big hug
Sweep down my stairs now
And beat my bedroom rug

I said, ""House lady, I'm through
Come on and tell me now exactly

About old lost John
Lost John was a boy that got loose
From a chain gang down in Louisiana

About sixteen bloodhound, took in after him
Sheriffs, deputies
And everybody else in the county
Chasin' him all across the swamp

Lost John outrun the bloodhounds there
All night long, it was long towards mornin'
He looked up to the tree there
And seen the lights from a house

He didn't know whether the people inside
Was friends or were enemies
So he wanted to go up to the house
So, and asked if he could stay there
To get away from the bloodhounds

He was afraid if he did go up there
That the people might set their dogs
Barking at him or shoot him down
With a Winchester riffle

This is the story about lost John

Old lost John ain't lost no more",Lost John,1996

So round, so firm, so fully packed, she's for me
She's just like a money bag guarantee
Like a barfly goes for drink, like a bobysocks go for Frank
And just like Jesse James, he goes for money in the bank.

From head to foot she's a perfect size, she's a wist
But she wears a forty-five gun that is
She's got a look that's so impressin'
She's got furs that's sorta fashion
So round, so firm, so fully packed, that's my gal...","So Round, So Firm, So Fully Packed",2008

Gangster life in the city
You know it's hard to stay alive
Because we gotta do or die, ooooh
Gangster life in the city
You know it's hard to stay alive
Because we gotta do or die, do or die, do or die

I roll around with big straps, I like to bust caps
Make money, hit the pussy, and bomb ass raps
I be in San Bernardino like a motherfuckin nut
All these fools want to kill me, and bitches want to fuck
Damn, but I ain't trippin and shit
I got a fuckin calico with a hundred round clip
And at my pad, I got this fine ass bitch
Long hair, big booty, with some big ol tits
I don't be fuckin around because I ain't no joke
A crazy motherfucker blowin indo smoke
'cause it's me, Danger, I'm chillin like a vilain
Smokin chronic, fuckin bitches, and I'd like to do a killin
In my crazy ass hood it's an everyday thang
Eastside Trece is my motherfucking gang
Hang, gettin paid, fucking all these hoes
Letting everyone know that we some fuckin criminals

[Chorus]

I remember growing up in my crazy ass hood
Now it's time to put it down to make this shit understood
Simon loco, I think it's time to roll
I got my homies down with it, and the rest in control
13 ST, IUC, from the 213 all the way to SB
It's a do or die in the streets where I'm from
Eastside South Central's where the petho pason
24 non-stop, you gotta carry your gun
Black and white, hitting corners but to me that's all fun
Rollin in the truck, got the glock sellin rocks
On the block, and I'm not givin a fuck
Gotta make that green anyway you can
And I'm that Brown motherfucker with the master plan
So you better not slip, 'cause I'm lookin for a jack
So if you putos see me coming, loco go for your gat

[Chorus]

1-3, here comes even more
My motherfuckin homies breakin down he door
Talkin bout, who we gonna kill, and grab your gun
We gonna kill some fuckin mejos just to have some fun
My homies catch you from the front, I creep and crawl from the back
Punk you for your sack, and peel your fucking cap back
Insane in my brain, 'cause I'm straight do or die
Dope money, fucking bitches, and I keep on getting high

Straight gangster flow, now you know, here I go
Creepin, hittin switches, bumpin, riding low
Danger sittin shotgun, Crook's rollin up one
Got the rag-top down in this hot ass sun
Rollin, by the park we go
Hittin corners through the hood puffin on some indo
It's an everyday thing in the city where I'm from
Tryin to do right, but always end up doing wrong

Brownside,"An eye for an eye's how the fuck we feel
When they get one of us then we're out to kill
I don't care about shit when it goes down like that
The only thing on my mind is the big payback
They get one of us, we get three or four
If that ain't satisfaction then we're out to get more
Fuck a drive-by, puto we'll walk to your door
Kill you motherfuckers and we'll even the score
We wait for you putos to forget and slip
Then we'll catch you in the streets and unload the fucking clip
Another puto dead from the other side
Now we wait for the funeral and watch your parents cry
Feeling no remorse for the shit we do
Those putos did it to us, so why not do it to them fools
The killing doesn't stop, it goes on and on
Ese smoking motherfuckers till these putos are gone
An eye for an eye's what this shit's all about
Rolling up on these levas taking these pendejos out
Doing it for the homies who ain't here today
Because as long as I live, in my heart they're gonna stay
All I do now is think about them in my head
And it's a fucked up feeling now knowing that they're dead
It's payback time and it's a do or die
I'm doing it for my homies, Rest In Peace above the sky

At the hood with the homies, getting loaded kicking back
Thinking about the motherfucking crazy payback
It's time to get these motherfuckers for the shit they shouldn't have done
Another homicide, another puto gone
Kill or be killed is the name of this game
Doing it for the hood, the homies, and the gang fame
This shit won't stop so fuck keeping the peace
From a loco motherfucker gang-banging from the East (Eastside)
Rolling down the calle and I just smoked a dip
With a quette in my hand so now I'm ready to trip
Thinking about my homies who ain't here today
And I'm gonna get these putos 'cause for this they gotta pay

Creeping late at night through their neighborhood
Rolling with the lights off to catch a puto doing good
Not giving a fuck about the time it carries
Just flashes of my homies and when they got buried
With a knot in my throat and a tear in my eye
We come across this puto who's time it is to die
He's strolling down the street and doesn't even realize
We got a bullet for his ass to go right between his eyes
Got out the car 'cause I knew I caught him slipping
He looked and tried to run when he seen my ass creeping
Jumped at the puto, hit him up ""Where you from?""
He said the wrong shit so he took one to the dome
Down the puto fell, I guess I'll meet the punk in Hell
Simon, he seen my face but a dead puto can't tell
Jumped in the ride, headed back to the Eastside
Kicked it with the homies then we all got high
Smoked a few wet ones and went home and hit the sack
Fell asleep thinking about the fucking payback",Payback,1996
Brownside,"Got the fuck up to another crazy day
Got my travos, hit em up and I was on my way
Three Flowers in my hair, creased up and my gat
A half-way joint in my ear and a twenty dollar sack
Jumped on my cycla and I rolled to the hood
Smoking a toke, getting high feeling good
Rolling South Central through the crazy Eastside
Made a stop and got the homey and we went for a ride
With some black spray paint we went strinking up
Crossing motherfuckers out and leaving up our block
Shaded in and all that with all the homies names
Eastside South Central's where the fuck we claim
Rolling on the cruiser got the homey on the bars
Watching out, keeping trucha for the black and white cars
Another crazy day rolling through the evil side
Throwing up the hood to every fool that drives by

That's right ese
Kicking up nada but reality
So if you putos don't know
You better recognize

Gang-banging like a motherfucker, down for my shit
And giving up a chance for any fools to trip
Blue-ragging to the heart to represent where I'm from
I'm a soldier from the South and I'm known to hold my own
Down with the homies, always rolling deep
Late at night, keep trucha 'cause we're out on a creep
Leaving bodies behind, putos coming up dead
One to the chest and three to fucking the head
And roll back to the hood and not give a fuck
Smoke a cool to the brain till we can't fucking walk
Simon that's how it is in the crazy ass hood
Rolling deep, gang-banging always up to no good
Hanging out on the corner, creased gangster'd out
Motherfuckers know what's up 'cause they don't even come around
We got the hood blocked up, the Eastside everywhere
South Central got these motherfuckers running scared

The gangs of LA, they'll never die
They'll just multiply
All you putos who ain't real
Ese keep trucha for my steel

Another crazy day, another crazy trip
The homies don't give a fuck 'cause they're down for their shit
Los Nightowls, Tiny Locos, Crooks, and the Tiny Dukes
The traviesos and the locos always smoking that juice
Crazy motherfuckers we don't give a fuck
Another crazy day just hanging out on the block
Always watching our backs, keeping trucha, looking out
That's just how it goes in the crazy ass South
Los Angeles, Califas crazy 213
Always running from the motherfucking LAPD
Simon living life, hanging from a string
But I don't give a fuck because it's all the same thing
Creases in my travos, white Nike shoes
Wearing locs, blue rags, and giving putos the blues
Another crazy day, another day gone by
Hanging out in the hood of the crazy Eastside

Thinking bout them putos that tried to do the drive-by
Creeping in the alley, ese this ain't the valley
Cholos are deep in a fucking brown Caddie
Drop to the floor, a fucking four door
(There's some putos we jump)
Ese they're coming for more petho
Watch real close as I level
His head to the seat, my quette he hands me
Six feet deep is where this culo stays
Although in a coma for a couple of days, anyways
That's what I see on 21 Street, where we meet in the big SC

All gotta pay dues, think it's time to take a cruise
Bensando in my hand, fuck them fools
They throw a rat on the fucking murder rap
Now it's time for us to go on back
Simon, we're the ones you putos can not stand
I'm coming to get you with a quette in my hand
Damn there he goes, stop, I go, I caught his ass quick
Nada me duro puro, blu blu to his stomach I stuck
Two balas at first then one on top for luck

I guess they seen us coming with our guns ready to spray
You look like a bitch when you run from us
I know you know we got guns that bust
Plus you know I'll peel your fucking cap
Didn't catch you yesterday but I'ma get you off the map
So strap, 'cause they only way you're lasting if you're fucking blasting
Never recognize me 'cause I'm always masking on a mission
All the santos missing, then they shoot this fool and then start dissing
Display my motherfucking gangster's way
Spit on his ass, tu pinche madre
Just like that, making putos disappear
why que, at least I'm still here
No fear, those majotes and my Mexican Pride

Times ain't good, but they won't hold me down
I'm out to get mine and won't get left back
I can't get me a job, but I can get a dope sack
In my hood everyday, gettin off my slangs
I'm not really trippin off money, 'cause I'd rather gang bang
And kick back with my homeboys who are down for me
From the evil side representing one-three
And the ways in my neighborhood ain't nothin nice
You gotta be down or else your payin the price
'cause for me to do good others must do bad
What makes me happy might make you sad
I need to straight come up so I can earn my way out
Broke motherfuckers don't carry no clout
The hood that I'm from is where I proved my name
And the streets where I live is where I got my fame

Don't push me 'cause I'm losing my head
The way I live I might end up dead

I can't ever forget the crazy things that I've done
A young gang-banger livin life by a gun
Doin down ass things to make you learn quick
The kind of crazy things that make people sick
Some might not agree, but I have to survive
And by me doing wrong is gonna keep me alive
So I try everyday to learn the tricks of the trade
Savin up my money 'cause I don't get paid
I know I do bad but I do it real good
'cause that's the way I learned in my crazy ass hood
Growin up in the streets of SB and LA
Where a youngster couldn't even hang around and play
Drive bys, drug deals, bases everywhere
Crack babies being born and their moms don't even care
Don't think for a minute that this shit ain't real
'cause life on the streets might get you killed

Times are bad and everything is hard
Got no money, don't own no car
With some old ass clothes, no food to eat
And some burnt out Nikes coverin up my feet
You get your first impression by the way I look
He's a gangster, a killer, and a no good crook
Just 'cause I'm broke don't mean I'm a punk
Lemme explain myself in five minutes of funk
Everything I've done that has been wrong
I just kick back and write it here in my song
'cause life on the streets is rough as fuck
Vatos tryin to hit licks so they can come up real tough 
Rapping is my hustle, alls I need is a beat
So I can tell my little story about life on the street
And I'ma do what it takes, so I can survive
This is mad ass Danger from the Brownside

Everytime you cross my mind tu saves que malito
I remember when we used to kick back and have a blast
It's hard to believe that was back in the past
I remember those times like it was yesterday
I knew if I was there and you were here it'd be the same way
We never thought'd we'd go through anything like this
Now we sit back and pray and say Rest In Peace
All the homies got your name tatted behind their neck
Some on their chest and back, arm just to show respect
You're always on our mind everyday and every night
We miss you carnal, things just ain't right

These firme memories, of my brother
They feel so wonderful
Rest In Peace, Rest In Peace

Every chance we get we're sitting by your grave site
Thinking about you, looking up in the sky
Mom sits back whiping tears from her eyes
We sit and talk about you and she starts to cry
She says how much she wants to hold you back again
In her arms like before, holding you by your hand
Every night we pray and think about you bro
It's hard to accept that you had to go
I sit back and drift and remenice of you
Of all the firme tiempos and the things we used to do
Simon carnal, you're in mi mente all the time
Tu tienes primero and you'll never stay behind
Your kids are growing up and they ask about you bro
They say they miss daddy but I guess you know
We say you're in the skies looking down at them
They stare at one another like they don't understand
Damn carnal, if only we could take time
Back to the days when everything was fine

Ooooohhh, I'm missing you

Sometimes I sit at the pad in the living room
Checking out your pictures, listening to some oldies tunes
The ones you liked, the ones you used to bump
Confessing The Feeling, Try Me, and Let's Get It On
Takes me back to the days when you were here
Sometimes I close my eyes and I can hear you real clear
Rest In Peace in the heavens up above
Those you left behind from us got nothing but love
Simon carnal, that's how it is, you're being missed
Now all we have are the firme memories
We used to share in the days when you were here with us
Now another firme brother and a son is lost
I know we'll see each other 'cause we'll be there some day
Rest In Peace carnal, for you we all pray

Ooooohhh, I'm missing you

Got some hynas lined up pero pa'mas alrato
Now I'm strolling down my calle and I'm packing my glock
Seen a basehead on the way and I sold him some rock
Put his twenty with my thirty and made a 5-0
Went around the block to buy a sack of indo
Now I'm strolling back smoking chronic on the way
I gotta grab more dope to make feria for today
Now I'm standing on my corner serving some d
When some putos drove up and took a blast at me
So I pulled out my quette and never hesitated
Came up and started blasting 'cause I knew they couldn't fade it

Didn't know how bad it was or if that puto was dead
Ran to the hood to let the homeboys know
Ese keep trucha tonight 'cause these putos might roll
Took my quette to the spot where I knew it was cool
Started packing another 'cause that's the golden rule
So I jumped in the ranfla that my homeboy Trigger had
Hit a couple of corners and got rushed to the pad
Hit up some brown khakis and a white t-shirt
Put a lot of starch on it 'cause I knew it couldn't hurt
Sat back on the couch rolled up another ounce
Couldn't help but laugh at these putos I shot
Turned on the radio, it was Lighter Shade of Brown
Turn that shit back off 'cause these putos ain't down
Vatos these days, some of these putos come fake
Talking gangster shit but didn't ever bust a grape

Threw in an old tape of More Bounce to the Ounce
Rolled down the street headed towards the hood
But when I got there shit wasn't looking too good
Two black and whites and a couple of narcs
And on the hood of one car they had my homeboy Shark
So I busted a you and headed back to the spot
To question the homies on any info they got

The juras came back and they were looking for clues
They got my homeboy Shark for having blood on his shoes
They took him to the station to see if he would break
Didn't say shit and got shot to East Lake
Straight to K and L 'cause the vato wouldn't tell
Told the juras too (fuck off, go to hell)

And that's the only thing that was ever stated
'cause you don't say shit when you're gang related

That you would never cheat on me
Or break my heart

Inside I never knew
Your love was so untrue
I thought that I was your only
Boy, was I wrong, so wrong?

Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
You did me wrong and told me lies
Never do somethin' that you'll live to regret
You hurt me so bad, babe

Deep in my heart I feel sorry for ya
You had to lose a damn good thing
Lovin' me could have been good
Losing my love was a shame, baby

I heard it through the grapevyne
That you ain't feeling too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do really

Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best
Hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do

We choose to play love games
We lose, we face the pain
Those lonely nights and that heartache
That empty space

I'll share with you my dreams
Those precious tender things
Everybody plays a fool
I guess I played my part for you

Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
You did me wrong and told me lies
Never do somethin' that you'll live to regret
You hurt me so bad, babe

Deep in my heart I feel sorry for ya
You had to lose a damn good thing
Lovin' me could have been good

Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best
Hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do

Oh, boy, you had my faith, you had my trust, you had my love
But now I have to take it back, it didn't work for us
And all I really needed was your lovin'
Yes, all I really needed was your lovin'

I was your lady and there's nothin' that I would not do
Now here's a 'Dear John' letter that I've written just for you
And all I really needed was your lovin'
Yes, all I really needed was your lovin', hey

Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
You did me wrong and told me lies
Never do somethin' that you'll live to regret
You hurt me so bad, now baby

Deep in my heart I feel sorry for you
You had to lose a damn good thing
Lovin' me could have been good

Keep your visions clear and bright

Wipe your tears away, hold your head up high

I kept you oh so dear & close to my heart

Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Brownsville Station,"All right now, get your ears lowered down to the speakers
So you can understand what I'm talking about
You know it seems like no matter where we go to play a concert at
There's one thing that remains constant
From the beginning to the very end of the show
You can always count on about one hundred to five hundred people
Down at the very front row screaming one word
At the top of their lungs...BOOGIE!!!
And sometimes, the feeling prevails upon 'em so hard, beloved
But they just have to mount up on the stage
And get to giggin' with the band
And when they do, uh-oh, here comes the security fuzz
And the scene is something like this...
Hey you guys are really good, man.  I dig up on you guys.
When you gon' play 'Smokin' In The...' OW! OW! OW!
Man, you made me drop my bottle of wine on the floor.
Say, there you go
So we're gonna dedicate this song to everybody listening
Because the ones that get into it
Are definitely, the KINGS OF THE PARTY!!!

Every Friday night there's a concert in their town
You know they all get together and they're ready to party down
An ol' Brownsville Station really diss 'em, 'cause they get it on.
You see the chicks they all go crazy, oh when the band begins to play
And the guys make so much noise, they scare all the cops away
But together we start to change the show into a rock 'n' roll holiday.

We're the kings of the party, we're the baddest people alive
We're the kings of the party, aw come on, and slip me five
Now we're the kings of the party, 'cause we're the baddest people alive.

Ten thousand eyes watching while we leave the floor
Ten thousand tongues screaming more and more
And there were fifteen hundred still waiting outside the door.

So we're the kings of the party, the baddest people alive
We're the kings of the party, c'mon and slip me five
Now we're the kings of the party, 'cause we're the baddest people alive.

Brownsville Station,"I never know, what you're gonna do
You're always so far away

Down below, you used to tell the truth
Now, you're lookin' for something to say
You give me those eyes
And then look away

Do you want me down on my knees?
Are you livin' a lie?
Is this some kind of game
Baby, won't you tell me please?

Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Who do you love? What makes you happen
What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love? I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time
Who do you love?

I wish you'd lie or tell me the truth
So I can decide for myself
Maybe you've tried what we used to do
With somebody, somewhere else

Give me one reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Nos falta a un party de electrónica
Ella le gusta el money en cash
Y las cadenas en oro como Mónica
Está a dieta como si fuera atlética
Y la cartera que tiene no es replica
Ahora quieren un Hershey’s las diabéticas
Y deja que saque un Bentley pa’
Le da al wax, molly y al acido
Dice que quiere que se lo hagan nasty boy
Va a esperarme sin panty hoy
Yo no sé si ir, dime Randy ¿voy?
Es más hoy, porque estoy sola
Me dijo y yo loco por alargar las horas
Yo ni la mando, ella misma enrola
Y me los tiene ready sin mucha demora

(La baby, la baby)
La baby no bebe ron
Ella prefiere hidratarse
Con la rola revelarse
No le mencionen casarse
Que no está buscando amarrarse
Está buscando estrellarse
Pero conmigo va a quedarse
Deja que se me levante

La baby no bebe ron ni Coca Cola
Botella de agua en la mano y se echa una rola
Ella se va de misión, y no anda sola
Anda con cuatro más y le gustan las pistolas

La baby no bebe ron
Pero fuma y se rolea
Se menea pa’ que le vea
Con el culo me frontea
Y me reza, pero es atea
Permint, nunca le patea
Pero quiero darle fuego a la gicotea
Pero es más fría que un tempano de hielo en Alaska
No rinde cuentas a nadie, ella hace lo que se le plasca
Anda con una Glock y se forma cuando la saca
La pasa pa’ to’s la’u porque aparenta la chamaca
Es una nena buena de su casa, disque no sale
Pero sé que si le gano en la cama to’ se vale
Se mete una rola la Paola y no del father
Creen las buenas vibras pa’ liberar to’ los males

Yeh, ah, yeh
Se le quieren salir las pupilas
La nota pa’ arriba y sin cojones le tiene el mundo después que se activa
Le explotó la rola y se dio cuenta de que también se atreve con la amiga
No sale de epic ni one
Le gusta Cale Calo guey, le gusta los dos coday has del del active a San
Ella es ratata
Y cuando explota rapapa
Sin pedirle me da
Lo que heredó de su mamá
Y quiere conmigo na’ ma’
Chingando me dice que me ama
Y yo la amo cuando me mama
Ay, si se entera su mamá
Se mete una X de más
Esa llego hoy pero no se va hasta que se vaya la felicidad
Esta tan prendía que puedo sentir en su vibra la electricidad
Puso en su biografía que era una rebel, pero es una bellaca ya
Una bomba estalla’

Bruce Abbott,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

And the sand in the glass is right

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

You must have felt me shiver,
Shaken by a wave of fright,
That you calm with a whisper.
And fear gave way to better things,
Like a warm summer and sweeter dreams.  

Like a warm spring rain, on a roof above;
The way you call my name, when we make love.
While the world outside my window goes insane,
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain. 

When living leaves my pride bruised up,
I'm fragile as a feather.
The storms of life just won't let up,
You're like a change of weather.
When dust settles on my dreams,
You wash them clean.

   She really made the Woolworth counter shine              
   Eddie was a sweet romancer, and a darn good dancer
   They'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
 
Eddie played the steel guitar, and his mama cried cuz he played in the bars
And kept young Rita out late at night
So they married up in Abilene, lost a child in Tennessee
Still that love survived, 'cause they'd sing

   Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
   Dance a little closer tonight
   Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
   And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
One of the boys in Eddie's band took a shine to Rita's hands
So Eddie ran off with the bass man's wife
Oh but he was back by June, singin' a different tune
And sportin' miss Rita back by is side.  And he sang...

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
Eddie traveled with the barroom bands till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
Rita's got a house to keep, dimestore novels and a love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night.  And they sing:

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, hey it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Bruce Carroll,"Since that blessed night in a manger, 
She watched her baby grow,
It seems Like yesterday 
He was in her arms, 
Where did the time go?,
He learned His Fathers trade, 
As she marveled at It all, 
The sweat dropped from 
Her Little Carpenter 
As He made the timbers fall,

(Chorus)

She can hear the driving nails 
Upon the Hillside,
And she prays that 
His spirit will not fail,
She watches as a young man 
Undertakes His Fathers Will, 
As she stands and listens to the driving nails

In the streets of Jerusalem 
A child can disappear,
She was frantic as She looked for Him, 
Until She began to hear,
The hammers up at the temple, 
She called Him as she ran, 
Surprised she found Him 
Teaching like no ordinary man

(Chorus)

Darkness covered all the land
 in the middle of the day, 
She began to tremble as the
 earth began to quake,
Hammers, Nails & Timbers 
Of The Carpenters Trade, 
Made the sound that pierced her soul 
As the Cross was being raised

(Chorus)

And She cries and listens to the Driving Nails",Driving Nails,1987
Bruce Carroll,"Saturday night in Plainville 
Saw some local people go
To the downtown corner movies
For a late night picture show
And it's ninety mindless minutes 
Of the best in blood and gore
They all come out laughing, 
Just can't wait for more.

While on the other side of 
Town a child four years of age
Huddles up a weak defense 
Against his fathers rage 
And as we spend our time and money on 
Life's moments cheapest thrills
In our city there's an Elm Street 
Where the nightmare is real.

[Chorus]
Oh God, have mercy on us please, 
For the times that You've shown 
The need and we refused to see
Give us all a heart like Yours that grieves 
For the lost souls on Elm Street 
That need to be released

Complacency's a poison taken 
One drop at a time
It fools our minds into 
Thinking that everything's just fine
Desensitize our Spirit with 
Nothing left to feel
'Till we never hurt for Elm Street 
Where the nightmare is real

Oh Lord You've got to send me 
Where there's a need to go
Put me on their street, Lord, 
Cause they all need to know
There's a God who's so much bigger 
Than anything their going through
Oh they need to know that there's 
A place where nightmares don't come true.

Oh God, have mercy on us please, 
For the times that You've shown 
The need and we refused to see
Give us all a heart like Yours that grieves 
For the lost souls on Elm Street 
That need to be released

Bruce Carroll,"Seems that every day I face 
A struggle in my soul
Keeping out the enemy 
That's fighting  for control 
And I know I should be strong, 
But it's hard to stand against 
What I can't see.
But somewhere deep inside my heart,
A passage is revealed , 
Reminding me to let Your Word 
Become my sword and shield, 
And it's comforting to know 
That the Devil has no power over me.

[Chorus] 
I'm livin' in the pages, 
Of where I need to stay,
Leaning on the promises 
To get me through each day,
I'm finding strength 
I need at every turn, 
I'm livin' in the pages

I am standing here amazed 
At how very long ago you knew
The kind of day I'd have today
What I'd be going through and
That everything I'd need 
Was written down so many years ago. 
And everyday I'm finding out 
The time is hard to find,  
And when I lose my time with You 
I find the loss is mine 
So Fill me with Your words 
Till everyone who sees my life will know,

[Chorus x2]

Bruce Carroll,"He came home from work last night,
To find that she is gone,
Now He's spending his first Sunday 
Sitting in the pew alone,

There are whispers all around him, 
His heart breaks in two,
He's wondering who will reach out 
And help him make it through,

She has a reputation like 
The woman at the well ,
The only love she ever knew was
The kind she buys and sells,

But her thirsty heart is searching 
For a love that will be true,
The Savior cries for her to 
See Himself in me and you,

Who Will be Jesus to her?, 
Who'll show the love that's 
Commanded in His word?,
Will she see in us the mighty God we serve?,
Who will Be Jesus to her?

Wounded People everywhere, 
And when they look at us, 
Do they see Jesus there?
Who Will be Jesus to Them?, 
Who'll show the love that 

Restores Them again?,

They need a friend, 
Who will Be Jesus to Them?

Bruce Carroll,"They were so excited it was coming to be, 
Two People so in love and 
Now soon there would be three. 
For many years they'd planned it 

Now it would soon be true,
She was picking out the pink clothes 
He was looking at the blue.  
The call came unexpected, the Doctor had bad news, some tests came back and things weren't right 

He said you're gonna have to choose
""I'll wait a week for you're decision"", 
Then the words cut like a knife,  
""I'm sure everyone will understand if 

you want to end it's life"".  
Though they were badly shaken they
Just had no choice, 'Cause they knew God 
Creates no accidents and they were sure
They heard His voice saying:

[Chorus]
Sometimes miracles hide and 
God will wrap some blessings in disguise  
You may have to wait this lifetime to see the reasons with your eyes  
'Cause sometimes miracles hide

It seemed before they knew it 
The appointed day arrived and 
With eager apprehension they 
Could barely hold inside 

The first time they laid eyes on her 
Confirmed the Dr's fears but 
They held onto God's Promises 
'Cause they were sure they both could hear that :

[Chorus]

Tho she was not like the other girls, 
They thought she was the best 
And through all the years of struggle 
Neither whispered one regret 

And the first day that she started school 
And took her first bus ride
They remembered the words that God had spoke 
And they both broke down and cried. 

You see to them it did not matter why 
Some things in life take place 
'Cause they just knew the joy they felt 
When they'd look into her face, they learned 

Sometimes miracles hide 
They said:"" God has wrapped our blessing in disguise"",
And We may have to wait this lifetime to see the reasons with our eyes
But we know sometimes miracles hide,
We've learned sometimes miracles hide""

Bruce Carroll,"Talked to a friend who 
Commanded quite a fortune
With one big deal 
He was an overnight success
He had it all everything 
That seemed important 
Then one day it slipped away 
And he felt the emptiness
And as I watched his bridges burn 
Once again I learned that
The treasures of this world
Will all go up in smoke
so in God I place my hope

[Chorus]
I'm livin' the good life
I've got everything I need
Totally satisfied 
With the faith He's given me
Life will overflow with joy 
With real security 
He's given me the good life
I'm gonna live it faithfully

I'm an average man 
With average kinds of problems
The bills stack up 
How am I gonna make it through
But I can't complain, 
'Cause He's pulled me through so often
And I may go without a time or two
But I don't lack for what I need
'Cause I know that my reward
Is in the Hands of the Lord
And the worst of circumstances
Work out for the best
How did I become so blessed

Bruce Cockburn,"My canoe lies on the water
Evening holds the bones of day
The sun like gold dust slips away 

One by one antique stars
Herald the arrival of
Their pale protectress moon 

Ragged branches vibrate
Strummed by winds from o'er the hill
Singing tales of ancient days 

Far and silent lightning
Stirs the cauldron of the sky
I turn my bow towards the shore 

As we grow out of stones
On and on and on
So we'll all go to bones
On and on for many a year 

But let us go laughing -- O
Let us go 

And may the holy hermit's staff
On and on and on
Guide you to the shortest path
On and on for many a year 

And let us go laughing -- O
Let us go
Let us go laughing -- O
Let us go

Bruce Cockburn,"I went up on the mountain side
to see what i could see
to see what i could be
on the shining mountain

I watched the day go down in fire
and sink in the valley
and sink into the sea
drown in golden fire

Fireflies danced in the forest night
the trees began to sing
the crags began to sing
above the black forest

to know what i did know
to know whence i did know
on the crowning mountain

Construct a tapestry of what will come

I see
What seems to be so free
Bound by
Empty sky

Maybe to those who love is given sight
To pierce the wall of seeming night
And know it pure beyond all imagining

Ultraflame, glittering dust falling in slow motion 
Clouds tumbling one over another into apparent emptiness

Of tire marks frozen in the mud

We changed the slogans

Behind icy mist and stark bare trees
Inside the dim empty cinema two guys in leather jackets 
Glance at each other and shiver
""They never built these places with winter in mind""
Out the window down the gray road
You can see old walled monastery
Now become a barracks for the paramilitary police

I saw an old lady's face once on a Japanese train
Half lit, rich with soft luminosity
She was dozing straight upright head bobbing almost imperceptibly
Wheels were playing fast in 9/8 time
Her husband's friendly face suddenly folded up in a sneeze
Across the straight a volcano flew a white smoke flag of surrender

In a Roman street on a full moon night
I was sick and there was a young cop in a circle of yellow light
As we drew near he snapped the safety off his machine pistol
And slid a trembling finger to the trigger
I wanted to say something calming but couldn't catch his eye
He didn't want contact -- he was trained to see movement
""Well don't shoot me, man, I'm a graceful slow dancer
I'm just a dream to you not real at all""

I wonder if I'll end up like Bernie in his dream
A displaced person in some foreign border town
Waiting for a train part hope part myth 
While the station changes hands
Or just sitting at home growing tenser with the times
Or like that guy in ""The Seventh Seal"" 
Watching the newly dead dance across the hills
Or wearing this leather jacket shivering with a friend
While the eye of God blazes at us like the sun...

Who thinks he can make things work
Tried to build the new Jerusalem
And ended up with New York

Through the thermal inversion haze
A laugh for the nuclear good time boys
Numbering all our days

A laugh for the newsprint nightmare
A world that never was
Where the questions are all why
And the answers are all because

A laugh for the dogs barking at our heels
They don't know where we've been

Hot tires sing like a string being bowed
Sudden town rears up then explodes

Undulate under a grey cloud shield
We outrun a river color brick red mud
That cleaves apart hills soil rich as blood

Stop caution hard hat yellow insect machines
Silver steel towers stalk rolling land
Toward distant stacks that shout feed on demand

Throws up silhouette skyline in brown

Sudden swoop skyward iron horse overpass
Pass a man walking like the man in the moon
Walking like his head's full of Irish fiddle tunes

Miles of flat neon spelling well known names
Used trucks dirty donuts you you're the one
Fat wheeled cars squeal into the sun

Glints metallic off the bowl of the spoon
Sliding through the air toward parted lips
Watch the expression when the straight taste hits
Face crumples, tongue's quickly withdrawn
I hate to tell you but the candy man's gone

Oh, sweet fantasia of the safe home
Where nobody has to scrape for honey at the bottom of the comb
Where every actor understands the scene
And nobody ever means to be mean
Catch it in a dream, catch it in a song
Seek it on the street, you find the candy man's gone
I hate to tell you but the candy man's gone

In the bar, in the senate, in the alley, in the study
Pimping dreams of riches for everybody

And the streets will be platinum, never mind gold""

Away from the smoke of the burning 
Fearful survivors 
Subject of government directives 
One sad guitar note 
Echoes of the wall of the jungle 
Seen from the air they're just targets with nowhere to run to 
Children of rape 
Raised on malnutrition 
Men in camouflage Filled with a sense of mission 
Light through the wire mesh 
Plays on the president's pistol 
Like the gleam of a bead of sweat in the flow of a candle 
Hear the cry in the tropic night 
Should be the cry of love but it's a cry of fright 
Some people never see the light 
Till it shines through bullet holes

Bathing a beach fringed with palms 
Glitters on shells 
And beach tar and coke cans 
And on the night-coloured boat 
And on the barrels of guns

Planet lurches to the right as ideologies engage
Suddenly it's repression, moratorium on rights

Callous men in business costume speak computerese
Play pinball with the third world trying to keep it on its knees
Their single crop starvation plans put sugar in your tea
And the local third world's kept on reservations you don't see

Headlights pick out fallen sack of corn One lone tarantula standing guard We pull up and stop and she ambles off Discretion much the better part of cars Rodrigo the government driver jumps out He's got chickens who can use the feed We sweep the asphalt on our hands and knees Fill up his trunk with dusty yellow seeds

To fall down from starvation, or some less humane fate
Cry for Guatemala, with a corpse in every gate

Half moon shining through the blind Paints a vision of a different kind And your hair tumbles down like sahara gold 

Wet limbs striped with silver light Locked together at the centre of the night And your hair tumbles down like sahara gold 

Night bloom filling up the room With the salt and musk of lovers' rich perfume And your hair tumbles down like sahara gold

See the beauty -- makes you cry inside
Makes you angry and you don't know why

Twelve mercenaries got weapons primed
Gonna take that African nation in record time
You wonder why they bother, why not leave it alone
They say, ""Every man wants to retire to a place he can call his own""


Those grim travellers in dawn skies
See the beauty -- makes them cry inside
Makes them angry and they don't know why
Grim travellers in dawn skies


Redness, richer than a rose
Blooms against the backdrop of somebody's white clothes
Bitter little girls and boys from the Red Army Underground
They'd blow away Karl Marx if he had the nerve to come around


They're just grim travellers in dawn skies
See the beauty -- makes them cry inside
Makes them angry and they don't know why
They're grim travellers in dawn skies


Down on the plain of 10,000 smokestacks
Trucks butt each other to establish dominance
The newspaper next to me leans over and says matter-of-factly
""Sacred mountains towers above meadows"" - uh huh - and above us

It makes me angry and I don't know why

Sky been down around our ears for weeks 
Only once -- gap-glimpsed moon over that anal-retentive border wall
As we laughed through some midnight checkpoint under yellow urban cloud 
Weeks of frantic motion -- petrol veins of 
Europe pumping 
Through scratchy acid-bitten transparent winter trees 
Through brownish haze that makes a ghost of the horizon 
I'm rushing after some ever-receding destination 
Berlin tonight

Waving a silver crutch in the blue lights 
Shape changing over glass 
On the front line of the last gasp 
Green shoots of winter wheat and patches of snow 
Russian walks dog in Saxon field 
From the top of a solitary tree like the one on the flag of Lebanon 
Unblinking eye of hawk follows traffic on the autobahn 
Tank convoy winds down smokestack valley 
Pound chemical pennants wave against the sky 
Turret gunner laughs when I throw up my hands 
I'm all glasses and grin to him under my ""commie"" fur hat

International loan sharks backed by the guns
Of market hungry military profiteers
Whose word is a swamp and whose brow is smeared
With the blood of the poor

Who rob life of its quality
Who render rage a necessity
By turning countries into labour camps
Modern slavers in drag as champions of freedom

Sinister cynical instrument
Who makes the gun into a sacrament
The only response to the deification
Of tyranny by so called ""developed"" nations'

Always making certain that there's one thing left

Passing themselves off as leaders
Kiss the ladies, shake hands with the fellows
And it's open for business like a cheap bordello

And they call it democracy
And they call it democracy
And they call it democracy

Trying to make the best of it the way kids do

To find yourself staring down the throat of the beast

Stream rising from feathered bamboo hills 
Tracks once paved now falling away into deep lush valleys 
And the farmed-out road contracts pass through so many hands 
The print erodes with the weather-worn blacktop 
And the jungle's always trying to reclaim the right of way 
And the mangoes cacao turmeric goats soursop 
Mushrooms cane plantains limes Horses crayfish long-legged birds donkeys 
Curved horns of cattle above dense grass Ganja sensitive plant ackee 
And some thorn whose prick brings lockjaw 
And tires torn by sharp yellow rocks --

With its dirt corral for dancing Drink soursop juice all day long

Bruce Cockburn,"I love the pounding of hooves
I love engines that roar
I love the wild music of waves on the shore
And the spiral perfection of a hawk when it soars
Love my sweet woman down to the core

There's roads and there's roads
And they call, can't you hear it?
Roads of the earth
And roads of the spirit
The best roads of all
Are the ones that aren't certain
One of those is where you'll find me
Till they drop the big curtain


Hear the wind moan
In the bright diamond sky
These mountains are waiting
Brown-green and dry
I'm too old for the term
But I'll use it anyway
I'll be a child of the wind
Till the end of my days


Little round planet
In a big universe
Sometimes it looks blessed
Sometimes it looks cursed
Depends on what you look at obviously
But even more it depends on the way that you see

These mountains are waiting
Brown-green and dry

Bruce Cockburn,"Mary grows a child without the help of a man
Joseph get upset because he doesn't understand
Angel comes to Joseph in a powerful dream
Says ""God did this and you're part of his scheme""
Joseph comes to Mary with his hat in his hand
Says ""forgive me I thought you'd been with some other man""
She says ""what if I had been - but I wasn't anyway and guess what
I felt the baby kick today""


Like a stone on the surface of a still river
Driving the ripples on forever
Redemption rips through the surface of time
In the cry of a tiny babe


The child is born in the fullness of time
Three wise astrologers take note of the signs
Come to pay their respects to the fragile little king
Get pretty close to wrecking everything
'Cause the governing body of the whole land
Is that of Herod, a paranoid man
Who when he hears there's a baby born King of the Jews
Sends death squads to kill all male children under two
But that same bright angel warns the parents in a dream
And they head out for the border and get away clean


Like a stone on the surface of a still river
Driving the ripples on forever
Redemption rips through the surface of time
In the cry of a tiny babe


There are others who know about this miracle birth
The humblest of people catch a glimpse of their worth
For it isn't to the palace that the Christ child comes
But to shepherds and street people, hookers and bums
And the message is clear if you've got ears to hear
That forgiveness is given for your guilt and your fear
It's a Christmas gift you don't have to buy
There's a future shining in a baby's eyes

Bruce Cockburn,"Evening sun slants across the road
Painting everything with gold
I'm headed for home, got a woman there
I can barely wait to hold
Got wind in my hair, got the heat inside
Heart jumping up and down
An empty head and a messed-up bed
I'll be floating just above the ground


Great big love
Sweeping across the sky


Seen a lot of things in the world outside
Some bad but some good stuff too
Felt the touch of love in the works of God
And now and then in what people do
Never had a lot of faith in human beings
But sometimes we manage to shine
Like a light on a hill beaming out to space
From somewhere hard to find


Great big love
Sweeping across the sky


I ride and I shoot and I play guitar
And I like my life just fine
If you try to take one of these things from me
Then you're no friend of mine
Got a woman I love and she loves me
And we live on a piece of land
I never know quite how to measure these things
But I guess I'm a happy man

Bruce Cockburn,"Out in the desert where the wind never stops
A few simple people try to grow a few crops
Trying to maintain a life and a home
On land that was theirs before the Romans thought of Rome

A few dozen survivors, ragged but proud
With a few woolly sheep, under gathering cloud
It's never been easy, or free from strife
But the pulse of the land is the pulse of their life


You thought it was over but it's just like before
Will there never be an end to the Indian wars?


It's not breech-loading rifles and wholesale slaughter
It's kickbacks and thugs and diverted water
Treaties get signed and the papers change hands
But they might as well draft these agreements in sand

Noble Savage on the cinema screen
An Indian's good when he cannot be seen
And the so-called white so-called race
Digs for itself a pit of disgrace


You thought it was over but it's just like before
Will there never be an end to the Indian wars?

There's lots of ways to hit the ground
Not many answers to be found

Like the nine billion names of God
Don't bring you any closer
To anyone you can simply set eyes on 

But in the same way it's as real
Don't always recognize what I feel
But of the dancing scenes that life reveals
This is one of the best ones 

Say what you will
There's no snake oil or pill
Can make love less painful or fine
There's no theater
Even of the absurd
Can express what goes on in this meeting of hearts and minds 

Guess I'd get along without you
If I had no choice
But please never make it so I have to 

Paid a lot of dues to get here
And after all this life

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see

He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down

One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, ""Patches

Leaving next week's hanging jury far behind them
Prisoner only of the choices they've made 

Night train 
Ice cube in a dark drink shines like starlight
The moon is floating somewhere out at sea
On an island in the blur of noise and color
Alcatraz, St. Helena, Patmos and the Chateau D'If 

Night train 
And everyone's an island edged with sand
A temporary refuge where somebody else can stand
Till the sea that binds us like the forced tide of a blood oath
Will wear it down - dissolve it - recombine it 

Anyone can die here they do it every day
It doesn't take much effort tho it goes against the grain
And the ultimate forgetfulness of violence
Sweeps the landscape like a headlight of a train 

Night train 
Ice cube in a dark drink shines like star light
Starlight shines like glass shards in dark hair
And the mind's eye tumbles out along the steel track
Fixing every shadow with its stare

And in the absence of compassion there is cancer

Bruce Cockburn,"Sunset is an angel weeping
Holding out a bloody sword
No matter how I squint I cannot
Make out what it's pointing toward
Sometimes you feel like you've lived too long
Days drip slowly on the page
You catch yourself
Pacing the cage

I've proven who I am so many times
The magnetic strip's worn thin
And each time I was someone else
And every one was taken in
Hours chatter in high places
Stir up eddies in the dust of rage
Set me to pacing the cage

I never knew what you all wanted
So I gave you everything
All that I could pillage
All the spells that I could sing
It's as if the thing were written 
In the constitution of the age
Sooner or later you'll wind up
Pacing the cage

Sometimes the best map will not guide you
You can't see what's round the bend
Sometimes the road leads through dark places 
Sometimes the darkness is your friend
Today these eyes scan bleached-out land 
For the coming of the outbound stage

Bruce Cockburn,"I've seen a high cairn kissed by holy winds,
Seen a mirror pool cut by golden fins,
Seen alleys where they hide the truth of cities,
The matter's blessing you must accept without pity.

I've been in airports, guarded glass and chrome
Walked rifled roads and landmined loam,
Seen a forest in flames right down to the road,
Burned in love 'till I've seen my heart explode.

You've been leading me beside strange waters,
Across the concrete fields of man.
Sunray, like a camera, pans.
Some will run and some will stand,
Everything is bullshit but the open hand.

Streams of beautiful lights in the night.

Bruce Cockburn,"Heavy northern autumn sky
Mist-hung forest -- Dark spruce, bright maple --
And the great lake rolling forever to the narrow gray beach

I look west along the red road of the frail sun
Where it hovers between shelf of cloud and spiky trees, 
Receding shore;

The world is full of seasons; of anguish, of laughter
And it comes to mind to write you this:

Nothing is sure
Nothing is pure
And no matter who we think we are
Everyone gets his chance to be nothing

Love's supposed to heal, but it breaks my heart to feel
The pain in your voice --
But you know, it's all going somewhere
And I would crush my heart and throw it in the street
If I could pay for your choice

Isn't that what friends are for?
Isn't that what friends are for?

We're the insect life of paradise:
Crawl across leaf or among towering blades of grass
Glimpse only sometimes the amazing breadth of heaven

You're as loved as you were
Before the strangeness swept through
Our bodies, our houses, our streets --
When we could speak without codes
And light swirled around like
Wind-blown petals,
Our feet

I've been scraping little shavings off my ration of light
And I've formed it into a ball, and each time I pack a bit more onto it
I make a bowl of my hands and I scoop it from its secret cache
Under a loose board in the floor
And I blow across it and I send it to you
Against those moments when
The darkness blows under your door

Blow a fruit fly off the rim of my glass

Midnight it was bike tires whacking the pot holes
Milling humans' shivering energy glow
Fusing the space between them with bar-throb bass and laughter

If this were the last night of the world
What would I do?
What would I do that was different
Unless it was champagne with you? 

I learned as a child not to trust in my body
I've carried that burden through my life
But there's a day when we all have to be pried loose

If this were the last night of the world
What would I do?

I've seen the flame of hope among the hopeless
And that was truly the biggest heartbreak of all

Bruce Cockburn,"Judge said to the hooker, ""Can you come out to play?
I've been condemning people all day long, that's how I get paid
My dreams are full of criminals frolicking about
Open up the window, let the bad air out!""


Strangled by confusion, my mind is in decay
Can't picture tomorrow, can't remember yesterday
Send out for the Black & Decker and the psychiatric couch
Open up the window, let the bad air out


Traitors in high places take my money, tell me lies
Take a walk past Parliament, it smells like something died
They ask for trust, but somehow I've got serious doubts
Open up the window, let the bad air out


Too much monkey business, like Mr. Berry said
Drugs and oil and money, don't mean nothing when you're dead

In the rays of the setting sun
Glasses of wine on a crate between us
Catch the light -- seem to glow from within

And there's a laugh
Hanging in the air
And there's no
Desperation anywhere

So many miles, so many doors
Some need patience, some need force
All fall open in their own due course
To allow us this time

And you're limned
In light, golden and thin

Stretched across golden smoky haze

Bruce Cockburn,"There's a black and white crow
On the back of a two-toned sheep
In a field of broken yellow stalks
Below looming cliffs.

High above the plains
Little grey houses blend
With giant jagged boulders
And pale weathered stumps.

Life in the ghost of the bush.

Wind whips the acacias and strange forked palms
That cluster around the water hole

Suddenly, out of the blowing sand
A milk-white camel appears.

Turbaned rider, blue robe billowing,
Bounces with the shambling trot;
Wears a sword and a rifle on his back,
And hanging from his neck, a transistor radio...

You blink and like ghosts, they're gone

Under the wan disc of sand-masked sun
A woman grins - spits expertly
Into the path of a struggling black beetle
Six feet away
Hoists her water bucket onto her head
And strides off up the trail...

Sun a steel ball glowing
Behind endless blowing sand
Sun a steel ball glowing
Dust of fallen empires slowly flowing through my hands
Use me while you can

Is the moon behind dry trees
Pearl held in black fingers
Bird inside the rib cage is beating to be free

The parrot things on the porch next door
Announced my arrival on Chartres Street
With their finest rendition of squealing brakes

Concerning Prince Charles' Amex account
A morose young man in old-tim Austrian drag
Stares past his long mustache at the ground
And last night's punks and fetish kids
All tattoos and metal bits
And in the other corner (wearing the white trunks)

Pearls before pigs and dung become jewels

Study the shadow creeping over the yard

Silver steel towers stalk rolling land
Toward distant stacks that shout ""Feed on demand"" 

One hundred miles later the sky has changed
Urban anticipation, we get 4 lanes
Red orange furnace sphere notches down
Throws up silhouette skyline in brown 

Sun dogs flare on windshield glass
Sudden swoop skyward iron horse overpass
Pass a man walking like the man in the moon
Walking like his head's full of Irish fiddle tunes 

The skin around every city looks the same
Miles of flat neon spelling well-known names
Used trucks dirty donuts you you're the one
Fat wheeled cars squeal into the sun 

Radio speakers gargle top 40 trash
Muzak soundtrack to slow collapse
Planet engines pulsate in sidereal time
If you listen close you can hear the whine",Luka,2015
Bruce Cook,"If you hear her cry at night
Better turn on your light
Maybe your baby's got the blues
When she says there's nothing wrong
She just wants to be alone
You can bet your baby's got the blues

[Chorus]
Women like men to make the first move
And touch her like he used to
When there's achin' in her heart
Only tenderness can find
Women like men to make them feel alive
And keep her apron strings untied
Yes women like men
To love them through the blues sometime

When her days all run the same
And she says she thinks she needs a change
Maybe your baby's got the blues
If she says she's just a wife
And so far from the glamorous life
You can bet your baby's got the blues

Bruce Cox,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1997
Bruce Daigrepont,"And then she holds my hand, mm
And then I understand. mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?
And then she dims the light, mm
And then she holds me tight. mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise
 
And then he holds my hand, mm

Bruce Davidson,"I was cruisin' in my Stingray late one night
When an XKE pulled up on the right
He rolled down the window of his shiny new Jag
And challenged me then and there to a drag

I said ""You're on buddy, my mill's running fine
Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way to Dead Man's Curve""

(Dead Man's Curve) you'd best keep away
(Dead Man's Curve) I can hear 'em say
Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You should've heard the whine from my screamin' machine

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six tail lights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were at Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play

And he worked with his hands and prisoners
He set a judgment on his fellow man

His spawn lay in the freezer
The killers that bore his name

The breeding house, you were there
And the sins of your fathers, in the breeding house
The breeding house, 731
And the sins of your fathers, are the sins of your sons

Maybe within childhood he pulled off spiders legs
Now, he's a big boy playing with big boys toys
Playing games he won't forget

A contract for some research
A pay cheque in the mail
A secret that defended by the ones that should have ended it

Angels of death in a white coat so serene
Devising ways of dying, so obscene, so obscene
And Washington was baffled about knickers and g strings
And men were busy hiding evil things, evil things

The breeding house, you were there
And the sins of your fathers, in the breeding house
The breeding house, 731
And the sins of your fathers, are the sins of your sons

Come to see the carnival, come to witness fear
Come and see deformity, all human life is here
A double blind experiment on who's the last to die
A fifty year conspiracy of murders and of lies

Angels of death in a white coat so serene
Devising ways of dying, so obscene, so obscene
And Washington was baffled about knickers and g strings
And men were busy hiding evil things, evil things

And the sins of your fathers, in the breeding house

As I lie still and quiet in the dark
The only sign of breathing, a flicker on my skin
The only sign of life, my beating heart

What does it take to register surprise?
What does it take to feel joy?
What does it take to feel pain?

Floors creak but doors are still
I've read all the books about being ill
I know the truth and truth knows I'm right
One day you'll fear me in the night

A drowning man sees daylight
Coming up for air
I've been working hard for this
All my life and I like it this way

I know they're staking out my house
That's why I'm quiet like a mouse
I don't know love but I know what's right
I feel my sickness every night

My TV fills my world with light
Twenty-four hours of second sight
I talk to God on my station
He gives me secret information

A drowning man sees daylight
Coming up for air
I've been working hard for this
All my life and I like it this way

Mother, suffocate me
Mother, suffocate me
There's no way out of here
It's tearing me apart

There's no way out of here
There's no way out of here
Mother, suffocate me
There's no way out of here

There's no way out of here
No, no, no way out of here

Bruce Dickinson,"You were too weird, you were too weird
You were too weird for your own skin, baby
You were too weird for your own piece of mind

Took a stab at the sky without a high wire
Took a touch-tone ride, but I couldn't come clean
Come clean

You were too weird, you were too weird
You were too weird to be flying by night
I shot for the moon but you turned out the light

Took a stab at the sky without a high wire
Took a touch-tone ride in the stars

I've been laughing all my life and waiting for a smile
Over and out, over and out
She threw me over and out

You were too weird, you were too weird
Candles and curtains to cover the guilt
You were too pale for the light
Took a step in the sky without a high wire
Took a touch tone ride in the stars

I've been laughing all my life and waiting for a smile
Strung out hanging on the phone and waiting for a line
Over and out, over and out
She threw me over and out

Yeah, I'd dance at you in the stars, yeah
Over and out, you were too weird
But I couldn't come clean
You were too weird, over and out

You were too weird, you were too weird
But I couldn't come clean
Over and over and out
You were too weird

In the post alternative Seattle fallout
Worms will fly and pigs will shout
Does a worm have a brain, well you'd better find out
Slice it in half and suck the offending part out

If you can't see the roof there must be a ceiling
If you can't find the door you must be locked in
Cover your faces cover your vest
Cover your ears east and west

Where do you wanna go?
I know where you wanna go
I don't want you to save me

Where do you wanna go?
I know where you wanna go
I don't want you to save me

There's something about a nozzle I like
Maybe the way they wave at you
Expectantly in the summer heat
Mmm, yellow lines on policemen, dry?

In the post alternative Seattle fallout
How would ya know how would you find out?
How can you see the wood for the trees?
Trying to find a species to rhyme with the birds and bees

When the world is run by things that squirt and it is
Better watch the skies for holy dirt
Go home on the bus and have your tea
Come have a vulture meal with me

Where do you wanna go?
I know where you wanna go
I don't want you to save me

Where do you wanna go?
I know where you wanna go
I don't want you to save me

Everything is very strange in here
