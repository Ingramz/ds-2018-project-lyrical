The Head and the Heart,"I left you over by the wishin' well
Wandering, wondering if these trees could tell

Summertime
I'll make you mine

'Cause I need
Healin' for a hollow wound
With room for two

If the garden's your daylight
Then I'll work the field
Fielding the ripeness of this stubborn will

Summertime
I'll make you mine

'Cause I need
Healin' for a hollow wound
With room for two

I will sing as your canary bird
Take my soul and bury it in the earth
I will sing as your canary bird
Oh yes I will
Yes I will

I left you over by the wishin' well
Wandering, wondering if these trees could tell",Summertime,2013
The Head and the Heart,"There's always hope
Hope in death
It brands these bonds
Refines the rest
But these days are numbered
This life absolute
I need this faith to keep me walkin'
To keep me alive

Oh darlin', oh darlin'
Won't you please take me home
Oh darlin', my sweet darlin'
Won't you please keep me warm

We must strive to be
Be like the moon
To be kind
Distracted by its tune
'Cause these days are numbered
This life absolute
We all complain if it rains or it shines
But we're never mad at the moon

Oh darlin', oh darlin'
Won't you please keep me warm
Oh darlin', sweet darlin'
Won't you please take me home",These Days Are Numbered,2013
The Head and the Heart,"When I wake up in the morning
I see nothing
For miles and miles and miles
When I sleep in the evening, oh lord
There she goes, only in dreams
She's only in dreams
Well, well my love
We've been here before
Don't drag me through this again
We tried everything under the sun

Now I'm trying to wake up from this
I'm trying to make up for it

All we ever do, is all we ever knew
La la la la la la

You don't see why you would there's no love to give
Well what goes around comes around
I know sometimes you get so caught in a dream
But now it's time to wake up from this
It's time to make up for it

It's time to wake up from this
Yes it's time to wake up from this

The Head and the Heart,"Salt in a wound on a warm afternoon
Sun is too bright so we wait for the night to find you
To find you

We'd get so high telling stories at night
Was it a lie or maybe more like a dream

Feels like a

On the other line is just people takin' time

The Head and the Heart,"I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away

I see you're kickin' the can down the road
And you're stirrin' up the dust
I hear you in the moonlight
Every word seems like you said

I saw the colors fade away from you, you said
I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away from you now, honey
I saw the colors fade away

So the ceiling looks the same as it did in the mornin'
And it feels like a storm, but it's all in your head
And I know that you feel like you're not gettin' what you need right now
But give it a night, wait for the light, yeah

Well, well what can you say
When your love just starts to fade away
Who can you tell?
You know this song just won't go away

Thinkin' back to the time before
Lookin' up from beyond the floor
Did you not feel that somethin' too
Takin' it back bringin' it up on everything

I saw the colors fade away
I saw the colors fade away from you
I saw the colors fade away from you
I saw the colors fade away

The Head and the Heart,"Call me the dreamer
Head's in the clouds
What must go up always comes down
I still believe
This was always here for me
This was always meant to be

So call me a dreamer
I feel like a clown
Guess that's what you get for stickin' around
Don't know how much longer
I don't know how much pain I can bear
Honey please

Holdin' on for you
Whatcha need now?

Au contraire-ey
Poor Mother Mary
It's like everybody knows
The way you ran the show
Was it all about control?

Call me a friend
Don't call me a foe
Look for the truth, know you're never alone
Just look to the sky
For the shooting golden lights
Like arrows in the night

Holdin' on for you
Whatcha need now?
All you need is love

Now you see
Whatcha done to me
I swear everybody knows
You're holdin' on to me

The Head and the Heart,"You can put it on a shelf
You can watch the dust collect
Don't let 'em die
I crushed it into blue
And wrote a song for you
Put it in your pocket to rest

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

So your heart was stolen
From the most beautiful girl in the world
Oh, the winds blew you over

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't

She told me, never come back alone
Never come back alone
Time will heal your soul, it's time

Just time alone
Just time alone",I Don't Mind,2016
The Head and the Heart,"I'm drawn to that sorta library magic
Whisperin' through the dusty aisles
Watchin' all the thinkers read
Tryin' to keep a grown mans quiet's like
Pulling teeth on a winter's eve
Cracks and pulls and unfamiliar roads
I'm on this one to find out
Veggie gas and brothers harass
Can't stay healthy in a cloud of eyes
Listenin' to my every move
Just tryin' to survive
This self-imposed adventure
That selfishness drives I can barely keep my head above the blue
Tryin' to keep it off me and you

But I can see the sunshine's rays gleaming through the clear water
Telling me you gotta hop in for this chapter's ride
There will always be better days
There will always be better days

Makin' music is what we do
Tryin' to weave the patterns for me and you
Tryin' to make the grasses breathe and a grown man cry
Truth and life is where I gleam
Tangled up in a funnel's wind
Tryin' to come out walkin'
Understand it's beyond me talkin'
Tryin' to come out walkin'
Understand it's beyond me talkin'

I can see the sunshine's rays gleaming through the clear waters
Telling me you gotta hop in for this chapter's ride
There will always be better days
There will always be better days

Bein' alone isn't lonely
It's sought after like a holiday
Bein' home is my vacation
Postcard dreams of a full-sized bed

Quit the band one too many times serious enough to get a rise
But he'll hop in the next mornin' for another drive
That's a promise the best advice we ever received is for you and me to stay together
It's easy to begin and hard to end
I'm just glad to go through it all with you as friends

I can see the sunshine's rays gleaming through the clear waters
Telling me you gotta hop in for this chapter's ride
There will always be better days
There will always be better days
There will always be better days",Library Magic,2016
The Head and the Heart,"Oh my dear
Have you forgotten all the good years
Once or twice, that's all we get in this life
You can put it on the shelf
You can watch the dust collect

But oh dear, oh dear
Don't let 'em die
Don't let 'em die
Don't let 'em die

Well, honey, I'll drink your poison
Well, honey, I'll take the blows when it gets rough

Ain't it nice to be so loved
Oh, come on darlin', won't you let me

No more lonely nights. In a film she once saw, a girl was
fucked by a dog. So she went to the pet store - but felt
stupid - and came home with a goldfish in a plastic bag.

world in five minutes.

in you and on you for sexual pleasure. SuperMan
watches glossy-eyed, camera staring mute, blinking
encouragingly down at the big bed where she has fallen
asleep, fingers smeared with 'Kissing Red' and melted
chocolate - SuperMan and the remote control still in a
cramped grip.

hot enough to keep you warm when winter comes. Oh, it
would suit you good, it would do you good. You can do

The Headstones,"Tweeter and the Monkey Man
Were hard up for cash
They stayed up all night
Selling cocaine and hash

To an undercover cop
Who had a sister named Jan
For reasons unexplained
She loved the Monkey Man

Tweeter was a Boy Scout
'Course he went to Vietnam
Found out the hard way
Nobody gives a damn

Thought that they'd find freedom
Just across the Jersey line
Hopped into a stolen car
Took Highway 99

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they standin'
Never saw them when they fell

The undercover cop
He never liked the Monkey Man
Even back in high school
Wanted to see him in the can

Jan got married at fourteen
To a racketeer named Bill
Made secret plans with the Monkey Man
From a mansion on the hill

It was out on Thunder Road
Tweeter at the wheel
Pulled into paradise
You could hear the tires squeal

It was Jan who'd told him many times
""It was you to me who'd taught
In Kingston everything's legal
As long as you don't get caught""

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they standin'
Never saw them when they fell

Some place by Rahway prison
They ran out of gas
The undercover cop cornered 'em
Said, ""You didn't think that this could last""

Jan jumped up out of bed
Said, ""There's some place I gotta go""
She took the gun out of the drawer
And said, ""It's best that you don't know""

An ambulance rolled up
State Trooper close behind
Tweeter took his gun away
And messed up his mind

The undercover cop was found
Face down in a field
The Monkey Man was on the bridge
Using Tweeter as a shield

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they standin'
Never saw them when they fell

The town of Jersey City
Is quieting down again
I'm sitting in a gambling club
Called The Lion's Den

The TV set is blown up
Every bit of it is gone
Ever since the night
When they showed
That the Monkey Man was on

Maybe I'll go to Florida
Set myself some sun
There ain't no more opportunity here
And everything's been done

Sometimes I think of Tweeter
Sometimes I think of Jan
Sometimes I don't think about nothin'
But the Monkey Man

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they standin'
Never saw them when they fell

You don't get what you need and you don't get what you want
Now everything is ringing, reality is calling
If you're digging Gary Busey, you're living Buddy Holly

Come on, lean into the curve and come on
You know the nerves are perfect, come on
Look down from above it, just see just where we're at
And to know how far we've come
",Come On,2002
The Headstones,"I smiled 'cause I know I tried firing up the circuits
Can't see myself jumping double-dutch
'Cause I know I'd smell the plastic burning
Last night was a pessimistic skydive
In a foolish narcotic shell
Beat the boredom that frames the lightning
Beat the path of the rituals

Gonna become... unsound

Bottom lip quivers, rage is so apparent
Don't know whether to kill or cry
Don't know whether to rebuild or to burn it
You don't know how just to say goodbye
I'll tell you what, what's to tell
It's the world not a call I can screen out
Keep it down see if it digests
Your batteries are shot - so are the instruments

Gonna become... unsound
Gonna become... You better run don't want to become yourself

Flies in and out of focus
Next best thing to a rage
I don't like the way that it coaxes me to explain
If you don't realize it's crazy
If you can't understand the source
Don't reach too fast for the answers
'Cause it gets worse
Turn your face to the day that's striking
Bend the barrel when the chamber's full
I'd give you more but you know that there's nothing
Hardly get any sleep at all
I'll tell you what, what's to tell
It's the world not a call I can screen out
Don't kill your partner 'fore the dancing's started
Kill the path of the ritual",Unsound,2002
The Headstones,"I got a gal who lives on the wrong side of town
I know what I like and man you know I sure know how
It's the other side, another place
I like it here, no accounting for taste
I can't think of nothing when I'm with her
But the wind and the rain and the cemetery dirt

Went down to the cemetery looking for love
Got there and my baby was buried, I had to dig her up

18,000 miles across nowhere land
I'm scratching and I'm spitting, there ain't nobody listening,

The Headstones,"Good for me for a time
All hell's cubically contained
Staunched and bottled
Pressed and altered
And at the ready for the reigns
The first tiny little shadows
Of my creepy little thoughts
Inhabit all that matters 
And I lose by default

And I'll never promise anything again 
And I'll never promise anything again
And I'll never promise anything again

I've set a dozen 12 step traps
But they've slid by everyone
I never catch the little bastards
I really do with that they'd own up
Those paranoid little fuckers
Take their paranoid little time
And when the mood rolls in
They're bank robbin'
And I'm a hostage who will drive

And I'll never promise anything again

Now I can only do so much
And I will never deviate
I hear myself take a deep breath
And think I must have wanted it this way
I remember all those little traps
I could not keep them in place
They were never stationed anywhere
They were terrorized and maimed

So tonight I've set a vigil
And my shadows all that's cast
And the iron that's encased it
Is doing all that one could ask

And I'll never promise anything again 
And I'll never promise anything again",Cubically Contained,2014
The Headstones,"If you look away even for a second
It's bound to break your back and leave you with the wreckage
Just a rolling pouring poison down that throat
With no concern about reaching for any goals
Maybe if I make it home tonight
Not to get torn apart or knifed in a fistfight
At night awake alive I'm barely functioning
And there is no regard for tomorrow's sting
(I don't think I can contain myself)
Look away - the memories they stay
Look away - 'til the whole thing fades
Poking holes in whatever comes near ya
Just because you need to nobody dared you
You had it all in the back of your Ford
Went through the windshield left the pills on the floor
Look away - the memories they stay
Look away - never learn anything

I'm bound to kick your ass and leave you with the wreckage
You got one eye open the other's always hid

The Headstones,"Thinking of swinging from a thread
Coiled tightly around my neck
Will an exposed pipe hold the weight of fears
Thinking of jumping from this spot
Well it's 52 stories 'til I hit the mark
Will the concrete waiting absorb the strain of the years
Bright lights are flashing, they hold me to my spot
I've got 2 seconds to get away or 52 until I drop
Well the whole thing is swinging it's a vicious and ugly curve
Electrocution where I lay
The taps are running and the radio plays
Will the water rolling absorb the strain of the shock
Shake that carcass, well that used to be your life
Before it consummates its love with an exposed pipe
Will the water rolling absolve you from all the things that you're not
If you really want to do it, do it slow
Real pain is the only way to go
You've got to savour the flavour
Self-destruction's a most attainable game
Pick yourself up, develop an addiction
Alcohol's a good one combined with sports, hunting, and fishing
Whole thing is vicious it's a most peculiar game
Shake that carcass, while it's hesitating
Before it consummates its love with the concrete waiting
Don't fool yourself into a quick and foolish end
If you're happy with your life
Roll over kiss your children and then your wife
And say
Jesus Christ I'm glad I never have thoughts like that

The Headstones,"Three angels setting a table for me tonight
They know my face
They set a place for me tonight
Well I can't disappoint them
So I guess I'll join them
They've been waiting on me forever
I've been down on earth and in this town
Man there's got to be something better

New suit, New tie
Real nice service for me when I die
New suit, cufflinks, and a new tie
Real nice service for me when I die

That's the thing about living
When you get there
You're seldom forgiven

The Headstones,"Tweeter and the Monkey Man
Were hard up for cash
They stayed up all night
Selling cocaine and hash

To an undercover cop
Who had a sister named Jan
For reasons unexplained
She loved the Monkey Man

Tweeter was a Boy Scout
'Course he went to Vietnam
Found out the hard way
Nobody gives a damn

Thought that they'd find freedom
Just across the Jersey line
Hopped into a stolen car
Took Highway 99

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they standin'
Never saw them when they fell

The undercover cop
He never liked the Monkey Man
Even back in high school
Wanted to see him in the can

Jan got married at fourteen
To a racketeer named Bill
Made secret plans with the Monkey Man
From a mansion on the hill

It was out on Thunder Road
Tweeter at the wheel
Pulled into paradise
You could hear the tires squeal

It was Jan who'd told him many times
""It was you to me who'd taught
In Kingston everything's legal
As long as you don't get caught""

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they standin'
Never saw them when they fell

Some place by Rahway prison
They ran out of gas
The undercover cop cornered 'em
Said, ""You didn't think that this could last""

Jan jumped up out of bed
Said, ""There's some place I gotta go""
She took the gun out of the drawer
And said, ""It's best that you don't know""

An ambulance rolled up
State Trooper close behind
Tweeter took his gun away
And messed up his mind

The undercover cop was found
Face down in a field
The Monkey Man was on the bridge
Using Tweeter as a shield

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they standin'
Never saw them when they fell

The town of Jersey City
Is quieting down again
I'm sitting in a gambling club
Called The Lion's Den

The TV set is blown up
Every bit of it is gone
Ever since the night
When they showed
That the Monkey Man was on

Maybe I'll go to Florida
Set myself some sun
There ain't no more opportunity here
And everything's been done

Sometimes I think of Tweeter
Sometimes I think of Jan
Sometimes I don't think about nothin'
But the Monkey Man

And the walls came down
All the way to hell
Never saw them when they standin'
Never saw them when they fell

The Heartbreakers,"If you reach back in your memory
A little bell might ring
About a time that once existed 
When money wasn't king
If you stretch your imagination 
I'll tell you all a tale
About a time when everything
Wasn't up for sale

There was this cat named Johnny
Who loved to play and sing 
When money wasn't king

We'd all get so excited
When John would give a show 
We'd raise the cash between us
And down the road we'd go
To hear him play that music 
It spoke right to my soul 
Every verse a diamond
And every chorus gold
The sound was my salvation
It was only everything
Before money became king

Well I ain't sure how it happened
And I don't know exactly when
But everything got bigger
And the rules began to bend
And they taught the people 
How to get their hair to shine
And how sweet life can be 
If you keep a tight behind
And they raised the cost of living
And could we have known
They'd doubled the price of tickets
To go see Johnny's show

So we hocked all our possessions
And we sold a little dope
And went off to rock and roll

We arrived there early
In time to see rehearsal 
And John came out and lip-synched
His new lite beer commercial
And as the crowd arrived
As far as I could see
The faces were all different
There was no one there like me

They sat in golden circles
And waiters served them wine
And they talked through all the music
And to John paid little mind
And way up in the nosebleeds 
We watched him on the screen
They'd hung between the billboards
So cheaper seats could see

Johnny rocked that golden circle 
And all those VIP's
And that music that had freed us
Became a tired routine
And I saw his face in close-up
Trying to give it all he had
And sometimes his eyes betrayed him
You could see that he was sad
And I tried to rock on with him
But I slowly became bored
Could that man on stage With everything
Somehow needed more?

There was no use in pretending
No magic left to hear
All the music gave me 
Was a craving for lite beer
As I walked out of the arena
My ears began to ring
And money became king",Money Becomes King,2018

Directed live from the 2-1-2, 7-1-8, and 5-1-6 area
Throughout borough to borough, state to state, world thorough wide

I ride, driving mass tracks to genocide
Verbal defender, the brain infiltrator
Break and fracture a sucka emcee's ""structal"" delegator
The pen and the pad and the microphone get blessed

With Nest, with ease now how I digress
Brothers are getting busy grabbing Teks while I apex
Verbal backshots coming without the latex
Watch the caption spin as the wax begin

How I'm rapping in to hit the backspin
Now end first verse in the blend
Herbalise to Resource done done it again

[Chorus: x2]
One of the three the Natural are-e to the source
In the b-l-e-n-d
City to city (state to state)
Borough to borough
NYC to worldwide rock thorough

See me and rhymes alike
Tooth to picks
Sides to kicks
Chops to sticks

Seas to sicks
Hard Mr. Bricks
Chest to Vicks
Corruption to politics

Sticks to stones
Stones to sticks
Not opposites flips
Cheese to cakes

Beefs to steaks
Bones to breaks
Decks to tapes
Good food to plates

Movies to dates
Cities to states
Odes to papes
Shaking MCs off their mics like earth to quakes

And now the hand of fate dealt me the higher intellect
Connect verbs, dissect words down to lecterns
W serves as the first repetition
H lines and curves take second position

A plays the third
The fourth brings the T
So hit two times so you get ummmmmmm
One of the three Natural are-e to the source

In the b-l-e-n-d

[Chorus: x2]

My verbal attacks react to mental stimulation
I'm leaving gaping contusions caused by lyrical abrasion
No pausing, no waiting
I play the plus and starting to get in, shining like the sun

Lyrical patterns double up on the one
Like the name when expose the flame
I combust like aerosol or kerosene contained
Deaf ears turn the conversation severed

I set it off like Lateef and getting
Debted, forget it, it only happens because you let it
I move, swift tongue sliced crews beheaded
I said it again so let the repetition end

I'm sittin sippin soda realizin that it's over 

My feelings he couldn't reciprocate til October 

But he's the one I want to lay my head upon his shoulder 

And keep it warm cause it's just about to get colder 

But I said I wouldn't see him, nor would I touch him 

He says he misses much and pursue per sound to suction 

through the phone, I try to hit the dialtone to clear the mess up 

or fess up, and say I'll be there soon just clear your rest up 

I can't dismiss it, no matter how much I just can't resist it 

And now he's tellin me he finally wants to be committed 

I can't call it, without me playin myself to fall for it 

Scannin my mind to see how much time I can stall 

or it can blow up, other kissings affect like anisthetic 

It's never as good as the first time and you never do forget it 

Feeling pathetic, but I quote it like someone said it 

If you really love it then you should just let it, go.. 



Let it go, let it flow 

Move on with your life and act like you know 

Been on my last breathe, been between life and death

Three times this year I've seen my people go to violent action 

that could have been avoided without negative instigation 

Goin on, off at the mouth, with foul verbal interaction 

Inevitably ending up with one or more gunshot patients 

I guess it's not a virtue anymore and scores gotta be settled 

with steel or real ain't even in the flesh and don't feel 

But eighteen feet of soil was dug out 

Three brothers lives was struck out 

Cause you wanted to be down, but without catchin a body you stuck out 

Hey, what goes around is ultimately what you get 

Sometimes good people and bad things mix 

Sometimes you got to fix the way you live 

I give my life to bring back family and friends 

But I don't control that I know that mine's precious til the end 

I leave my lifecourse to the greater knowledge of the creator 

And if it's time to go, I won't hold back, I'll just let it, go.. 

Let it flow, if it's meant to come back then it shall do so 



Let it go, let it flow

At thirteen I watched ghetto gold turn to green 

and get crushed, through this undramatical street scene 

When all my peoples like to whyle out 

wearin the low style out 

One night we stood in front of Homebase 

watched the club file out 

Mad people started runnin, that was the end of fun and 

one nigga stand in be	-boy stance, holdin his gun and 

started shootin, pollutin the curbside with shells 

Yellin buggin out cause someone stepped on his Gazelles 

or Asics, whatever it was, money's beef was basic 

It's tragic the way people takin anger and misplace it 

Now, mad are my peoples wearin scars and stitches 

cause niggaz choose to play the role of actin like bitches 

Don't take it hard, if it's not you, act like you know

The Herbaliser,"Woke up at 7:30 early in the morning last week 
Sun shining in my face, I wiped away the sleep 
From my eyes, from the beginning, oh shit, what do you know 
Two guys standin' with guns at my bedroom window 
I played it cool, peeped the tools they carried in they hand 
Two three-fifty-seven Mags and one on the bed stand 
I had my, piece under the pillow cause that's just how I do 
Started to reach for it, but then I guess they knew 
One nigga started laughin' and turned to his man 
He said, ""I don't think that she knows about this plan"" 
His man, just smiled, and nodded his head 
Aimed his gun at me and said, ""Get out of the bed"" 
I complied, with his wishes, bent down, to grab my slippers 
Nigga number one said, ""Hey now, no funny business 
Just, do what we say and everything'll be cool 
You'll hear a lot of things today but that's the number one rule"" 
I said, ""What the fuck is this shit, all about? 
We can discuss the problem and y'all, can break the fuck out"" 
Nigga number one said, ""That we not able to do 
But there's a tape deck on your table with a message for you"" 
It said: follow niggaz one and two's instructions carefully 
Or fucked up things will happen if you dare to be 
A heroine, these orders come straight from 
The President, of the American, People 
Then the tape just stopped, I looked at my watch 
Niggaz one and two had they guns up cocked 
And said, ""It's time to go, grab your things and get ready 
In thirteen minutes we all gotta be jetti, c'mon.."" 

Sitting in the, back of a van, with cuffs on my hands 
Six secret service men in black, one nigga in tan 
Who's driving? For three hours, we've been riding to 
Route 33, to a very small island and unloaded 
Niggaz one and, two at my side 
Number one glaring at me for the whole damn ride 
They seem to, travel in silence, express themselves in violence 
And I'm the target, shoving me back and forth 
With very very big guns 
What would you do in this situation? 
No place to run in the remote location 
Kept my patience, and stuck to the tape's advice 
Knew my crew could find me with the Negro Tracking Device 
I wasn't worried, but niggaz one and, two hurried 
They stepped, to the door, where the President was kept 
Punched in a passcode, I watched the door slide open inside 
Stood there we, and the President arose 
And my people said, ""Drop the guns, hop in your van 
Get the fuck off the island or we cappin your man"" 
The secret service men ran, what could they do? 
There's a lesson - never ever fuck with me and my crew 
Check it

The Herbaliser,"To become aware of my own sensuality,
I first become fully aware of my own tactile sense.
In dim light, I close my eyes and remove my clothes.

Do I lose his respect for being so wild?
Hardly. He treats me like a rare and precious jewel.
And he goes through the day proud of the fact, that with me,
He is the world's most imaginative lover.

Men pick amazing places for sexual adventure.
The wildest adventure proposed to me was in a bathtub which was full of Jello!
All I could think of, was how many boxes it would take?
What would be the most alluring colour?
The most delicious flavour?
And how could that affect our oral explarations?
If the Jello gets firm, would I bounce?

As you look around for what's new and different,
Remember these three important weapons that should be learned to keep a man in love.
Imagination, sensitivity to his moods and desires,
And the courage to experiment with new sexual techniques,
Enticing situations and places.

Lovemaking is physical, and so its its language.
Suck, cock, fuck, and prick, are not bad words.
Used in the bedroom by lovers to describe parts of the body,
And physical activities,
They are very proper indeed, and they distinctly enhance sex.
Overhaul a prudish attitude.
Don't whistle and stick up your nose, at least, not up in the air.",The Sensual Woman,1999

You crazy)

I don't claim that Shan's the epitome
Your rhymes can't ban so you can't get rid of me
Line after line has a cause and effect
But I first test the mic with the 1-2 check
The hip-hop world made the Juice Crew orphans
Gained our respect sealin up much coffins
We're all obligated to Juice Crew Laws
You'se a perk if you let a man take yours
Number 2 is not to follow, yo, you must set trends
And if you ain't down with us, you can't be friends
Many of my so-called boys just flipped
But the thrill of it all - you're on the tip
Glad there is no tricks
On ours so hard we wrote your name on out
Mix after mix every record we make
To prepare or scare, so I dare you to take
Any part of the rhyme or the kickdrum sound
I be meetin you, defeatin you and beatin you down
My name rings bells and make rappers petrol
God help you, kid, when I get upset, yo
???????? bid your fans farewell
Cause the chance of you winnin is like snowin in hell
My rhymes are more than a tasket, a tisket
Too clever, yo, I never go out like a bisquit
Don't try to take my spot and not be legit
Try to vic my shoes and your feet won't fit
You're good, but compared to me you're not nearly
You think you can serve me? Come on, really
Till I can't breathe, yo, I'ma be with it
When I hear three words, you got it, I get it
My style is wild but strong and you're temporary
Violate the Juice Crew Laws and I bury
???? to the land a piece of tranquility
Suckers have the nack but they lack my ability
Those who tried to dis in the days behind us
Are back gonna dis us, brother, sign up
Make the mistake and I'm breakin your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

Never too alert, but I'm always cautious
And if you were on it you would save for some Porsches
Suckers get paid by means of distortion
My rhymes ??? your mind by means of a fortune
Rhymes clear and ????, time can't fly on
Mic, what you bring on stage you'll die on
Sit back and watch your life ???? and
If rhymes were juice I'd be Con Edison
???????????? accustomed
A sucker tried to snatch my chain and I bust him
I didn't cuff him and read him no rights
I knocked out his service and turned outs his lights
Be a ??????, don't let your boys divert you
Soup you up to battle me, kid, and I hurt you
Superior intellect made me a phenomenon
And I can go on and on and on and on
You can be blind but my rhymes still focus
And sucker tried to violete Law and I broke his
???????? tapes and his compact discs
And his boys stood around sayin (yo, he dissed you, kid)
Straight up, and I flip while a hype man 
Cuts you to pieces without puttin a knife in
You won't bleed, it feels the same
Now answer me right, boy, what's my name?

Guaranteed to decipher the mice from the men though
Now that I have the power make a refinement
Revealin the snakes is my next assignment

So I'm ?????? you can't play ?????

Queen, couldn't even jack Monk

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crabs test, can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three X-L kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

The Herd,"Out of the land of shadows and 
Darkness, we were returning 
Towards the morning light 
Almost in reach of places I knew 

Escaping the ghosts of Yesterday 
You were behind me following 
Closely 
""Don't turn around now"" 

I heard you whisper in my ear 
""If you should turn now, 
All that you won 
Will vanish just like a passing dream. 

Just on the very verge of the 
Morning, daylight was dawning, 
Freedom was but a step away 
Now with the deep dark river 

Behind us, 
What could go wrong if I stayed 
Strong in mind. 
What was the sudden lapse into 

Madness, what was the urge that 
Turned my head around to look at you? 
What was the stubborn will 
To destroy the love and the joy 

I nearly held? 
Three times the thunder roared 
In my ears 
In all of my years I'll see that lost 

Look in your eyes. 
As, with a sigh like smoke in the wind 
You slipped from my grasp into 
The waiting shadows 

So much I longed to say, 
But my touch found only the 
Empty air and a black nights 
Coldness.

And never again I can reclaim you.",From the Underworld,1968

The Herd,"Mum and dad and Danny saw the passing out parade at Puckapunyal
It was a long march from cadets
The sixth battalion was the next to tour and it was me who drew the card
We did Canungra and Shoalwater before we left

And Townsville lined the footpaths as we marched down to the quay
This clipping from the paper shows us young and strong and clean
And there's me in me slouch hat with me SLR and greens
God help me 
I was only nineteen

From Vung Tau riding Chinooks to the dust at Nui Dat
I'd been in and out of choppers now for months
And we made our tents a home, V.B. and pinups on the lockers
And an Asian orange sunset through the scrub

And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And night time's just a jungle dark and a barking M.16?
And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?
God help me
I was only nineteen

A four week operation, when each step can mean your last one on two legs
It was a war within yourself
But you wouldn't let your mates down 'til they had you dusted off
So you closed your eyes and thought about somethin' else

And then someone yelled out contact, and the bloke behind me swore
We hooked in there for hours, then a God almighty roar
And Frankie kicked a mine the day that mankind kicked the moon
God help me 
He was goin' home in June

And I can still see Frankie, drinkin' tinnies in the Grand Hotel
On a thirty-six hour rec. leave in Vung Tau
And I can still hear Frankie, lying screaming in the jungle
'Til the morphine came and killed the bloody row

And the Anzac legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears
And the stories that my father told me never seemed quite real
I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel
God help me 
I was only nineteen

And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?
And why the Channel Seven chopper chills me to my feet?
And what's this rash that comes and goes
Can you tell me what it means?

The Herd,"""My dearest Grandma"" was the way he always started the letter,
It wasn't the only occasion he wrote to keep it together,
""Thank you for the birthday present, it'll really come in handy
I'm writing quietly, 'cause I hope you're not angry,
Mum and Dad are yelling at each other, like every night,
Like every night, I end up locking my door and I write.
Would you please be able to visit, and maybe make 'em make up?
I'd hate to think that it was me that made my parents break up.
Next year I'll be in high school, I'm pretty nervous, actually,
Though I know it's common, I don't want no broken family.
It's my fault, and I don't like it here,
And it's my fault, and now my little brother's in tears,
And Gran, I hope you're not mad, I swear I'll try to be good,
Cause Mum and Dad'll get along much better when I'm being good""
Signin' it, ""Love, your Grandson"", quietly he stored it in the cupboard
With the others, and tightly held his brother, he was...

[Chorus]
Under pressure, I'm heating up.
Under pressure, calm, but it's all front.
Under pressure, boiling point has come

Fast forward twelve years, and he's been out of home for seven,
Never really understood the way he carried it all with him,
Even years later, he hated things gettin' too heated,
Whole section of his history he tried to delete.
New school, new city, reason justified his leaving,
He couldn't leave his guilt seeing his mother's spirit beaten,
She was bleeding, eyes streaming, he had to depart,
Frightened sunken-eyed kid became the life of the party,
Only been in town a term, social life like a soap star,
Still wrote his grandmother the occasional postcard,
""Doin' fine, working hard"", he thought that she'd be relieved,
And perhaps a little proud of all the things he'd achieved.
HD's and team captain, a prize in his class,
A string of love affairs, but never close enough to see the scars,
Kept the cards to his chest, stressed to less and conflict,
Between the lines, his Grandma, only one who heard his bomb tick, he was...

[Chorus]

""Child, I miss you greatly, haven't got many letters lately,
I just wrote to let you know that it's OK to show when you're under pressure.
Though I never really needed to explain this is true,
I see a lot of your dear father when I'm looking at you.
He worked hard, and enjoyed inebriation,
And really, that's a trait that doesn't skip a generation.
Once removed, I see clearer than most, dear boy,
I see though your illusions, boy,
All life's lessons are under pressure.""

Now he's old enough to know better, looking through those old letters,
That he's never sent, he's sure the past is omnipresent,
He won't resent the sum total of experience,
From delirious days, to some so serious.
""Never got those letters, but be sure that I'm hearing this"".
They're really just signposts, landmarks, clippings,
Some repetitive themes, like record players skipping.
He has torn off the layers and always found something different
Inside him, tiny sparks like stars colliding,
And they let him live again, he's never giving in,
And without those few friends that always meant well,
It might have never got to ""all's well that ends well"",
Pen fell, swiftly, why he's writing now is still a mystery,
Has the feeling history forgotten tends to repeat,
So some nights before sleep, he writes to keep it in his sights,
And when it's close enough to touch, he lets fly,
Just to get by, by any means, to walk the path of many dreams,
The penny seems to fall at the very last moment,
The ability to love is like the vast ocean,
And with lead-lidded focus, he writes the last lines of this one,
And signs off, ""With love, your Grandson"".",Under Pressure,2005

When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!

When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!

The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.

Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 
the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,

So lock the doors
And call me yours

So I-a picked you-a.

Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle

Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She's funny that way.

She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

And my caution was leaving you flat,
I should have made use of the tonic
Before you gave me that!
A mental deficient you'll grade me.
I've given you plenty of data.
You came, you saw and you slayed me,
And that-a is that-a!

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all.
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will,
You've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me!
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow.
So what's the use,
You've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me!

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear.
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near.

Here am I with all my bridges burned,
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned,
So lock the doors
And call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

It must go to someone, of course;
It can't be a sister or brother

And left me alone for a filly,
So I-a picked you-a.

The High & Mighty,"(Mr. Eon)
Yeah uhh
What it look like? Mad Skillz
Uhh Mr. Eon (The Mighty Mos Def)
The Mighty Mos (the E.C. Rawkus connection)
Coast to coast (from '88 to '99)
What? What? What? What?

It's on fire tonight
Everything on my side is lookin' alright
It's high power original, b-boy traditional
Raw bass material, huh, when individual
True brand imperial you're hearin' on your stereo
Transcribe the live, the Mos, Def init-ial
Sit BACK, and listen, you ain't, in no position
To deal with my conditional mentally and physical
Strength is indivisible, crews be comin' pitiful
Speech be sound typical, downfall habitual
Ock, I'm not feelin' you; don't know what your label
Tellin' you or what magic beans they sellin' you
I can flow, you can't though, example
Of a cat who just a modern day Sambo (yeah)
Who be bitchi'n out to A&R demands so
You can collect your little petty cash advance HOE
You knock-kneed and sloppy, but not me
I'm I-N-D, E-P-E, N-D-E-N-T

[Chorus]
It was a jam at the center, and the party was shakin'
And the poppers was poppin', and the breakers was breakin'
And it won't be long til everybody know that
B-boys rock the document! (document)

Yo, yo, you on the injured, I'm hot to death
I'm foul, plus I'm winnin', you think I shot the ref?
Rock a vest if you out of turn speakin'
'Cause I'm right there like nightmares;
I catch MC's while they sleepin'
I'm back these rap cats is wildin'
Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

[Chorus]

I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do
Hip-Hop's Cleon Jones, when Eon Jones
Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless
Stereo stompin' defeatin' me is like
Latrell chokin' up John Thompson, Charles Bronson
Had a Death Wish for this next to left shit
Leavin' all these hot air MC's breathless

The High & Mighty,"Intro:
Girl: Soon you'll have a band
Mr. Eon: It's just my voice and this hand
Girl: That's what hip hop was and still stands
Eon: What
Girl: Soon you'll have a band
Eon: It's just my voice and this hand
Girl: That's what hip hop was and still stands
Eon: Cause
Girl: We don't have a band
Eon: It's just my voice and this hand
Girl: That's what hip hop was and still stands
Girl: We don't have a band
Eon: It's just my voice and this hand
Girl: That's what hip hop was and still stands

Verse 1:
Death to the mic, Starbuck's on arrival
Raised in Illadel where I wrecked the recital
Introduced Jack Daniels to Mary Jane
Now they dating in my body, shit ain't the same
Your petty thinking cat need training like Amtrak
Can't stand that, need to abandon that
Catch a random violent act, over a phantom track
With zoot suits and Hammer pants, we ain't wearin' that
Swearin' that they nice, when I'm vastly, more nasty
Trashy, trying to be all cute and dashing
To alien crafts, I'm unabductible
My visionary path is unobstructible
With the dope we on, Ma look like a Pokemon
Arsenic laced lyrics that you choking on
Catch my illest tale up on story boards
Like my latest smorgasbord with 40 whores

Chorus:
High & Mighty nicest, too hot spittable
Mr. Eon's frequency's untrasmittible
Come around the way, we don't act hospitable
Can't see us, so on stage we invisible
(Repeat)

Verse 2:
Killed Billy Blanks with Tae-Bo, puffin' hydro
But guess what kids?, I wasn't even high though
A thousand thirty words can't describe my sturdy turds
Absurd, like 30 nerds doing the Dirty Bird, in Atlanta
Trash, skidded up Pampers
Looking like some old washed up exotic dancers
Trains get sprayed like high schoolers these days
They don't listen to hip hop, they checkin' Green Day
My unexpectedness is like the '69 Mets
My 69 wets on my Penthouse pets
A mic, better snatch it
Record, gotta scratch it
A loop, better catch it
The blunt, better ash it
Who want to see me erupt?
Like I had beans, tacos, pizza and Chinese for lunch
Watch me daydream about Tyra's vagina
Take a VH to it, catch me in the all nighter

Chorus

Verse 3:
I'm the illest one, I'll smoke L's for 50 years
Catch emphysema, then sue Phillie Blunts
Really stunts, no need for elaborate tactics
Just lick your lips and presto!, it's my mattress
Electrocute you in wet clothing articles
Send your air particles to the Antarcticas
With no bubble Nauticas, no fleeces
More popular in Brooklyn than Pee Wee Reese is
More infamous in L.I. than Colin Ferguson
More hated Uptown that Mayor Rudy son
I'm David Berkowitz, when I be spurtin' this
Son of Sam on this here diagram
Fuck immaculate conception, I was Anakin's dad
Took the book to Amsterdam, now the Vatican's sad
See my, boys are nuts ill ploys on cuts
Your Mattels can't swell, you be Toys'are'Us

Chorus

Outro:
Yes indeed, too hot
The spittablest, Mr. Eon
Yes indeed, Dick Starbuck

Keep my feet in anus MC's so much they stop shittin 

The Sugar Box, called crotch, for Cage prints 

Leave pussy glowin orange in a spin like dioxins 

My man's truck crashed, the radiation plant burned 

Spit ran out, lit up like Green Lantern 

Bentley on the wrist, while I'm drinkin Sunkist

From big city to outback, somebody's gettin cornered 

And my steez got my old seeds suicidal abortin shit 

Even cheerleader from a player present 

Stuck this hooker with broken glass

Pissed in her mouth and lit her stomach for a while 

Kicked her in the ass while she gave birth to a crystal

I'm tellin you girl, I got a tough pill to swallow 

Like Killamanjaro, been in there

I hope to grab up pirates just like a Pharaoh 

and I wobble too much, for the straight and narrow 

But on this mic, I be a pleasant surprise 

Like seein shaved pussy right in front of your eyes 

Intriguing, your empty words have no meaning 

You need Vivarin if you gonna keep sleeping

Then I stick my fingers in the fuckin mouth of critics 

Ahhh, day in the life of Agent Orange mad E.T. 

Paraphanelia, try all local twats in the area

Take it out on my mom's dome with legs and arms bound

The High & Mighty,"Weed, weed, what a relief
Where will my eighth a day habit cease?
This an agricultural service announcement
You can treat it, and you can douse it
Let us begin now with the plant
The way that it gets to your blunt in hand
See the herb doesn't grow fast enough for man
So for his lye, he makes a master plan
He has bowls to make the weed grow quicker
Through the hydroponic, the weed gets sicker
Twenty-one different soils are dumped
Into the pot in one big lump
So just before it dies, it dries
In my back closet, with no moss and flies
Off with the bud, we cut it, weigh it, and bag it
And there it is for your local street addict
Green and buddy, an ounce condensely packed
Smoke it up and catch a heart attack
Now come on now man let's be for real
You are what you smoke is the way I feel but
The weed and blunt administration'll
Have you thinkin' lye is the perfect combination
See heads be livin' under fear and stress
Wonderin' where they get the best
Now beer and bless can become a part of you
In your cells and dome, this is true
So when the plant is grown, believe it
Sell some to your man or smoke for free kid
Roll it up, and begin seasonin'
Then you sit down, and begin seein shit
In your body, Blackwoods, a Phillie, a Dutcher
All the need and fiend for another
See any smoke's addictive by any man
Even the brownish rag it's all the same
The alchemist'll have my ass, strung out
On the indo and Northern Lights no doubt
Think you got your weed habit on lock?
Tell yourself you gonna try and stop
Smokin' weed and you'll see you need the tree
It's the number one drug on the street
Not coke, cause that's a category of dope
But the green leaf, that I smoke with wreath
Now herb brings life and real bad breath
Smoke all your shit and what you got left?
Absolutely high, the sedative
Watchin' the movie Friday, with a spliff
By Chris Tucker, that high motherfucker
For anybody, Northern or Southerner
See how many blunts we gotta pump up fatter?
How many seeds gotta fall in the batter?
How many chickens want to smoke what you smoke?
And how many heads ask for just one toke?
Now they'll consume, the local dread could care less
He'll sell you donkey shit and say it's fresh
For ninety-nine, you suckers!

Come a little tighter, pull the all-nighter... --the high and the mighty--
Taste this delicious, mystic malicious
Ridiculousness, I tease like my snippets
I strip this down to the core and explore
Many more want what I have in store
For you, in this era, this mic's still a terror
My scripts consist of printed parchness
I gave the apple to eve and she ate it
Built the pyramids and the sphinx, and now you fuckin hate it
Co-create the reborn, keep this mic torn
My defense is tight like jason sehorn
On these corn on the cobs, lop for pop, now they popcorn
Plus I got a bucket of em, so stick it to em
Bring ruckus to em, slip the ducats to em
Still they gettin ruined when I bring my touch to em
Can't feel my shit no matter what I say

For more than funs and guns, I'm stressed on gettin sex
Yo I take it as it comes, on most occasions
I like my heart, chimes, and organ
But this is for your heartbeats twelve in the morning
Never tense, I rock the flossy, fly shit from tchaikovsky
Don't drink so I get bent when I sip bacardi
Spark this party, no question
Never caught wearin guess, and
Seldom lose when I got my chips on the table
Go against the oz, and face the wizard
So play that evil shit then come short, get the blizzard
Why is it you be buildin worlds that's fake and useless?
Heads pretend they hard, yo their favorite movie's lukas
Now you focused like ? caught locusts
This style's covered like rakim's, I ain't no joke, this
Flow is out of control like rap in fact

And shoot at will shoot to kill with lyrical skills

But in my trunk there's straight bumps like that
And just a licensed nba spalding notebook, that looks phat

Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted Father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born
Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins
A brand new pair of brogues, rattlin' o'er the bogs

Started by daylight me spirits bright and airy
Took a drop of the pure

At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city
Well then I took a stroll, all among the quality
Bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'

Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

From there I got away, me spirits never falling
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, played some funny rigs
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling
When off Holyhead wished meself was dead
Or better far instead

Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's isle they began abusing
""Hurrah me soul!"" says I, me shillelagh I let fly
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in
With a loud ""Hurray!"" joined in the affray

The air smelled like roses
I flew my big black balloon
As an accountant, over the city
Staring straight at the moon

Then all my friends quit smoking
Saying an ill wind had set in
None of us can win

I started drinking in city gymnasiums
Hanging out with the guys
Now all the streets are empty
No one calls I'm eating in apricots from tins

Get in the car
No

The dumbest thing I've ever heard

The living church must move along
The Carmelites could use a song
A blessing father if you please
Help the hopeless in their need
They don't need this kind of sleaze

Checking in and checking out
Why be shy when you can kick the can and shout?

Here's a man who's run the marathon
Sad and lonely, now it's been and gone
Let me check upon my family
I wonder, do they still remember me
I'm on the run, on the fun run

True collectors must collect

Dodgy sculptured license plates

To the misery you left for me

You should go if you wanna leave
I know when you're six feet deep

So I'll make it easy

I'll pick up the most beautiful coffin for you
To send you on your way
And I'll douse it with gasoline
To make sure when you leave this place
That you leave it up in flames

When the smoke fills your lungs
And your body starts to decay, oh
And you blend into the earth
I hope it hurts, I hope it hurts you
Like you hurt me first

You had everything you needed
But you walked around so jaded
With a heart as hard as pavement breathes
Through cracks unseen

Death will feel natural
Then you'll see all your pipe lit dreams
Won't become reality 'cause they're out of your league

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' ""

Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

The Highwaymen,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman,1985
The Highwaymen,"This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets
On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer
And his dreams of tomorrow, surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the 7th when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis Lamour has told us his tale
Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him
And wish to God, we could have ridden his trail

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz

Rode there on a big steam train.
Lost two fenders in the steel wheels,
And I ain't goin' back again. 

I fought for my country,
Lord knows I did my best.
Crawlin' cross some foreign field,
They pinned a ribbon to my chest.

Night's rollin' in, it's cold as sin,
Here on the welfare line. 

Served on a Georgia road gang,
Couldn't pay the debts I owed.
'Cos I ain't made of silver,
And I ain't ever seen no gold.

I still remember Rachel,
Soft as a velvet gown.
They laid her in a pauper's grave,
On the other side of town.

And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream was back downstream Cavortin' in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis but she just walked up the block
Raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

They'll never get the best
Of better men

I make a livin' dealin' cards

Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from

Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books, one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs

In a crystal sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one loved to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole live saving souls
When he looked at me his blood ran cold
He didn't even try

I had no dreams, I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
The warden asked, “How come you killed that man”
I said, “I don't know why”

Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one prays for life
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my mortal soul be blessed
By someone close to me

He came to me with trembling hands
He swore he'd never understand
I said it's just what life had planned
It's destiny

Don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
I chose the dark, you chased the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

We gathered round the room, you sang yours and I sang mine
We took turns with the guitar, in the front and center seat
Shel and Kris and Dylan, and a couple off the street

Joni Mitchell cried on, ""Both Sides Now""
We sang songs that made a difference and we can again somehow
Everybody knew that this was quite a special night
Graeme Nash was nervous in the hot seat, in the light

Joe South was total magic and we all walked in his shoes
Orbison and Rabbit cried and they rocked the country blues

June was pregnant with my boy
Oh, I could make a livin' drivin' nails or drivin' trucks
Sleep beneath the bridge or in the streets, down on my luck
I'd stand the cold and hunger, if they'd let me hear the songs

 Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

 Loads a mighty slow and soon I found out 
 It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out

 Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down 
 Shot the dog down, watched the man fall 
 Never touched his holster never had a chance to draw 
 The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed 
 Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said 
 Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man 
 Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

To lose more than he wins
Guess these trouble times get scary
But that's just ordinary

Never fallen to their knees

And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman Porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rail is all they feel

Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the city of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea

But all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues

The Highwaymen,"I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through
I've been busted for things that I did, and I didn't do
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that I've done

I've always been different with one foot over the line	
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane

The chances your taking loving a free living man
Are you really sure, you really want what you see
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be

The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.

Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!

For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.

Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.

Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,

The Highwaymen,"I was a highwayman.
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive.

I was a sailor.
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still.

I was a dam builder.
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tob that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around.

I fly a star ship.
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...",Highwayman [Live],2004

And under his knees was a ragin' black stallion,
And walkin' behind was a bay.

And his lips, they were sad and tight.
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside,
And his heart was heavy as night.

He's ridin' an' hidin' his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him,

An' watched as he passed her way.

Meant more to him than life.
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin',
Had ridden when she was his wife.

Now he had every right to call on me. 

Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy 
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune 
That picker there's in trouble boy 
Ain't nothin' but another side of you. 

If we ever get to heaven boys 
It ain't because we ain't done nothin' wrong 
We're in this gig together 
So let's settle down and steal each other's song. 

I found a wounded brother 
Drinkin' bitterly away the afternoon 
And soon enough he turned on me 
Like he'd done every face in that saloon. 

Well, we cussed him to the ground 
And said he couldn't even steal a decent song 
But soon as it was spoken 
We was sad enough to wish that we were wrong. 

Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy 
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune 
That picker there's in trouble boy 
Ain't nothin' but another side of you. 

I know that it sounds silly 
But I think that I just stole somebody's song 
She's a good timin' woman 
In love with a good two timin' man. 
And she loves him in spite of the way 
That she don't understand.

The Highwaymen,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning 
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt 
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert 
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes 
And found my cleanest dirty shirt 
Then I washed my face and combed my hair 
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day 

I'd smoked my mind the night before 
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking 
But I lit my first and watched a small kid 
Playing with a can that he was kicking 
Then I walked across the street 
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken 
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost 
Somewhere, somehow along the way 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone 
And there's nothing short a' dying 
That's half as lonesome as the sound 
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
And Sunday morning coming down 

In the park I saw a daddy 
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging 
And I stopped beside a Sunday school 
And listened to the songs they were singing 
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyon 
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday 

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned 
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone

The Highwaymen,"Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

[Chorus:]
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

We can have a bamboo hut and brandy in the tea
Leave your fat old mamma home, she never will say yes

My, my, yes
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When she walks along the shore, people pause to greet
White birds fly around her; little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love but I'm the only mortal man 
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne 
Don't rush me
 
All day, all night, Marianne
Down by the sea side siftin' sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside siftin' sand
 
When we marry we will have a time you never saw
I will be so happy I will kiss my mother inlaw

One for every palm tree and coconut

And here's how we'll greet ya
Stop fool, come off that beat ya
Feel dumb cause you're caught in the dark
(Ya lil' nuttin' ass mark)
Raise up, cause you cant' have it back
You said ""I ain't never got gaffled like that""
Off the end of the gat you choke
Short Dog's in the house ""Whattup loc?""

Gimme that bass, and don't try to run up
Cause you'll get banked somethin' sweet

Huh, and even if you're down with my crew
Yo Chuck man, I dodn't understand this man
You got to slow down*
I jack them too
And then we'll freak it
Kick that bass, and look what we did
Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil
And I keep stealin
Ice Cube'll make it funk
But right about now let's get up in the hump
But I don't party and shake my butt
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircurs
And it'll drive you nuts
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch
Like jackin' at night
Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin'
And it sounds so sweet
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats

Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it
Locate a dope break, and then I break it
And give it that gangsta lean
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass
I make punk suckers run and duck because
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi
So when I come to your town don't crowd me
'Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me
But I know, none of y'all can get with me
So you think you're protected
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove
'Cause suckers can't fade the Cube
And if I jack you and you keep comin'
I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!

Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to board this
Cos now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist
But I don't miss when it comes to this

I loved to play with my toys
And sit around and watch TV
Sometimes we'd go to the beach

I loved to go to the beach
Until an old man came to me
I said hey mister, why do you look so blue
He said it's nothing you just

Look like someone I once new
I said oh really as I looked into his eyes
Right then and there I knew this man would tell no lies
He said

I am a man of glory, I've got a million stories
If you would just listen to me
I've sailed across this ocean, given so much devotion
But just one thing has stayed with me, come here and see

We'd find a park with flowers
We'd sit and talk for hours
He taught me ancient history
He said

I used to be a great man
I traveled across this great land
Until an old man came to me
And said

I am a man of glory, I've got a million stories
If you would just listen to me

Been with all kinds of girls

But just one thing has stayed with me, come here and see
But now I am much older
My life has grown much colder
I only care about one thing

How can I make more money
Life's empty without money
And then a voice spoke out to me
And said

I am a man of glory, I've got a million stories

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds

He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?""

They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial

Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller
Thriller here tonight

(Rap performed by Vincent Price)
Darkness falls across the land
The midnite hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighbourhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

When Horton the elephant, Horton the Elephant
Horton the elephant heard a small noise

Help, help

So Horton stopped splashing, he looked toward the sound
“That's funny”, thought Horton, “There's no one around”
Then he heard it again, just a very faint yelp
As if some tiny person were calling for help

Help, help

“I'll help you”, said Horton, “But who are you and where?”
He looked and he looked, he could see nothing there
But a small speck of dust blowing past through the air

“I say, how confusing, I've never heard tell
Of a small speck of dust that is able to yell
So you know what I think? I think that there must
Be someone on top of that small speck of dust”

“Some poor little person who's shaking with fear
That he'll blow in the pool, he has no way to steer
He's alone in the universe”

“I'll just have to save him because after all
A person's a person no matter how small
A person's a person no matter how small”

So, gently and using the greatest of care
The elephant stretched his great trunk through the air
And he lifted the dust speck and carried it over
And placed it down, safe, on a very soft clover

If people ask us, “Can you speak Rhinoceros?”
We'd say, ""Of courserous, can't you?""

If we conferred with our furry friends, man to animal
Think of the all the things we could discuss
If we could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to us

If we consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we’d have asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions, walruses or sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be

We’d learn to speak in Antelope and Turtle
Our Pekingese would be extremely good
If we were asked to sing in Hippopotamus
We’d say “Whynotamous?”, and would

And I am sure every octopus, lobster and platypus
Certainly would see it as a plus
If we could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to us

We’d learn to speak in Antelope and Turtle
Our Pekingese would be extremely good
If we were asked to sing in Hippopotamus

If we all spoke like animals, who needs English?
Gradually, we'd drop it with no fuss

Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast

Mama used to warn me
Not to rush love with another
She said I'm not trying to lecture
I just care about my daughter
Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let
A man control my emotions
But when he smiles (when he smiles)
I feel like a little child
When he says

I am full blood boricua
Reads the tattoo on his arm (whoa, whoa)
He tells me, mami I need ya
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (so strong)

And what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world
But a part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it, can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I, let him take me to Puerto Rico
I can't hold back no more
Let's go tonight
Ooh, hey

You adore me, never be lonely, oh

I am full blood boricua (boricua)

No, I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the sign
That you can't wait to see me again

I stu-stu-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breath, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, ""Oh, she's just being funny""

The next time we hang out I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest till then
Whoa I, I can't wait to see you again, to see you again
