Bob Rockwell,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love. 
Love.",Prisoner of Love,1989
Bob Rockwell,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1990
Bob Rockwell,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",How Long Has This Been Going On?,1990
Bob Rockwell,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.",After You've Gone,1995
Bob Rockwell,"Three little words
Oh, what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
To hear those three little words
That's all I'd live for the rest of my days

And what I feel in my heart, they tell sincerely
No other words can tell it half so clearly
Three little words, eight little letters
Which simply mean I love you",Three Little Words,1995
Bob Rockwell,"Homesick tired All alone in a big city 
Why should ev'rybody pity me,
Nighttime's falling, folks are a singin',

Takes me back there where I belong 
How I'd love to be in mammy's arms

Bob Rockwell,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Bob Rockwell,"Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye bye blackbird

No one here can love or understand me

Bob Rockwell,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005
Bob Rockwell,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,2005
Bob Rockwell Quartet,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,1987
Bob Rockwell Trio,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,1989

Bob Roden,"When the wintry winds start blowing
And the snow is starting to fall
Then my eyes turn westward knowing
That's the place that I love best of all

California, I've been blue
Since I've been away from you.
I can't wait till I get going
Even now I'm starting in a call

California, here I come
Right back where I started from
Where bowers are flowers bloom in the spring
Each morning at dawning
Birdies sing and everything
A sun kissed miss said ""Don't be late!""
That's why I can hardly wait,
Open up that Golden Gate! 
California, here I come!

California, here I come, yeah!
Right where I started from
Where bowers are flowers bloom in the spring

Bob Rodriguez,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2005
Bob Rodriguez,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

Bob Ronald,"She sits alone, waiting for suggestions.
He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions.
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding.
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy,
Come on, sugar, let me know.
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me.
Come on, honey, tell me so.

He's acting shy, looking for an answer.
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together.
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further.
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother.
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment.
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant.

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy,
Come on, sugar, let me know.
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me.
Come on, honey, tell me so.

His heart's beating like a drum,
'Cause at last he's got this girl home.
Relax, baby. Now we're all alone.

They wake at dawn, 'cause all the birds are singing.
Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking.
Outside it's cold, misty, and it's raining.
They got each other. Neither one's complaining.
He says, I'm sorry, but I'm out of milk and coffee.
Never mind, sugar. We can watch the early movie.

Bob Rondinelli,"What can you hear? Can you believe it?
Should we remember all the words outta your mouth?
Livin' a lie, no guts, no glory
No sign to surrender, you're the devil in disguise

Expect no mercy
You are responsible
We're looking ahead
On the train to tomorrow

Oh
Catch your wounded pride
High above
In your tower of lies
Oh
You're on a never ending ride
High above
In your tower of lies

Bob Rowe,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it queer?

in my career?

Bob Rowe,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Bob Rowe,"There's nothing left for me of days that used to be
There's just a memory among my souvenirs

Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs

A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest
And though they do their best to give me consolation

I count them all apart and as the teardrops start
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs

I find a broken heart among my souvenirs",Among My Souveniers,2006
Bob Rowe,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know

Bob Rowe,"And when October goes
The snow begins to fly
Above the smokey roofs
I watch the planes go by

The children running home
Beneath a twilight sky
Oh, for the fun of them
When I was one of them

And when October goes
The same old dream appears
And you are in my arms
To share the happy years

I turn my head away
To hide the helpless tears
Oh, how I hate
To see October go

and our hearts sang on
Was it the spell of Paris,

In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Though I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Bob Saltmarsh,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Bob Sands,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1998
Bob Sawyer,"For weary weeks I waited
And hoping for the best
But blues will make me ramble
And the rails are leading west

I'm feeling oh, so lonesome
Pleasure I can't find
I'm leaving you mean mama
Just to worry you off of my mind

That old kindly whistle
Just fall in line and smile
Mean, my mama haunts me
And I crave the peace of mind

I don't know where I'm going
I'm feeling kind of square
I've been from several places
And I'm going to be from here

Seems there's something missing
There's feelings in my breath
I crave to cover distance
So mean mama give me wreath

I hear the rails a singing
The sky is clear and blue
I'm going to leave you mama
When the train comes rolling through

No money in my pocket
I'm roving around so flat
And soon I'll be strolling
Down that railroad track

And when I'm miles away
Riding all the while
I think of you mean mama
I think of you and smile

Bob Sawyer,"The sweetest girl in the world
Is my blue-eyed Jane
We fell in love like turtledoves
While the moon was shining down
I asked her then, I asked her when
Wedding bells would ring
She said, ""Oh, dear, it seems so queer
That this could happen here""

You are my little pal
And I never knew a sweeter gal
My little blue-eyed Jane
I love you so
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Just meet me in the lane
My blue-eyed Jane

Janie dear, listen here
I've come to say farewell
The world is drear without you, dear
But now I cannot linger here
I'm going away this very day
Oh please, come go with me
I'll be sad and blue wanting you
Longing all day through

My little blue-eyed Jane
You'll always be the same sweet thing
I know you'll never change
I love you so
And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again

Dusted off the spiders and cobwebs and used it
To fly on down to Cleveland for the weekend

And it's been so long since she didn't feel bad

Not spending all the time making people feel sad
No more now she's made up her mind
Put on that old dress and get herself looking real fine
All up in the club drinking Hennessey

Let your heart pound
Let the light in let the light in

The wicked witch walked in said show me what you got
The lion ran for cover and the tin man didn't move
That's when the band started playing this groove and

The next thing you know there was magic in the air
No one saw it coming it wasn't too clear
And the tin man said I don't know how to do this baby
Maybe you could show me how, she said

And they danced in the darkness on the floor
And the world kept spinning round
Like it's always done before
And all the people in club
Said they don't make a pretty pair

I'm doing exactly what I wanted to
And baby I don't even think about you anymore

Just thought I'd drop you a line
To let you know I was feeling fine
Cause honey it's been a long long time
Since you walked out my door

It took me some time I must confess
For a while there I was feeling less than my best
I had to get out of town so I headed out west
I ended up in Seattle

I thought I'd start a brand new band
I thought I might call it Lonelyland
Things got a little out of hand
I ended up hooked on heroin

So I ended up moving back over to Germany
Living with the folks baggin grocery's
But the time I had was mostly free
So I spent most of it drinking

I got myself in a jam or two
I guess it's what I had to do
Late at night I'd still think of you
And it felt like I was drowning

Till I met this girl at a discotheque
She was a dancer but not what you'd expect
She taught ballet and she was half-Czech half Chinese

But after she decided not to have the baby
She said she was gonna move back to Czechoslovakia maybe
By then I didn't really care I was either half drunk or half crazy

I got arrested once but never convicted
My parents eventually had me evicted
I tried your number but it'd been disconnected
I guess I should've known

I heard you got married and you moved away
I called your folks but where they wouldn't say
They said it's probably better that way so I just let it be

I moved back to Austin bout a year ago
I drive a schoolbus I don't drink no more
I go out every once in a while and see a show but mostly I just watch TV

So I don't know where I'm gonna send this letter
I doubt things are ever going to get much better

And a pocket full of pills she called her
And swore she's found salvation
But the hand grenades inside her
Where ready to explode
And the pins were pulled long ago
By sweet temptation

She found herself in New Orleans
With carnival of tears upon her veins
In the arms of strangers
When the lies where not enough
To hold back all the years of pain
She'd lie inside the danger and cry

I need me one more chance to fly away
And tonight I'm gonna fly away",Oklahoma,2001
Bob Schneider,"When your head falls off your neck
And hits the ground with a smack
And you're back on the wrong track
Where' your at when you lost you're head
Get out of bed that's what I said
And you're feeling like the dead seeing red
Reborn where's my porn
My pants are torn up damnit where's the wine
Put my body in a pine box baby
Bustin' clocks changin' my locks
I know the time it's time to get up
And get out and get over this
But I don't know how and I don't know why

And the world goes round
And the world goes around
And the world goes round round

When your bets been beat and they turn up the heat
And you feel a little weak and you can hardly speak
And the coconuts come to your house with a bomb
And blow up the cake you got from your mom
And your diapers aren't dry and the neighbors all die
And you feel a little high a little higher than the big blue sky
And you wring your hands and the blood pours out
And the blood pours out

When your friends evaporate and you can't catch a break
And you're tied to the stake and everything you hate
Comes crashing down on your big round
Golen greazy crown and you can't make a sound
And you feel like your drowning and you stumble through the dark
And the dogs start to bark and you're fired on a lark
And your skin starts to spark and you're burning up inside
And your dentures start to slide",Round and Round,2001

To where I want to be today 

But lonely ain't a word with me 
Absurd you see in crowded rooms 
That's where it hits me 
Splits me right in half and out spills the emptiness 
And no one wants to talk with someone 
Cut in two and blue acting werewolf crazy 
And hairdooed and out of control

Bob Schneider,"Soon Yin was a pilot in the nationally known
Amazing ladies of the outer ozone
She didn't have no kids, she didn't have no time
She was a woman of her word, she was a fighter of crime
She looked good in a hat, she had a natural way
With tools and no car she went to UCLA

And everybody said she was as crazy as a loon
When she was a girl she'd spend every afternoon
Sitting in her backyard pretending to be
A fighter ace in the Japanese military
She liked to make up her mind, she kept her feet in the air
She wore her heart on her sleeve 'cause she'd found it there

And it was all well and good until she met this young man
A young pilot named Steve with a beautiful tan
He spoke English and French and he swam like a swan
He had a mouth full of teeth and more style than Cézanne
He could talk to the bees, he could breathe in the air
He wore his heart on his sleeve 'cause he'd found it there

And they'd sit in the trees and they'd talk through the night
While the blind moon swam in the pale starry light
They talked and they crowed and they told what they knew
It was better than beer, it was all strange and new
There was grass all around, there was black up above
It was more than hello, it was something like love

And I don't know why life, it seems to be
So hard for dreamers like you and me
When love is, love is, love is everywhere

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

You've made me throw my old friend down

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade

Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong, we were runnin'
Against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searching
Searching for shelter again and again

Against the wind
A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind

Well those drifter's days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

He was too far from home

They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles

Higher and higher and higher they climbed

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face
That would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control
Night after night
Day after day
It went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA
Wondering if he could ever go home

There's another one down on Washington square

Down around there

The last one's a slug just for good luck

Between what you're told and what you've seen
You'll know that it's just another show

Everybody sells somethin'everybody's got game
We all keep believin' no one is to blame
The world keeps getting hotter, ice falls in the sea
We buy a bigger engine and say it isn't me
Between what we say and what we mean
It's clean far away from that machine

We talk on the phone because we're alone
And everyone knows it
We feel overdue, we want something new
And everyone knows it
It's time to join with the living, time to understand
We're all in this together, we've got to have a plan
We're facing an extinction every other day
There's got to be an answer, we've got to find a way

We learn what to keep and what to burn
Between what is fair and what's obscene

From a little Dixie Chicken to a Mississippi Queen, 

She spent her days a fishin' with a bamboo cane 
Every night skinny dippin' in the Pontchartrain
If you were living breatin', had two feet
You would be stalking that girl cause she looked so sweet

You could always find her when the night time fell, 
Drinkin' of a bucket from an old stone well, 
Drinking from her hand, 
Dancing to the moon, 
She don't look like her mother, nothing like her father, 
How else can you explain it must be something in the water.

The night she took me down to the riverside, 
She wrapped herself around me like a honey suckle vine
An let me have a taste of wild cherry wine
You could always find her when the nighttime fell 
Drinking of a bucket from an old stone well
Drinking from her hand 
Singing to the moon
She don't look like her mother

Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

We were young and strong, we were runnin'

Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worried about paying or even how much I owed
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searching
Searching for shelter again and again

Against the wind
A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter against the wind

Well those drifter's days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

There were no weeds here, no thorns at all
I was misguided, I was mislead
I asked for good but got evil instead

Come on, we're leaving, no time to waste

Saw my first pistol in a general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
I thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up, she didn't understand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol was the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and soon I found out
It will get you into trouble but it can't get you out
Bout a year later got a Colt 45
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why

Got into a card game in a crumbling town
Caught a miner cheating so I shoot the dog down
Shoot the dog down, watched the man fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man

I remembered thinking all of this must have a reason
I remembered thinking maybe I should look beyond

The night came on like thunder lightning split the purple skies
My whole day had been a journey sorting through the truth and lies
I remember searching longing for a deeper meaning
And it hit me like a diamond bullet right between the eyes

She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed

In her diamonds and frills

In those high rolling hills

See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control
Night after night, day after day it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA
Wondering if he could ever go home

It was giving him chills

From the brave, the bold, the battered heart of Chevrolet

Where the women kneel to pray

You're still damn good
No one's gotten to you yet
Everytime they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk

You always said
The cards would never do you wrong
The trick you said 
Was never play the game too long
A gambler's share
The only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

And you're still the same

Turning on the charm
Long enough to get you by

Janey was lovely she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio playing low
And the secrets that we shared
The mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

We were runnin' against the wind
We were young and strong, we were runnin'
Against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
And I guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was living to run and running to live
Never worryied about paying or even how much I owed
Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breaking all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searching
Searching for shelter again and again

A little something against the wind
I found myself seeking shelter sgainst the wind

So innocent and blue

He was too far from home

They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles
Up those twisting turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face
That would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control
Night after night
Day after day
It went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA
Wondering if he could ever go home

Comin' home
You've been gone so very long
Comin' home
You'll just say you're comin' home

You left your hometown for the city lights
You were young and you were strong
Lots of traffic lots of sleepless nights
Lots of dreams that all went wrong

How you took the place by storm
You won't tell them how you lost it all

It might not sound like much

Feelin' lost and wounded tryin' hard to find your way 
No one there to talk it out with 
Learnin' how to sleep alone 
Overcomin' each new doubt 
Tryin' hard just to accept it all 

Everytime you keep control when you're cut off at the knees 
Everytime you take a punch and still stand at ease 
Little victories 
Little victories 

And when night falls and there's no one around 
The cruelest time of all and not one sound 
Listenin' to the wind blow 
Listenin' to the tickin' of the clock 
Tryin' hard to forget 
Tryin' hard to just accept it all

Watch the way they learn to bend with each breeze

Will reach your eastern shores

Across the great unbroken void

Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band,"Golden boy
Take your place
Among the stars

Light your fire
Cast your glow
Near and far

Mother's eyes
Warm you when you sleep

There's a tree
By a brook
In the glade

There's a wave
Off a cape
Making way

Galaxies
Rush away from you

I'll be there
In the wind
In your sails

Through the clouds
Through the fog
Through the gates

I'll be there
Golden boy for you
",Golden Boy,1995
Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band,"Well I wish I had a nickel for every time I fell
And blamed somebody else
I'd give a ton of money to the ones I've hurt
And I'd still be sittin' pretty well
I've spent years losin' touch of what's right and what's real
Caught up in these missions of my own
And you're tellin' me you think I've done so damn well
While we're sittin' here a thousand miles from home
There's a hole in your wisdom, a hole in your sky
Two holes in your head where the light's supposed to get by

Time to lock and load
Time to get control
Time to search the soul
And start again

So many times I've seen chances disappear
I hesitate and watch them slip away
Like the time I fail to spend with the ones I love
And it's gone as sure as yesterday
All these users and fakers, big time takers
Manipulating everyone they see
I get caught up in their schemes and their useless dreams
And the only one I have to blame is me
I get turned 'round and twisted, pulled left and right
I can see where I'm goin', but I can't see the light

Time to lock and load
Come in from the cold
Take a different road
And start again

I can sit here, in the back half of my life
And wonder when the other shoe will fall
Or I can stand up, point myself home
And see if I've learned anything at all
Anything at all

Mediocrity's easy, the good things take time
The great need commitment, right down the line

Time to lock and load
Come in from the cold
Pay these debts I owe
And start again

I've been down this road
I've seen things get old
Time to get control
And start it all again

Time to lock and load
Time to get control
Time to search the soul
And start again

I've been down this road
I've seen things get old
Stand up, get bold
And start it all again

Time to lock and load

It's sawed off to the limit 
He's got a vague plan 
There's this liquor store on Madison 
There's another one down on Washington square 
He's pretty sure no one's ever seen him 
Down around there 
  
The first one's bird shot the next four are double aught buck 
The last one's a slug just for good luck 
He's got his works in his pocket 
He wants to score as soon as he's done 
He can't wait to get straight to get long gone 
  
He puts on his long coat scribbles off a short note 
Sits himself down and waits for the sun to go down 
  
It's right around midnight and there's still too damn many people on this street 
He's walked all the way from Battery Park he's got sweaty hands and burnin' feet 
He's desperate for a fix 
His body's screamin' ""Get me high"" 
He bursts through the door and lets one fly

Freight cars full of abandoned hurt and hope

There's no doberman dogs or security guards at the love junkyard
Open twenty four hours, come as you are, yeah, to the love junkyard

Tiny trysts or grand affairs, there's no more need for teddy bears
The time for pretty words has past, so fly the flag of love half mast
At the love junkyard, yeah

There's no dobermans though or security guards at the love junkyard

Look what I've done for you",Love Junkyard,1991
Bob Sheppard,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning

Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove

Bob Sinclair,"I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and for you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
Bright blessed days, dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of a rainbow
So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying how do you do
They're really saying, I love you

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more
Than I'll never know

Bob Sinclar,"Once upon a time science opened up the door
We would feed the hungry fields till they couldn't eat no more
But the potions that we made touched the creatures down below, oh
And they grew up in the way that we'd never seen before

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature

They were angry with the man 'cause he changed their way of life
And they take their sweet revenge, as they trample through the night
For a hundred miles or more you can hear the people cry
But there's nothin' you can do even God is on their side

Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature
Supernature, supernature

How can I explain, things are different today
Darkness all around and nobody makes a sound
Such a sad affair, no one seems to care

Supernature, better watch out
Look at you now, better watch out
Look at you now, supernature

Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
Look what you've done, there's no place that you can run
The monster's made, we must pay

Supernature, you better watch out
Supernature, look at you now
Supernature, you better watch out
Supernature, look at you now

Better watch out, there's no way to stop it now
You can't escape, it's too late
(Supernature)
Look what you've done, there's no place that you can run
The monster's made, we must pay

Maybe nature has a plan to control the ways of man
He must start from scratch again many battles he must win
Till he earns his place on earth like the other creatures do
Will there be a happy end, now that all depends on you

Bob Stewart,"Walked with no one and talked with no one

With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

Bob Tench,"I had a dream last night, Lord it wasn't me
I dreamed the only woman I ever loved
People, turned her back on me
Let me tell you little more about the dream

I dream of working a graveyard shift
For the long nights a week
When I left home my baby's in bed
My baby, she was fast asleep

When I'm done sick of my job
And I had to go home
And when I got there my bed was empty
My baby she was gone

It couldn't let this worry
It all happened in my sleep
All the things that has been so bad
And I don't want you from seven to seven next weekend

And that's why, that's why, that's why I had a dream
Lord, that's worrying me
She's the only woman I ever loved, people
She's turned her back on me

Baby, don't you know I had a dream last night
Don't you know that worries me
You know I had a dream last night
I had a dream, you were worrying me

Just pick the way I was going people, yeah

Both feet bled, now I don't stand anymore.

Take shape and shift beneath the skin
And whisper:

Take up the floorboards to get
Closer to the bone and find
How the past will not
Play dead anymore.""

I'm outrun and now I track your steps in straight clear lines

Found where you dropped your halo in the snow
Found an echo of you in an empty house
Where once we counted stars beyond reflection,
Cut hearts from a cheap cloth and kept them safe for rainy days

Where first love plays games with penknives

Bob Wallis,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,2011

Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confessin' that I need you,
Honest I do, need you every moment.
In your eyes I read such strange things,
But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
Saying ""can't we still be friends""
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
All in life on you depends.
Am I guessin' that you love me,
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.",I'm Confessin',1995

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Bob Watters,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown",The Old Rugged Cross,2007
Bob Weir,"It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
And a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed

That's why it seems like a dream
Got me hypnotized
And I know that's right

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
'Cause what matters most is the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized

Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Got me hypnotized",Hypnotize,

Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core.
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.

Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat.

Up and down your carpeted halls

I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

'Cause you're a sweet little softcore pretender
Somehow, babe, it got as hot as it gets
With her black leather and gold spike suspenders
And your chain, your black whip and pets.

Well we know you're the reincarnation
Of the infamous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love the ovation
And the scene that it seems to create.

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride.

You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a say when I'll dance on your grave
Unable to dance I'll still crawl across it
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl.

You must really consider the circus
It just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you.

'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
Well I know you wake up here only
When the snakes come marching in.

I was trailed by twenty hounds 
Didn't get to sleep that night 
Till the morning came around 

chorus:
I set out running but I take my time 
A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine 
If I get home before daylight 
I just might get some sleep tonight 
I ran into the Devil, babe 
He loaned me twenty bills 
I spent that night in Utah 
In a cave up in the hills 

I ran down to the levee 
But the Devil caught me there 
He took my twenty-dollar bill 
And he vanished in the air 

Got two reasons why I cry 
away each lonely night 
First one's named sweet Ann Marie 
and she's my heart's delight 
Second one is prison, baby 
the sheriff's on my trail 
And if he catches up with me 
I'll spend my life in jail 

Got a wife in Cheno, babe 
And one in Cherokee 
First one says she's got my child 
But it don't look like me

You can borrow from a friend 
But the Devil will give you twenty 
When your friend only got ten

I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

And the stars start to splatter in the sky,
When the moon hits the southwest horizon,

And listen to the ripples as they moan,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

Black muddy river, roll on forever,
I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side,
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll.

When it seems like the night will last forever,
And there's nothing left to do but count the years,
When the strings of my heart begin to sever,
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And dream me a dream of my own,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own, sing me a song of my own.",Black Muddy River [Studio Rehearsal],2013
Bob Weir,"Mama said, ""Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Take me back to another morning
To a time so long ago
When the sweet Magnolia blossomed
Cotton fields as white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
Who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

Mama said, ""Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
Traded for a chestnut mare
Lord, her never spoke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear

Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn

Bob Weir,"There was a wealthy merchant
In London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter
The truth to you I'll tell
Oh, truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor
Her true love e're would be
Oh, her true love e're could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away

Well before you step on board, sir
Your name I'd like to know
She smiled all in her countenance
They call me Jackaroe
Oh, they call me Jackaroe

Your waist is light and slender
Your fingers are neat and small
And your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannon-ball

Well, I know my waist is slender
My fingers are neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

The war soon being over
She hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds

This couple they got married
So well did they agree
This couple they got married
So why not you and me?
Oh, so why not you and me?

What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O,
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink

Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers.

If ever I return your cities I will burn
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O.

Come steppin' down the stairs combin' back your yellow hair 
Bid a last farewell to your William-O.

Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear.

When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye.
With shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove,
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove.

Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head,
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door,
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four.
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love.

Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows,
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose.
Put my arms around you, love you til you cry,
Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you 'til you die.

Must've been a bad thing to get shot down for
I wonder how they blew it up or if they burned it down
Get out, get out Mr. Lot and don't you turn around.

Who gave you your orders, someone from the sky
I heard a voice inside my head in the desert wind so dry
I heard a voice tellin' me to flee the very same voice I always believe
Say a lot of trouble comin', but it don't have to come to you
I'm telling you so you can tell the rest what you've been through.

But don't you turn around, no, don't look after you
It's not your business how it's done, you're lucky to get through
You're a good upstanding man, a credit to the flock
But if you don't face straight ahead you could not take the shock
Blew the city off the man, left nothing there but fire

Bob Weir,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.",Tangled Up in Blue,2013

Bob Weir,"Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me

Click, flash blade in ghetto night
Rudie's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

On our own. On our own. On our own.

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shinning ball of blue we can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians, throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Shipping powders back and forth
Singing ""black goes south and white comes north""
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours""
And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks - God knows and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
That Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, cleanse my hand
My strength comes as natural as any other man

You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever had lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand were dead

Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he walked up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paw
Samson got hands up round the lion's jaw

And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1990
Bob Wilber,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1990

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse.

Bob Wilber,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings,1995
Bob Wilber,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1995

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
