Idina Menzel,"I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas please
Fold em let 'em hit me raise it baby stay with me,
Love the game and intuition play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, and show him what I've got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face

No he can't read my poker face
(She's got to love nobody)

P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me,
Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it ain't rough it isn't fun, fun

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lying I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunning

Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, I promise this
Check this hand 'cause I am marvelous
I'm marvelous

I'm marvelous, oh marvelous

Idina Menzel,"I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
(But the tigers come at night)
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
(As they tear your hope apart)
As they turn your dream to shame

And still I dreamed that she'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream [Version],2010
Idina Menzel,"Even through the darkest phase
Be it thick or thin,
Always someone marches brave
Here beneath my skin

And Constant (constant) craving (craving)
Has always (always) been

All souls towards truth
Or maybe it is life itself
Leads wisdom to it's youth

Idina Menzel,"The window is open!
So's that door!
I didn't know they did that anymore!
Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?

For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they're opening up the gates!

There'll be actual real live people
It'll be totally strange
But wow! Am I so ready for this change

'Cause for the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light!
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in that zone!
'Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone

I can't wait to meet everyone!
What if I meet. The one?

Tonight, imagine me gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace
Ooh!

I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!

But then we laugh and talk all evening
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've lead so far!

For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun!
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance!

Don't let them in
Don't let them see
Be the good girl
You always have to be
Conceal
Don't feel
Put on a show
Make one wrong move
And everyone will know

But it's only for today

It's only for today!

It's agony to wait

It's agony to wait!

Tell the guards to open up the gate!

The gate!
For the first time in forever

Don't let them in, don't let them see

I'm getting what I'm dreaming of!

Be the good girl you always have to be

A chance to change my lonely world

Conceal

A chance to find true love!

Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know

Please don't shut me out again,
Please don't slam the door
You don't have to keep your distance anymore

'Cause for the first time in forever,
I finally understand
For the first time in forever,
We can fix this hand in hand
We can head down this mountain together!
You don't have to live in fear...
'Cause for the first time in forever
I will be right here

Anna
Please go back home
Your life awaits
Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates

Yeah, but

I know!
You mean well, but leave me be
Yes, I'm alone but I'm alone and free!
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me

Actually we're not

What do you mean you're not?

I get the feeling you don't know

What do I not know?

Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep, deep...
Snow

What?

You've kind of set off an eternal winter... Everywhere

Everywhere?

It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

No, I can't
I, I don't know how!

Sure you can! I know you can!
`Cause for the first time in forever,
I'm such a fool!
I can't be free!

You don’t have to be afraid...
No escape from the storm inside of me!

We can work this out together!
I can’t control the curse!

We’ll reverse the storm you’ve made
Anna, please, you’ll only make it worse!

Don’t panic!
There’s so much fear!

We’ll make the sun shine bright!
You’re not safe here!

We can face this thing together!
No!

We can change this winter weather!

And everything will be all right...

Idina Menzel,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight

To test the limits and break through

Let it go, let it go

I would teach my feet to fly

He tried hard to help me
He put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees

I'm selfish and I'm sad

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
Singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I, I wish I had a river I could skate away on.
Yeah I wish I had a river I could skate away on and on

We planned a better day
But planets turn one way
So though it seems unlike me
Girls, this is what I say

Love wherever and whenever
And however you should
Yes marriage is a bastard
But love is always good

It's nothing you prepare for
It's nothing that you plan
So love when this world lets you

Our love belongs to everyone who loves us
So it's not just you and me
And we both know love doesn't make us perfect
It just makes us want to be

If what we had before
Is broken on the floor
We can see the way the pieces work
And make it something more

And love wherever and whenever
And however we feel
Let anger clean the cut out
Let love help us heal
It's not the love we dreamed of
Back when we began
But love if your heart lets you
Love while you can

I believe our fate will find us
I believe that we get but one true love
I believe in seeing signs, 
And I believe and trust the starts above
And I thought you believed in me
That deep down we were meant to be
I try to let that go

But I can't let you go

When these feelings flow

I still love you so

It's love that forgives

You toss his fav'rite shoes onto the pile
You see him in the faces of the boys he left behind

You learn to count the quiet wins
An hour with no unprompted tears
And not to count the deadly days
As they fade into years

You learn to stand alone at last
So brave, and bold, and strong, and stout
You learn somehow to like the dark

Going anywhere the wind would blow
She used to look a bit like me

Someday I'm gonna find her again
And I'm gonna tell her the truth
Shake her by the shoulders
Make her see nobody's fireproof

You will get burned

The fire inside me, like lightning
Trying to get out all my light

Dying to finally get back home
And I'm forever trying to keep the faith
Praying but it's a lonely road

I'm wondering what your family does at that time of year
Love and joy and peace on Earth and tidings of good cheer
Do you have tradition things
For that time of year

Well, we hang up boughs of evergreen on every single doorway
Bake a giant cookie in the wavy shape of Norway
Go from door to door to door while singing with our choir

Hang up all your giant socks above an open fire

So happy, merry yuletide carols, faithful friends are dear

Well, we make our decorations out of flotsam and jetsam
Bake a yummy fruitcake, and you can't leave till you get some

Buy each other presents and then hide them very nimbly

Wait up for a chubby man to shimmy down your chimney

Oh, happy, merry, muletide barrels, faithful glass of cheer
Thanks for sharing what you do
At that time of year

Don't forget the jammies that I knitted for my kittens

Idiot Flesh,"If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me

In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there

She had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And the the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down

It said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away

He was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said

You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible

Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door

So you can go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible

And go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible

I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
I disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible

So just by looking in, I'll be looking still
You find and follow stories well
You're naked except for a newspaper, the headline telling me
That fortune favours the brave
I've been known to be that brave
What I want is on it's way out
All I needed was an easier way to stay 

Walking around the city as the light fades (is it all that you remain?)
I'm thinking about each promise that I have ever made 

But I know what they will never say, I know what they will never say
Century after Century they remain 

And if I read to remember that the entire Earth is outside this room 
So close the windows, keep the curtains shut forever
And if I need to remember that the entire Earth is outside this room
So close the windows, close the windows 

Isn't it romantic, to be romantic
When you don't understand what you love
Or if a word like that couls ever mean anything
When what you want is on it's way out

And your cheekbones don't taste of anything at all

Then they came along and changed
All these questions and their answers seem to change

We stop in every passing place
To watch the world move faster than we do
Watch it pass with our eyes closed the way we usually choose to

So I'll wait 'till I find the remote part of your heart
When no where else will let us choose a comfortable start
And even if the breath between us smells of alcohol
We call it confusion in the best way possible

Idris Muhammad,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1987

And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord

Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?

Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2005
Idris Philips,"Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying, no not dying

There's no suicide like the lie that you tell yourself and believe it
Mask look decent, face is weeping underneath it
Self-hate feasting on our deepest darkest secrets
Warning signs that read help needed, too ashamed to seek it
Seems so easily deleted when you're browsing
But can't erase the history of what your eyes allowed in
The intimately profound ecstasy that gives life's
Stripped of all its meaning 'til it eats you from the inside
The big lie, you just do this to get you through the slim times
One click at a time 'til you prefer counterfeit kind
Seen so many scenes that it would seem you're desensitized
Just to get your fix begin dipping into the sick side
Seeking to feed a demon that you no longer recognize
If you swear it off, you'll never find a place you can hide
Inside your pocket lies a portal to your inner battle
Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple

Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying, no not dying

Don't get it twisted
There's no innocence existing in its biggest business
You create specific demand whenever you click it
Whatever it is you're into someone's got to fill it
Have their lowest moments frozen to be shown infinite
You watch the porn get savager
Box office movies nastier, the TV get trashier
Schoolgirls are flashing the camera
Profile pic look just like the next amateur
Babies get exposed no one controlling how it damage them
You find yourself detaching, retreating, reacting
Deep anger, decreased passion and you keep lashing out
Your sweet family just reminds you of your weak habits
You have no mercy for yourself and so you're relapsing
Your sweet attraction used to drive you to that deep connection
You're feeling so cold and lonely when you least expect it
Atop your desk sits a portal to your inner battle
Children of Adam still grappling with that bitten apple

Dark places I would play
I watch the night turn into day
Screaming voices in my mind
Leave me cold and so hard to find
Thank God those demons didn't last
Dealing with the wreckage of my past
Not dying, no not dying

Now that I have died I have to taste for life
Or the affairs of the living
Only for love and the affair of the lovers
The affairs of the living are many and assorted
The affair of the lovers is singular and complete
Do not mourn this walking carcass
Some are dead because they are without life
Others are dead because they are beyond life
Yet others have forgotten the affair of life and death altogether",The Bitten Apple,2017

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

You'll find an old brick church still sitting there
With it's hold oak so burdened with Spanish moss 
That its very limbs seem to bow in prayer

'Cause there is no where else that they can drink
Where the law won't bother them and no one will know

Don't get it confused
Boy you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn

Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone

Why you acting like that?

Baddest bitch in the world right here
You ain't even gotta go nowhere
Boy you better watch the way you walk
'Cause if you trip you're gonna fall

Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you

Well shit, she may never
My love cost too baby, ain't nothing free
Check my angle, daddy, you could call me angel, daddy
Uh, but you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast
Now, this is the business of pleasure let's keep 'em separate
I ain't tryna be second, just for the record
I see you slippin' you trippin' just thought I should let you know
I admire your effort but I need better love
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away
I told 'em that's just a fall, try another day
This is different, now I'm seeing that it isn't
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary Jane
Now ain't that funny, that you was something special
'Til i noticed that you just like these losers who come in several but I
Know that if you leave you comin' right back
So my question boy is, why you acting like that?

Don't let the tables turn

Gonna love you

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something liking to loving
It was us against the world now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like It'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You was different from my last but now you got a mirror
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave

That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus hallelujah
Imma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breath for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air
And you leave for it
Til then having kids, can check on your mind
And there's nothing but me on it
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it
I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back go quick
'Cause this here is fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shit

Iggy Azalea,"He ain't goin' nowhere

You should listen to the shit your boyfriend says
Searched high and low inside his dirty mind,
Then concentrate on making his heart race
Find your treasure, make it last forever now

Get what you want in more pleasure
Leave no one y'all come together
Whisper in his ear it makes it hotter
And don't wipe off sweat it makes it better
Get him whatever he wants,
Don't hit him with questions
Ask my other girls
Trust me girl don't stress him

He ain't movin', ah he ain't goin' nowhere
He ain't movin', ah he ain't goin' nowhere
He ain't movin', ah he ain't goin' nowhere
He ain't movin', ah he ain't goin' nowhere

There's so much to learn from what your boyfriend says
Take advantage when he thinks you're not listening
And ? In tune with his pleasure triggers
Love that he will backfire, that's your mission

Get what you want in more pleasure
Leave no one y'all come together
Whisper in his ear it makes it hotter
And don't wipe off sweat it makes it better
Get him whatever he wants,
Don't hit him with questions

He ain't movin', ah he ain't goin' nowhere
He ain't movin', ah he ain't goin' nowhere

What you know 'bout blowing 'bout twenty racks
Ain't worried 'bout coming back, if you're going now
Got him wrapped by my fingertips
I'm rock hard every time that he can't get his up
Make him wanna change it up
And I only feel forgiven if changes us ?
Bonnie and Clyde never strange to us
'Cause what's like if you never live dangerous?
And when it ain't much left and we get it right
And since love is a drug you won't get it light
I never been the kinda tug in a kitten animal
That take you wild until you go and get a sit her tight
Get it like this like that and all you want
Boy ain't tryina hear it when you're talking front
See I know your weak spots, so I always go there
And I bet that's the reason he's going nowhere, like uh (na girl, I told you)

I won't ask you to climb back
I paid twenty for that Rolly, I just want my time back

That you don't give a damn
I got you tatted, you took off before the ink dried on my hands

The truth is, I left a piece of me in a piece I gave you
And I tend to laugh and crack a smile when things get painful
Said I crack a smile when things get painful

I need payback for all the time lost
Said, I need payback for all the time lost

So I need payback for all the time lost

Say that you love me
I say that you're lying
'Cause I said we could work on it, you said ""let's leave it behind""
Couldn't put together the picture I paint in my mind
So how I see you know insulting me is wasting my time
But we live and learn and learn and love and let go
Cause if we stay in this then we might make it worse than before
Another hard lesson, stressing taking personal notes
Remember sweet nothings, like baby, what's the purpose in those?
Both of us saying it shouldn't have went like that
But sometimes in love, it just get like that
Used to think that when it went wrong we'd get right back
You know, Cupid's got another arrow, and shit like that

Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air And you lean forward
Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me on it
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back, go quick
'Cause this here is fatal attraction
So I take it all or I don't want shit

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me honey
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby",Black Widow,2014
Iggy Azalea,"I remember when it used to be simple
But all this cash, it just complicates things
And all this money that we into, it'll drive you crazy
But it only make me go harder, grow stronger
And get tougher when the road get longer
Sometimes you gonna think that it's too much on ya
But think what I'd be doing if this wasn't going on
So I just keep pushing when I'm being pulled in every direction
Now I'm popping so they watching every step of my progression
Sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
On the road to riches turning earth into heaven
Dear Lord, if you hear me, I don't need not a new friend near me
'Cause I don't want none of that fake love, 'cause I'm looking and all of that be made up

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now y'all wanna act like y'all know me, yeah
Oh, now everybody wanna love me?
Try to knock me down but I'm strong
Did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends,
so for now just leave me alone
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all

Making each and every song like it might be my last one
But still making sure the cash come
Still ain't forget the times when I didn't have none
Back against the wall, feeling like I had to grab some
That's when, I took time and I figured it out
I'd rather deal with the stress more than living without
Take a one way trip to the top one time
Let you have it for a minute, now I want mine
Same girl on the cover of the magazine
Was the one hiding pain that you hadn't seen
Talking about no money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami
Same critics love me nowadays couldn't stand me
Now we talking about VMA's and a Grammy
But in due time, turn nothing into something
And so now I need money, put it all in my discussions

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now y'all wanna act like y'all know me, yeah
Oh, now everybody wanna love me?
Try to knock me down but I'm strong
Did all this on my own
Ain't got no time for no new friends,

I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all anyway
I don't need y'all

And if you wasn't here when I was down
Then you won't be here when I'm up
Now the same one you looked over, be the same one that blew up
Ain't it funny how this life thing works?
When you think it's finished is when it all begins
Go from doubts to having the thought it might work
It goes up and down and then it starts again
When I reminisce sometimes I can't even keep a dry eye
But my heart's on fly when you on top of the world sky high

I remember when I wasn't this big
And now y'all wanna act like y'all know me, yeah
Oh, now everybody wanna love me?

One phone call that make all the money get wired

After any competition coming up against me
You think it’s anything better, then come convince me
Until then I’ll be leading the race
So bow down, put your knee to your face
While I make wine outta water, turn rappers into martyrs
Set it off whenever I-G-G in the place, uh

Iggy Azalea,"Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear
Not in a million years could you tell me that I'd be here
I just hopped off that lier, my life on another tier
Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear
From country living to country skipping, this would drive you crazy
Check the rate that they pay me, a giant could never slay me
Money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots
I heard that the top is lonely, I wonder if it's the truth
So I'm just climbing, pay that fine, and now I'm shining could be blinding
Ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it
This that new classic, ain't this what you needed?
I'm what amazing look like, you'll recognize it when you see it

Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just trying to make it on my own
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones
This is the line, and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

I been counted out, I been stepped on
I was wide awake, and got slept on
I had everything and then I lost it
Worked my ass off, I'm exhausted
All this talking about me, just talk about me
I'm here now, they can't walk around me
I'm dedicated, flow elevated
Tell every hater I hope you never play it, said I'd never make it
Now I'm celebrating, I'm never quitting, no resignation
I'm the fresh face with no expiration
I know pressure make diamonds, so I threw them off in this chain
And when it's all on the line, I'm who you want in the game
Cause I'm gonna get it
And that's for sure
Can't be like y'all, that's a no-go
International, and y'all local
Got this locked up just like popo
Every beat get A, that's tocho
Won't lose, oh no, that's Yoko
Been up and down like Lolo's
Still make my own on the solo
Had to be here to believe it
Think like winners to perceive it
Had to let you know that I mean it
If I speak it, I say keep it
This flow, that's genius
Just think about it, would I think about it?
If I didn't live it, won't ink about it
Married to the money, put a ring around it, what?

Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just trying to make it on my own
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones

Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

And everything ain't the way I planned it
But when the smoke clears, I'm the last standing
This lifestyle can be so demanding
But I take off like a plane and they never landing

Know where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just trying to make it on my own
And unless they send me clothes, I don't answer phones

Iggy Pop,"I never saw you before
I never sound strained before
Now I'm at your door
And I hope you're unusual
Very unusual

Now I'm at your door
And when you nicely ask me in
I'm staring at your shoes
And I don't wonder why
I feel like a horse
We can stray out on the open range
Missing me every day with its hidden claws
Spring snow

And when you brush me
Brush me with your eyes
I think you've noticed that 
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore
I never saw you before
But you're unusual
And now I'm at your door

I feel safe and warm
I feel

I feel
I feel
Like a horse

Iggy Pop,"Riding in the saddle
Henchmen at your side
Holy macaroni
Hose you on your back

And the bystanders just stand there
Like ? on a shelf
In the world of work your rivals
That you have yet to meet
And quite a bunch they are

In the morning sun
With blinking eyes
The worthless stands
In readiness
For transport to
The battleground
There's dirty work
Ahead of them

And quite a bunch they are
What do you do with a life of work?
What do you do with a life of work?
What do you do with a life of work?

Face it in the morning
Face it in the morning
And the parting of the ways
And the interrupted mirth
And the shock that has to come

Because of what you want
Compared to what you've got
Meet it squarely
And it only hurts
When it hurts
Life of work
Early in the morning",Life of Work,1982
Iggy Pop,"Lovely games of yesterday
Have left me with my soul today
Felicity flies out the door
When people lose their warmth
That's a very ordinary bummer
I'll hold out for summer days

Stand and laugh and run
In a quiet movie of mine
I saw a girl with eyes like fire
I had to look away
She was swearing like a sailor
And demanding her own way
That was when I knew I had to love her

I opened up my sad old eyes
And let the feelings run
With a quiet beauty of mine
Maybe sometimes we do bad things
And then other times we do good
And sometimes from something very bad
Comes something very good
In a quiet year of mine",Ordinary Bummer,1982
Iggy Pop,"Pain and suffering (Pain and suffering)

And blood everywhere

I am terminating this world (Pain and suffering)
I want to break into your walls
Where you're having fun
And I want to rip you limb from limb 
And tear you up

And your mother

Here come the armies
Your breath is screaming
As your head hang bloody from your elbow

I am destruction (Pain and suffering)
I am angry (Pain and suffering)

I am black Armageddon

A tall building falls under you (Pain and suffering)

Iggy Pop,"Strategic angles indirectly revealed
Uniting human form and manufactured heels
Go buy in a hurry, buying your chance
You give your best by loving a classic
Immoderation seems to suit her best
But then I turn around and she's very delicate

Go buy in a hurry, get all you can
Give her your best ?
Time has no pull on her soul
When she is here I'm her doorman
I'm ?

Oh the coronation when she walks by
Even if it's private makes you end your mind

You give your best for loving a classic
For loving a classic
For loving a classic",Platonic,1982

He shot a missile in the sky
It functioned just as advertised
Until the fire made him cry

Run like a villain to the sugar bowl
Run like a villain cause you can't adjust
To a saccharine suburb in the mush
I've got some loving arms around me
Darker than the tombs of Egypt,
Dumber than the crudest fiction,
Buried in a melting coffin
Nights like this appeal to me!

Tracy got an afghan, pedigreed,
Prescription shades and designer jeans
A sony walkman on her head
All she wants is to be fed
Run, run, run, cause you're soft
Run, run, but don't get lost
The shining moon the dead oak tree
Nights like this appeal to me

I've got some loving arms around me
The shining moon the dead oak tree
Nights like this appeal to me
I've got some loving arms around me
Trying to steal a moment of pleasantry
In this zombie birdhouse

Run, run, run run like a villain
Let the good times roll
Run like a villain to save your soul
It can't be done I already know
So I run like a villain to the sugar bowl

Who you are nobody knows
Rings on your fingers
And bells on your toes",Run Like a Villain,1982

Yes, they're cropping up now with alarming frequency
These little group eyes
Wasted people standing around

They may as well be apes, you know

In the backbrain
Of every body you meet
Man is the village animal
United by the glue

Of our loathsome qualities
We are sneaking peeping toms
In revolt against each other
The villagers are most insane
They live to die anonymous

So in the space age the village idiot rules

I looked up at the radio tower
Rag tent by the railroad tracks
Concrete poured over steel bridge
Pondered my fate while they built the interstate

I'm a product of America
From the morgue to the prisons
Cold metal, when I start my band
Cold metal, in my garbage can
Cold metal, gets in my blood
And my attitude

Yeah, uh-huh

Threw my hide in an automobile
Heard a song called ""Drive the Wheel""
Truckers, trailers, tractors caught me workin'

This is the song of my heritage
From the bad to the Buddha
Cold metal, that's what it be
Cold metal, from sea to sea
Cold metal, it's how we win
And also how we sin
How we sin, how we sin, how we sin, how we sin

Cold metal, in the afternoon
Sounds lovely like a Hendrix tune
Cold metal, it's the father of beat
The mother of the street
Cold metal, it rolls on by
Cold metal, gonna raise it high
Cold metal, it'll even fly
Rust buckets in the sky
Cold metal, got to be
Skeleton of the free

Iggy Pop,"People are so sad and I know why
With no chance to live before you die
You get pretty sick if you have to
Keep it inside

I wanna build a house where an ad don't scream
I wanna live in peace-quietly
I wanna have a place of love and safety
People ought to live how and where they want
People ought to have respect in front
People ought to get along pretty O.K.

So get off my dick
I'm building it brick by brick
Brick by brick

I'm building a house where I can think
And have some balance and dignity
I'm building a house where no one can hurt me
I'm building a house where the weak are strong
I'm building a house with a real song
I'm using faith that is immortal
I'm building it with simplicity
And the way that we feel, you and me
I'm building it with what I believe in

So get off my dick
I'm building it brick by brick
Brick by brick

Now I'm looking at just a little time
So be it I want to
Be true to my simple heart
And not put nothing else above it

Iggy Pop,"I was gently raised 
Fussed over r in school

It was a beautiful summer day
The sun was shining
And I found myself surrounded by Latin American and dark women

And as I looked at their ankles,
Their knees and their thighs,
And the curve of their bodies,
Their mysterious eyes
I couldn't help but thinking about their pussies
And I asked myself

Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy prance
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Pussy, pussy walk

The high schools, jr. high schools and
Other centers ol learning in this wonderful land of
The united States of America
And when I do, from time to time
I run into the young girls that attend these places
And I see them smiling at me with their young girl clothes
And while I smile back, I never say anything
But inside I'm thinking
Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy love
Can your pussy shove
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy prance
Pussy, pussy walk

Now all you men can relate to this
How sometimes you're supposed to go out of the house
And get something done
Like you're supposed to go to the store
And just go get a bottle of milk
Or just go to your job
And do it good and cone back home
But on the way, my God
There's a girl, and there's another girl, and there's another girl

And pretty soon you're surrounded
And your eyes are going one way
And your head is going another way
Ano your nose is going up
And your nose is going down
And you're thinking about that pussy
And it's become a real distraction
And you've gotta ask yourself

Can your pussy walk
Can your pussy talk
Can your pussy smile
Can your pussy frown
Can your pussy dance
Can your pussy prance
Can your pussy love
Can your pussy shove

I saw a comely goth girl
With tattoos on her form

And shone her eyes on me
She shined my shoes and then I knew
That I would spellbound be

Her hair was not the shiniest
Her skin was not like silk
But she had a way of looking
That made me want to milk
As I sat high above her
Her cleavage I could see
I contemplated both of them
That's how she spellbound me

She wore black on her clothing
And she wore black on her boots
Lt was Lollapalooza day
But she didn't like he groups
I got lost in her pale skin
And wanted to stay down
But I had someone waiting
So I left spellbound

And you see me passing by

Came tripping to my room last night
I cooked her a steak and I tried not to fake
And still make everything alright
She had dreads in her hair and problems and cares
She tried hard not to let 'em show
She was decent and sweet and I was sizin' up the meat
But doubts fell in my mind like snow
And when the shove comes down to love
The facade falls down
And when the bricks fall from the tricks
The facade falls down

It's a sunny afternoon and I'm sitting in my robe
I'm dirty and I'm here alone
There's a story on my table that talks about me
And I want to stuff it down the author's throat
And I'm sleeping with someone new every night
And in the morning politely saying ""bye""

And I'm nowhere and no one
And I only wanna run
And I feel like a hamburger bun
And when you must
Believe or bust
The facade falls down
When you're scared of a brand new care
The facade falls down
I got no reason to believe
I got no reason but I'm New York Scumbag Tough
And I'll keep on truckin'

So night is falling
And I'm getting' tired
And it's time to get my slippers and books
Got a sweater and glasses
And something that passes
For a way to get by in this world
And I'm getting' tired
Of so many different things
I guess I'm just plain tired
Or maybe too intelligent to believe
In the obvious side of things
And when voice says make a choice
The facade falls down
When your knees start to concede
The facade falls down
When the shove comes down to love
The facade falls down
And when the bricks fall from the tricks

As I pulled in the drive
Wearing leopard skin velvet
And shiny black eyes

And a smile like the sun
She held my poor corpse
Like she'd never be done
And the caption in my mind said

How my life was a desert before she came in
And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin
How I liked to see her little feet pad around the house
The way she curled up quietly on the couch
I can still see her in my mind that way now
Aah I felt the luxury of her
I felt the luxury of her

Well time went by quickly
And her confidence grew
And she wanted this and that
And she wanted those too
And she wouldn't shut up
And one day I just blew up

Maybe she'll die
Maybe I'll cry

I'm cold 'till the end

In the modern world

You got a dog face chic,
With basketball tit's.
Porno sucks,
That's the truth of it.
You got a bunch of dumb fat guys,
In a wrestling uniform,
Trying to fake they're playing music,
They ought to be killed.

They got the chics, 
The money cars and all, but they ain't got no motherfuckin' balls.
They got a fungus on their dick,
They got bald heads and tupees,
They're in total control,
Total fucking control,
They're even parked in my space.
You got a song with no soul,
No truth no love.

Because the music sucks,
That's why little kids blow up.
Everybody needs a gun,
To express feelings,
That should be expressed by a real musician
And I'm trying to be a person,
But they all say I'm worthless.

Iggy Pop,"I'm a Very Important Person
I park in the V.I.P
And when I go to the bathroom,
I go in the V.I.P toilet
And when I wanna change a light bulb,
I don't do it myself
I have a technician
Cause I'm a V.I.P
I'm a V.I.P
I'm a V.I.P
I'm a V.I.P
Now, as I began to become a V.I.P,
I forgot what I've become a V.I.P for
I began to grow accustomed to people saying
""Right this way sir, drinks are on the house""
Flight attendants on airplanes saying

""Please, really, I don't wanna bother you sir, but it's such a pleasure to have you on board.
May I have your autograph for my daughter?""
""Yeah baby right after I go to the toilet
I I'll give you a couple of 'em
Cause I'm a V.I.P!""

Now,one thing about V.I.P is,is they never seem to be alone
Oh no !
The ""true"" V.I.P must travel with an entourage !
People who say ""Right on boss""
Cause it's a V.I.P!
Right on boss
I'm a V.I.P!
As I began to realize that I had gained V.I.P status,
Worries began to creep in
What if one day,I woke up,and I was no longer a V.I.P?
No more good tables at the restaurants,
No more strange women smiling and approaching me on the streets,
No more top notch booty
No more entourage to say ""Right boss""
I began to have nightmares
And in my nightmares, I was just a fucking nobody.
Laying at the beach, imagining myself being a VIP!
Just like I was before,
Hearing the applause in my head
Beautiful warm embraces of superior members of the female gender

V.I.P
V.I.P

Of course, when one becomes a V.I.P,
One meets other V.I.Ps
At social occasions,
And one inevitably thinks,
""thick! How shallow and crass these people are!
They're not down to earth and real like me,
Oh no! I'm a very special V.I.P""

Another interesting phenomenon, associated with V.I.P celebrity hood, 
Is the ""V.I.P reflection effect"", during which anyone associated with the V.I.P, 
Becomes a sort of V.I.P in their own right! Such as ""son OF the V.I.P"",
""Guitar player FOR the V.I.P"",
""Girlfriend WITH the V.I.P"",
""Accountants of the V.I.P""
The maid, the dog, the music publisher, huh!
All enjoy a sort of 'reflected glory', as in

""Hi this is Nastea
I work for Iggy
And I'd like 6 tables tonight in the V.I.P section
And he needs passes for everyone
And free drinks of course
In the V.I.P area""
Right on boss
Cause I'm a V.I.P.
It's also true that when one is a V.I.P, everybody's happy to see you, all the time!
And there's an implicit rule that a V.I.P must never, never
Be on a barn.
Cause everybody expects YOU to make their day
And they're all be on to you if you're in a bad mood.
They will ""thck!tchk!tchk ! mur mur mur mur mur!"",
And you will find yourself with the wrong kind of attention:
A ""difficult"" V.I.P.
Psychologists tell us that a sense of self-esteem
Is so necessary in today's world.
As a V.I.P, I can guarantee you, you'll never be alone.
You'll never be alone.
Cause you're a V.I.P!",V.I.P.,2001

Is there anyone that cares?

On seven shotgun shells

That you're holdin' in your hand

Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm

Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born

And wrecked it and ripped it and rubbed my nerves thin

The way she curled up quietly on the couch
I can still see her in my mind that way now

Is it the same under the sky?
Black motorcycles and the will to survive

Surely leeches gain the right
To send their message screaming
One that has no meaning
To people who feel

questions and questions plain as your nose
But who would believe a little rose?

No santa claus no happy elves
In this smoking gun existence
It gets harder to unwind
I'll just eat my breakfast
Try to keep my questions
Starving all night

My true fine love
Down in the suburbs I met
My true fine love
She gave me money
She gave me head
She gave my everything
And then she went dead

stick out your thumb
And hit the open road
Cat in a mercedes
Goes by, he's old
He's got some, you got none
Together maybe you can have
Some fun-winners and losers
Gentlemen boozers
Winners and losers

roll roll roll roll
Roll your money down
Rock rock rock rock

Raise my feelings one more time

Yeah, find a little stranger, find a little stranger

Heard a song called ""Drive the wheel""
Truckers, trailers, tractors caught me workin'

Sounds lovely like a Hendrix tune

The mother of the street

I was stretched out on the bed when he approached
And tried painfully to jump up he wagged his tail nervously
Since the beginning he hadn't touched his bowl once
He had lost a lot of weight

I helped him to settle on my lap
For a few seconds he looked at me
With a curious mixture of exhaustion and apology
Then, calmed, he closed his eyes
Two minutes later he gave out his last breath

I buried him beside the residence
At the western extremity of the land
Surrounded by the protective fence
Next to his predecessors

During the night a rapid transport
From the Central City dropped off an identical dog
They knew the codes and how to work the barrier
I didn't have to get up to greet them

A small white and ginger mongrel
Came toward me wagging its tail
I gestured to him
He jumped on the bed and stretched out beside me

Love is simple to define
But it seldom happens in the series of beings
Through these dogs we pay homage to love
And to its possibility

What is a dog but a machine for loving
You introduce him to a human being giving him the mission to love
And however ugly, perverse, deformed or stupid this human being might be
The dog loves him, the dog loves him",A Machine for Loving,2009
Iggy Pop,"It's party time and I smell slime
You stupid people make me evil

Dicks and asses, cocktail glasses
Parlor games, exchange of fluids

Cause it's party time, it's party time
It's party time, I got the slime

Here's a brute, isn't he cute?
He needs a hole to bury his soul in

Cause it's party time, it's party time
It's party time, I got the slime, I got the slime",Party Time,2009

A massive headache in my aging skull
Means I do not feel well

Pain, pain, pain
Bad brains must always feel pain

The problem started with my attitude
It's all lust, direct and crude
There are good people in this world of bums
But, sadly, I am not one

Pain, pain, pain
That's why I'll always be in pain

Good karma will not get you anywhere
Look at Jesus and his hair

Always dreamin' someone like you would appear
Now that I've found you, let me make it clear
That you can't escape my wild love

Somehow you ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
Now that I've got you here, girl, there ain't no turnin' back

We're gonna party till the sun comes up
I'll ride you in my hot pink pick-up truck
If you've got other plans, then you're just out of luck

That soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care

And you recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new
It well could be the one time

A toutes les femmes qu'on aime
Pendant quelques instants secrets
A celles qu'on connaît à peine
Qu'un destin différent entraîne
Et qu'on ne retrouve jamais

A celle qu'on voit apparaître
Une seconde à sa fenêtre
Et qui, preste, s'évanouit
Mais dont la svelte silhouette
Est si gracieuse et fluette
Qu'on en demeure épanoui

A la compagne de voyage
Dont les yeux, charmant paysage
Font paraître court le chemin
Qu'on est seul, peut-être, à comprendre
Et qu'on laisse pourtant descendre
Sans avoir effleuré sa main

A la fine et souple valseuse
Qui vous sembla triste et nerveuse
Par une nuit de carnaval
Qui voulu rester inconnue
Et qui n'est jamais revenue
Tournoyer dans un autre bal

A celles qui sont déjà prises
Et qui, vivant des heures grises
Près d'un être trop différent
Vous ont, inutile folie,
Laissé voir la mélancolie
D'un avenir désespérant

Chères images aperçues
Espérances d'un jour déçues
Vous serez dans l'oubli demain
Pour peu que le bonheur survienne
Il est rare qu'on se souvienne
Des épisodes du chemin

Mais si l'on a manqué sa vie
On songe avec un peu d'envie
A tous ces bonheurs entrevus
Aux baisers qu'on n'osa pas prendre
Aux curs qui doivent vous attendre
Aux yeux qu'on n'a jamais revus

Alors, aux soirs de lassitude

To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause 'tis the season

Completions and connections left
From last year, ski shopping, counter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
(Most of '81 past along those lines)
So deck those halls and trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer

Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow, get this winter over with
Flash back, to spring time, sun again (why?)
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summer time
Out to the beach to his boat could have joined him
No this time, it was me, sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendars just one page
Of course I am excited

Turned down all of my invites

Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go, (I'm sorry)

Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me with the world's smallest turkey
All ready in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn, guess what I forgot?
So on with the boots back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear?
In the line is that guy
I've been chasing all year
(I'm spending this one alone) he said
(Need a break this year's been crazy)
I said me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot cranberries too?
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale to a very happy ending

Never, never working
This run along pretty well for a while but
Friends need to be demanding, people need to be demanding
I started becoming demanding
And I lost my friends
They couldn't stand anybody being demanding
As a demanding person I got somewhere in life

I started having girlfriends
I was very demanding of them
But I didn't let them be demanding of me
I started making big friends
Friends that could help me
Oh, those friends are really demanding
You don't get a warm fuzzy feeling
But you get
What you gotta have to get along
I mean, that's showbiz

I'm getting a little older now and
I start to think about the friends that are gonna think of me
When I move along
There are one or two of 'em are gonna have a grin
And a good memory of me
They're not the best, fanciest people
Not even very good people frankly
Their big claim to fame is
They're my friends
Useless, expensive, maddening, pain in the ass friends

Spinning rotors floating in the sky

On wasting my fucking time
Keep on searching round here for something you ain't gunna find
So lets take a step back
Remove our mask and ask
Is this the way we're gonna live
Keep on stepping over cracks

But it ain't that

Better jump for your life
And watch out and be ready to hurdle

All around my feet
They're biting on my shoes

I look around the corner life is changing fast
But it really don't have to be like that do it
I don't wanna go and leave you
Going back through it
But I'm driving away in a car full of friends
Hearing songs that remind of the time that we spend, and
Now I'm sitting and I'm wondering if
The thunders gonna roll when we kiss, or
Is the rain gonna come down
Gotta go inside so we can talk some more.

We can talk all day, we can talk all night
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just sit around, and do whatever we like
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like

We can talk all day, we can talk all night
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just run around, and do whatever we like
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like

A phone calls sticking in the back of my mind
I was listening to you
Yea it's been a long time
And it might have been a hard year
It ain't easy when you're looking in the mirror
Only seeing your tears
Enough is enough
And all this time
Spent just drinking it up out of my mind
Counting the times
We would have a lot of fun
Get into a little trouble
Hoping fences on the run
And, we can only look in the past so long
Give us a second
We can sing a song
About all the happy times
And the times we got mad
Fighting, giving up and smiling before we shook hands
Now, I got one thing to say
Take a seat next to me and stay
A while
We can cross paths again
Like we did
Before we grew up and did our own shit, shit.

Please don't forget
Please don't forget
'cause these moments they seem to fade so quick
We put aside just a little time to laugh
Got places to go, so little time for that, but
When we go our separate ways
Remember the days
Late night, staying up, sharing a blaze
'cause these times, those times
All those low times
We've been together, gonna be better in no time
'cause everything that happens is a blessing in disguise
We can read it like a bunch of letters in the sky
What it says, who knows but I know
We gotta a lot to talk about
So come on lets go

We can talk all day, we can talk all night
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just sit around, and do whatever we like
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like

We can talk all day, we can talk all night
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like
Or we can just run around, and do whatever we like
Do whatever we like, do whatever we like",Whatever We Like,2008

Igor Butman,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1993
Igor Cavalera,"A vision of unselfishness, a union of black and white 
One nation of all races, it's clear within my sight 
I see it clear, no hate, no fear, no soldiers sent to die 
A state that's free and thrives on peace, no greed, no threat to life 

We won't build the weapons of war which looms over your heads 
We'll not feed the war machines that lead our youth to death 
We won't close our eyes to the atrocities which abound 

We won't stand and watch until we're six feet underground 

The future is our burden, we can't stand and watch 
As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march 
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity 
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace 

Motherfuckers around us who stand and say no way 
Opposing lessened armies, they say are here to stay 
But no one knows until we try, what we all can do 
I won't watch children die, it's up to me and you 

Our world is divided, the boundaries have been drawn 
Ideas are decided by where you have been born 
You can't judge people by the government of their land 
They're flesh and blood like us - why don't you understand? 

The future is our burden, we can't stand and watch 
As the world around crumbles, opposing armies march 
We work towards our goal: one nation - unity 
And you must be the convert who works towards world peace",One Nation,2002
Igor Kiskatchi,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the Gypsy in me

I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama, come to mama do

Igor Kiskatchi,"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-a-pats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.
Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say:

Fascinating rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm,
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.

Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
To find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong;
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.

Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!
Fascinating rhythm,
On won't you stop picking on me?",Fascinating Rhythm,2001
Igor Kiskatchi,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",I Hadn't Anyone Till You,2001
Igor Kiskatchi,"I remember sky
It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky

I remember snow
Soft as feathers
Sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint
When the wind would blow

And ice like vinyl
On the streets
Cold as silver
White as sheets
Rain like strings
And changing things
Like leaves

I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges
Ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces
Muddy shoes
And light and noise and
Bees and boys
And days

I remember days
Or at least I try
But as years go by
They're a sort of haze
And the bluest ink
Isn't really sky
And at times I think
I would gladly die
For a day of sky",I Remember Sarah,2001
Igor Kiskatchi,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2001
Igor Kiskatchi,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2001
Igor Kiskatchi,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns,2001
Igor Kiskatchi,"Speak low when you speak, love
Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift, we're swept apart, too soon
Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark, lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go that tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief
We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me, speak love to me and soon",Speak Low,2001
Igor Nazaruk,"How can I just let you walk away,
Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Take a look at me now

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face, oh

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here

Igor Nazaruk,"Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you there's no open door.
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Once we were standing still in time,
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

Now looking back at all we planned,
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to those questions can be?

Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me the spy who loved me 
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin' but just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
 
And nobody does it better 
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you","Nobody Does It Better, song (for the film The Spy Who Loved Me) [From T",2002
Igor Nazaruk,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon

And sometimes I'm out of control
