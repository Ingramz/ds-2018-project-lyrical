Frank Sinatra,"You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how 
I can see the judge's eyes 
As they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 

Oh! You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now 

Does your dad appreciate 
That you are merely great? 
Does your mother realize 
You're such a treat for the eyes? 

You must have been a beautiful baby, 
You must have been a wonderful child 
When you were only startin' 
To go to kindergarten 
I bet you drove the little boys wild! 

An' when it came to winning blue ribbons, 
You must have shown the other kids how 
I can see the judge's eyes 
As they handed you the prize 
I bet you made the cutest bow! 

Oh!, You must have been a beautiful baby, 
'cause baby look at you now (she's a cutie!)

Frank Sinatra,"I'll get by,as long as I have you
Though there be rain and darkness too,

I'll get by, as long as have you",I'll Get By,2008
Frank Sinatra,"Hey! Jealous lover
You're acting so strange
Hey! Jealous lover
What is making you change

Hey! Jealous lover 
How wrong can you be
I'm yours ever faithful
Just be faithful to me

I am just as steady as that clock on the shelf
Maybe you're accusing me of what you're doing yourself

Hey! Jealous lover
I'm telling you true
I know that you're jealous 
But there's no one but you

Could have cheated lots of times but just couldn't do
I was much to busy baby being faithful to you

I know that you're jealous
But there's no one but you

Frank Sinatra,"What is there to write? What is there to say?
Same things happen everyday, not a thing to write, not a thing to say
So I take my pen in hand and start the same old way

Dear, I thought I'd drop a line, the weather's cool, the folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine, p. s. I love you
Yesterday we had some rain, but all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train, p. s. I love you
Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call, and I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess that's all
Nothing else for me to say, and so I'll close but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you, p. s. I love you
I do my best to obey all your wishes, I put a sign up ""Think""
But I gotta buy us a new set of dishes, or wash the ones that are piled in the sink
Nothing else to tell you dear, except each day seems like a year
Every night I'm dreaming of you, p. s. I love you",P. S I Love You,2008
Frank Sinatra,"Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
This I tell you brother
You can't have one without the other

Love and marriage, love and marriage
It's an institute you can't disparage
Ask the local gentry
And they will say it's elementary

Try, try, try to separate them
It's an illusion
Try, try, try, and you will only come
To this conclusion

Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother
You can't have one, you can´t have none
You can't have one without the other

Try, try, try, and you will only come

Frank Sinatra,"Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began.
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face?
Can't you see
I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Ask him to sit this one out. while you're alone,
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone.
You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.
Won't you change partners and then,
You may never want to change partners again.",Change Partners [The Frank Sinatra Collection],2008
Frank Sinatra,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick Out of You [The Frank Sinatra Collection],2008
Frank Sinatra,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out, I faced it all
And I stood tall and did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man what has he got
If not himself then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes it was my way",My Way [DVD],2008
Frank Sinatra,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're ogling
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Frank Sinatra,"Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything started'in to hum
Still it's a real good bet
The best is yet to come

Best is yet to come and babe won't that be fine
You think you've seen the sun
But you ain't seen it shine

Best is yet to come, 
Come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine

We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait til your charms are right for these arms, to surround
You think you've flown before 
But baby you ain't left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait til I draw you near
And wait til you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothing like it here

Frank Sinatra,"I stand at your gate.
And the song that I sing is of moonlight.
I stand and I wait
For the touch of your hand in the June night.
The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade.

The stars are aglow.
And tonight how their light sets me dreaming.
My love, do you know
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you, and I sing you a moonlight serenade.

Let us stray 'til break of day
In love's valley of dreams.
Just you and I, a summer sky,
A heavenly breeze, kissin' the trees.

So don't let me wait.
Come to me tenderly in the June night.
I stand at your gate
And I sing you a song in the moonlight.
A love song, my darling, a moonlight serenade",Moonlight Serenade,2008
Frank Sinatra,"The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind
Warm summer wind
The summer wind",Nothing But the Best,2008

Frank Sinatra,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You [From Babes On Broadway],2008
Frank Sinatra,"I got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got no car,
Got no mule,
Got no misery
Folks with plenty of plenty
They got a lock on the door
Afraid somebody?s gonna rob them while
they're out making more
What for?
I got no lock on the door
that's no way to be
They can steal the rug
From the floor
that's OK with me
Cause the things that I prize
Like the stars in the sky

Are all free
Say I've got plenty of nothing
And nothing is plenty for me.
I got my girl
Got my song,
Got heaven the whole daylong.

Got my lawn

Our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but ever and a day
The radio

And the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble

They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay,2008

I'll tell you no lie 
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky? 
How many times in a day 
Do I think of you? 
How many roses are 
Sprinkled with dew? 

How far would I travel 
Just to be where you are?

But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!

If I loved you.","If I Loved You [From ""Carousel""]",2009
Frank Sinatra,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told, ""seek and ye shall find""
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me","Someone to Watch Over Me [From ""Young at Heart""]",2009

She means her tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around her
I know her thoughts are strong for somebody else

It's worse to fall in love by yourself

We've just begun to know how lucky we are.

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender

I have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay

Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

I smile my secret little smile
Because I know the change in me is you

Do you remember the reason we married in the fall?

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught

Project you right in to space. without any warning

What's the difference: Ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding, ring-a-ding ding
She takes (grabs) your hand - this captivating creature

And like its planned - you're in the phone book looking (hunting) for the nearest preacher

Will sound in the steeple, announcing to people, Love's the loveliest thing

My mother will start to worry (beautiful what's your hurry?)

I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)

I ought to say, no, no, no sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)

I simply must go (but baby, it's cold outside)

So nice and warm (look out the window at this dawn)

My brother will be there at the door (waves upon the tropical shore)

My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)

I've gotta get home(but baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat(it's up to your knees out there)

You've really been grand (i thrill when you touch my hand)

When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star

And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

But when he kisses me it's Christmas everywhere
Troubles fly away and life is easy

Does he love me good?

"Frank Sinatra, Jr.","The bells, the bells, ringing everywhere for the sound of Christmas is in the air,
The bells, the bells, from the steeple above, telling us it's the season of love,
Ring out, let the tale be told that inspires the dream of the young and old,
Love, love, let your hearts unfold, for the bells of Christmas are ringing.
The bells, the bells, on a wintry night, with the friendly fire burning warm and bright,
The bells, the bells, on the steeple above, telling us it's the season of love.
Ring out, let the tale be told, that inspires the dream of the young and old,
Love, love, let your hearts unfold, for the bells of Christmas are ringing.
The bells, the bells, they've been here and now, to a world that almost forgotten how

Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best,
I wouldn't trade Christmas, no no, never would I,
Wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best.

It's time for the holly's of fun, and the folly or all of that jolly jazz,
The people are glowing, the sand is now showing, each window is showing it has
All the latest in choicing, the daddy invoicing and all that razzle that does,
But I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for New Year's Day,

Thanksgiving, Halloween and the rest. Christmas we love you the best.
I wouldn't trade, no, no. never would I, wouldn't trade Christmas, I love you the best.
The traffic gets poky, the turkey gets smoky, and all of that holy stuff,
The people are shopping for things they'll be swapping like filigree boxes of snuff,

Though you pour the hot toddy, to force everybody, though half of the toddy's enough,
I wouldn't trade Christmas, wouldn't trade Christmas for Father's Day or Mother's,
Valentine, and the rest, Christmas we love you the best.
The jingle fell jingle you feel the old tingle, you buy the first single scene.

The idea is clever but subways will never quite handle that huge evergreen.
And the old office party, with Stanley and Molly keep drinking until they turn green.

Six golden lighters, Five ivory combs,
Four mission lights, Three golf clubs, Two silken scarfs,
And a most lovely lavender tie.",The Twelve Days of Christmas,1987

My kind of people too
People who smile at you

And each time I roam, Chicago is
Calling me home, Chicago is

It's my kind of town

My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of razzmatazz
And it has, all that jazz

The union stockyard, Chicago is

"Frank Sinatra, Jr.","Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river

And after while she was holdin' hands with me
My heart was flyin' up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Back like a loop the loop
And around like a merry go round

We ate and ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could, I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

For this is the last time
Backing off the victory roll
I'm not spoiling for a fight
Wear the turquoise mask tonight
Like a thunderclap
The ugly ones attack
There's no turning back
So go Blue Hummingbird
Oh no, not another megalomaniac
Fettered and chained while smoky eagles rise
And the winds four directions will blow
But not erase them from our minds
And the crumpled feathers on this broken wing
Cannot impair our flight oh no
Burning spirits sing
Help my tormented soul to rest
This is not my time nor place
Give the turquoise mask a face

Frank Turner,"I check that I've got all my things before I leave the house,
Because when I'm gone I'm never coming back.
I'm not being melodramatic, it's just I neither have your number or a key.
An evening spent pretending that we're just becoming friends,
Or this goes any further than going back;
I'm not being pessimistic, it's just you and I were never meant to be.

It isn't love, but every time I kind of wish it was.

I've picked up this silly habit in the last few years of going out
In the evening with my friends into the town,
Of packing a spare T-shirt in my bag in case I do not make it home.
It's pathetic and I know it, but the truth is there've been mornings
I've proved prudent taking toothpaste to the pub.
But that's precious little comfort against the knowledge of the person I've become.

Frank Turner,"We were only supposed to go out for the night,
But it's been a few hours now since it got light -
We're a mess, and the worst part is we couldn't care less.
There's water in the ash-tray and ash in the sink,
The carpet's mostly soaking, but there's nothing to drink -
We're a state, and we're starting to regret staying awake.

And I'll pay for my sins when I get paid,
I'll stop talking to girls when I get laid.
I should have gone home when I could, but I stayed.
But then I never was the clever one.

We were only supposed to go out for the night,
I did my best to go home but in the end I lost the fight with myself -
To be honest I was hoping I'd go home with someone else.
And right about now I should be starting my day,
But instead I am sat here downing the dregs of yesterday,
All the while trying to prop up both ends of my smile.

And I'll pay for my sins when I get paid,
I'll stop talking to girls when I get laid.
I should have gone home when I could, but I stayed.
But then I never was the clever one,
But always the one to not see that I'm done and
I need to go home and get to sleep,
Always the last to see the moment has passed and
I need to admit my defeat.
And I'm lonely - there, I said it.
I'm lonely, but it's hard to admit it
When everbody thinks that you're fine all the time and you're not.

So we were only supposed to go out for the night...
But who am I kidding? Try as I might I can't stop
Until I've squeezed out every last drop.

And I'll pay for my sins when I get paid
But I don't have a penny to my name.
I'll stop talking to girls when I get laid
But I haven't had a shower for days.
I should've gone home when I could but I stayed,
And so I stay up alone,
And set off on my own
To the station where I catch the first train.




",I Really Don't Care What You Did on Your Gap Year,2006
Frank Turner,"From the heart of the Southern Downs, to the North-East London reservoirs,
From the start, the land scaped my sound, before I'd ever been to America.

And if I knew anybody who played pedal steel guitar,
I'd get them in my band and then my band would get real far,
But I was raised in middle England, and not in Nashville Tennessee,
And the only person in my band is me.

A simple scale on an old guitar, and a punk rock sense of honesty.
I cannot fail, I've got this far with no knowledge of mid-west geography.

And if I knew anywhere where I could drive in a straight line
For hours in the desert, I'd drive for hours at a time.
But I was raised in middle England, not in Nashville Tennessee,
And the only person in this car is me.

And yes I'm in four-four time, and yes I use cheap cheap rhymes,
But I try to make a sound my own.
I know I don't break new ground, many have travelled this sound,
But I try to make it sound like home.

Well I've been to Texas state, I didn't think it was that fucking great,
And Nebraska is just a bunch of songs,
Holloway and Hampshire where I belong.
And I don't know anybody who plays pedal steel guitar,
All the city roads are twisted and I do not own a car.
I was raised in middle England, not in Nashville Tennessee,
And the only thing I'm offering is me.




",Nashville Tennessee,2006
Frank Turner,"Whatever happened to childhood?
We're all scared of the kids in our neighboorhood;
They're not small, charming and harmless,
They're a violent bunch of bastard little shits.
And anyone who looks younger than me
Makes me check for my wallet, my phone and my keys,
And I'm tired of being tired out
Always being on the lookout for thieving gits.

We're all wondering how we ended up so scared;
We spent ten long years teaching our kids not to care
And that ""there's no such thing as society"" anyway,
And all the rich folks act surprised
When all sense of community dies,
But you just closed your eyes to the other sidev Of all the things that she did.
Thatcher fucked the kids.

And it seems a little bit rich to me,
The way the rich only ever talk of charity
In times like the seventies, the broken down economy
Meant even the upper tier was needing some help.
But as soon as things look brighter,
Yeah the grin gets wider and the grip gets tighter,
And for every teenage tracksuit mugger
There's a guy in a suit who wouldn't lift a finger for anybody else.

You've got a generation raised on the welfare state,
Enjoyed all its benefits and did just great,
But as soon as they were settled as the richest of the rich,
They kicked away the ladder, told the rest of us that life's a bitch.
And it's no surprise that all the fuck-ups
Didn't show up until the kids had grown up.
But when no one ever smiles or ever helps a stranger,
Is it any fucking wonder our society's in danger of collapse?

So all the kids are bastards,
But don't blame them, yeah, they learn by example.
Blame the folks who sold the future for the highest bid:
That's right, Thatcher fucked the kids.




",Thatcher Fucked the Kids,2006
Frank Turner,"A free house, a sound-system and a fridge full of beer;
I've known how this story ends for a good few years.
The night lays out before my eyes, there's no new faces, no surprises.
This town is growing old with me, so I'm making a move.
Everybody round here's been out with everybody else,
Which makes talking to girls hazardous to my health.
They've been in this genepool so long they've got wrinkled toes;
I don't want all her exes to be people I know.
There's millions more fish in the sea, so I'm making a move.

I'm bored of this town, bored of this scene, bored of these people, yeah.
I'm an expert at pretending that everything is OK,
But I'm just a kid and it seems as if I've signed my life away.
I need to get out and see what the rest of the world is about.
This toen ain't big enough for the one of me, I'm making a move.

Every guy with long hair round here is a star,
Accorinding to his girlfriend and the way that he holds his guitar.
If anyone gets out they stick in the knife, I don't want to get stuck here for the rest of my life.
I'm sick of these fuckers, I'm moving on.
I still want to be buried here, just like I said, but I'd prefer it if you'd wait until I'm actually dead.
It's easy to get caught inside a town that seems to have a hive-mind,
But I'm packing up and moving on,
When I move out from my parents' house I'm gone, yeah fuck you guys I'm gone.

This town ain't big enough for the one of me,
So why don't you get from in front of me?
We're all going to move to london anyway, so I'll see you in town.

Because I wanted to walk the walk,
And not just talk the talk,
But it was a bit of a disaster because
I did the sides with kitchen scissors,
Because I didn’t have any clippers,
And I didn’t want to use a beard-trimmer
I’d made that mistake before.

When you got home you didn’t want to talk about what I’d done.
You said I’d let you down, I’d fucked around, when I was only having fun.
With the way that you’ve been lately, you’ve no right to scream and shout.
You and I, we’ve got a lot that we need to talk about.

What’s the point in making vows that you’re never going to keep?
A lifetime lying awake means you’ll never get to sleep.
And all the promises you made, that were painful and untrue,
Of all the things you do they reflect worst on you.

We all have our own devices
For handling mid-life crises
Usually involves a motorbike and
Suspicious fashion decisions.
But you choose to stave off grey hairs by
Lamely hacking at the sides
With lies and flimsy alibis
For your suspicious expeditions.

When I get home I don’t want to talk about what you’ve done.
Yes you’ve let me down, you’ve fucked around, but I guess you were having fun.

You always told me Father’s Day was just another way

Meant every Father’s Day spent wondering who the hell you are.

Frank Turner,"Let's begin at the beginning:
We're lovers and we're losers,
We're heroes and we're pioneers,
And we're beggars and we're choosers.
We're skirting round the edges
Of the ideal demographic.
We're almost on the guestlist,
But we're always stuck in traffic.

We've watched our close associates
Up and play their parts;
They're chatting up the it girls,
And they're tearing up the charts,
While we were paying with coppers
To get our round in at the bar.
We're the see-Team, we're the almost famous
Old friends of the stars.

Justin is the last
Of the great romantic poets,
And he's the only one among us
Who is ever going to make it.
We planned a revolution
From a cheap Southampton bistro.
I don't remember details
But there were English boys with banjos.

Jay is our St George, and he's standing on a wooden chair,
And he sings songs and he slays dragons, and he's losing all his hair.
Adam is the resurrected spirit of Gram Parsons, In plaid instead of rhinestone and living in South London.
And no one's really clear about Tommy's job description,
But it's pretty clear he's vital to the whole damn operation.
Dave Danger smiles at strangers, Tre's the safest girl I know,
Zo and Harps will skamper up to victory in the city we call home.

We won't change our ways, we will proud remain when the glory fades.

I am sick and tired of people
Who are living on the be-list.
They're waiting to be famous
And they're wondering why they do this.

And I know I'm not the one who is habitually optimistic,
But I'm the one who's got the microphone here so just remember this:

Life is about love, last minutes and lost evenings,
About fire in our bellies and furtive little feelings,
And the aching amplitudes that set our needles all a-flickering,
And help us with remembering that the only thing that's left to do is live.

After all the loving and the losing,
For the heroes and the pioneers,
The only thing that's left to do
Is get another round in at the bar.",I Knew Prufrock Before He Got Famous,2008

Not eating, not feeling good anymore

What to say in my defense, I was imperfect tense
Used to have such balance, but I don't know where it went
So won't you be my present sense

Yeah my friend Lex was lying in the hospital
She'd been pretty sick for about half a year
But it seems liked this time the end was drawing near
So dropped my plans and jumped the next London train
I found her laid up and in a lot of pain
Her eyes met mine and then I understood
That her weather forecast wasn't looking too good
So I sat and spun her stories for a little while
Tried to raise her mood and tried to raise a smile
But she silenced all my rambling with a shake of her head
Drew me close and listen this is what she said now

""You'll live to dance another day, 
It's just now you'll have to dance, 
For the two of us, so stop looking so damn depressed 
And sing with all your heart that the Queen is dead""

Yeah she told me she was sick of all the hospital food
And of doctors, distant relatives, draining her blood
She said ""I know I'm dying,
But I'm not finished just yet, 
I am dying for a drink and for a cigarette""
So we hatched a plan to book ourselves a cheap hotel
In the centre of the City and to raise some Hell
They waste to all the clubs 
And then when everyone else is long asleep
We know we're good and done

""You'll live to dance another day
It's just now you'll have to dance

She said that Lex had gone asleep and wasn't waking up
And even though I knew that there was nothing to be done
I felt bad for not being there and now, well, she was gone
So I tried to think what Lex would want me to do
At times like this when I was feeling blue
So I gathered up some friends to spread the sad sad news
And we headed to the City for a drink or two
And we sang

and when I get to your age I won't be such a coward""

And Punk Rock didn't live up to what I hoped that it could be

Are just coasters for beers and clean surfaces for drugs
And I packed all my pamphlets with my bibles at the back of the shelf

Well it was bad enough the feeling, and the first time it hit
When you realized your parents had let the world all go to shit
And that the values and ideals for which many had fought and died
Had been killed off in the committees and left to die by the wayside
But it was worse when we turned to the kids on the left
And got let down again by some poor excuse for protest

In manning the old barricades, 
So come on old friends to the streets

Let's be heroes, let's be martyrs, let's be radical thinkers
Who never have to test drive the least of their dreams
Let's divide up the world into the damned and safe
And then ride to the valleys like the old life brigade
And straighten our backs and we won't be afraid
And they'll celebrate our deaths with a national parade

So come on let's be young, let's be crass enough to care
Let's refuse to live and learn, let's make all our mistakes again yes
And then darling, just for one day, we can fight and we can win

And that's how I miss out, on another night
The kind of night where nothing really happens
Yeah but everything goes down
And at the end I'm just a promise to pick up the phone
When I'm in town

When the evening casts it's shadows on the corners of my days
And I am old and I am settled in the place where I will stay
When my wandering meanderings have finally reached their end

Frank Turner,"The first girl that I fell for was a fair and faithful fighter
She smoldered with a will to save the world
I did my best to help her, yeah I stood shoulder to shoulder
On the front lines with my visionary girl

I wish that she had cared for me
But in the end her ideologies
Occupied the fortress of her heart
I wrote her 15 songs, but still we had to part

And if music was the food of love
Then I'd be a fat romantic slob
Well music, it's my substitute for love

The last girl that I loved she was a low and lusty liar
She set my heart on fire, but made me choke
Her beauty was a sight to see, but she didn't save it all for me
I found other fires by following the smoke

I wish that she had either cared for me or
Let me be
But she chased me from mind and from my home
I wrote her 16 songs, but I ended up alone

And if love is really all that we need
Then even all my singing is never gonna save me
Music it's my substitute for love

Well I've had many different girls inside my bed
But only one or two inside my head
These days I cuddle up to my guitar instead
But oh, what I would give, not to stumble but to really fall in love
And I could substitute my singing for the sound of someone sleeping next to me",Substitute,2008
Frank Turner,"I come from the land of the Wessex downs
From the Hampshire hills near Winchester town
In the country where the soft South rivers flow down
To English channel I roam, this is where I call home
I sing for my supper and I'm pretty well fed
My cross is silent and I make my bed
Where I can find a crown and somewhere to lay my head
And the traveling day is done, 
And all my songs have been sung

But honey I was lonely on the road, 
I was all on my own
Hanging outside at the back of a death metal show
I saw you standing there with your hair down low
A kink in your step that made me want to know
If you would like to take me home
Who'd of thought that a French kiss 
From a Parisian girl could capture an English boy

She comes from the channels of a distant shore
From the land of revolution and of Agincourt
From the Kings blood stain on a tricolour
And the culture a little too high, 
For an English boy like me
She doesn't know the Island I grew up upon
The valleys and the hills that I've roamed along
And she doesn't like my clothes 
And she doesn't like my songs
But she's still my Mademoiselle 
And it goes to show you never can tell

Cos she was a quiet one
She was a shy one
She was the prettier at the show
She crept up so slowly
She crept up behind me
But still she pretended that she didn't know
But all that she thinks of me, and she kissed me
And she's yet to let me go though I'm far away
Across of sea I'm singing for the hope 
That she would ever remember me

So honey when you're lonely on the road, 
You're all on your own
Hanging outside at the back of the country show
Picture me there with hat down low
A smile upon my face to let you know
That I would like to take you home
That I would like to take you home, 
To the hills that I know
I would like to take you home, to the places I go
I would like to take you home
And that's the way that a French kiss 
From an English boy can capture a Parisian girl",To Take You Home,2008

Always paid the rent
But I`ve never set foot inside a tent
Can`t build a fire to save my life

I`ve never slept out underneath the stars,
The closest that I came to that was one time my car
Broke down for an hour in the suburbs at night
I lied about being the outdoor type.

Too scared to let you know you knew what you were looking for
I lied until I fit the bill god bless the great indoors
I lied about being the outdoor type

Frank Turner,"I woke up on a sofa in an unfamiliar house, surrounded by sleeping folks I didn't know.
On failing to find my friends, I decided it was clearly time to go.
So I made my way out of the door as quietly as I could - there was no one there I knew to say goodbye,
Squinting in the sadly sobering sunshine of the Sunday morning light.

I started the night with all my friends and I ended up alone.
I started out so happy now I'm hungover and down.
It was about then that I realized I was half-way through the best years of my life.

I scanned the local landmarks, trying to find out where I was, and maybe even find a bus back home,
Longing for a shower, and for clean sheets, and a charger for my phone.
Suddenly it hit me - I got paid this Friday last, and so I rifled through my pockets for some change.
But all I found was a packet of broken cigarettes and a sinking sense of shame.

I had to ask myself:
Is is really worth it? Is any of this worth it?
Well the whole thing's far from perfect,
But I've yet to figure out a better way to spend my time.

Too many suits and dirty looks made me rack my brains - the real damage started to sink in.
It'd been quite a heavy weekend and I could just about remember where I'd been.
Well I started the night with all my friends and I ended up alone,
I started out so happy now I'm hungover and down.
I stood on a street corner and I felt a little sick.
It was about then that I realized I was halfway through the first day of the week.

It's obvious, the way you move, the way you hold your head
The way you hide your pretty eyes and shift across the bed

You say worse things happen at sea
I say worse things have happened to me

Honestly, I'll be fine, this isn't my first time
I've taken blows before and every time I have survived
You made it clear you didn't care, you never did pretend
And in the end, at least you never try to fuck my friends

You say worse things happen at sea
I said worse things have happened to me
Bitter eyes, the bedroom floor
And we're not gonna talk anymore

Well, honestly, it doesn't matter, I know better than
To cry over spilt milk, wasted effort, spoilt plans
We're adults here so shed no tears, I'm sure we can be friends
I'll nod and smile and watch you in the arms of other men

You say worse things happen at sea
I say worse things have happened to me
Bitter eyes, the bedroom floor
And we're not gonna talk anymore
We got nothing to talk for

Well, honestly, your honesty, it has emerged unscathed 
And I hope you're doin' fine

Are going to get some beers,

To the park and drink them there.
We'll busk out in the sun
Play guitar and sing some songs
Pull up our friends and
Invite them down to share

What might be
The last weekend of the summer
'Cause September getting colder, as it goes
And we haven't done enough
Of this simple kind of stuff,
This year we're clearly getting older
And it shows.

Well work weeks make us weary
School's a distant memory,
And it's easy to ask questions
Of ourselves.
Like where it is we're going?
And what we had to show 
From the sunny days we've
In the shelves.

With expectations of our ultimate direction
All the stations 
That we should have reached by now.
Where we haven't read the script,
And our tender wings are clipped.
And we're scared we might be
Letting someone down.

Listen to these heart-break songs
When nothings really wrong.
And then we smile
When we're asked
And say we're fine.
We're drifting through 
Our middle days,
And creeping,
Into middle age.
And setting in our ways

And now it's time

To decide
Now it's time 
To draw the line
In the sand
And ask 
What's more important than
Days like today,

And meet us here

Meet me where the underground runs out.
Bring a picnic blanket and your pity.
A pen and paper so I can write things down.

Mother, oh dear mother, I wasn't joking when I said,
That I plan to keep doing this until the day I'm dead.
And I'm not a mirror for you when you were young.
But I still remain your faithful only son.

Lately I've been feeling kind of fragile,
Lately I've been feeling all worn out.
What would any of us do, before the dreams that we had came to,
What would there be left to dream about.

Father, oh dear father, I'm not trying to reject,
The values that you held like winning cards up to your chest.
But I can't just do the things that you wish that you'd done,
Though I still remain your faithful only son.

The city, seems so still
When you're looking down, from Highgate Hill.
There's nothing left for us to say,
You taught me everything that I know,
You wouldn't miss me if I stayed,
You never see me if I go.

Weather wears the mountains right down into the sea,
So I will stand in the rain until I am clean.

We fell in love in the summer, 
When the skies were clear,
But I'm still wearing my coat from winter last year.

Confess and cover my sins.
I need to make a home for you before inviting you in.

A landscape shaped by a stream,

Is to try and make me good enough for you.

And it's not long since you and I could have been
Train drivers and astronauts.

Muffled sighs and might-have-beens
Count your blessings, then breathe, 
And count to ten.

And though it doesn't often show,
We are scared because we know

A story honest as it's old of sowing seeds
And setting sail.

But now our hands are soft and weak
And working seven days a week
At these salvation schemes that are bound to fail.

And so the world has changed, 
Worse or better's hard to tell,
But my hope remains within the arms of Isabel.

And I'll admit that I am scared
Of what I don't understand.

Gentle voice and soothing hands,
To quiet my despair,
To shore up all my plans,
Darling, if you're there

Falling apart, he knew in his heart that his time had come.

I could have played safe,
But in the end the journey's 
Brought joys that outweigh the pain.""

Odysseus sat tired and alone.
He'd always held out against 
All the doubts that he would come home.
But now he was here,

His son and his Gods, everything changed.

""I could have stayed and ruled as an Ithican prince,
I could've played safe.

Joys that outweigh the pain.""

Balthazar rode for seven long years, 
Eastwards and far,
He followed his star,

Too small for a crown.

""I could have lived with my Gods as a Persian prince,
I could've played safe,
But in the end the journey's brought 
Joys that outweigh the pain.""

I'm not playing to pass time, 
I'm playing for keeps.

We only just started and you're throwing the fight.
You'd rather burn out than fade away? 
Well why not both, I plan to stay.

I used to act like none of this mattered, 
I used to say that I didn't care,
That we wouldn't be doing this forever,

I'm going to end my days in a house with high windows

And on my seventieth birthday I'll see you right here, 
And together we'll watch the sun set.

There's no one in my coffin, 
There's nothing in my grave,
I'm tired of being damned,

Free verse powered of the street light mains,

Between the end of the club and the sun coming out.
Leave Kerouac at his desk, we have romance in our risks.

And here's what we believe,
Before we get bored, let's be inspired,
Let's ignore the applause and set the theater on fire,
Fight every war like the drunks in the choir,
Put our art where our mouths are: Poetry of the deed.
So enough with words and technical theses,
Let's grab life by the throat and live it to pieces.

We can choose, we can change,
And if we don't, we're just afraid of living life 
Like we're loved and in love and alive

To take the last few steps to the bathroom door 
From his bedroom floor and to lock himself in. 

Steady young hands, meticulous plans, 
Disposable razors and a blister-pack filled 
With strong sleeping pills, and a bath of hot water. 

He carefully wrote a funerary note 
On his best writing paper to set out the facts, 
And sealed it with wax, and left it in the kitchen. 

He left it out so his parents would know 
What there was waiting for them
Pale cold skin and blood seeping in to the landing carpet.

He said he's not for sale, said that he felt hounded, 
Crowded and surrounded by this life he didn't choose. 
But everybody plays this game on a daily basis. 
They're not heroes, they're survivors, 
And it's not Shakespearean if they lose. 

So do what you want, 
Do what the voices tell you, 
But don't ever say that we didn't warn you.

But he bought into his failure. 
He's telling tales that hammer nails right into open palms.

He's best at being worst, 
The rest of us are cursed 
But we keep calm and we carry on.

Frank Turner,"Once an honest man could go from sunrise to its set 
Without encountering agents of his state or government 
But a sorry cloud of tyranny has fallen across the land 
Brought on by hollow men, who did not understand 
That for centuries our forefather have fought and often died 
To keep themselves unto themselves, to fight the rising tide 
And that if in the smallest battles we surrender to the state 
We enter in a darkness whence we never shall escape 

When they raise their hands up our lives to possess 
To know our souls, to drag us down, we'll resist.

To meet the king at Smithfield and issue this demand: 
That Winchester's should be the only law across the land

That a government will only work for its own benefit 
And I'd rather stand up naked against the elements alone 
Than give the hollow men the right to enter in my home 

When they raise their hands up our lives to possess 
To know our souls, to drag us down, we'll resist. 

Stand up Sons of Liberty and fight for what you own 
Stand up Sons of Liberty and fight, fight for for your homes.

And not thinking that you're better

If you're oh, so fucking different 
Then who cares what you have to say?

'Cause there's no such thing as rockstars 
There's just people who play music
And some of them are just like us 
And some of them are dicks
So, quick turn off your stereo
Pick up that pen and paper
Yeah, you can do much better 
Than some skinny half-arsed English country singer

Come ye, come ye, to toilet circuit touring snobs.
Come ye, come ye, to bedrooms, bars and bunker squats.

Now who'd have thought that after all,
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all.
And who'd have thought that after all, it was rock 'n' roll.

Hear ye, hear ye, now anybody could take this stage.
Hear ye, hear ye, and make miracles for minimum wage.
Hear ye, hear ye, these folk songs for the modern age,
Will hold us in their arms.

Right here, right now, Elvis brings his children home.
Right here, right now, you never have to feel alone.
Right here, right now, teenage kicks and gramophones.

Yeah, in Jerry Lee and in Johnny and all the greats.
And I still believe (I still believe) in the sound,
That has the power to raise a temple and tear it down.

And I still believe (I still believe) in the need,
For guitars and drums and desperate poetry.
And I still believe (I still believe) that everyone,
Can find a song for every time they've lost and every time they've won.

So just remember folks we not just saving lives, we're saving souls,
And we're having fun.

And I still believe.

They cast long shadows in the evening sun
But when the morning comes they've moved along

Hey hey Mr Dylan I have written you a song
About the river of new singers that still rolls along
So here's to Reagan, here's to Marwood, here's to Tim and Jonah too

Sing for the records you played till they broke
For the parts where you insisted that nobody spoke
Sing for the words that you know but they still make you choke

Rushing through the suburbs to the station to catch the train
Heading up to town to Dave's to get my glad rags on

Excuses stretched thin and it's hard not giving up
Tonight we're going to get it right, we're going to have us a good one

And the roll call is missing a name
Since you left things haven't been the same
But I don't blame you, there was nothing here to make you stay
But I remember the way that you'd light up a room when you walk in,
The way that you'd lead a crowd when you sing
Jamie, this one is for you.

Pre-club beers at Dan's before we hit the road
Nicely warmed up, pleasantly half-loaded
Ready for a night on fire, we're going to get out the big guns
And I run down the numbers, scan through the faces
Run through the plans, scout out the places
I'm electrified, surrounded, but still missing something or someone

I'm wide awake in the cityscape

You did your time out on the road
One day you stayed away for good
You found a home down by the shore
A place to hang your hat and more
You sent me postcards to tell me of
Slowing down and finding love
The thrill has gone from the city life
I'm not far behind

So you can strike my name from the roll call,

Leave this loveless lonely behind

Not long after the Northmen had come
A low and evil deed was done
In the dark of the New Forest

From the shores of Normandy King William came
To Albion fair, King Harold to slay
With greed in his heart and his scurrilous claim
He took the land for his own
He took the land for his own

Now John was a blacksmith, an honest old man
He raised up his children and worked with his hands
At his family's forge in the patch of land
In the dark of the New Forest
In the dark of the New Forest

King William rode out after his victory
To ravage the land in his hunger to thieve
For hunting grounds in the Wessex trees
He took the land for his own
He took the land for his own

But if you steal the land of an Englishman
Then you will know this curse
Your first born son's warm blood will run
Upon the English earth

Now King William's son was called Rufus the Red
He took up the crown when his father was dead
And he rode the hunting grounds in his stead
In the dark of the New Forest
In the dark of the New Forest

But John's curse it called out and Lord Terryl fired low
The arrow struck William with a sickening blow
And he fell from his horse to the ground below
And the land took him for it's own

Raise up your lowered head and hear the liberation beat,

No cowering in the dark before these overbearing priests,
Not waiting until we die until we restitute the meek,
No blaming all our failings on imaginary beasts,
Because there never was no God.

No fighting over land your distant fathers told you of,
Not spilling blood for those who have never spread a drop of love,
No finger pointing justified by phantoms up above,
Because there never was no God.

There is no God,
So clap your hands together,
There is no God,
No heaven and no hell.
There is no God,
We're all in this together,
There is no God,
So ring that victory bell.

I know you're scared of dying man and I am too,

Frank Turner,"I keep having dreams
Of pioneers and pirate ships and Bob Dylan
Of people wrapped up tight in the things that will kill them
Of being trapped in a lift plunging straight to the bottom
Of open seas and ways of life we've forgotten
I keep having dreams

Amy worked in a bar in Exeter
I went back to her house and I slept beside her
She woke up screaming in the middle of the night
Terrified of her own insides
Dreams of pirate ships and Patty Hearst
Breaking through a life over-rehearsed
She can't remember which came first
The house, the home, or the terrible thirst
She keeps having dreams

And on the worst days
When it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons
She's got her cowboy boots and car keys on the bed stand
So she can always run
She can get up, shower, and in half an hour she'll be gone

I keep having dreams of things I need to do
And waking up and not following through
But it feels like I haven't slept at all
When I wake to a silence and she's facing the wall
Posters of Dylan and of Hemingway
An antique compass for a sailor's escape
She says you just can't live this way
And I close my eyes and I never say
I'm still having dreams

And on the worst days
When it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons
I sleep with my passport
One eye on the back door
So I can always run
I can get up, shower, and in half an hour I'll be gone

And come morning
I am disappeared
Just an imprint on the bedsheets
I'm by the roadside with my thumb out
A car pulls up, and Bob's driving
So I climb in
We don't say a word
As we pull off into the sunrise
And these rivers of tarmac are like arteries across the country
We are blood cells alive in the bloodstream
The beating heart of the country
We are electric pulses
In the pathways of the sleeping soul of the country
We are electric pulses
In the pathways of the sleeping soul of the country

The very last of my desires
Is that you take my broken body
And commit it to the fire

And then when the fire is finished
Scrape the ashes in a tin
Take them down to London's drinking reservoirs
And throw them in

And then specks infinitesimal of my mortal remains
Will slide down seven million throats and into seven million veins
And I will creep through their capillaries to the marrow of their bones
And they will wake to bright new mornings and then wordlessly they'll know 

That I remain
I am remembered
I remain

And from there into the channel across the great Atlantic Ocean

By a loving or a vengeful God
Or one who condescends
Who'll wash his hands down in the mire among the misery of men
Or by ever turning circles hanging timeless in the sky
Like a dream catcher distracting from the fact you're gonna die

But I place one foot before the other
Confident because
I know that everything we are right now is everything that was
That Watt Tyler, Woody Guthrie, Dostoevsky and Davy Jones
Are all dissolved into the ether and have crept into my bones

Were once carved into the details of two feet upon the sand

When Springsteen came clear in my headphones with a pertinent question
Oh is love really real and can any of us hope for redemption
Or are we are merely biding our time down to the lonely conclusions

How loneliness edged into deep seeded psychosis
Lying away in crowded hotel rooms focused on takers
With my feelings laid clear on the ceiling

You deserved better

Out of trash some might back in my ears
Sound comes clear and brings the awful truth that I can't stand what I've done to you
And it's written clear in my diary today should have been our anniversary
And I'm far way and I'm far apart
And you're back home with a broken heart
And loves is real and I can't escape
I'll only ever have myself to blame

Like a fever I can't break try as I might
Wake me darling I need you to take me home
But I know in the end redemption is mine and mine alone

I wandered up the rolling Humber
And down the Thames to London town

Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me

You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks

Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road

Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken

There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win",Thunder Road,2011
Frank Turner,"The single saddest thing that I ever heard you say
Was on the day I told you I had to go away
You said “Darling baby please, if you really mean to leave
Can't I just hold you for a little while longer?”

And the single hardest thing I ever had to do
Was take your arms from round me and walk away from you
And I know I shouldn't have kissed you as a I left
Darling I should have been stronger

Not with a bang but with a whimper
It wasn't hard, it was kind of simple
Three short steps from your bed to your door
Darling I can't look you in the eyes now and tell you I'm sure
If I love you anymore

You see, I did my very best, I've given you these years
Of love and understanding, telephone calls and tears
But now the little things you do that used to make me love you
Now just cramp my heart a little and let it slip

And we've met this sorry end from a picture perfect start
The romance and the running down to disconnected hearts
Of two people sad and free, who know they used to be
More than just a pair of sinking ships

Not with a bang but with a whimper
It wasn't hard, it was kind of simple
Three short steps from your bed to your door
Darling I can't look you in the eyes now and tell you I'm sure
If I love you anymore

I'm not drinking anymore, but I'm then I'm not drinking any less
I can't do this anymore, oh you know I did my best

Frank Turner,"As I walked out one morning fair,
I found myself drawn thoughtlessly
Back to the place we used to live,
And you still do, now without me.

Around the back, away from the road,
Behind the bins, beneath your window,
I found the hulk, the rusting bulk
Of a shattered old piano.
Someone had torn out some of the keys
With cruel care, not thoughtlessly,
In such a way that one could only play
Minor melodies.

So I sat down in my sadness, beneath your window,
And I played sad songs on the minor keys of a broken piano;
A sinner amongst saved men on the banks of the muddy Thames.

As I have wandered through this city,
Like a child lost in the London fog,
From Highgate Hill, down to the river,
Then washed downstream past the Isle of Dogs,

I've had time enough to think upon
The question of what kind of songs
That you would choose to listen to
Now that I am gone.
And as I drift beneath that bridge,
Just down the road from where you live,
I've often thought I might have caught
Your voice upon the wind.

But as I stroked those broken keys
You did not join in harmony.",Broken Piano,2013
Frank Turner,"Parents don't be too kind to your kids,
Or how else will they grow up to be
Louche Parisian sinners or Nashville country singers,
Singing about the terrible things their parents did?
Lovers don't be sparing with the truth;
Break their hearts if that's what you must do.
Fill them with remorse, tinged with hope of course,
And let their baser instincts pull them through.

And though it seems a little strange to me,
People never really change, it seems.

And all across America,
Waitresses and boys who play guitar,
They fall in love and fall out, the boys have something to sing about,
The girls go drown their sorrows at the bars.
While in front rooms across the old country,
Sat spellbound in front of their TVs,
The younger brothers and sisters wonder at what they're missing,
And wonder how the air tastes when you're really free.

And though it seems a little strange to me,
People never really change, it seems.
We're all broken boys and girls, at heart,
Come together fall apart.

And in Battersea power station, the fisher king
Ponders on his ruin, among many other things.
He folds his broken hands,
Surveys his barren lands,
And prays for hope to whisper in the wind.

We were born without meaning, we will die without reason,
And the world will not shrug all that much at our passing.
Yes you can try and try and try,
But no one ever makes it out alive.

With your tattered flags unfurled:
Fix yourselves then fix the fisher king.
Won't you fix yourselves to fix the fisher king?",The Fisher King Blues,2013
Frank Turner,"Because we're all so very twenty first century,
You're probably listening to me on some kind of portable stereo
Maybe you're sitting on the back of the bus,
Or it's running up your sleeve, and you're across from your boss,
Or you're sitting in your bedroom on your own with the lights down low
I'd like to teach you four simple words, so that next time you come to a show,
You could sing those words back at me like they're the only ones that you know:

I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust and love and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance, I want to dance

Hi ho hi ho hi ho, we're heading out to the punk rock show
Colleagues and friends condescend with a smile,
But this is my culture man, this is my home
The dark huddled masses gather at the gate,
Yeah, the doors are at 7, and the show starts at 8
A few precious hours in a space of our own,
And when the band comes on, the only thing I really know:

I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust and love and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance, I want to dance

Yeah is anybody else sick of the music
That's churned out by lacklustre scenesters from Shoreditch?
Yeah it's all sex drugs and sins, like they're extras from Skins,
But it's OK because they don't really mean it
I want bands who had to work for their keep,
Drove a thousand miles and played a show on no sleep,
Sleeping on the floor in a stranger's place,
Hungry just to do it all again the next day

I want to dance, I want to dance
I want lust and love and a smattering of romance
But I'm no good at dancing, and yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance, I want to dance

So put your hands on your hips, bring your knees in tight
Yeah we do this shit together man, no fists, no fights
We're not trying to shape the world so people think like us,
We just want our own space to dance, no favors no fuss
On blood sweat and vinyl we have a built ourselves a house,
So if the roof is on fire then we're going to put it out
Forget about the bitching and remember that you're blessed,
Punk is for the kids who never fit in with the rest, alright
Somebody told me that music with guitars
Was going out of fashion, and I had to laugh
This shit wasn't fashionable when I fell in love,
If the hipsters move on why should I give a fuck?

I want to dance, I want to dance,
I want me some lust and love and a smattering of that old time romance
But I'm no good at dancing, yet I have to do something
Tonight I'm going to play it straight, I'm going to take my chance
Yeah, I want to dance, I want to dance
I want me and you both to join hands down at the front

In the darkness of a dozen dingy dance halls
In countless queues in cafes in the suburbs
In the bed clothes of a thousand stranger's bedrooms

In the hollow hell of many hundred hotels
In the solitary stillness of the early hours
I still do

Sometimes the things you need are right back where you started from

So fuck you Hollywood
For teaching us that love was free and easy
For dressing all our daughters as princesses
For gulling us with tales of happy endings

And fuck you, Mötley Crüe
For charming us with access and with excess
For telling tales that leave out all the dark sides
For bringing out the lowest drive in everyone
Oh, fuck you

Sometimes the things you need are right back where you started from
Sometimes the things you need, they hang around a little while
Then they're good and gone

If I could just have a second try
I'd take the second call you made that night

In the days when I was younger

And I used to think that I
Would never live past twenty five

I was so scared before and after I was so proud when it was new

You always said that if you had another one it would be me.

The misspent youth.
And yeah we ran out of miles,

And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing

Amelie lied to me, this was supposed to be easy
I found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night
But sleeping gets tiring, and dark reminds me of dying
And as long as this feeble heart is still beating
You will find me rushing through every room, switching on all the lights

The problem with falling in love in late-night bars
Is that there's always more nights, there's always more bars
The problem with showing your lover your scars
Is that everybody's lover is covered in scars

So, give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything
It was a wonderful life when we were together
And now I've fucked up

Everything's gone fractious, and I felt faithless
At that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart
But baby I didn't mean it, for things to get desperate
I let slip my guard, I let go of the rudder
Now we're drifting in the current away from one another

Fold your hands, speak my name like a curse
Upon your pretty lips, the pressured white behind your fingertips

And when you see me for all that I am
I couldn't make mistakes to make a difference any more
I'd throw myself down on my knees, at your hands
And beg you for forgiveness for my fuck ups and my faults

But in the stillness of the moment it takes for a Polaroid picture
To capture our faces forever and
The world has turned a touch on its axis
And the only thing certain is
That everything changes

And they closed the Astoria
At the end of last summer
The place we earned our pedigrees
Scene of our victories

And you can't remember anything except way you sound
When you told me you didn't know what I should do

It's a long road out to recovery from here,
A long way back to the light
A long road out to recovery from here,
A long way to make it right

And so I wake up in the morning just like every other day
And just like every boring blues song I get swallowed by the pain,
And so I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away
But you're not lying there any longer and I know
That it's my fault so I been pounding on the floor
And I've been crawling up the walls and I've been divvying my darkness
And Serotonin boosters, cider and some kind of smelling salts

If anybody ever asks us well let's say that we met in jail
And that's the story that I'm sticking to like
A southern face that comforts but today I need to hear
Some truth if I'm ever getting through this
Yea you once sent me a letter that said if I was lost at sea
Close my eyes and catch a time idea and only think of me
Well darling now I'm sinking I'm as lost as
Lost can be and I'm hoping you can drag me
Off and down and out to my recovery

If you could just give me a sign and just a subtle little glimmer,
A suggestion that you'd have me if I could only make me better
Then I'd stand a little stronger as I walk a little taller all the time
'Cause I know that you are cynical but I think
I can convince you yea 'cause broken people
Can get better if they really want to
Or at least that's what I have to tell myself if I'm hoping to survive

You can't just keep waltzing out of my life,
Leaving clothes on my bedroom floor,
Like nothing really matters, like pain doesn't hurt.
You should be more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt.

You kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I made when I was a kid,
With a disassembled disposable razor I stole from my dad,
When I thought that suffering was something profound,
That weighed down on wise heads,
And not just something to be avoided,
Something normal people dread.

With all the things I've done and the places I've been
I'd be a machine if I had stayed the same.
But you're still back where we started, you haven't changed at all.
You're still trying to live like a kid, like you can always have it all.

You know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I hid as best I could,
That I covered with ink, but in the right kind of light they still bleed through,
Showing that there are some things I just can't change no matter what I do:
The tell-tale signs of being used,
Of being trapped inside of you.

You're a beautiful butterfly
Burned with a branding iron
Onto my outsides into my insides
As a simple sign:
To show off your ownership.
Burned into my naked skin,
Onto my outsides into my insides.

It's just a claim upon my soul.
It stains my skin, yeah it's on my breath,
And I'm ashamed to get undressed
In front of strangers in case they see
The tell tale signs that you have left all over me.

God dammit Amy.
You'll always remind me of scars on my arms that I know will never fade.
And it's not like it's something I think about each and every day -
I just occasionally catch myself scratching them, as if they'd ever go away.

And don't know where I am.

I've forgotten how to stand.

And gather thoughts to think:
That if all I had was one long road
It could drive a man to drink.

But then I remember you,
And the way you shine like truth in all you do.
And if you remembered me,
You could save me from the way I tend to be.

Because I've said I love you so many times that the words kinda die in my mouth.
And I meant it each time with each beautiful woman but somehow it never works out.
You stood apart in my calloused heart, and you taught me and here's what I learned:
That love is about the changes you make and not just three small words.

Catching your scent on someone else
In a crowded space
And it takes me somewhere I cannot quite place.

I found an old film camera that I thought I'd thrown away
But there it was covered in dust
I checked it and the film inside still had a few pictures left
So I just snapped it off and then
I found a place on the high street that could still develop them
I dropped them off and clean forgot,
It wasn't until this morning that I picked the pictures up

And there before my eyes in vivid colour
Pictures of her stood smiling bold on the edge of a cliff by the sea
On the south coast somewhere,
Wind in her hair wrapped against the cold

There were many other pictures in the set,
Most of them were taken in the first months after we met
When we were lovers like happy drunks
Stumbling for each other with each step, each breath in our lungs
Pictures of nights from soho bars
A weekend in the country when she bought my sister's car,
Her naked, serene on a hotel bed
Smiling at the camera, her beauty like a word unsaid

And there before my eyes on the glossy paper
Quiet whispers of something I had lost or put aside for the longest time
The hope that I might find some kind of peace

Oh oh oh where did it go go go
I just don't know exactly where I kept it
There right there under the stairs oh please
Darling I swear swear swear that's where I left it
Secret little things that you keep locked away
In a small wooden box that you barely even mention to yourself
It's not exactly hope, nothing quite as simple as youth
Perhaps it's just a way of looking past the truth
We're all fading away
The truth I can see in the very last frame of that long lost roll of film
A picture of me, a young man holding a camera up to a mirror

And there before my eyes in that old reflection a declaration bold
We won't stay gold, all that's left of her and rest
Is a small locked box of undeveloped films and photographs",Undeveloped Film [*],2013

And the girls I like, they don't kiss too many boys

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

What do we want?
And when do we want it?
And how would we feel if we knew that we were never gonna get it?
And where did we start from?
And where are we going?
Can anyone here say with any certainty that they know what they're doing?

Ever feel like an awkward understudy thrown into a cast where you just don't get along?
Crowd and the crew all standing silent staring and you can't shake the feeling that somehow you're doing it wrong

What do we want?

Mum and dad always seem like that had a plan
Everything fell apart when mum moved on, now dad's a broken man
And all these decisions that keep getting made
I can't remember making them and nobody wants to explain

We're all awkward understudies wearing comfortable shoes getting comfortable with doing it wrong
Missed the dress rehearsals and we had to rush a drink before the show but now it's show time and we're singing our song!

Fall in love with every person who ever made your heart want to skip a beat

What do we want?
We shall not overcome!
We shall not go well!
Hey, hey!

Because the lives we lead, they will be so very perfect

Frank Turner,"A mother said, ""Beware of boys in bands
And certainly don't let them write you songs
For they will come to you on bended knee and kiss your pretty hands
When the singing's done, and the suns up they'll be gone.""
While her mother has a point, I might resent the implication.
That every boy who plays guitar plays women like Gene Simmons.

4600 photographs, stuck into a scrapbook beneath your bed.
4599 broken hearts, and one more you can't get out of your head.
And though you swear you can remember every pair of lips you've kissed
Deep down you're scared there's 1 or 2 you might've missed.

Oh, Chaim Witz, wherefore art though?
Does your mother know who you are now?

Not that I can point a finger, I've been a sinner just the same
Fallen hard in love in motels and by sunrise lost their name.
And I have crept out into cold air in the smallest hours to leave
And in the pockets of my jacket I've kept my last infidelities

A navy coin and a broken plastic compass that someone gave me.
That can't find north anymore. Just like me.

Oh, Gene Simmons, wherefore art though?
I could sure use a hand on my shoulder now.

In a council place there on the edge of town

It would be nice to holiday 
Till they took her job away 

They just took her life away

When you've nothing from which to run 
You've nowhere left to run

And I can fuck up anything, anything.
It was a wonderful life when we were together,
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing.

Amelie lied to me, this was supposed to be easy.
I found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night.
But sleeping gets tiring, and dark reminds me of dying,
And as long as this feeble heart is still beating,
You will find me rushing through every room, switching on all the lights.

The problem with falling in love in late bars
Is that there's always more nights, there's always more bars.
The problem with showing your lover your scars
Is that everybody's lover is covered in scars.

Things got fractious, and I felt faithless,
At that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart.
But baby I didn't mean it, for things to get desperate.
I let slip my guard, let go of the rudder,
Now we're drifting in the current away from one another.

So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything.
It was a wonderful life when we were together,
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing,

Brave, and not just standing, but jumping in,
Of making circles into squares, of laying down
The bare facts like a burden I can't bear.
And I can almost find the words, but I can see the way you'd
Fold your hands, speak my name like a curse
Upon your pretty lips, the pressured white behind your fingertips.

And when you see me for all that I am
I couldn't make mistakes to make a difference any more.
I'd throw myself down on my knees, at your hands,
And beg you for forgiveness for my fuck ups and my faults.
And maybe you'd relent and return my hope for our forever,
Lift up your precious hands, and then bring yours and mine together,
So just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather.",Plain Sailing Weather [#],2014

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line

It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider

Christa McAuliffe gazed in horror as the o-rings failed
And she died, and she died, and she died
For the next agonising two minutes and forty five seconds
She called out the truth on a broken radio
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive

It came as some surprise to realise that as she lost everything
The world was revealing a transmission so real that she understood everything
You're still alive, you're still alive

Four thousand nautical miles as the crow flies away
A home made ham radio
In the loft of a Hampshire family home
Came alive, came alive, came alive
And so the poor old amateur operator thus became the only person to hear
Christa's last desperate communique
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive

It came as some surprise to realise what he didn't catch everything
The world was revealing a transmission so real that he understood everything
You're still alive

And Christa said
The darkness up above
Led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need
Were down here in the deep blue sea
The darkness up above
Led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need
Were down here in the deep blue sea
The darkness up above
Led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need

But now I am helplessly silent instead
There's a hole in my heart and in my head
Why didn't you call?

Why didn't you say something, on the last time we met?
Why didn't you say something? There's always hope left
And I can't say for certain what I would have done
But I can't do anything now that you're gone
And it kills me to think that for a second you felt alone

Now you can measure the mark of a man on the day that he died
In the mixture of memory and wreckage that he leaves behind
And I know you were carrying too much weight on the evening when you slipped away
But I loved you like a brother, man, and I never really had a chance to say

So at half past nine each evening, I'll think of my friend
And at half past nine, I'll remember you were better than your end
'Cause I too have stood up on that ledge,
But I know you'd have pulled me back down from the edge
And I let you down in your darkness, I wasn't there

So I'll remember you making a hole through the kids in the crowd
And I remember you lifting me up, each time I fell down
And I'll glance at the barrier when I'm watching the band
And I'll expect to see you there stood on the foot stand

But I guess I will see someone else

Because the last time that I saw him he was on his needs knees, he was praying

Laying low, waiting on the next storm
I don't want spend the whole of my life inside

Frank Turner,"I have wandered
Through the dark
Through the dirt
I was hurt
And in the end I came back to the start
And I stumbled
Lord knows how I stumble
I slipped on myself, no help from anyone else
I fell in love and I was humbled

There she is
Isn't she everything?
There she is
Isn't she everything?

Down at the bottom
I found the things I'd forgotten
Then despite all I've done, I can learn, I can learn in this time
Gonna hold onto that
I'm gonna forgive myself
And then ask for forgiveness
Crossing my fingers and toes
'Cause God only knows I need this
Lord how I need this

Frank Turner,"""Stop asking musicians what they think""
He said softly as he poured himself a second drink
And outside, the world slipped over the brink
We all thought we had nothing to lose
That we could trust in crossed fingers and horseshoes
That everything would work out, no matter what we choose

The first time it was a tragedy
The second time is a farce
Outside it's 1933 so I'm hitting the bar

But I don't know what's going on anymore
The world outside is burning with a brand new light
But it isn't one that makes me feel warm
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn

If I was of the greatest generation I'd be pissed
Surveying the world that I built slipping back into this
I'd be screaming at my grandkids: ""We already did this""
Be suspicious of simple answers
That shit's for fascists and maybe teenagers
You can't fix the world if all you have is a hammer

The first time it was a tragedy
The second time is a farce
Outside it's 1933 so I'm hitting the bar

Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn
For the dawn

Aren't you ashamed of this?
I surely hope that you are
We live in a society that's maybe heading for Mars

But down here we still have a shower of bastards leading the charge

Let's make America great again
By making racists ashamed again
Let's make compassion in fashion again
Let's make America great again

Well I've been fortunate to go 'round the continent
From California through the midwest and Providence
And I've mostly only encountered common sense
Hospitality and warmth from Americans
But I wish it was a bit less significant
The program and the name of the President
Because it seems to me the truth is self-evident
You fought our king to be independent

In the shining city on the hill
Where nobody can be illegal

By making racists ashamed again
Let's make compassion in fashion again

And call them out when they're faltering
Remind them of their best selves and then

Frank Turner,"I've got the 21st century survival blues
A condition brought on by watching the news
Things have been quiet for far too long
And if I know human beings, things are gonna go wrong
We were raised in a glade of unsustainable peace
Not many of us ever have to live on our knees
I'm scared that I won't have the strength that it takes
To stand up when the levee breaks

So meet me at home when the sirens go off
I don't wanna be alone so don't you get lost
I know a place where the two of us can hide
We can barricade the door and we'd be safe inside
When the harsh winds blow and the world gets cold
You can't trust kindness and you can't eat gold
I've got the 21st century survival blues
But to tell you the truth I just need you

I've got the 21st century survival blues
A generation raised up without paying its dues
Comfortable enough to play around with doubt
Without knowing how to survive when the lights go out
And if we take away the things that they've been depending on
We'll be flailing like children in a nursery home
So I started making lists of the essential things
For when the storms bring what they bring

So meet me at home when the sirens go off
I don't wanna be alone so don't you get lost
And I know a place where the two of us can hide
We can barricade the door and we'd be safe inside
When the harsh winds blow and the world gets cold
You can't trust kindness and you can't eat gold
I've got the 21st century survival blues
But to tell you the truth I just need you-you
I just need you, you

I've got the 21st century survival blues
I've got shelter, drinking water I've got cupboards of food
And I know I can survive in my apocalypse home
But what's the point of surviving if you're just surviving alone

So meet me at home when the sirens go off
I don't wanna be alone so don't you get lost
And I know a place where the two of us can hide
We can barricade the door and we'd be safe inside
When the harsh winds blow and the world gets cold
No you can't trust kindness and you can't eat gold

Frank Turner,"History's been leaning on me lately
I can feel the future breathing down my neck
And all the things I thought were true
When I was young, and you were too
Turned out to be broken
And I don't know what comes next

In a world that has decided
That it's going to lose its mind
Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind

They've started raising walls around the world now
Like hackles raised upon a cornered cat
On the borders, in our heads
Between things that can and can't be said
We've stopped talking to each other
And there's something wrong with that

So before you go out searching
Don't decide what you will find
Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind

You should know you're not alone
And trouble comes, and trouble goes
How this ends, no one knows
So hold on tight when the wind blows

The wind blew both of us to sand and sea
And where the dry land stands is hard to say
As the current drags us by the shore
We can no longer say for sure
Who's drowning, or if they can be saved

And when you're out there floundering
Like a lighthouse I will shine
Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind

Like a beacon reaching out
To you and yours from me and mine
Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind

In a world that has decided
That it's going to lose its mind
Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind",Be More Kind,2018

In a bind and way behind

Pickin' on a guitar, playing it hot
And the devil jumped on a hickory stump
And said I'll tell ya what

I guess you didn't know it

And if you care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you

But if you loose the devil gets your soul

And said I'll start this gig
And fire flew from his finger tips
As he resined up his pick
He strummed the pick across the strings
It made an evil hiss

And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
Let me show you how it's done

Fire on the mountain run boys run
Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Ready says you don't fight, no child, no
Let's go

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
He laid that golden guitar
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said Devil come on back 
If you ever want to try again
I told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best I've ever been

Frank Usher,"I am the assassin, with tongue forged from eloquence
I am the assassin, providing your nemesis
On the sacrificial altar to success, my friend
Unleash a stranger from a kiss, my friend
No incantations of remorse, my friend
Unsheath the blade within the voice
My friend, my friend, my friend, my friend

I am the assassin
Who decorates the scarf with the fugi knot
Who camouflaged emotion in the thousand-yard stare
Who gouged the notches in the family tree
Who hypnotized the guilt in career rhythm trance

Assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin
(Assassin, my friend.)

Listen as the syllables of slaughter cut with calm precision
Patterned frosty phrases rape your ears and sew the ice incision
Adjectives of annihilation bury the point beyond redemption
Venomous verbs of ruthless candor plagiarize assassins` fervour
Apocalyptic alphabet casting spell, the creed of tempered diction
My friend, your friend, the assassin
A friend in need is a friend that bleeds
Let bitter silence infect the wound
I am the assassin, (your friend)
Assassin

You were a sentimental mercenary in a free-fire zone
Parading a Hollywood conscience
You were a fashionable objector with a uniform fetish
Pavlovian slaver at the cash-till ring of success
A non-com observer, I assassin, the collector... defector

So you resigned yourself to failure, my friend
And I emerged the chilling stranger, my friend
To eradicate the problem, my friend
Unsheath the blade within the voice
Within the voice, within the voice
Within the voice

And what do you call assassins who accuse assassins, anyway
My friend?",Assassing,1993
Frank VanTijn,"Clouds are only dewdrops that once kissed a rose
Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender

Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams

Kings don't mean a thing

Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams

All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.

Kommt es am Block zu Stress läufst du wie 'ne Fotze weg
Wenn willst du beeindrucken Missgestalt?
Ich zerstör euch mit Gewalt weil ihr alles Bitches seid
Komm nach Schöneberg ich zieh dir deine Jordans ab
Wie man ein Banger ist? Ich hab es euch vorgemacht
Meine Marke auf der Straße, Maskulin
Mein Auto fickt euch alle, Bumblebee

Alles Heavy Metal, so wie meine Kette
Komm mir nicht mit wenn und aber, bla, hätte hätte
Maskulin, Frank White im gelben Mustang
Du Opfer hältst die Luft an, da drüben hält dein Bus an
Seht es endlich ein, eure CDs kaufen nur Spinner
M-A-S-kulin, das ist der Sound für Gewinner

Eure Hoes haben alle Pickel am Arsch
Undercover Polizei, diese Bullen hören mein iPhone ab
Schönen Gruß an eure Frauen, wenn ich euch schonmal in der Leitung hab

Bevor du mich fickst, kann S-A-V sich seine Haare kämmen
Warum gibt es auf der Welt keine Liebe?

Großer Wagen, große Fresse, große Ziele

Deutsche Rapper kiffen noch im Zelt und trinken Selters
Ich komm auf die Summer Jam im Rover, Game Over
Ihr könnt flexen, ich mach meine Kohle mit Pullover
30 Gs im Monat, Schlampen fallen in Ohnmacht
Die Polizei, sie stresst mein' Arsch, als wär ich Dunkin' Donuts
Cruise durch die City, vierundzwanzig/sieben
Keine Angst vor'm Fliegen, Beamer vierradangetrieben
Mach in vierundzwanzig/sieben, vierundzwanzig Riesen
Ihr seid maskuliner, doch wir sind am maskulinsten
Mein Auto ist ein Sixer, mein Waschbrett ist ein Sixer

Ich bin ein Bad Boy, Mama nennt mich Krimineller
Meine Eltern denken immer noch, dass ich studiere
Ich lüg' sie an, damit ich ihren Kopf nicht strapaziere
Maskulin Jogginghose, M-A-S Gewinnerpose

Und deine Schlampe, die Bitch, sie schickt Bikinibilder
Ich sammel' Tangas, ihr Kinder noch Paninibilder
Und meine Scheine, sie sind grün wie Meister Yoda
Von der Straße in ein Loft mit Designersofa
Das' der Gym-Flow, G-G-G-Gym Gang
Weil wir tagtäglich immer nur im Gym hängen
Ich bin kein Schauspieler, doch zieh' nach Hollywood
Pump' mich auf, bis jede Olle guckt - Modellook
Und ich schieb' Welle wie Arnold in den 80s

Ihr geht vom Label weg und ich mach Geld wie Beats by Dre
Ich verdeal mein Tape, denn ich rapp straighter als der Rest
Wenn du nicht gewusst hast wer der King ist ja dann weißt du's jetzt
F-L-E-R, sie woll'n das mein Album floppt
Und die Bullen verhaften mich, weil ich meine Feinde box

Was für Deutschrap, sie machen Schlagerrap
Mir egal was du verkaufst ich hör nur was die Straße denkt
Ich mache deine Gang zu meiner Hure
Du kannst leben mit der Waffe und sterben durch die Kugel
Du bist kein Gangster, komm mit deiner Sippschaft
Ihr könnt weiter Silben zählen weil ihr keine Hits macht
Ich fick das, dich und deinen Scheißdreck
Ich bin King Frank White jetzt kack ich auf dein Scheißtext
Wer ich bin? Die Nummer 1 in meiner Stadt

Du kleiner Newcomer, denn ich hab dir blind vertraut
Ich hab dich groß gemacht, ich krieg dich wieder klein
Auch, wenn du jammernd zu mir rennst, ich werd dir nie verzeihen
Und Kollegah, komm erinner dich dran
Vor paar Jahren hat mein Gesicht in deinem Zimmer gehangen
Du warst damals noch ein Frischling, Themen, die vom Tisch sind
Ja, ich bin mein größter Rücken, einfach, weil ich ich bin
Du bist ein Mischling, halb Frank White, halb Sonny Black
Du machst auf Kanack, doch versteckst dich auf dem Sonnendeck
Ich musste Produzenten zeigen, wie man Beats baut
Musste sie bezahlen, dass sie sagen, dass Fler Beats klaut
Denn wenn du Geld machst, kommen die Ratten aus dem Rattenloch
Du Wasserkopf, fickst keinen Meter mit dem Plattenboss
Wir können uns gerne treffen, und ich erklär dir Leben
Doch sie trauen sich nicht, mit Fler zu reden

Alles, was ihr heute macht, es war meine Idee
Yeah, jetzt kommt Frank an, fängt wieder an zu stänkern
Denn du Fotze warst nur schneller beim Patentamt
Und sie fragen mich: ""Wie war dieser Anis drauf?""
Universal-Deal, plötzlich war sein Handy aus
Doch auch ohne dich, hab ich das Land gefickt
So 'ne Rapper wie du haben plötzlich Angst gekriegt
Ich war ein Psycho denn ich wusste dass mich alle hassen
Ich sagte Specter: ""Yo, so musst du das Cover machen""
Ich holte Kat ins Boot und fickte Fettes Brot
Spaiche fickte Aggro - deutscher Rap ist tot
Es wurde scharf geschossen, es hat mich hart getroffen
Ich bin ein Einzelgänger, wir sind keine Artgenossen
Ohne mich seid ihr Rapper die nur Reime haben
Doch wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft, ist für euch Feierabend

jetzt seid ihr wieder im Film, hä?
Frank, - aber, ey, denkt ihr ich schlafe? 
Denkt ihr, das war alles?
Und es geht weiter... 2015 ist mein Jahr, du Pussy, okay?
Ich hör die Leute reden „Fler, keiner kommt klar mit dir!“
Man, du Wichser, ja, genau das ist meine Aufgabe
Als Rapper, okay?
Weil diese Schwänze da draußen sind keine Rapper, okay?
Das sind nur Typen die Reime haben, okay?
Die können den ganzen Tag ihre Silben zählen
Aber wer von denen ist wie Frank, hä? Wer von denen ist wie Frank?
Ihr scheißt euch ein, keiner von euch hat seine eigene Meinung
Ihr hüpft von dem einen Schwanz auf den nächsten Schwanz, okay?
Wer bist du, hä? Du hat keine Stadt, du hast keine Gang. 
Du hast keine Geschichte, du Bastard! Ihr seit fake. 
Alles an euch ist fake!
Und alles was ich 2014 gerappt habe, werdet ihr 2015 rappen. 
Und eure hässlichen Fans werden es dann 2022 verstehen
Oh mein Gott, wie seht ihr alle aus, Alter? 
Und an alle meine Ex-Maskuliner, okay? Ein Wort für euch
irrelevant! Hä, wo seit ihr jetzt? Ihr kleinen Wichser! 
Ihr habt die Reste von meinem Teller gefressen! 
Ich schwöre dir alter, ich schwöre dir, glaubt ihr, 
glaubt ihr ihr werdet Gnade bekommen? Keine Gnade
Nicht aufregen Fler,
Ich werde dich suchen und ich werde dich finden. 
Und dann werd ich dich ficken, okay? 
Das Leben ist kein Internet Homie! 
Bruder, Brudi, was auch immer alter. 
Diese Szene,  ist eine Nutte. 
Die Medien, alles Nutten! Diese deutschen Rapper,  die Übernutten,
Yeah!
Damals schon im Heim hieß es, 
„Fler keiner kommt klar mit dir"". 
Dann später, in der Oberstufe, „Fler keiner kommt klar mit dir“. 
In der Ausbildung „Keiner kommt klar mit dir“ 
Meine Mutter, mein Vater ""Fler keiner kommt klar mit dir"". 
Und jetzt kommt ihr, jetzt kommt ihr alter? 
Versteht ihr nicht das keiner was machen kann? Versteht ihr das nicht?
Junge 32 Jahre, Schöneberg, Kreuzberg, Tempelhof, Südberlin was los, hä? 
Und dann kommt ihr, mit euren Röhrenjeans, mit euren
hässlichen Frisuren, mit euren Bärten. 
Was soll das sein? Und das schlimme an euch ist
Ihr habt auch 'ne große Fresse. 
Warum hast du so 'ne große Fresse, hä?
Du hast doch noch nicht mal den Mut der zu sein, der du sein willst! 
Du brauchst doch Typen wie mich, hä? 
Typen wie mich auf den du mit dei'm scheiß Finger zeigen kannt 
und sagen kannst „Da ist der Proll. 
Da ist der Proll!"". 
Aber ich fick' deine Frau trotzdem besser als du
Ich schwör's dir Dicker
Ihr könnt nicht mal richtig laufen
ihr könnt euch noch nicht mal richtig anziehen
Wie wollt ihr eure Frauen richtig ficken? 
Oh shit alter. Und deutsche Rapper, 
die neuen deutschen Rapper
sind wie diese kleinen Schwänze bei McFit
Du bist nicht breit, du bist nicht krass
Du trägst nur dein Gold's Gym Tanktop,
Was soll dieses Tanktop? Wen willst du beeindrucken alter? 
Was soll'n diese 140 Kilo Bankdrücken
alter, die du nicht einmal schaffst?
Ok Fler, cool bleiben. 
Und wenn ihr mich das nächste Mal auf der Straße seht
okay, quatscht mich nicht an. Sagt nicht „Hi, Fler“. 
Weil ich hab mir eure Fresse gemerkt. 
Jede einzelne Kackvisage hab ich mir gemerkt. 
Und irgendwann kommt alles zurück. Glaub mir. 
Und wenn du die Bullen rufst, geb ich 'n Fick. 
Weil mein Anwalt ist der gottverdammte Teufel,
24 Stunden erreichbar, yeah

Noch vor zwei Jahren habt ihr an meinem Schwanz gekaut
Meine Interviews mehr Klicks als deine Single-Hits

Dieser Animus und Kay One sind nur Botoxfressen
Ihr wollt eins gegen eins, wir können uns sofort treffen
Deine Juli, sie hat nicht nur an meinem Schwanz geleckt
In ihrer Fotze, hat nicht nur meine Hand gesteckt
Leg die Hantel weg, ich ficke dich, du Karl Ess
Du bist wie Tim Gabel einfach viel zu schmal, Kek

Keine Schlampe guckt im Club auf deine Oberarme

Deine Modemarke, doofer Name, Copayn
Man, dieser Hurensohn Kollegah färbt sich Barthaare
Und diese Snare ist wie ein Hammer auf den Sargnagel
Rest in peace, Deutscher Rap, ihr seid nicht muskulös
Warum wirst du frech, wenn du wie eine Schwuchtel stöhnst
Dein schwuler Vater er wird auch gefickt, du Fitnesstrainer
Elektrofensterheber, im Ghetto fickt dich jeder
Jeder Schwanz auf dem Ku'damm fährt jetzt G-Klasse
Und deine Freundin weint, weil ich sie einfach stehen lasse (Bitch)

Rapper sind nicht grade, ich bin gerade aus
Ich überwach den Warentausch im Lagerhaus
Aus meinem AMG Mercedes qualmt der schwarze Rauch
Rapper sind behindert im Cannabis Rausch
Ich schlage mit der Faust ihr Anwalt schickt die Klage raus
Mein Konto fängt den Schaden auf, ich atme aus
Jedes Haus in meinem Block hat die Farbe Grau
Ich sag es laut du bist ein Hurensohn mit Gartenhaus
Siehst mit 25 wie dein schwuler Vater aus
Fick dein Applaus, auf meinem Herz sind Narben drauf
Doch dann geht die Garage auf und ich fahr im Ferrari raus
Yeah deine Mutter ist total versaut
Ich fick sie auf der harten Couch die Bukkake Braut

Frank White,"Yeah!
Es gibt Rapper, die mein Demotape bei eBay sellen
Jede Wette dazu kannst du 187 zählen
Ich bin so im Trend, ich trage keine Reeboks mehr
Hamburg-Rapper tragen Carlo, was läuft hier verkehrt?
Bitches komm' zu mir und tragen dabei Yoga-Pants
Kollegah ist gekleidet so wie die von Cobra 11
Bin ein Carlo-Gangster so wie er im Buche steht
Animus sein Album war ein Schwuchtel-Schmusetape
Was für Philipp Plein und Audemars Piguet, Nutte?
Ich bin Streber, lerne Kriminologie, Nutte!
Siebenstellige Beträge sind normal für mich
Ihre Schwäche, keine Ehre, ist normal für mich
Ihr macht alle ein' auf G, zu zehnt in Berlin
Ein echter Star kommt zu spät zum Termin, Felix
Kommt zu spät zum Termin, Felix (hehe!)

Und ab heute traut sich keiner mehr hier Klingelstreich
Ich bin Gangster Frank-Neunmillimeter-White

Warte, warte
Du klaust bei Amis und Franzosen, erst Biggie, dann Booba
Kaschierst es durch Gimmicks, im Video 'ne Bazooka
Kommst an goldbehangen, wie Slick Rick the Ruler
Doch hiernach hört man dich nie wieder live, wie die Stimme von Homer
Ist es Baba Haft oder Baba Babuschka?
Was für Baba? Baba bedeutet „alte Frau“ oder „Großmama“ in Russland

Und was sagt es über dich, wenn du erfolgreich bist?
Du bist im Endeffekt so fake wie deine Käuferschicht!
Und was sagt es über mich, wenn ich erfolgreich bin?
Du kannst es ohne fake Scheiße zu den Euros bringen!
Internet-Kiddies wissen nicht was Realness heißt
Dass 'ne Schlägerei mit Animus nicht viel beweist
Denn ich rappe von den letzten fünfundzwanzig Jahren
Als ich aus dem Ghetto kam, wart ihr im Techno-Wahn
Für den cholerischen Prolet keine Solidarität
Doch privat fragt ihr um Rat, weil ihr von Promo nichts versteht
In Wahrheit beten sie mich an wie einen Altar in der Kapelle
Mein Album lag schon damals bei Xatar in seiner Zelle
Erkläre dir nochmal: was heißt „keep it real“
Ich red' nicht um den heißen Brei mit 'nem Distri-Deal, yeah
Nächster Gerichtstermin 27. Mai

Denn die endet im U-Bahn-Schacht

Heute macht sie Kasse nur im Supermarkt

There in the road straight up ahead 
A car was stalled the engine was dead 
I couldn't stop so I swerved to the right 
I'll never forget the sound that night 
The screaming tires the busting glass 
The painful scream that I heard last 

[Chorus] 

When I woke up the rain was pouring down 
There were people standing all around 
Something warm flowing through my eyes 
But somehow I found my baby that night 
I lifted her head she looked at me and said 
Hold me darling just a little while 
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss 
I found the love that I knew i have missed 
Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight 
I lost my love my life that night

Vanished like a snowflake with the rising of the sun

You'll sit home & drink all night

In between the moisture cream & velvet facial lotion?
Ever tell your kids you're glad that they can think?
Ever say you loved 'em? Ever let 'em watch you drink?
Ever wonder why your daughter looked so sad?

Shot by the cops as she quietly lay
By the side of the creeps she knew . . .

Frank Zappa,"These executives have plooked the fuck out of me
And there's still a long time to go before I've
Paid my debt to society

Play the guitar 'n bend the string like
Reent-toont-teent-toont-teent-toont-teenooneenoonee

I've got it
I'll be sullen and withdrawn
I'll dwindle off into the twilight realm
Of my own secret thoughts
I'll lay on my back here 'til dawn
In a semi-catatonic state
And dream of guitar notes
That would irritate
An executive kinda guy...

Well, I guess that one did the trick
If they only coulda heard it
Half-a-dozen of 'em woulda strangled
While they was suckin' on each other's dick

But that was only a bunch of imaginary
Notes I played
Just a little extra somethin'
To keep me goin' from day to day

That's okay
I'll be gettin' outta here pretty soon

He don't really need you

All those earthling worms he nibbled away

Oh hunchentoot you brute, can't you see I want you?
Stay with me flagrantly
And we'll have ecstasy for all eternity

We must say good-bye
There's no need for you to cry
It's better that I tell you this tonight
Our affair has been quite heated
You thought I was what you needed
But the time has come, my darlin'
To set things right, 'cause
I'll be harder than yer husband
To get along with
Harder than yer husband every night
Harder than yer husband
Harder than yer husband
An' I don't want our love affair
To end with a fight

You been like a little angel
How you loved me
I appreciate the warmth of your embrace
Well, the world don't need to know
How I adored you
But there's somethin' I must tell you, darlin'
Face to face...
I'll be harder than yer husband
To get along with
Harder than yer husband every night

Harder than yer husband
Harder than yer husband
An' I don't want our love affair
To end with a fight

So it's adios, adios, my little darlin'

Gotta go now...
Keep that hankie that I gave you for
When you cry
There are things that trouble me
And I'm sure that you must see
That it breaks my heart the same as yours
When we say good-bye

Harder than yer...much, much, much
Harder than yer husband
Harder than yer...much, much, much
Harder than yer husband
Harder than yer...much, much, much
Harder than yer husband

Once upon a time
It was in albuquerque, new mexico
There were these girls that worked at the college
The were really cool...
(they thought so anyway)
The would be delighted to tell you how suave they where
At the drop of a hat

There was three of 'em:
One of them thought she was a beauty queen...
The other one was a walking blow-job
And then there was this skinny girl...

Oh well...
Some of the guys in the band got together
With the girls from the college
They were having a good time...
(we were in alburquerque for a couple of days)
But these girls thought they were hot shit
'n wouldn't pooch the guys in the band
On the first day, so...
A couple of the guys in the band
Who were desperate for that kind of action
Kept workin' on 'em for two days
(which is a waste of fuckin' time anyway...)
So, anyway...
But if that's your idea of a good time, what the hey?

Send those pants up here!
Here's some more!
Okay, good-good!
Traditional cotton...oh, how sweet!
Umf...huh-huh-huh-huhhh...
Here! work these!

Anyway...
We're in albuquerque, new mexico...
A couple of the guys in the band, who shall go nameless
Because their girlfriends might find out
Decided they were gonna work the wall on these girls
From the college
So, one night...it was the first night
When they were still trying to 'get it in there'
(ya know what I mean? huh-huh-huh-huh...)
The skinny girl, she says to one of the guys in the band
She says, well, to several of the guys in the band
And one of the t-shirt guys too...
""hey! let's go skinny-dipping!""
At two o'clock in the morning at the pool at the hotel
That's right, your heard right,
Two o'clock in the morning, pool at the hotel...
It was so fun...
But the water was very, very cold!
So they go out there and the girl who was really skinny
'n' probably totally insensitive to climatic changes
Took all of her garments off and she jumped in the pool
And she says, ""hey guys! come on in!""
Well, one of them did...
The other one was too smart for that shit
So him and the t-shirt guy say by the edge of the pool
And when the girl who was really skinny
(and insensitive to climatic changes)
Took off her clothes and jumped in the pool
She threw her pants over there by the little table

Well, one of the guys in the band picked up het panties
(he told me later the stuff in the bottom
Was like punching an eclair...)
Anyhow...there was nothing else to do...
It was alburquerque, new mexico
It's two o'clock in the morning...
They're not going to get any nooky anyway...
So this one guy and the t-shirt guy
Started sniffing the girl's panties...
They were sniffing the fudge and sniffing the glue...
Sniffing every 'thing' that adhered to these
Delightful little morsels
(some of you might think this is weird...
No wonder. it's not exactly normal, but
What the fuck? )
So, they're snorting it...
(hey! it's the twentieth century...
Whatever you can do to have a good time, let's get on with it,
So long as it doesn't cause a murder...)

So they're snorting the pants
'n' then they put them on their heads...
They were having a good time...
The girl was in the water...she didn't even see
What was going on with her underpants...
They were wearing the pants
It looked just like a tiny little party hat...
Their ears were sticking out the side...it was so fun
Later on they discovered,
This would make a great way of life for them...
They would go from town to town, looking for panties
They would take the panties after they were hung up
On the clothes line
Later on they would take 'em back in the dressing room
They would play with them...
They would fetish the underpants...
They would snort every little morsel attached
To the underpants...and then...they would feel that
They were fulfilled

And so you can see,
That what we're doing here on stage
Is part of a great american tradition
The tradition of the
Jazz discharge party hats
",The Jazz Discharge Party Hats,1983
Frank Zappa,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears

Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds

There will never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart
With very special things
With angle songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love that anywhere I go
I am never lonely
With her along
Who can be lonely?
I reach for here hand
It is always them

How long does it last
Can love be measured by the hours in a day

The earth, my earth
Is bulging at the seams
The earth, my earth
It's full of many schemes
And as the sunlight beams
The glory of our sciences
And militant alliances
Reveal their basic worth
Along the mounds of dead appliances!

The earth, my earth
I hear it's muffled screams
The earth, my earth
And though it often seems
From televison beams
That ignorance is rampant there
And governmental goons don't care
I know that I shall not despair
And cheat like all the rest
I'll just keep on
With what I do the best!

Watch your watch, play a little flat
Make the session go overtime, that's where it's at

How many doubles can you get
Special rules provide the way
To help you maximize your pay

Your girl, arlyn's, what's the diff
What's the service that you're with
So long as you can suck the butt
Of the contractor who calls you up

Your career could take a thud
Unless you kneel and scarf his pud
And when the dates come rolling in
You can wipe your lips and flash a grin
That tells them all on the jingle date
That you enjoyed what you just ate

Yum yum, dog food
Hemorrhoid cream but the bread's so good
New rv and a leisure suit
Hey, I play shit but I love the loot

Thank the union, it's so great
Only a few get to be on the date
Those other shmucks with electric guitars
Got to play for poot in the bistro bars

You have been to the berkeley school
You give clinics on the side

Stands by the light;

If you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee 
Then it avoids an awful lot of mess 

It's murder by numbers  one  two  three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now if you have a taste for this experience 
And you're flushed with your very first success 
Then you must try a twosome or a threesome 
And you'll find your conscience bothers you much less 

Because murder is like anything you take to 
It's a habit-forming need for more and more 
You can bump off every member of your family 
And anybody else you find a bore 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 

Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious 
In history's great dark hall of fame 
All our greatest killers were industrious 
At least the ones that we all know by name 

But you can reach the top of your profession 
If you become the leader of the land 
For murder is the sport of the elected 
And you don't need to lift a finger of your hand 

Because it's murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your ABC 
Murder by numbers, one, two, three 
It's as easy to learn as your A, be	, see, D, E

Frank Zappa,"On the plane of the baritone women
They talk low
'bout stuff they know,
They sing 'oooh!'
And laugh at you
Ah-ha-ha-ha-hah!
If you can't
If you can't
Do it too
Do it too
Ah-ha-ha-ha-hah!

They sing 'li-li-li-li!'
They sing 'lo-lo-lo-lo!'
The man carry purses
Wherever they go

Junior executives.
All in a row,
Watch the baritone women
Do the baritone show
Ah-ha-ha-ha-hah!

They sing about wheat;
They sing about corn;
They sing about places
Where women was born

They sing about hate!
They sing about fear!
It seems like they all got
A pretty good ear
Ah-ha-ha-ha-hah!

They sing it in harmony
Not often heard
With a big ol' cadenza
On every long word

They keep it as low
As they possibly can,
And sometimes they walk
Like an e-gyp-tian
Ah-ha-ha-ha-hah!

They do choreography
Still more unique!
They leave their legs open
Whenever they speak!

They roll their eyes upward.
And over again,
And slam their legs closed
When they sing about men!

Those baritone women!
They are not your friend!
You will make a mistake
If you go there again!

We just can't be promiscuous
He's a docter -- he should know
It's the work of the devil, so
Girls, don't blow!

Don't blow jimmy, don't blow bobby

I'm sure he'd do it
Just like him)

Is doctor koop a man to trust?
It seems at least that reagan must
(but ron's a trusting sort of guy --
He trusts ed meese
I wonder why? )

For doin' stuff it shouldn't ought
All they do is lie and lie
Where's doctor koop?
He's standin' by

Surgeon general? what's the deal?
Is your epidemic real?
Are you leaving something out?
Something we can't talk about?
A little green monkey over there
Kills a million people?

Would they take you serious,

Way back a long time ago,
When the universe consisted of nothing more elaborate than
Mark volman ...

Thank you, frank

... trying to convince each and every member
Of this extremely hip audience here tonight,
That he was nothing more, nothing less
Than a fat maroon sofa,
Suspended in the midst of a great emptiness
A light shined down from heaven (* twinkling sounds *)

And there he was ladies and gentleman, the good lord
And he took, he took a look at the sofa,
And he said to himself
""quite an attractive sofa""
""this sofa could be commercial""

With a few more margaritas and the right company

However, I digress
""what this sofa needs"" said the big 'g'

""is a bit of flooring underneath of it""
And so in order to make this construction project possible,
He summoned the assistance of the celestial corp of engineers,
And, by means of a cute little song in the german language
(which is the way he talks whenever it's heavy business)
The good lord went something like this:
(take it away jim pons!)

Gib zu mir etwas fussbodenbelag
Unter diesen fetten fliessenden sofa

Everybody!

Gib zu mir etwas fussbodenbelag
Unter diesen fetten fliessenden sofa

And of course ladies and gentlemen that means:
""give unto me a bit of flooring under this fat floating sofa""
And sure enough boards of oak appeared throughout the emptiness
As far as vision permits,
Stretching all the way from belfast to bogner regis
And the lord put aside his huge cigar
And proceeded to deliver unto the charming maroonish sofa
The bulk of his message
With the assistance of a small electric clarinet
And it went something like this...

Take it away jim pons!

Gib zu mir etwas fussbodenbelag
Unter diesen fetten fliessenden sofa

Everybody!

Gib zu mir etwas fussbodenbelag

And of course ladies and gentlemen, that means:

Of the love in your heart
And it makes even sunshine more bright

Crooning all the day long
Comes your laughter and light

For the springtime of life
Is the sweetest of all
There is ne'er a real care or regret
And while springtime is ours
Throughout all of youth's hours
Let us smile each chance we get

From someplace in this area,
And they complain if I talk about this horrible pizza
During the show.

All:
Come out here, to californy,
Just to find me some pretty girls.
Ones I seen gets me so horny,
Ruby lips, 'n teeth like pearls.

Wanna love 'em all, wanna love 'em dearly.
Wanna a jellyfish, I'll even pay.
I'll buy 'em furs, I'll buy 'em pizza,

Ike:
""darling, I crazy go nuts when I hear this,
You know what I'm sayin'? ""

Frank:
When I get off, I get plastered.
I swim till I fall on the jellyfish.
Then I find me some academic kind of illustrator,
I describe the little dangling utensils on this thing,
And tell him to draw it up
So it looks just like a brand new jellyfish.

Ike & mike:
(trying to follow along, they sing some gibberish)

Frank:
""take that! take that!""
I fuss an' I cuss and I keep on swimmin',
Till my snorkel puffs up an' turns red.
I drool on my shorts,
I do some water sports,
Then I take the jellyfish back to my house
And stick it in the bed! ""sorta...""

Ike & mike:
""whaddya do? ""
Stick it again in the bed!

Frank:
""that's right!

In the laboratory of the utility muffin Research kitchen.
Reaching for an oversized chrome spoon,
He gathers an Intimate quantity of dried muffin
Remnants and brushing his scapular aside,
Procceds to dump these inside of his shirt...
He turns to us and speaks:

""Some people like cupcakes better.
I for one care less for them!""

Arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas 
Snoot of a fully charged icing anointment utensil,
He 'poot's forths a quarter-ounce green rosette,
- oh ah yuk, yuk... let's try that again...! -
He 'poots' forth a quarter-ounce green rosette
Near the summit of a dense,
But radiant muffin of his own design.
Later he says:

""Some people... some people like cupcakes
Exclusively, while myself, I say,
There is naught nor ought there be nothing 
So exalted on the face of god's grey
Earth as that prince of foods... the muffin!""

Girl you thought he was a man,
But he was a muffin,
He hung around till you found,
That he didn't know nuthin',

Girl you thought he was a man,
But he only was a-puffin',
No cries is heard in the night,
As a result of him stuffin',

Put down the rag, I told her then
Don't wanna hear you cry again

Tell me, tell me what's the reason

And then she read a magazine
Forget that book, I told her then

Tell me, tell me what's the reason

That showed a young sophisticator
Who falls in love three pages later
With some aggressive agitator
And by and by he comes to hate her
'cause she don't shave her underarms
And he can't go for that
'cause he's a young sophisticator

All down the side of my kimono
Well of course I would, it might be hip

You bum, bum, bum, bum
I'm a wino man,
Don't you know I am?

I went to the country,
And while I was gone
I lost control of my body functions
On the road ahead at the ladies front lawn
I'm so ashamed,
But I'm a wino man
I can't help myself
I've been drinkin' all night
'Til my eyes got red
Stumbled on the gutter
And busted my head
Bugs in my zoot suit,
Been scratchin' like a dog
I can't stand no water,
And I stink like a hog

Then they worry 'cause they's too fat
Who wants t'ride on a ironin' board?
That ain't no fun...i tried me one

Any time, anywhere
Sex
Why d'ya think it's growin' there

Some girls try it 'n' they don't like it
They complain 'cause it don't last
Who wants to ride on a debutante?
They talks too much...they moves too fast

You can be very warm inside
'n' when the train goes 'round the bend
Check the shrub'ry on the other end

And grabbed it tight
And threw her up
Against the wall

And said: ""Go eat shit!""

Daughter of the smog-filled winds of Los Angeles,
I'd like to take you in the closet and take off your little clothes until you are virtually stark raving nude,
Spread mayonaise
And kaopectate all over your body and take you down to Hollywood Boulevard and we can,
We can walk down the streets by the stars that say Jon Provost and Leo G. Carroll together, baby.
We can go dancing up at the Cinegrill
Can't you see it: Frank Pernell and us, until dark,
Don't you understand, my baby?
I didn't mean, I didn't need, I mean, it was so hard for me, I just...
I saw you standing under the Shell pest strip late last night,
In the light,
With your little nipples protruding through your little see-thru thingie, and I just said, ""My god,
My god, I gave my sperm to this thing!"" And now I just,
Oh, you got me so hard, I just,
I don't know what to do, Magdalena, don't you understand? So I grabbed you, but,
But don't hold it against me, I mean,
Your mom will never know, baby, and I wantcha to come back to me,
I mean, do you understand me? I want you to...
I'm down on my knees to ya, Magdalena! I wantcha ta walk back to me, baby,
I wantcha to turn around by the Sparkletts machine.
That's it! That's it! In the little chartreuse hallway with the little neon Jesus picture on the wall,
And I want you to step, baby,
I want you to walk back in your five inch spike heels that you got at Frederick's,
Same time you and your mommy got that crotchless underwear last year for Christmas,
And I want you to stroll back to me, baby
Walk back, baby, don'tcha understand me, baby?
I want you to walk back
I'm down on bended knees, baby
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I wanna take off your little training bra
Don't you understand me?
I'm gonna take off you little maroon hot pants
I'm gonna get down on my knees, baby, dont'cha understand what I'm saying to you?
Your mom will never know, she's playing bridge with the girls,
And you and I...
You and I go sucking som'thing, baby,
It's just you and I, don'tcha understand?
We can make love all night long,
Nobody will ever know,
Come on, Magdalena!
Please, little girl,
Walk back to your daddy,
What did I do that was so wrong?
My God, I was only following the sexual impulse like I heard on the Johnny Carson Show from a book or something I wrote,
I didn't know what I was doing
I got carried away
What can I say like, like...
Walk back, baby,
Come on,
Oh, please, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,
Walk back to your daddy!

Frank Zappa,"The mystery man came over
And he said I'm outta sight
He said for a nominal service charge
I could reach nirvana tonight
If I was ready, willing and able
To pay him his regular fee
He would drop all the rest of his pressing affairs 
And devote his attention to me

But I said look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me

The mystery man got nervous and he fidget around a bit
He reached in the pocket of his mystery robe
And he whipped out a shaving kit
Now I thought it was a razor
And a can of foaming goo
But he told me right then when the top popped open
There was nothin' his box won't do
With the oil of aphrodite, and the dust of the grand wazoo
He said you might not believe this, little fella
But it'll cure your asthma too

And I said look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now what kind of a guru are you, anyway? 
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me
(Don't waste your time)

I've got troubles of my own, I said
And you can't help me out
So, take your meditations and your preparations
And ram it up your snout
But I got the crystal ball, he said
And held it to the light
So I snatched it, all away from him
And I showed him how to do it right

I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I looked like I was deep
I said some mumbo-jumbo, then
I told him he was going to sleep
I robbed his rings and pocketwatch
And everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future, then
As long as he was hanging around
I said the price of meat has just gone up
And your old lady has just gone down

Look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho? 
Don't you know, you could make more money as a butcher?

Spread mayonaise
And kaopectate all over your body and take you down to Hollywood Boulevard and we can,
We can walk down the streets by the stars that say Jon Provost and Leo G. Carroll together, baby.
We can go dancing up at the Cinegrill
Can't you see it: Frank Pernell and us, until dark,
Don't you understand, my baby?
I didn't mean, I didn't need, I mean, it was so hard for me, I just...
I saw you standing under the Shell pest strip late last night,
In the light,
With your little nipples protruding through your little see-thru thingie, and I just said, ""My god,
My god, I gave my sperm to this thing!"" And now I just,
Oh, you got me so hard, I just,
I don't know what to do, Magdalena, don't you understand? So I grabbed you, but,
But don't hold it against me, I mean,
Your mom will never know, baby, and I wantcha to come back to me,
I mean, do you understand me? I want you to...
I'm down on my knees to ya, Magdalena! I wantcha ta walk back to me, baby,
I wantcha to turn around by the Sparkletts machine.
That's it! That's it! In the little chartreuse hallway with the little neon Jesus picture on the wall,
And I want you to step, baby,
I want you to walk back in your five inch spike heels that you got at Frederick's,
Same time you and your mommy got that crotchless underwear last year for Christmas,
And I want you to stroll back to me, baby
Walk back, baby, don'tcha understand me, baby?
I want you to walk back
I'm down on bended knees, baby
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I wanna take off your little training bra
Don't you understand me?
I'm gonna take off you little maroon hot pants
I'm gonna get down on my knees, baby, dont'cha understand what I'm saying to you?
Your mom will never know, she's playing bridge with the girls,
And you and I...
You and I go sucking som'thing, baby,
It's just you and I, don'tcha understand?
We can make love all night long,
Nobody will ever know,
Come on, Magdalena!
Please, little girl,
Walk back to your daddy,
What did I do that was so wrong?
My God, I was only following the sexual impulse like I heard on the Johnny Carson Show from a book or something I wrote,
I didn't know what I was doing
I got carried away
What can I say like, like...
Walk back, baby,
Come on,
Oh, please, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,
Walk back to your daddy!
Come on, Magdalena, to your daddy, baby, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,

My daughter dear, do not be concerned
When your Canadian daddy comes near.
I work so hard, don't you understand
Making maple syrup for the pancakes of our land.
Do you have any idea?
What that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?
Do you have any idea?
What that can do to a man?
What that can do to a man?
(Tell 'em!)

Magdalena, don't you tease me like this
Right in the hallway with your blouse and your tits
If your mommy ever finds us like this
She'll call a lawyer, oh how mom will be pissed

DOODLE-OODLE-OODLE DOOT-DOO DEE-OOH
DOODLE-OODLE-OODLE DOOT-DOO DEE-OOH
DOODLE-OODLE-OODLE DOOT-DOO DEE-OOH
DOODLE-OODLE-OODLE DOOT-DOO DEE-OOH-WAH...

Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena,
Daughter of the smog-filled winds of Los Angeles,
I'd like to take you in the closet and take off your little clothes until you are virtually stark raving nude,
Spread mayonaise
And kaopectate all over your body and take you down to Hollywood Boulevard and we can,
We can walk down the streets by the stars that say Jon Provost and Leo G. Carroll together, baby.
We can go dancing up at the Cinegrill
Can't you see it: Frank Pernell and us, until dark,
Don't you understand, my baby?
I didn't mean, I didn't need, I mean, it was so hard for me, I just...
I saw you standing under the Shell pest strip late last night,
In the light,
With your little nipples protruding through your little see-thru thingie, and I just said, ""My god,
My god, I gave my sperm to this thing!"" And now I just,
Oh, you got me so hard, I just,
I don't know what to do, Magdalena, don't you understand? So I grabbed you, but,
But don't hold it against me, I mean,
Your mom will never know, baby, and I wantcha to come back to me,
I mean, do you understand me? I want you to...
I'm down on my knees to ya, Magdalena! I wantcha ta walk back to me, baby,
I wantcha to turn around by the Sparkletts machine.
That's it! That's it! In the little chartreuse hallway with the little neon Jesus picture on the wall,
And I want you to step, baby,
I want you to walk back in your five inch spike heels that you got at Frederick's,
Same time you and your mommy got that crotchless underwear last year for Christmas,
And I want you to stroll back to me, baby
Walk back, baby, don'tcha understand me, baby?
I want you to walk back
I'm down on bended knees, baby
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I wanna take off your little training bra
Don't you understand me?
I'm gonna take off you little maroon hot pants
I'm gonna get down on my knees, baby, dont'cha understand what I'm saying to you?
Your mom will never know, she's playing bridge with the girls,
And you and I...
You and I go sucking som'thing, baby,
It's just you and I, don'tcha understand?
We can make love all night long,
Nobody will ever know,
Come on, Magdalena!
Please, little girl,
Walk back to your daddy,
What did I do that was so wrong?
My God, I was only following the sexual impulse like I heard on the Johnny Carson Show from a book or something I wrote,
I didn't know what I was doing
I got carried away
What can I say like, like...
Walk back, baby,
Come on,
Oh, please, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,
Walk back to your daddy!
Come on, Magdalena, to your daddy, baby, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,
Walk back, baby, walk back,
Your mom will never know,
Your mom will never know,
Walk back, baby, walk back,
Walk back, baby, walk back,
Magdalena, come back,
Come back to you daddy,
Walk back, baby,
Walk back, baby,
Walk,
Walk,
Walk,
Walk,
WALK!
Walk to your daddy,
Come on down, stroll it around of me,
I'm down on my knees, don't you understand?
Your mom will never know,
I told you so...
(I love you, Magdalena!)
You know what...
I said...",Magdalena,1972
