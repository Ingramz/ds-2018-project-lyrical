Ron Kalina,"Every day, along about evening
When the sunlight's beginning to pale
I ride through the slumbering shadows

Along the Navajo Trail
When it's night and crickets are callin'
And coyotes are makin' a wail
I dream by a smoldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail

I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale
It's time to climb into my saddle
And ride the Navajo Trail

I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale (like a silvery veil)
It's time to climb into my saddle

And ride the Navajo Trail
Ride the Navajo Trail

Ron Kaplan,"My mama done tol' me
When I was in knee pants
My mama done tol' me
Son! A woman'll sweet talk
And give ya the big eye
But when the sweet talkin's done
A woman's a two face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing 
The blues in the night

Now the rain's a fallin'
Hear the train a collin'
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
Hear dat lonesome whistle
Blowin' cross the trestle
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
A whoo-ee-duh-whoo-ee, ol' clickety clack's
A echoin' back th' blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night

Take my word, the mockin' bird'll
Sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong and he's right 
From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I been in some big towns
An' heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know 
A woman's a two face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing the blues in the night
My mama was right, there's blues in the night",Blues in the Night,2000
Ron Kaplan,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2000
Ron Kaplan,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you
",Cry Me a River,2000
Ron Kaplan,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,2000
Ron Kaplan,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Ron Kaplan,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,2003
Ron Kaplan,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2003
Ron Kaplan,"I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love.",Old Devil Moon,2003
Ron Kaplan,"The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
The thrill is gone baby
It's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open armed baby
Just like I know a good man should

You know I'm free, free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well",The Thrill Is Gone,2003
Ron Kaplan,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few

And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2004
Ron Kaplan,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Ron Kaplan,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick out of You,2008
Ron Kaplan,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Ron Kaplan,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today

Ron Kearns,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2003
Ron Kearns,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2005
Ron Keating,"Four o'clock in the morning
My mind's filled with a thousand thoughts of you
And how you left without a warning
But looking back I'm sure you tried to talk it through

Now I see it clearly
We're together but living separate lives

So want to tell you I'm sorry
Baby I can't find the words
But if I could, then you know I would, yeah

No I won't let you go, know what we can be
I won't watch my life, crashing down on me
Guess I had it all, right there before my eyes
Girl, I'm sorry now, you were the last thing on my mind

You carried me like a river
How far we've come still surprises me

And now I look in the mirror
Staring back is the man
I used to be

With you
How I long for you

No I won't let you go, know what we can be
I won't watch my life, crashing down on me
Guess I had it all, right there before my eyes

Could have been there
Should have been so strong

Ron Kenoly,"Grandma's hands clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands used to issue out a warning
She'd say Ronny don't you run so fast
You might fall on a piece of glass
There might be snakes there in the grass
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands used to lift a face and tell her
She'd say baby Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put your faith in Jesus' hands
Grandma's hands

  Grandma's hands used to hand me a piece of candy
Grandma's hands picked me each time I'd fall
Grandma's hands
Lord they really came in handy
She'd say Edith don't you whip that boy
What'cha wanna spank him for
He didn't steal that candy from no store
But I don't have Grandma anymore

I'm gonna look for Grandma's hands

You are the love of my life
You are the hope that I cling to
You mean more than this world to me 
I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold
I wouldn't trade you for riches untold.
You are , you are my everything

I wouldn't take one step without you 
I could never go on.
I couldn't breathe on breath without you.
I don't have the strength 
To make it on my own

I want you to listen to me for a little bit right here 
I wanted you to read the newspapers this morning 

Or did you see the evening news 
As you were having dinner with your families last night?

This world is now in a whole lot of trouble

There's so much hatred, war and poverty, oh yeah 

Wake up all you teachers, you better teach a new way 
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say 

Because they are the ones 
Who's coming up and the world is in their hands 
When you teach the children 
You better teach them the very best you can 

The world won't get no better 
If you just let it be, no no 
The world won't get no better 
You gotta change again, you and me 

Wake up all you doctors, make the old people well 
Because they're the ones who suffer a lot and catch all the hell 
They don't hassle very long before their judgment day 
Won't you make them happy before they pass away? 

Wake up all you builders, it's time to build a new land 
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand 
Only thing we have to do is put it in our minds 
And surely things will work out, they do it every time

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

I have walked out in rain-and back in rain.

I have out walked the furthest city light.

I have looked down the saddest city lane.

I have passed by the watchman on his beat

And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet.

When far away an interrupted cry

Came over houses from another street,

But not to call me back or say good-bye;

And further still at an unearthly height,

One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right

His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:

I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:

There but for you go I.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:
There but for you go I.

Before the sun goes down
You can hear it coming closer
To this dislocated shoulder

That's when the ice cream van rolls around

But in the land of plenty 
The money here is tight
The children here are many

Like you used to hide from thunder

Her name was Amanda with pretty eyes of green
And hair of blonde, strawberry blonde
Springtime and dandelions

And summer 'round the corner
Was at the tail end of age nine
With a million dreams before her
She lived with her mother in an old decrepit house

If there was trouble she kept it to herself
All summer long, the strawberry blonde
And by her face there was no way to tell
It seemed like all was well in her world

But the neighbours said 
Her mother had lost her will
To gin and sleeping pills
It was no life for a little girl

Still I see her face framed in blue sky
At the top of a slide coming down
And when the sirens wailed 
(her mother had failed to rise)

All the neighbors stood outside
As Amanda just stared at the ground
Time flies and years are piled
I'd forgotten all about her

Of a streetcar with her daughter
Then I heard Amanda say as she got up

It's with the warmest thoughts
I took so much from her
I really learned a lot
How to dust off my heart
How to make it shine
How to take a field of dandelions
And make dandelion wine

Such sweet and simple days
Though bitter tasted the wine
We drank it anyway
For love had made it fine
When the world was young
When the road was bright
And the morning poured
Its golden light
Like dandelion wine

Oh I believed in us
Long before deceit and lust
Had lost the trust
Forgive me girl
Forgive me girl

Now when I sing to you
It's with a heavy heart
I took a love that was true
And tore it all apart

Of all those times?

It could mean a ruination
Of your best laid plans

Dividing all goodwill has tried
To mend and to unite

You wonder if it's gone for good
As I ponder that unlikelihood
Oh, if only wishing could
Just keep us from harm's way always

But I feel it like a train rollin' down the track
As it calls for you
To entertain these thought so black

Cold blooded storm
May turn the warmest heart to stone
And leave a trail of toppled hopes and dreams
Where the cold hearted wind has blown

When the world is wiping her eyes

Past the police station, across the tracks

As we bus 'em off to school
To a greasy grimy ol? building

Will we wake to wings up in heaven
Or to hooves and snout in our next life?

He'd never toss you a line

May it help remembering 
For every door that closes in 
One'll open to the other side 
Opened by the hands of time 

Heaven knows 
There are days when it flies on by 
Heaven knows 
There are days when it drags 
Though it may seem to be on your side 
Turn around, it?s left you high and dry

When was the last time we saw the sun rise
And what did we gain in return
But a lesson that we'd already learned
Remember that first time we saw with our own eyes
We saw with our own eyes

As the sorrowful leaves fall at our feet
All the sadness is sweet
And the trees in the sunlight are seemingly spiritual

Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn
Keep me on a slow burn

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn
Keeps me on a slow burn

When we touch this fire breaks out
And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

And the love we made is so deep, so strong
That when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, a slow burn
A slow burn, slow burn

She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
Keeps me on a slow burn
In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
Keeps me on a slow burn
When we touch, when we touch

Ron Thal,"Sand and wind burns the back of my throat
I fell while standing on my rowboat
Salt water tightens on my skin coat
I drowned my head smacked to the rowboat

I floated through the plains of sea - an old pork chop greeted me
It was thankful for the company of a dead man who once might have ate him

I miss my rowboat left it on the shore 10 feet above me

I never noticed the chipped paint on the bottom
And now I get to see things from a different view
The sea did vandalize with natural shades of green
Under what circumstance would I ever have had the opportunity to find out?

True pond scum always rises to the top of the water
I, on the other hand, am false pond scum and remain below

I swim the seven liquid gallows
I'm furniture for budding tadpoles
Sock-sogged and waterlogged I slow-bloat
One with the bog fate sailed my rowboat

I'd kiss you but my lips are feed for tuna getting back at me
I am the Ronald-Of-The-Sea in a swimsuit that no longer fits me
I'd love you but my brain is cheese my body's 59 degrees
And if I could I'd surely sneeze 'cause my nose is filled with red snapper

I'd hold you but my arms are weak this whole thing won't help my physique
And to my neighbors I'm a freak they're a fish hook, an old shoe and (???)
I'd sing to you but I can't make sounds there are no more bubbles in my mouth
And when I said I would head South to retire I meant Florida

I'm running out of words to sing this fading out is a good thing

Nope.

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

This song was written in a hotel room in New York City
Right about the time a friend of ours, Little Steven
Was putting together a record of artists against apartheids
It's a song written about a man in a shanty town outside of Johannesburg
A man who's sick of looking down the barrel of white South Africa
A man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor
A man who has lost faith in the peace makers of the West
While they argue and while they fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu
And his request for economic sanctions against South Africa

When I was younger. 
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger. 

The can-can such a pretty show will steal your heart away 
But backstage back on earth again 
The dressing rooms are gray
They come on strong and it ain't too long 
For they make you feel a man 
But love is blind and you soon will find 
You're just a boy again 

When you want her lips, you get her cheek 
Makes you wonder where you are 
If you want some more then she's fast asleep 
You're just twinkling with the stars. 
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say 
You'll have to learn, just like me 
And that's the hardest way,

Rock And Roll Music,
Any old way you choose it,
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it.
It's gotta be Rock And Roll Music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me.

So she can hear my man await a sax,

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jockey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and roll music

It's way to early for a congo,
So keep a rockin' that piano

It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurt

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and
Mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Standin' over by the record machine

To be a minute over seventeen

Well if she's in the mood
No need to break it

Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Comin' by my way drivin' his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together

And keep it on the down low, nobody has to know (no, no)
We can keep it on the down low (on the down low), nobody has to know (nobody has to know)

Sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Changin' top locks with ripped off hinges

Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
Vision blurry, cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era

Finished for the rest of his life, till he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood but no signs say out
Mental slave-house where gats go off, I show off

Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, till they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on

Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up, hit it up, *puff*

Now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9
Watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hi Satan, United Nations quietly taken, to own your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation

Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole ma**, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow

Perishin', brain dead from a Erickson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune

Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said ""go and see the world for myself, and my brother Shafala""
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the rules, guitar strings he played smokin' his ?

? hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' cause somebody pulled a knife out

So I look at this poem, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, ?
Reading's what I should've done, cause my imagination would run

I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustlers and hoes, drugs and fo-fos
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows

Understand you a black sister, in this white man's

It's essential that you grow amongst your group
So you don't grow too fast and be doin lord knows who
Cuz daddy loves you, don't let nobody tell you different
What I, do for a living is a talent I'm given
And I'ma raise you too black too strong beautiful
Tell the truth let you know what women go through
Lies and deceit, the nigga you love he gone cheat
So be careful in the heat baby girl wit cold feet
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready

Put her over my knee and let her know this world is yours
Men are dogs take it from daddy and hold yours
Head high lady, love is bout lies and deception
Will always be seen through the eyes
In my demise don't cry just, hold on
Stay headstrong and live to learn that life goes on
The day you was born God answered my cry for help
I look at you a female replica of myself
I was conceived 2/29 you 9/22
God' whats the science in this sign you threw?
I wanna know just so I can spread the jewel to my youth
So she don't have to come up like I did runnin loots
Keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
For real

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever

When I look in yo eyes I see stars
It's me and you against the world
Baby it's in the signs
And anything you want you can get it daddy's getting it done
You the reason why I keep the hundreds under the ones
And go through rain sleet and snow to kiss the sun
Though my travel through the storm has just begun
Swear to god when my sister died, I was only five
Didn't even cry, couldn't know the value of a life
Know I realize why Brittney's so rare to me
She came at the time when nobody cared for me
This world's tough, I'ma guide you through it carefully
Learn the game and remember nothing in life's free
My little lady, can't quite understand me now
But baby, in time I'll break it down
So keep yo head steady, baby this world ain't ready
Make me proud you're daddy's little baby
For real

I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
I'll always come back to you
You're my baby now and ever

Listening it's the realest shit I've ever wrote
This is a letter
From Inga
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby

Dear Mommy, I apologize  
I know it's because of me that your life is traumatized (and)
it's cause of me that at times you want to die
But you was always there when your little Na Na cried (and)
When the media said Foxy's ill  
You was there when this fame almost got me killed
When I was in the hospital, could not be still
Only you knew the reasons why I popped these pills
And to my friends I love them and I know they care
But, time after time, you was always there
When I did the Vibe cover, holdin my crotch
I was wailin, while you prayed for me hopin I'll stop
Sorry for the times I didn't tell the truth
And I'm sorry for the times when I yelled at you
I love you mommy, sorry that's happened
Please pass the letter to Gavin

From Inga
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby
Ah yea oh oh oh yeah

Gavin, dang, where do I start
You knew it all, you was there from the start
My cold deed the ear to my heart
Just writing this tears me apart (see)
Seemed like yesterday when I signed my deal
Brought the Benz, and put you behind the wheel
I wanted you to know that I did it for us
And I wanted you to know I was committed to us
And of course the long way, we had our disputes
You didn't care for some of the things that I would do
But you still watched my back, complete and the same
You're the one that used to school me, and teach me the game (see)
Whether I'm here, or dead in a box
Keep my name alive, you know no bitch is better than Fox
I love you, tell ma I'll never forget her
Let Ant read the rest of the letter

Shimmering memories.. up in the studio gettin low
Listening it's the realest shit I've ever wrote
This is a letter
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby
Oh I love you yeah

Anton, don't let this letter get you down
Dagg, I hope I didn't let you down
I made my mistakes
I was young in the mind
But you gotta admit, I was one of a kind
Remember Miami when you fought my man
Can't imagine how mentally lost I am (memories)
Never knew life could be so painful
Tell daddy I love him, and I'm still his little angel
I'm all cried out, I feel like I want to go
Can't take this no more
I want my life like it was before
My life so raw
Love you Ant but I can't write no more

Oh come on come back home
Memories, memories
Oh I'm so sorry
I want my lover
Yeah this is my letter

It's a Wu-Tang official right here why'know
[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
Things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, the usual suspects, we at it
Vexed at it, why'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday

Uh, why'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope
[GZA]
We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle

Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope why'all niggaz is armed
And when we get there, all my niggaz in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich

Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggaz with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me

Cellular brings somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her she don't hit me back something is funny.
So I called her mother's house and asked has she seen my baby.
Roll my six around lookin' for that missing lady.
Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news
Then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused.
And then I turned the TV down
Cause I thought I heard a squicky sound,
Somethings going on upstairs
And I know nobody else lives here
""bump bump bump"" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear
Then I hear my babies voice in my ear screamin out

Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
(and I heard an other man said) sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(And I just can't believe this shit)

I ran downstairs looked in the closet lookin' for that ooo,
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a Preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin' ""not in my own damn house"".
Who would have thought she was creepin' wit another man?
The down low happenin' to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down
Cause I know I heard a squicky sound,
Something going on upstairs cause I know no one else lives here
""bump bump bump"" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear,
Then I hear my babies voice in my ear screamin'

Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
(and I heard an other man said) sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(And I just can't believe this shit)

What the hell is goin' on between the sheets in my home?
Baby wait let me explain before you start to point your cain.
Girl I'm bout to have a fit
""oh its bout to be some shit!""
How did I get in to this? Should have never came home with this bitch!
Low down dirty woman, back to where you come from
""but baby wait"" but wait my ass
Hit the streets your ass is grass!
Now Mista Biggs before you done
""Wait how you know my name son?""
""Honey wait I was gonna tell ya""
"" Move this cat looks real familiar""
Hmmm?!?! Now don't I know you from somewhere a long time ago?
No no I don't think so.
Yea yea, I feel I know you brother very well.
No No you mistaken me for somebody else.

""But"" Thought I told yo ass to get to walkin'!

Ronald Isley,"Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
There was liquor overflowin' the cup,
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck.
So I took one girl outside with me,
Her name was Londy, she went to Junior High with me,
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said,

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one to have a baby,
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
So she stared me right square in the eye
And said, ""Everyday I wake up, hoping to die""
She said, ""They're gonna know about pain
'Cause me and my sister ran away,
So our daddy couldn't rape us,
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to""

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Get up off my feet!

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor,
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone in and out of lock down,
I ain't got a job now,
He's just smokin' rock now,
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

House, cars, shopping mall 
Man I tell you its a battle call

Now no disrespect but man I'm tired 
Cause all these years its my back you've been riding 
We've been in and out of fights on these videos 
Now its about time you felt the real rodeo 
See I did it back in 98 of September 
You took her from me yea right you don't remember 
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera 
How clever you were when you slipped her your number 
(ooh) I know that makes y'all wanna know 
(ooh) Who's really on the down low 
You wonder why we're always at it there it is 
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs 
Cause I'm about to get, wild, wild, west 
Sick and tired of your mess 
You put me to the test 
And now I'm sticking out my chest 
So any last words before I draw these cannons 
Cause when the smoke clears I'll be the last man standing

Come to think about it - dirty, they got more than we do
They got mo' - juice in they talk, got mo' juice in they walk
They got mo' - juice in they veins, OOH GOD DAMN!
I tell you man it's a cryin shame..
.. how people use, the juice in vein - you hear me mayne
Pimp juice is color blind
You find it work on all color creeds and kinds
From ages 50 right down to 9
The Mayor of Nellyville and I won't resign, watch me recline
Cause you want to put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really want to put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - bitch I got all night
Matter fact, stand on my left boo - I know you ain't right

Crazy, I gotta work with what'chu gave me
You claimin' I'm a criminal and you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this holocaust headin' for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war
And got a busted jaw for sayin' fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm mad check the record
What's a nigga gotta do to get respected?
Sometimes I think I'm gettin' tested
And if I don't say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay testin'
I keep a vest on my chest in case the cops are gettin' restless
Walkin' around, ready to light shit up
But since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust, huh
They make a nigga be a killer; I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see who's realer
Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me
And I wonder if the Lord ever heard of me, huh

And a few dollars
That way he ain't have to worry about borrying
From a nigga
Told me to check on his old girl
Make sure its all good
For her and the kids
But hell I already did
And then he asked me about his shorty
I hate he asked me about his shorty
Cause its been some years since I saw him
Him not knowing his baby's momma's horror
And ever since the days he's been gone
She's kinda trapped in a storm
But he goes on and on about when he gets home
And then he mention every nigga that did him wrong
Put him right back where he started at
But he ain't snitched
So he feels them that niggaz in his click
They ought to pay for that
He did his time day for day without turning snake

I pray that God bless America

We gotta set examples for the kids
We first ought to teach em love
Cause these days us niggaz got
Too much hatred installed in us

I guess it still just ain't big enough

While y'all referring to y'all old books of the bible

To the hands of the men that befriend us

But whosever ain't forgiving

He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man, 
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, 
The plans that we've made,

And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,

So I had to introduce myself, didn't want nobody else
She’s not something you see every day
Got close and smelled the sweet perfume
I didn’t have nothing to lose
She was so surprised when I walked up to her hands

Hello, hello, girl what’s your name
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
Girl don’t say no if you feel the same
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
'Cause your so amazing to me girl (Amazing)
I need to have you here in my world
No second best for me won't do

That’s why I just got to be with you, hello
Hello, hello girl what’s your name
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
Girl don’t say no if you feel the same
I was thinking maybe we do dinner and a movie
Oh, hello
How about dinner and a movie
Don’t say no

Ronald Isley,"How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
Twenty on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend 'em a ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
Twenty on six, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion
Asked me for ten grand
Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, beat it
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, my son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car and tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal
'Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
You looked at me and said, your potential is bittersweet
I looked at him and said, every nickel is mines to keep
He looked at me and said, know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God

I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be

And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back

Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade

A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train
",Blue Train,2013
Ronan Browne,"Made up my mind to go
Some place so far away, I headed west
Without a sad goodbye
No hugs or tears that way, it's probably for the best
Sent cards along the way
Said I was looking for a brand new life
I never settled down
My wanderlust would always cut the ties like a knife
Sometimes the lonesome wind
Calls out just like it knows me
And on a night like this
When I don't know where to go, he shows me the way

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

I always looked ahead
I was so afraid that I'd be caught behind
Followed a crooked stream
To places I'd never seen and one more highway sign
Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end
But it's not so I can rest
For me it's the time that's best for talking to my friend

Cause he knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

Now half my life is gone
The only home I have is open road
My skin is cracked and brown
A mirror to the dessert ground and the dusty wind that blows
I never made a mark
Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind,2014
Ronan Browne,"After the morning there comes an evening
And after the evening another day
And after a false love there comes a true love
I'd have you listen now to what I say

I swear my love is the finest young man
As fair as any the sun shines on
But how to save him, I do not know it
For he has got a sentence to be hung

As he was marching the streets of Derry
I own he marched up right manfully
Being much more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallows tree

""What keeps my love so long in coming
Oh what detains her so long from me
Or does she think it a shame or scandal
To see me die upon the gallows tree""

He looked around and he saw her coming
And she was dressed all in woolen fine
The weary steed that my love was riding
It flew more swiftly than the wind

Come down, come down from that cruel gallows
I've got your pardon from the king
And I'll let them see that they dare not hang you
And I'll crown my love with a bunch of green",The Streets of Derry,2014
Ronan Hardiman,"I danced in the morning when the world was begun,
I dance in the moon and the stars and the sun,
I came down from Heaven and I danced on earth,
At Bethlehem I had my birth.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee,
They would not dance, they wouldn't follow me.
So I danced for the fishermen,
James and John came with me and the dance went on.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame,
The Holy people said it was a shame.
They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high,
Left me there on a cross to die.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black,
It's hard who dance with the devil on your back.
They buried my body, they thought I'd gone,
But I am the dance, and I still go on.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he.

They cut me down, but I lept up high.
""I am the life that'll never never die
And I'll live in you if you'll live in me.
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he.

""Dance then, wherever you may be,
I am the Lord of the dance,"" said he,
""And I'll lead you all wherever you may be,
And I'll lead you all in the dance,"" said he",The Lord of the Dance [*],1997

I thought I lost, but actually I won

Well I could have turned left
And you could have turned right
I could have stayed at home that night
And you you might have never caught that train, for the rain
Well if you hadn't smiled and if I hadn't asked
We could have been two ships that passed
And I might have never known your name
Thank god I kissed you, that I kissed you

Thank god I kissed you
That I touched you
That I met you, now I love you
Well I'm hooked on you and without you I'm insane

Well I could have turned left
And you could have turned right
I could have stayed at home that night
And you you might have never caught that train, for the rain
Well if you hadn't smiled and if I hadn't asked
We could have been two ships that passed
And I might have never known your name
And thank god I kissed you
Thank god I kissed you
Thank god I kissed you
Cause I could have missed you
Thank god that I kissed you
That I touched you
That I met you , now I love you

Ronan Keating,"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
I don't have much money but boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live 
If I was a sculptor but then again no 
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 

My gift is my song 
And this one's for you 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 

How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind 
While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that 
Keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting 

But these things I do 
You see I've forgotten 
If they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but 
Now that it's done 

I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

Chased my share of rainbows in the sky
Before I stopped to ask the question why
I've fallen out of love too many times

But now I see
The possibilities
Of how my life could be

From any other love I'd walked away
Love is temporary I would say
Now each night I find a reason to stay
With you there's always brighter days

I've broken a heart, a heart or two
I've let the curtain fall I guess, it's true
The thought of something borrowed,
Something blue
Was something that I never could pursue

But now you're here
My doubt has disappeared
The clouds are gone, it's clear

As much as I can give you girl [Repeat: x3]
I had a bad day and then I heard what you had to say
After I had a hard week it's getting harder to turn the other cheek
It's going to be a tough month without you cause you give me the bump
So this is my last year because without you I don't even care

I've tried so hard but how about you?
And here I am trying to save what already died

As much as I can give you girl
I'm gonna send your way
I need you I can't give up girl
Please don't go away

The day we first met you were innocent and so full of life
You said you'd follow me across this whole earth where are you tonight?
So you go fly while I get sold and you'll go far like we all know
Til one fine day you'll realize what you let die

I spent my whole life just to find you
And lost it all in just one day so as much as I can give you girl

Baby I'm gonna aft blow you away

I'm blown [15]

You make me feel like a stranger in my own house
You got me running around just like a scared mouse
You were always saying that I was your destiny
Then pretty baby why aren't you here next to me
You made all of my dreams
And fantasies come alive, but it was lies
I gave you all my love and got shot between the eyes

Well baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away

You got me feeling like a stranger in my own heart
I'm acting so together but I'm falling apart
I'm begging lover, begging mother, begging saviour please
I ain't got no leg to stand on much less my knees
You never even tried to let me know where we stand

Was it planned?
That when you ran away you'd leave a bomb in my hands

And baby I'm blown away
The way you made me go away
You'll let me know how this love has been thrown away
Now every time I think of you
I'm blown away

Were all these dreams for nothing?
You make me want to cry
We made this flower to grow girl

Not to die

I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She''s lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me

In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one

And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one

This year's for me and you

They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging,
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day

You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse

My mind's filled with a thousand thoughts of you
And how you left without a warning
But looking back I'm sure you tried to talk it through

Now I see it clearly
We're together but living separate lives

So want to tell you I'm sorry
Baby I can't find the words
But if I could, then you know I would, yeah

No I won't let you go, know what we can be
I won't watch my life, crashing down on me
Guess I had it all, right there before my eyes
Girl, I'm sorry now, you were the last thing on my mind

You carried me like a river
How far we've come still surprises me

And now I look in the mirror
Staring back is the man
I used to be

With you
How I long for you

No I won't let you go, know what we can be
I won't watch my life, crashing down on me
Guess I had it all, right there before my eyes
Girl, I'm sorry now, you were the last thing on my mind

Could have been there
Should have been so strong

Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
In her strawberry eyes
The way she sees you signifies
That she's susceptible to your velvet lies
But if you must lay her down
May a butterscotch glow be her dressing gown
And please do not lead her on when you leave town
Even though there's nothing I can say
To cheat you and nature any way
Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time
She's a woman now
With a daughter to make her proud
In her crayon world of paper clouds
She still remembers you
The first boy that she gave it to
And she laughs at how little then she knew
Her daughter's five and her grandfather adores her (of course)
Let her down easy
Her heart is on the line
Let her down easy
And you'll grow up in time

Ronan Keating,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the night can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
