Eric Dolphy,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,2009
Eric Dolphy,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon/Ornithology,2009
Eric Dolphy,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back To Me/Quicksilver,2009
Eric Dolphy,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2012
Eric Dolphy Quintet,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.",Pick Yourself Up,2005

We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Seem to be happening again

A healthy, grown-up, busy-busy bee
Whiling away all the passing hours
Pinching all the pollen from the cauliflowers

Flying around the garden, brightest ever seen
Taking back the honey to the dear old queen

Building up the honey-comb that looks like tripe

Being just as busy as a bee can be
Flying all around in the wild hedgerows
Stinging all the cows upon the parson's nose
Oh, what a wonderful thing to be
A healthy, grown-up, busy-busy bee
Visiting the picnics, quite a little tease
Raising little lumps on the maiden's knees
I'd like to be a busy little bee
Being with the butterfly strong upon the wing
Whooppee, o death, where is thy sting?

Heed the detour, life's like a seesaw
The ups and downs, and I'll bet there'll be more
Potholes and obstacles in our path, that's righteous
At times you need a hand to fight this

But now you try to glaze me, play me and diss me
Uh, wide awake, ready to break, so we argue
What happened to the kisses, and, ""Why, how are you?""
Forgot about the times when I rhymed when I bathed you
Dreams was the only little things that I gave you
You still ain't thankful, you're still complainin'
Used to be a quiet storm, but now it's rainin'
Farther than ever, I'm thinkin' whether
If we should be friends, let it end, is it better
To forget or remember, your body's tender
The rhymes that I send her, makes her surrender
The feeling of capture, caught in a rapture
No woman can match ya, so when I'm lookin' at ya
Paint a perfect picture so you can remember me
But you can find the end if you pretend to be

Selling flowers
Pretending she was blind
So I said, ""Won't you please believe me
Instead of running 'round and
Laughing all the time?""
She was five foot four and lonely
As she walked into my room,
""So this is where you stay""
But when I tried to tell her
About these lonely walls
There was nothing, I could say

Do you believe in me
I'm yours you're mine
And though you refuse to see, I'll be behind

Anyday & anyway another rain had to come
And it got to me as well, well, well
When your losing what you came for
In the first place it gets fogged
Believe me, I can tell, I can tell
So I slip into my lonely room
And saying to myself
It doesn't matter if I fall
But then I heard some noises at my door and far away
There was somebody, somebody who shouted

Do you believe in me
I'm yours, you're mine
And though you refuse to see
I'll be behind

Do you believe in me
I'm yours, you're mine
And though you refuse to see

Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it.
Finding beauty in the dissonance.
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.

Trying to pick up a girl
Why are my eyes
Filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world

Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun
Pining a way in a heat wave there
Hoping that I won't be long
I should be lying on that sun swept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin

Eric Hansen,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Thoughts meander like a 
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,

To win her love is nothing I wouldn't do
Talking to her all would seem would give her a thrill

Well, I might have stretched the truth just a tiny bit
When I told her that I had one with a continental kit
Ya, well, I don't steal but I've been known to borrow
Ya, tonight we've been rolling like there's no tomorrow

She's cuddling up close rubbing my back
Doing a little this, doing a little that
I'm sure gonna hate to have to sneak it back
But we've been riding 'round in someone else's Cadillac

I got my uncle Willy's watch and my daddies money clip
My cousin Bubbas black boots with a golden silver tips
Ya, she's purring like a kitten, I'm the cats meow
I'm gonna trade a weeks pay for a night on the town

Well, how could I tell her what she don't know
When she's sitting here thinking, I'm a king of the road
Ya, well, I don't steal but I've been known to borrow

Doing a little this, doing a little that
I'm sure gonna hate to have to sneak it back
But we've been riding 'round in someone else's Cadillac

We were in the back seat parked under the stars
When I saw the blue lights of that police car
Ya, well officer, now I don't steal but I've been known to borrow
Ya, tonight we've been rolling like there's no tomorrow

Now can you find it in your heart to cut me some slack
I'll admit, it ain't mine sir, that's a fact
But I was gonna take her home and then sneak it on back

When I don't have you
I can't shake my sins
When you don't come through

How could you leave me
Just when you see me crying
And I can't feel low down
When I don't have legs to stand on

I can't feel low down
When I there ain't no ground to land on
How could you leave me
How could you leave me

Eric Hutchinson,"Call me crazy if you've got it in you
But these people don't seem to mind
Sweet vermouth now you're telling me the truth
A little stubbornness will work out fine

A bottom feeder at the end of my rope
But I'm wondering where this rope began
Gonna circle around what I couldn't help bring down
It's just supply with demand

Nothing looks the same
Even when there's been no change
Say that somethings gonna give
And it's all giving out on you

When it's all over now
It's all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now

A large pickup truck with a little cargo towed
Gets from baker's to the laundromat
These daily fights all start to sound alike
I guess I'm gonna have to live with that

Short changed
Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition
Short changed
Now it's getting even harder to identify the repetition

Will I simply peel away
Feels more likely everyday
Say that somethings gonna give
And it's all giving out on you

When it's all over now
It's all over now
It's no longer fun and it's all been overdone
So it's all over now

And if you came here to tell me that you're sorry
For the pain you couldn't cause
Then save your breath and use it
Just to regain what you have lost and look at the cost",All Over Now,2006
Eric Hutchinson,"And now I'm trying to decide if I feel dirty at all
Cause it gets hard to tell
It's never just black and white she's got a mind of her own
And she uses it well

So she invites me over outside villanova
She's got some pull-out sofa that we won't hardly need
She is only drinking soda revving up that motor
Got places we could go to but I still won't believe

That she's only gifted
When I'm standing by her side
She goes unassisted
And I start to relax as I cut her some slack

[Chorus]
So get up I gotta go to work
Facing all these people who now know I'm a jerk
And it's a set-up I gotta change my clothes
Concealing all this evidence before everybody knows
What I've done and what I'm gonna do ?again

And in the middle of the night I have a breakdown of sorts
With regret creeping in
She's gonna put up a fight and she will get her way
Cause she loves sleeping in

So I need someone to side with when she begins confiding
And I cannot provide it cause I'm endlessly cold
She says she's so excited to play some groom and bride
With me but I'm undecided so I need to be told

That she's only sinking
When I'm sleeping by her side
With a change of thinking
I could pull us away even just for a day

[Chorus]

She grows impatient to change my tune
She's geting older and legal soon
And I wasn't ready to start out and go upsetting
Some girl that I'd be forgetting
By the time the cops came by that afternoon
And I try to decide as she pulls me aside

And makes us wish we'd shown respect before
Though I don't have much of a choice
I resolve to regain my voice

If I only just begin to understand it that's because
Everytime I time I start to change my mind again
It gets me back to where I was

New life we never had a clue
The two of us deciding what to do
Though my hands are all but tied
I rebound so I can say at least I tried

Eric Hutchinson,"Don't let this affect the game every five months we act the same
But I never get used to putting you off
And no one could've scripted this who knows what'll come of it
I refuse to believe it was all just a waste

[Chorus]
Cause look around
Everybody's on the food chain
Funny but from day to day we get bottom to top
And if you get lost you start over again
But we don't ever get to no we don't ever get to stop

I wake up in the oblivious state go to sleep trying to save some face
Cause I've never been one for acting naïve
And so what we've got nothing to prove
Why on earth would we soften the mood
Do we think that this wire is better left live

I would've known better if I was on the outside
I would've known better if I was on the outside
Looking in looking in
But this chain just eats away at the people who use it
No ones gonna say that it's easier losing
Touch with who we need
When it's lonelier on the outside

Eric Hutchinson,"Long as I am erasing this there's something I am bound to miss
Opportunities exist but often don't arise
And think of how it must have felt to watch you walk away and melt
I keep it all inside myself and in between my eyes
And it's no surprise what we've become
Since the arrival has begun

It hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright
I'm only concerned with the way we end up
I think I've been wrong enough to know when I'm right
So put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone
It hasn't been long enough

I feel as if I spoke too soon and ruined the whole afternoon
A feeling that we're more than doomed is creeping up inside
And good as it was bound to be there's something about you and me
It's negative in chemistry which makes it hard to hide
And it's no surprise when lights are falling
It's bound to re-awake some primal calling

It hasn't been long enough to even begin to think it's alright
I'm only concerned with the way we end up
I think I've been wrong enough to know when I'm right
So put up fight if you must but we know that our trust is undone
It hasn't been long enough

What's making you believe that the seventh time around is gonna be different
You know I'm not convinced

And I'm not any different so I won't listen",It Hasn't Been Long Enough,2008
Eric Hutchinson,"I got arrested in the dark of the night
The cop got restless as he read me my rights
He told me, ""I'm always envious of those that I jail
If I got locked up nobody come to help me post bail""
And I said ""oh!""

Went to a party on the side of a hill
Met three Latinas who had gotten their fill.
They told me ""nobody ever gets us down on our knees
Simply to help us take a load off our feet.""
And I said ""oh!""

And I'm never sure what I'm living for but it's always on my mind
Someone comes along always proves me wrong think im gonna be fine

I picked a pocket just to give it all back
Took out the license left the money in tact
The man said ""I wanna thank you"" and I had to ask why
""That was the old me I was living a lie""
And I said ""oh!""

Riding the subway with the scent of her hair
She took out a toothbrush started using it there
She explained ""I'm always sure today's the day I will die
I wanna look good if I get to look god in the eye""

And I'm never sure what I'm living for but it's always on my mind
Someone comes along always proves me wrong think im gonna be fine

We get lost in the back of our minds
Got nothing to burn but time time time
Everybody's got the love but they keep it inside

Met an acquaintance we were reintroduced
With more in common than we had in our youth

Figuring which club to sneak in

To make sure he's fitting in and living large
Disregard the lies that he will tell and what he's probably like
'Cause it's not hard his charm is gonna get him through the night

Every girl out wants to be her
But they look the same already why adjust
Reading the magazine secrets
Forgetting the topical regrets
'Cause if she comes home all alone the night's a bust
It's a must the swivel in her hips and the look she gives
It's all her trust if only in the morning she knew where she lived

Where people all have a good time

My ears are going out of my mind, mind, mind

It's a cliche to put it this way

I'm never leaving the floor

Tells us to hang our burdens up
He says songs you hear today all start to get in the way
Till you're barely feeling the love, love, love, love
He drops the needle on a pop song
He drops the needle on some soul
And I watch a pimp fall in love over there
Dancing to songs their parents would know, know, know, know
So everybody give me room now
Watch me cut a rug in the show

I'm going down to the basement

Just want to hear some favorite before my years
Dance soldiers forgetting our day jobs

And I need you, but there are things I cannot do
And I want you when he's playing all his games
And it gets hard to tell who's the victim
And I am watching you watch him

Oh oh what is there to learn?
When he will let you crash and burn
He never gives attention
But you're still...
Where do I fit in
When I'm watching you watch him?

God only knows why I still wait around

And I need you, but there are things I cannot do

Got to know where you stand
If you are going to try to make a move
She is standing alone with her girls and I don't think she minds
You better not give a damn
If you are going to be one of those dudes
I've seen a thousand come round and she
justs shoot them all down the cold shoulder

So if you want my advice don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed 
You could give her your heart she wants your sister's instead 
Better forget about Joni

Her black hair shines in the night
A fixture smile and she loves to tease
All the atheates and actors have called but she's never responded
She's got those jeans on so tight
She's half egyptian and half japanese
Each time she batting an eye congressmen senators cry 
Oh mama help me

You can give her your heart she wants your sister's instead

All the men want Joni so much
But she don't want the touch of a man

Your gonna know where you were
The very moment that you caught these blues
And you will lie awake all through your nights wondering what she's doing
Just look at me if your unsure
I've walked a thousand miles in your shoes
I've spent the rest of my life back at this bar everynight trying to love her

So if you want my advice
Don't let it go to your head
She's the kind of girl who wants a girl in her bed 
You can forgive her your heart she wasn't your sister's instead

On the front a desert sky orange red and brown 
She wrote will you think of me when the sun goes down

She wrote it wasn't anything I did
To make her leave me all alone to raise both our kids 
Said she cannot spend the night in that desert town
Cause she always thinks of me when the sun goes down

So hard to know how long its gonna take
To hear the heart that was never supposed to break
She said to tell her mother hi for her
And that she thinks of coming home but she's still not sure
Plays piano when she can
But she hates the sound
And she always thinks of me when sun goes down

Eric Idle,"Cheer up, Brian.  You know what they say.
Some things in life are bad,
They can really make you mad.
Other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle,
Don't grumble, give a whistle!
And this'll help things turn out for the best 
And 
 
Always look on the bright side of life!
 
Always look on the bright side of life 
If life seems jolly rotten,
There's something you've forgotten!
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing,
 
When you're feeling in the dumps,
Don't be silly chumps,
Just purse your lips and whistle -- that's the thing!
And  always look on the bright side of life 
 
Come on!
 
Always look on the bright side of life 
 
For life is quite absurd,
And death's the final word.
You must always face the curtain with a bow!
Forget about your sin -- give the audience a grin,
Enjoy it, it's the last chance anyhow!
 
So always look on the bright side of death!
Just before you draw your terminal breath.
Life's a piece of shit,
When you look at it.
 
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true,
You'll see it's all a show,
Keep 'em laughing as you go.
Just remember that the last laugh is on you!
 
And always look on the bright side of life 

Always look on the bright side of life

Come on guys, cheer up

Always look on the bright side of life 

Always look on the bright side of life 

Worse things happen at sea you know

Always look on the bright side of life 

I mean, what have you got to lose?
you know, you come from nothing
you're going back to nothing
what have you lost? Nothing!

Eric Idle,"Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown,
And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,

And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
In all of the directions it can whiz;
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!",The Galaxy Song,2000

Here she comes -- alone in the night
She looks in your eyees while she's breaking your heart
And her smile -- Mona Lisa style
She lends you her heart -- Lets you think you're the only one
But she'll leave you...

Lonely in the night
She breaks all her lovers' hearts
Lonely in the night
Dreaming of a love that fades away

When she wants -- she gets what she wants
She looks in your eyes and you give her everything
So demure -- so insecure
Oh how she conceals -- all that she really feels
And she'll leave you...

As she breaks another heart (that's)

Eric Johnson,"Way down here on the edge of these snows
I hear a strong wind whine
Goin' to where the freedom bells ring
Into the Highlands I must climb

On this journey, I have been here before
Tryin' to reach the other side
I just can't get through the top of these hills
Without a mountain guide

Took such a while to find you
Oh, could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew
You're the only one, so take me through High Landrons

Up ahead, I know the trail way stops
From there on, only eagles fly
Burning with visions of the way back to you
They're burnin' through the eastern sky

Now and then I see a shooting star
Lighting up the silver blue
It's shining all the way down the mountain skyway
Oh, it's shining straight from you

Took all my life to find you
Oh, could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew
You're the only one, so take me through High Landrons

Up ahead, took all my life to find you
Oh could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew, you're the only one
So take me through High Landrons, up ahead

Don't you lose your life
Put down your gun
Stay inside tonight

With artillery
Shots rang out Bart's men were fallin'

Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps

Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth

Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then

From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school

I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Lui si beau et moi si lais

Je te donnerais la lune

Tu ne voudrais pas m'aimer

Et lui sans faire un seul geste

Sans un mot sans un regard

Il a mis de la tendresse

Au fond de tes grands yeux noirs

Tu lui donneras ton corps

Tu croiras à ses serments

Tu l'aimes pour le dehors

Sans voir ce qu'il why a dedans

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Lui seigneur et moi vaurien

Il te donnera la lune

Toi qui ne demandais rien

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Aime ton beau cavalier

La satin de ta peau brune

N'est pas pour les va-nu-pieds

Ma laideur est une insulte

A ta beauté insolente

Une erreur de la nature

Qui ne me fut pas aimante

Dieu que le monde est injuste

Notre lot n'est pas le leur

Nous n'avons pas de fortune

Mais eux, ont-ils donc un coeur ?

Ils sont nés dans la dentelle

Pour faire l'amour et la guerre

Mais nous pauvres vers de terre

Notre vie est bien plus belle

Et de quel côté est Dieu

do côté des ostensoirs

Ou bien do côté de ceux

Qui le prient matin et soir

Ce Jésus que l'on adore

A t-il toujours préféré

Les Rois Mages avec leur or

A nous autres pauvres bergers

Dieu que la vie est cruelle

Pour deux coeurs qui se cherchaient

Moi si laid et toi si belle

Comment pourrais-tu m'aimer

Ailleurs c’est trop loin
C’est beaucoup trop loin
Ailleurs c’est trop loin
Et j’y comprends rien

De quoi t’as peur quand la nuit s’en vient?
Si t’es coincé quelque part un matin
Donne-moé donc la main
Je saurai t’aider
Donne-moé donc la main
Je saurai t’aimer

À partir de d’là c’est dur à dire
Ce serait-tu parce que j’ peux pu mentir?
C’est-tu les mots, c’est-tu la musique?
Ou ben si c’est moé
Qui est un peu fuckée?
Ou ben si c’est moé
Qui s’rait mélangée?

Aide-moé, aide-moé à me retrouver
Aide-moé, aide-moé à me retrouver, bébé
Je suis perdue
Oui je suis coincée
J’ai besoin de donner
J’ai besoin de toé

Si tu pouvais m’emmener là où ça sent bon
Oùsque mes mots vivraient quelque part
J’ m’en irais toute seule sans ton aide
J’ comprendrais un p’tit peu plus
Que c’est que j’ fais là
Mais vois-tu, j’ comprends jamais
J’ suis toujours perdue

Si j’ pouvais au moins voir de face
Ce que je sais, ce que je fuis
J’ai quelque chose en d’dans d’ mon cœur
Qui me fait vibrer tout au long de moé
Qui me fait vibrer mais j’ai rien que le goût
Hé hé hé, j’ai rien que le goût d’ brailler

Aide-moé, aide-moé à me retrouver
Aide-moé, aide-moé à me retrouver
Je suis perdue
Oui, je suis coincée
Je suis tannée de toujours me cacher

C'est un mot qu'on dirait inventé pour elle
Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps à jour
Tel un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler
Alors je sens l'enfer s'ouvrir sous mes pieds

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

Belle
Est-ce le diable qui s'est incarné en elle
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel

Elle porte en elle le péché originel
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel
Celle qu'on prenait pour une fille de joie une fille de rien
Semble soudain porter la croix du genre humain

Ô Notre-Dame!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Pousser la porte du jardin d'Esmeralda

Belle
Malgré ses grands yeux noirs qui vous ensorcellent
La demoiselle serait-elle encore pucelle
Quand ses mouvements me font voir monts et merveilles
Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel

Ma dulcinée laissez-moi vous être infidèle
Avant de vous avoir menée jusqu'à l'autel
Quel est l'homme qui détournerait son regard d'elle
Sous peine d'être changé en statue de sel

Ô Fleur-de-Lys!
Je ne suis pas homme de foi
J'irai cueillir la fleur d'amour d'Esmeralda

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Ô laisse moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

That's alright, I clock 'em that way
Remind me of something James used to say

""I like 'em fat""

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch

A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery, just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore

Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded, must be displayed

Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here

His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing

In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal

Tip-toeing in the street like Dally
Pulled up, moped to the valley
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise

Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I watch her skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a handstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, that ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, you need to slow down
Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.

She called me her ape man orang-utan 
Me Tarzan, she Jane

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1995
Eric Reed,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Eric Reed,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.

One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Eric Reed,"I don't take coffee, I take tea, my dear
I like my toast done on one side

Modesty, propriety can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society

Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

And mail it right away

So lock the doors and call me yours

Eric Roberson,"How does is feel to finally be free?
I wonder will I ever know
Sometimes I dream of how that can be
To have a life that I own

When you look at me, what do you see?
Do you understand my story?
All I want is love, someone else to see
If you took the time I have a song

For so, so long I've been searching
For something that we’re probably not meant to find
But no matter how hard it gets
No matter if the tears fall
Nothing should stop us from trying

When you look at me, what do you see?
Do you understand my story?
All I want is love, someone else to see
If you took the time I have a song

When you look at me, what do you see?
Do you understand my story?
All I want is love, someone else to see
If you took the time I have a song

Do you understand my story?

Eric Roberson,"Back in the day, before there was love
Before there was us, before I knew what
It really meant to have me somebody
Who's really there giving there all for me

Back in the day, I didn't know none
Before we was one, I learned on the run
What it would take to keep our hearts happy
Straight to the end, can't let this chance pass me

Baby, we made mistakes
But I see just what it takes
The last thing I want us to make
Is steps that we'll take us far from our fate

Girl, how can something so clear
Just push back something so near
Now I don't want to be cause of your tears
Your worries, your fears should all disappear, baby

There's no need to worry
Just that I am ready
Even when I'm away my heart
Stands right back here with you

Whenever you call, girl
My heart reaches back for you
No matter how far away
My heart runs right back to you

Back in the day I would have just ran
But now here I stand, I'm making these plans
What's in a day if you're not my future?
Why give these words if they do not move ya?

I wanna just build, I wanna just heal
Those negative feels when out on the field
Most of my boys think that I've gone crazy
'Cause since I met you, none of these girls faze me

Baby, it's you I hold, lately it's hard to let go
It's crazy even when I know
That I just have to go, I can't pull to the door

I know it has to be love, you fell down from up above
As if you came down here just for me
To somehow help me see how heaven can be

There's no need to worry
Just that I am ready
Even when I'm away my heart
Stands right back here with you

Whenever you call, girl
My heart reaches back for you
No matter how far away
My heart runs right back to you

More ever more
You will find so much love [Incomprehensible] in me
I've learned to love
Take your time so that you can see
You can trust in me

So baby, won't you lay back?
My lady, won't you relax?
I got you, take care of that
Your front to your back
Your sides and all that

All that is mine
What comes to mind
Put those behind
Love your design

There's no need to worry
Just that I am ready
Even when I'm away my heart
Stands right back here with you

Whenever you call, girl
My heart reaches back for you
No matter how far away
My heart runs right back to you

There's no need to worry
Just that I am ready

She ought to know by now everything I say I feel
She ought to know by now there's no secrets to conceal
She ought to know by now

Pulled out my heart and rang out all the love
Gave it to her but it was not enough
Went back to see if I left some behind
Hoping that one more drop will make you mine

She ought to know by now that the love I have is real
She ought to know by now everything I say I feel
She ought to know by now there's no secrets to conceal
She ought to know by now

I'm out here knockin' but she won't let me in
Just keeps on stoppin' before we can begin
But once I'm in she will see how good love can be
But right now her past is clouding her views of me

She ought to know by now that the love I have is real
She ought to know by now everything I say I feel
She ought to know by now there's no secrets, no, no secrets
She ought to know by now

Want to show I love her so

I gave her kiss she said she needed more
I got in my car and went straight to the store
I spent all my dollars and took a part a rose
For every step ya take I drop these on your toes

She shook her head so I wrote a letter
Hoping that my words would come across better
But still no reply, least not the one I hoped
She just closed out her eyes and let out these notes

So I just stood there scratchin' my head, hey
Prolly when I should have been listening instead
Wanted to know her wishes not just her fears
Just want her to know, know that I'm here

She ought to know by now that the love I have is real
She ought to know by now everything I say I feel
She ought to know by now there's no secrets to conceal
She ought to know by now

Oh, she ought to know by now there's no love that's not real
She ought to know by now everything I say is real
Hey, she ought to know by now there's no secret to conceal
And I'm done 'cause she should know by now

You ought to know I need you, you ought to know I care
In your love I believe in, my heart is yours to have
Now just know I'm here, you ought to know I'm yours
There's no need to fear, no need to be unsure

You ought to know to trust me you ought to know I'm honest
So have some understanding let the truth be your promise
I know I have a love I know I have a friend
But do we know each other? We won't know till the end

You ought to know by now

Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my bonnie bride.
The roses all have left your cheek.
I've watched them fade away and die
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes.

   To where your heart will feel no pain
   And when the fields are fresh and green
   I'II take you to your home again! :|

I know you love me, Kathleen, dear
Your heart was ever fond and true.
I always feel when you are near
That life holds nothing dear, but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me
I scarcely ever see them now
Though many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.
Refrain:

To that dear home beyond the sea
My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream
Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

Left and never looking back
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
Music wherever you go
You don't fit in a smalltown world
But I feel you're the girl for me
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
You're leaving town where nobody knows

I could feel my chance was coming
Another time, another place
A pillow filled with frozen tears
See the gates, a distant fire
Shows the way, to my desire
Laying down my heart for you
’cause I’m lonely, feelin’ blue
I know that I’ll never die on love
But I’ll never get enough
Oh, I got no time to lose

On my avenue to a jet airliner
Avenue to my broken dreams
My avenue to a jet airliner

Love is a lie
Love is a mess
Telling the secrets of loneliness
Our love survive
Our love survive
Letters are written
Words are spoken
Some hearts are better left unbroken
How will love survive
How will love survive
Little by little, step by step
We will kill the dirty heads
Heart to heart and side by side
Love will never hide

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I know I can count on you.
Sometimes I feel like saying ""Lord, I just don't care"".

And things go wrong no matter what I do.
Now and then I feel like life is just too much.
But you've got the love I need to see me through.

I know I can count on you.
Sometimes I feel like saying ""Lord, I just don't care"".
But you've got the love I need to see me through.

Time after time I say, ""Oh Lord, what's the use"".
Time after time I say, ""This just won't do"".
But sooner or later in life the things you love you lose.
Just like before I know I call on you.

Occasionally my thoughts are brave and friends are few.
Occasionally I cry out, ""Lord, what must I do"".
Occasionally I call up, ""Master, make me new"".
You've got the love to see me through.

Eric Stern,"Why did I wander
Hereand there and yonder,
Wasting precious time
For no reason or rhyme?
Isn't it a pity!
Isn't it a crime!
My journey is ended,
Everything is splendid;
Meeting you today
Has given me a wonderful idea 
Here I stay!

It's a funny thing;
I look at you,
I get a thrill I never knew,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Here we are at last,
It's like a dream,
The two of us, a perfect team,
Isn't it a pity we never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
You with the neighbours,
I at silly labours!
What joys untasted,
You readin Heine,
Me somewhere in China!

Let's forget the past, let's both agree
That I'm for you and you're for me,
And it's such a pity we never, never met before!

Imagine all the lonely years we've wasted,
Fishing for salmon,
Losing at backgammon!
What joys untasted,
My nights were sour,
Spent with Schopenhauer!

Eric Stern,"Back in the days of knights and armor,
There once lived a lovely charmer,
Swimming in the Rhine,
Her figure was divine!

She had a yen for all the sailors,
Fishermen and gobs and whalers,
She had a most immoral eye,
They called her Lorelei.
She created quite a stir,
And I want to be like her!

I want to be like the gal on the river
Who sang her songs to the ships passing by,
She had the goods and how she could deliver,
The Lorelei!

She used to love in a strange kind of fashion,
With lots of ""hey, ho-de-ho, hi-de-hi!"",
And I can guarantee I'm full of passion,
Like the Lorelei!

Oh I'm treacherous, ya ya,
And I just can't hold myself in check!
And I'm lecherous, ya ya,
I wanna bite my initials on a sailor's neck!

And each affair has a kick and a wallop,
For what they crave I can always supply!
I wanna be like that other trollop
Called the Lorelei!

I wanna be like the gal on the river

I hope to ask you, dear, will you be mine?
The lovers you have had say you're the best egg
They repeat, you're completely divine

But you are better than the two combined
How can it be you fancy me, is it that love is blind?

I'm about the luckiest man in the world
To have a girl like you, I'm told by Fritz and Peter
Your lips would not be sweeter

Oh, you must be a marvelous thing to delight
The many men you do, the secrets they can find
Have made me swell with pride

We shall move to larger quarters
To make your boyfriends feel at home
Your iceman and your cops and porters
Would fill the hippodrome

I'm very lucky to have a little girl like you

I'm proud because I can't see
Yet struck the nations fancy

And things each time the doorbell rings

When you were through with him last summer
He couldn't plumb at all

She got boyfriends by the dozen, when she sang in a lowdown way
She was a positive sensation
The songs that she sang would never miss
My cousin was my inspiration
That`s how I got like this

I got a cousin in Milwaukee
She`s got a voice so squawky
And though she`s tall and kind of gawky
Oh, how she gets the men

Her singing isn`t operatic
It`s got a lot of static
What makes your heart get acrobatic
Nine times out of ten

When she sings hot, you can`t be solemn
It sends the shivers up and down your spinal column
When she sings blue, the men shout, ""What stuff!""
That baby is hot stuff

So if you like the way I sing songs,
If you think that I`m a wow
You can thank my squawky cousin from Milwaukee
Because she taught me how

Making of my days.

If you can't put the words to the tune,

Travellers in a storm,
Finding love is warm.

Eric Tingstad,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1988

In his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold

But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Fuck, a nigga just don't fit in
No one close to kin
I write about it so much, I done broke my pen
And I'm so sick of pretendin' my life is dandy and flawless
I'm stuck on a road to hell, fightin' demons
But I let 'em drag me across it
While everybody happily applauds it
Tell me what caused it
Was it Monroe High? That's where I went to school at
All the black kids said I was white-washed
And the white kids said I was too black
When I skateboarded, I got booed at
At lunchtime, I was who they threw food at
I was tryin' so hard to cope with it
I wanted to run up on campus with two gats
And just (ahh) let loose
Put some niggas in the E.R. for tryna treat me like a retard
Where the fuck does my future lie? I can't see far
Momma's little sweetheart, he developed an attitude
Picked up a mic, that's a hell of an avenue
He gon' take yo' ass to hell and then back with you
Life is a class you can tell I've been absent to
My massive doubt has got me wrapped around
And it drags me down a bit
I don't know how to cast it out, I try to rap profound
So you could laugh about the shit
Truth is, yo, I never laughed
I'm lookin' for wherever Heaven's at
The black sheep, they won't let him past
They would rather get together
Tie him up and then behead his ass, got me hella sad

That nigga whose brain is off, I am that
My train of thought left on Amtrak
I take the loss and I stand back
I can't play the cards with no hand clap
I can't recall when this damn crap
Became so overwhelmin' I started rebellin'
I hate as all as I stand at
Never got no love from my niggas
No love from no hoes, came up in a hole
Tryna climb out the Devil's dark lab, but the oven is closed
I don't ever leave the house much
I never really thought this would be the outcome
Wish I had a window I was leapin' out from
My family is yellin', ""Please, Jesus, help him!""
When I'm out in the real world, I feel like nobody knows me
What if this whole time I've had an issue and nobody told me?
See, this cold heart isn't cozy
Am I below par and I don't see?
I'm so disconnected from Earth
My hands are out so far but they won't reach
Should I get in a coffin?
Not many niggas would wanna kick it with me
Unless they would gonna benefit off it
Motherfuckers never interested in knowin' me
They just be just itchin' for Hopsin
I'd be frontin' if I act like it isn't a problem
I done shed tears contemplatin' my suicide in my room
Isn't it awesome? (Fuck no!)

That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
When they see me everybody brrap's, brraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to earth
I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malory Blackman
Where the hells all the sanity at, damn

When we ate we never took because we needed a change
I needed a break
For a sec' I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say the money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam'
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to turn a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no-one cares about

Eric Williams,"I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

You tried everything, but you don't give up

Will you come with me and walk awhile

Eric Woolfson,"When I was born 
No silver spoon in my hand 
No trumpet blew 
No bells rang out in the land 
Nobody said life would be easy 
Nobody promised me an island in the sun 
For all my life 
I've walked as tall as I can 
Among the crowd 
A small invisible man 
I wasn't born to be a hero 
I have to make the dream become reality 
I know that somewhere there must be 
A golden key 

And/Give me a reason to believe 
There is freedom in the air 
And it's easier to be/breathe 
A golden key 
That will open any door 
And the truth that lies within 
Is no secret anymore 
I fill my shoes 
And walk wherever they go 
A man of straw 
For every wind that may blow 
I have to take control of my life 
I want the world to see 
A different side of me 
Unlock these chains and set me free 
A golden key 

To a castle in the air 
And a heaven here on earth 
Will be waiting for me there 
A golden key 
To the place I want to be 
On an island in the sun 
And the hero would be me 
Don't want to live my life in silence 
One taste of paradise 
Is all there has to be 
Is all there has to be 
Set me free 
A golden key 

To a castle in the air 
And a heaven here on earth 
Will be waiting for me there 
A golden key 
To the place I want to be 
On an island in the sun 
And the hero would be me 
A golden key 
That would open any door 
And the gold that lies behind 
Will be mine forevermore

And my life would be complete 
With a crown upon my head 
And the whole world at my feet

Eric Woolfson,"I was adrift on an ocean of dreams
I was amazed
And as I sail to the end of the world
I'm not afraid
Mournful moon and willow tree
Tell the world not to weep for me
And I will be set free
I took a drink from a bottle of wine
And I was changed
Made a deal with the devil inside
And I was shamed
I have sailed on stormy seas
Where the four winds blow me

Shining moon and willow tree
Tell the world--remember me
For I will be set free
All that we see
All that we seem
Is but a shadow of a shadow
Of a dream within a dream;
But if a tree is evergreen,
Then maybe part of us
Could be eternal
Though tangled life
May be no more

A drop rain upon the ocean
Grain of sand upon the shore
The words will live forevermore
If you can hear me now
Am I immortal?
Magic mood and willow tree
If they ask about me
Tell the truth, and they might learn;
Light a candle and watch it burn
Then I will be set free
Free as a bird
Upon the wind

Now all the trials and tribulations
Of the world don't mean a thing
Above the clouds
I'll fly away
Was it my imagination
Did the stars come out to play?
Beyond the sun
Eternal flame
I hear a chorus of a million voices
Calling out my name

But all I see and all I seem
Is but a shadow of a shadow
Of a dream within a dream
Free as the wind
Lighter than ai
Free from the jealous minds
The scornful, bitter words
Won't hurt me there
And I will live forevermore
If you remember me

And stumble along the way
The comedy will play and then it's gone
For everyday's a show that must go on
But if God is in His heaven
Can He hear me when I pray?
I begged of Him and pleaded
Not to let it end this way
But from somewhere in the audience
He turned his back and looked the other way

Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

People get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board them
There's hope for all among those loved the most

You know there ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
For there's no hiding place against the kingdom's throne

People get ready, there's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage, no, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesel's humming
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

Oh, oh, get ready, oh
Oh, you gotta board it
Oh, get ready
People get ready, oh

Mountains and valleys, that look like you carved them by hand

As they dance across the heaven, as only they can
A warm summer rain, as it falls from the sky
And a sweet, sweet little birdy, is just learning how to fly

You amaze me daily
I see your personal touch, on the things you love so much
So let me be the first to say
In case you never heard

Everyday that I see
Each line, each wrinkle
That’s unique to just me
Ten fingers, ten toes, two eyes, lips, and a nose
A masterpiece created, by the hands of the greatest

Erica Miller,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son
Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son",Georgia on My Mind,2010
Erica Mou,"Che invidia,
Quella tua casa senza bilancia
E la tua stanza senza uno specchio
E la tua mente senza mai colpa

Che invidia
Quelle tue mani senza vergogna
E la filosofia del viene come viene
Come viene, ti va bene sempre

Ho scelto te
Perché mi hai scelto
E la tua scelta mi sembrava coraggio
Ho scelto te
Perché mi hai scelto
E la tua scelta mi sembrava coraggio

Che invidia
Per tutto quello che hai, è così poco
Rispetto a quello che io cercavo
Per essere felice

E mai
Avrei pensato fosse così
Semplice mai
Avrei pensato fosse così

Ho scelto te
Perché mi hai scelto
E la tua scelta mi sembrava coraggio
Ho scelto te
Perché mi hai scelto
E la tua scelta mi sembrava
Ho scelto te
Perché mi hai scelto
E la tua scelta mi sembrava coraggio
Ho scelto te
Perchè mi hai scelto
E la tua scelta mi sembrava coraggio",Ho scelto te,2015
Erica Rivera,"Daddy you don't know the half of it
See I've started something, now I have to finish it
The curtain blows outside my bedroom window
This is my life and I've gotta go

I check to see if there is a ladder
In my stocking tight
Don't forget to leave the lights on

I'll be home before you know
Don't be mad if you hear me on the radio
I feel good and I feel free
On the microphone

Somebody stop me
Keep my body rocking til' late night
I'm warning you, don't try to block me
You can't stop me on my time, on my time

Come my girlie's asking for the score
(What?)
They scream out, ""Better meet 'em at the back door""

Sky rockin' to where the speakers blow
Bass heavy, rock steady, grab the microphone
Now check, the clock is reading 10 p.m.
I bet my daddy's dreaming, he sleeping, talking so loud again

I'll be home before you know
Don't be mad if you hear me on the radio
I feel good and I feel free
On the microphone

Somebody stop me
Keep my body rocking til' late night
I'm warning you, don't try to block me
You can't stop me on my time

Somebody stop me
Keep my body rocking til' late night
I'm warning you, don't try to block me
You can't stop me on my time

I leave the light on
And will make it, so daddy
Gotta get my grove on
I'll be jumping 'round, yeah, yeah

I leave the light on
And will make it, so daddy
Gotta get my grove on
I'll be jumping 'round, yeah, yeah

Somebody stop me
Keep my body rocking til' late night
I'm warning you, don't try to block me
You can't stop me on my time

Somebody stop me
Keep my body rocking til' late night
I'm warning you, don't try to block me
You can't stop me on my time

Erich Bergen,"I cried for you
Now cry for me
No, no, I don't love you anymore
Cry for me

Well, you had your fun
(Don't go, baby)
With someone new
(Don't go, baby)

Now you want me to take you back
(Don't go, baby)
We're all through

'Cause now I'm leaving
No, no, make believin'
You made a fool of me
So now I'm leaving you

Loved you so
(Don't go, baby)
Much more than you'll ever know
(Don't go, baby)

But you just cheated and you lied
(Don't go, baby)
Go and cry for me

Well you, knew it from the start
Someday you'd break my heart

So cry, cry for me

Erich Kunzel,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1988
Erich Kunzel,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You,1988
Erich Kunzel,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1988
