Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the streets,
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs

A summer disregard,a broken bottle top
And a one man soul
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
(If you want to make the world a better place)
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
(Take a look at yourself, and then make a change)
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
(Starting with me!)

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(Ooh!)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Ooh!)

I'm asking him to change his ways

No message could have been any clearer

Even though certain s*** I probably would never understand

Cut a few n****s off that were bringing me down

Why you never really see a n**** trip out, pray this s*** gon' really out, blessed to be here
I'm just a n**** from the slum, now I'm rich with a get money gut like a n**** drink beer
Made it out the hole, almost ended off the road
Now I'm on and out the road state to state doing shows
Came a long way from kicking doors, stealing n**** bowls
Or sleeping on the floor
And walkin' to the store
Now I might pull up in a roll when you walkin on more
Whoever knew that the streets did take me this far
Used to rock G shocks now I might rock the rollie or flaunt that Audemar
Bosses be the magic used to make Paris
Now I got Houston just to order seafood salad
Thank god for the times that a n**** did struggle

The prison band was there and they began to wail.
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing.

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock.
Everybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock.

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone,
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone.
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang,
the whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.

Number forty-seven said to number three
""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
I sure would be delighted with your company,
come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me.""

The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
way over in the corner weepin' all alone.

If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair.""

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Pleading - one word

And 'neath her window have I stayed

Listen to the warning
The Seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

Spreading his hands on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old men's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

Oh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove

Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late, too late, all the wretches run

From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain

And death all around will be your dow'ry

My magic carpet ride 
And I can play hide and seek with my fears

To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation

We should be wasting
When the darkness falls
It's too late to fix the crime
It's peace that we need

Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get

It's a song of truth we're bringing

For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us
Look for the day

Take heart my friend we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million light's above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live I could not live this way

Doing the type of things I love so much
But so what, I'm sleazy it's not easy being Joe Smut
With more bucks than you can count, more than what's in your clutch

When people see me, they point and whisper ""He's corrupt""

And as a kid he never took crap from no one

Queen,"It's the sad eyed goodbye
Yesterday's moments I remember
It's the bleak street, week kneed partings I recall
It's the mistier mists the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all

It's the fantastic drowse
Of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings
To waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told
For the everyday hero it all turns to zero
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying when you're young
And your troubles are all very small

Out here on the street we'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet
Half on the time we'd broaden our minds
More in the pool hall
Than we did in the school hall
With the down town chewing gum bums
Watching the night life the lights and the fun

Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain't easy for a small town boy
It ain't easy at all
Thinkin' it right and doin' it wrong
It's easier from an arm chair
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess

I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Jimi Hendrix he was good

Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

Only if you say you'll come
All to myself
Is how I want to have you
Can't see me with nobody else
And I don't know what to do

I see you pass my way each and every day
Could you stop just once is all I'm asking
Cause I can't seem to help myself
There's something about the way you walk
Oh I wish that we could talk 
Sit and cuddle in the park
Gazing in each other's eyes
All night

I want to take you far away, far away, far away
Only if you say you'll come
All to myself
Is how I want to have you
Can't see me with nobody else
And I don't know what to do

All my friends are angry 
They think I'm crazy
Cause I don't let you know
About this feeling that I have for you
Something tells me that you feel the same way too
It's only a matter of time, oooh

I want to take you far away, far away, far away
Only if you say you'll come
All to myself
Is how I want to have you
Can't see me with nobody else
And I don't know what to do

It's been a while now since I wanted to tell you but I found it hard mi couldn't find the courage and when I say you with another clinging on your arm I knew I had to get you so I couldn't keep my calm
I want you to keep me warm
Rubbing on each other
All night, all night

I want to take you far away, far away, far away
Only if you say you'll come
All to myself
Is how I want to have you
Can't see me with nobody else
And I don't know what to do

I see you pass my way each and every day
Could you stop just once is all I'm asking
Cause I can't seem to help myself
There's something about the way you walk
Oh I wish that we could talk 
Even sit it and cuddle in the park
Gazing in each other's eyes
Oh night

I ain't playing, you know what I'm saying?
This ain't the best you've ever hear coming from a female MC
But you know what I mean? (Hail to the Queen!)
This MC stands for ""Microphone Commando""
When I command that you take a hand
And throw it up in the air, yeah, just like that now
Chill, and watch me rap cause I'm flowing (Flowing)
Just like water I slaughter (Slaughter)
A battle, put me in it, I win it
The mission is music and rhythm
Rhythm backed by words, all in my system
System by techniques, techniques I got my heart in
Heart into the music, music I take part in
One try, one God, and one destiny
Just dance for me

	""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 2x)

Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to
My brother Lance said ""Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet""
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat
Ample samples, this for example
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel
Your plans of moving to the front lines
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine
I hop, dip, and spend with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me bring while I bring
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me

	""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 2x)

My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say ""ho""
With powerful lyrics I'm armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to
This here is a moment of truth
So take the record to the DJ booth
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some
People dancing, I can spot 'em
When I take control, you know I got 'em
Stop the music?  That's not a question
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be
I order you to dance for me

Queen Latifah,"You asked  I came  so behold the Queen 
Let's add a little sense to the scene 
I'm living positive not out here knocked up 
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up 

This rhyme doesn't require prime time 
I'm just sharing thoughts of mine 
Back again cause I knew you wanted it 
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it 

Dropping bombs you're up in arms, you're puzzled 
The lines will flow like fluid while you guzzle 
The sip I drop you on a BDP-produced track 
From KRS to be exact 

It's a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking 
Cause it's knowledge I'm seeking 
Enough about myself, I think it's time that I tell you 
About the evil that men do 

Situations, reality, what a concept! 
Nothing ever seems to stay in step 
So today, here is a message to my sisters and brothers 
Here are some things I want to cover 

A woman strives for a better life, but who the hell cares? 
Because she's living on welfare 
The government can't come up with a decent housing plan 
So she's in no man's land 
It's a sucker who tells you you're equal 

KRS-One: You don't need him, Johannasburg's crying for freedom! 

Queen Latifah: We the people hold these truths to be self-evident 

[KRS-One] 
But there's no response from the president 

Queen Latifah: 
Someone's living the good life, tax-free 
Except for a girl, can't find a way to be crack free 
And that's just part of the message 
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do 

Tell me, don't you think it's a shame? 
When someone can put a quarter in a video game 
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street 
You can't treat him the same 

It's time to teach the def, the dumb, the blind 
That black-on-black crime only shackles and binds 
You to a doom, a fate worse than death 
But there's still time left 

Stop putting your conscience on cease 
And bring about some type of peace 
Not only in your heart, but also in your mind 
It will benefit all mankind 
Then there will be one thing that will never stop 
And it's the evil that men do",Evil That Men Do,1989
Queen Latifah,"Let's start the show off sisters ago look alive 
The Queen Latifah the King of 45 
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor 
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a 
A sample sound the she added a compound 
Word this is for those who haven't heard 
A King and Queen combine minds and trample 
Those who oppose us here's an example 

It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set 
The competition is petty and ready to step 
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one 
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one 
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken 
Queen Latifah's outspoken 
Use your imagination, picture this 
Any male or female rapper trying to diss 
Here for excitement and enticement 
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment 
Teach the youth, feed the needy 
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti 
The mother of civilization will rise 
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation 
Secondary but necessary to reproduce 
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack 
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind 
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher 
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys 
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy 
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King 
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring 
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation 

Technician, musical musician 
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction 
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most 
Creativity, you get a double dose 
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test 
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet) 
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one 
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one 
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum 
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em 
I rock, never hyperventilate 
Others get tired, could use a commercial break 
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias 
It takes a ton of M-C's to prevail against me 
Just listen, I'm unstoppable 
You want a mission? This one's impossible 
Beats rock all night with no curfew 
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue 
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it 
If the style fits, I wear it 
Many attempts were made, none was recognized 
45 King said sample soundified 
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next 
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet 
Studio mixer, I got the formula 
And said the man from self, I'm warning you 
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur 
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa 
On top, it's a usual act 
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios 
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing 
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing",A King and Queen Creation,1989
Queen Latifah,"Alright listen, I'm back again cause that's what you required of
Me steady rhyming, and I'm so sick and tired of
Being forced to put suckers in their place
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face
But I'm not trying, so never sound like I don't bone to pick with you
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two
I speak the poetry, dissing those who keep on quoting me
Try to play me, cease it, you don't know me
So smile in my face, behind my back take a line or two
I'm not an idiot, so who you think you lying to?
Queen Latifah's here to lay the law down
So speed it up or shake it around because it's a showdown
The 45 King is arising, surprising, hypnotising star, he's up to par
So I hope you've prepared yourself for what you're in for
This is Latifah's Law

BMW's and gold rope chains don't impress me
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me
Get skeezed, you nose will bleed, that's how they live life
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life
Fire and desire make you go a little higher
When I grab the wire of the mic
And get hype, I'm sorry you sound dot
Cause I roll like the homicide squad
You must be broke and, hoping that I'm soft but I'm dope and
Left you in the litter to consider coping with
Life, it's trife yeah, but these things happen
You need to make it better, stop trying to be the mack again
Get a grip on the African way
Cause there's a sucker born every day
Crime's the way for you to see what the Queen saw
And this is Latifah's law

Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to
The Flavor Unit keeps all, and keeps a way to band
And slides keep the hardcore fall, cause I'm heavy-handed
Whip out a .45 caliber pen and begin
A funky message from beginning to end
Peace be to Africa, can't forget my other land
Won't fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland
You say you're living right, but we know it's nonsense
In case you forgot, just check your conscience
At showtime, I blow lines, you don't get yours, I get mine
Your showtimes, you behind, the Queen Latifah divine
Rule number one: don't step across the line that I drew
Number two: don't take credit for something that you didn't do
Number three: check your heart, every man has a call
It's time for me to go, but I'll be back, y'all",Latifah's Law,1989
Queen Latifah,"Basslines affect me when my rhymes direct me
Forgive the crowds, O Lord, they know not why they sweat me
Biting's against the law in the place that I live
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib
The call me the high priestess of this hasta
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta
There's never been a word I can't master
I've always been, a piddly pastor
I reign, the lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light

	The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
	She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun
	The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
	She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world

You try to dissect my rhymes to see if there's a pattern
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn
Let me know now if you'd like to protest
And proceeding a greeting, or would you rather progress
Onto a higher plateau, to the peak and I'm taking it slow
Enough for you to see the knowledge and to know 
I'm the Q-you-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H
Queen of the R.E. Posse the GLA which is
Get Live Alright, you standing there chewing on your fingernails
Nervous, watching me doing the live thing
Singing like a bird sing, ringing like the phone ring
I'm the Queen and you're the underling
I'm never following, I follow none
The princess of the posse is a cool one

	The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
	She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun
	The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl
	She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world

I'm the queen of the clan, with a mic in my hand
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land
It's a concoction, for my ability
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility
Cause they don't know I'm the one to fly one or two
I'm snatching hearts cause I'm Latifah and I want to
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip
I'm kicking gold so grab a hold and get a good grip
Stop the lying, the trying
The time buying, you've been denying
You're dependent on me, the princess of the posse
I got the cards, so I'm dealing a death blow
You're taking no crowns, put that on cease
My DJ's name is Mark the 45 King to the posse
Peace, got to let you know where I come from
The princess of the posse is a cool one

	The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one
	She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun
	The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl

Queen Latifah,"Bass lines affect me when my rhymes direct me 
Forgive the crowds  O Lord  they know not why they sweat me 
Biting's against the law in the place that I live 
So I lock up the door with the keys to my crib 
The call me the high priestess of this hasta 
Although I'm not a dread and not a rasta 
There's never been a word I can't master 
I've always been  a piddly pastor 
I reign  the lesson of today 
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say 
Because the Ruler Lord Ramsey is on my side 
And I'm the princess of the posse, so yo, take it light 

The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one 
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun 
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl 
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world 

You try to dissect my rhymes to see if there's a pattern 
I bounced it all around you like the rings around Saturn 
Let me know now if you'd like to protest 
And proceeding a greeting, or would you rather progress 
Onto a higher plateau, to the peak and I'm taking it slow 
Enough for you to see the knowledge and to know 
I'm the Q-U-E-E-N, L-A-T-I-F-A-H 
Queen of the Army Posse, the D.L.A which is 
Get live alright, you standing there chewing on your fingernails 
Nervous, watching me doing the live thing 
Singing like a bird sing, ringing like the phone ring 
I'm the Queen and you're the underling 
I'm never following, I follow nothing

The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool one 
She rhyme on my record and she ram jam me gun 
The Princess of the Posse, me say she a cool girl 
She rhyme Brooklyn, the Bronx, USA, the world 

I'm the queen of the clan, with a mic in my hand 
I step over suckers to position myself to rule this land 
It's a concoction, for my ability 
To show the skeezers the meaning of humility 
Cause they don't know I'm the one to fly one or two 
I'm snatching hearts cause I'm Latifah and I want to 
I find it necessary to tell you to get off my tip 
I'm kicking gold, so grab a hoe and get a good grip 
Stop the lying, the trying 
The time buying, you've been denying 
You're dependent on me, the princess of the posse 
I got the cards, so I'm dealing a death blow 
You're taking no crowns, put that on cease 
My DJ's name is Mark the 45 King to the posse 
Peace, got to let you know where I come from

Queen Latifah,"Let me remind you on how to unwind your body
So dance and shake and just keep in step
Understand, draw a clear picture
What I'm gonna hit you with is truly def
These are the words of a Queen of a Queendom
All competitors, I simply cream them
One by one, I dust a rush them all
If you have any more, bring them
To the front so they can sho me what they got
What they got, it better be hot
Cause if it's not, I'll simply knock them out the box
And they'll be put in a spot
The style I use will surely amuse
The party people to a state of gladness
What I mean is I'm on the scene
I'm the Queen of Royal Badness

Well it's the Lah, T-I-F-A-H
While I say my rhyme, Mark creates
The direct hi-tech sound of the dope noise
The bass will pound, I hope girls, I hope boys
Understand what I'm quoting, I'm not joking
Or freaking, this is a Queen speaking
Wis words, when I'm done I leave your eyes blurred
When you address me, address me as ""Your Highness""
One of hip-hop's finest
You see, I can flow on tempo, off tempo
It makes me no difference
So play that beat, play it, kick it, watch me
Flip it, with dope lyrics, you want to hear it?
Observe my ways and actions, I grab the mic
And draw attractions
To the table, I'm a hit you at all angles
Those who think I caught a fit, I strangled them
The result with a pen and a pad
Gets mean, see I'm the Queen of Royal Badness

I can't wait until the party is jam-packed
When I start to drop it, the people say ""Damn, black""
The queen is hyped up, awesome and deadly
If you don't dance, grab a chair and plex, be	
Composure's kept, blows are thrown in death, hard as hell
Guard as well as you can or step
Off the premisis, in one minute it's
Going to explode in a style that's limitless
Make your first move, don't let it be your worst move
Cause if you do, you'll be a hurt fool
Keep your mouth shut to those that shout and cuss
It's no doubt that I got clout and I'll bust
Literature that flows like liquid
Some can't comprehend the way I kicked it
So don't say nothing
Just listen up, follow instructions
Rhyme, shake, slide, and dance like Lat said
When I'm on stage I sold rage and drop heads
Ambidextrous, skilled with both hands
Teaching a lesson, ready to throw jams
Latifah loves to rip up the scenery
It's nothing special, just a Queen to me
So do the knowledge, see if you can catch this
You know what I mean, it's the Queen of Royal Badness",Queen of Royal Badness,1989
Queen Latifah,"I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn 
The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in 
A female walked up to me and said, ""Latifah bust a line"" 
I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time 

I said, ""If you really want to do this we can do this fine' 
Take six paces and begin to rhyme"" 
As soon as attempted to make a sound 
I ate her up with the verb  broke her down with the noun 

'Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me 
I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow 
I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings 
 
Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing 
Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them 
Rhyme thieves, biters, and bums 
Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight 
I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?) Yeah, right!
 
Bash! went the first, Smash! went the next one (What about the third?)
He started, he started to run 
But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped 
Cause I snapped that neck before the second step 

You see you may speculate, but everybody knows 
Not one amateur can deal with the pros 

These are the pros, coming now from Queen Latifah and Daddy-O 
And if you want to hear more then just follow 
If you like the smooth chanted lyrics then just say ""Bo bo bo!"" 

There was a time that a man could go 
Anyplace, anywhere without a Rambo 
But now me have to keep me pistol loaded with rhyme 
Have to deal with bad breath biters that step out of line 

So when they make a move them surely get a taste of it 
I'm Daddy-O and I don't quit 
So feel the flow, y'all because you're under attack 
From my rhymes, 'cause I'm writing swift rhymes in stacks 

And four words to the wack, just, ""Stay the hell back"" 
Cause it's a fact, if you're wack you ain't saying jack 
So we can go rhyme for rhyme if you wish 
But eating you suckers is my favorite dish 
And I warned you suckers if you messed with me 
You'll be the next ingredient in my recipe 

Start and don't finish, I'll hunt you down 
And you can't run forever, so you'll be found 
And with nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide 
How you want to be eaten, boy, baked or fried? 

[Chorus: x 2] 
 
It's Latifah the Queen, pioneer of the mainstream 
I flow just like a pro cause it's the same thing 
Suckers have to realize how foolish they sound 
So button your lips and stop trying to be down 

I caught you out there (How many times?) 
A lot of times 
Cause when it comes to mine, you know I gotta rhyme 
Stepping to the right, to the left 
To the best place, well I have to face 

A sucker like a pooh-butt, weak and soft 
Riding my bra strap trying to get off 
Understand and know, if you want to go 
You'd better be ready to flow 'cause I'm a pro 

[Chorus: x 2]

We wax floors with bums, make mocks out of some 
Sting 'em hard, and watch them complain how it stung 
Kidnap the babysitter, lock 'em inside a box 
Daddy-O and the true blue Queen of Rock 

[Chorus: x 4]",The Pros,1989
Queen Latifah,"The ladies will kick it  the rhyme that is wicked 
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted 
A woman can bear you  break you  take you 
Now it's time to rhyme  can you relate to 
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream 

Ayo  let me take it from here  Queen
Excuse me but I think I'm about do 
To get into precisely what I am about to do 
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue 
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you 
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed 
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed 
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes 
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes) 

(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here) 

Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see 
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me 
Not for being one but for being with one 
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some 
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on 
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting 
We are the ones that give birth 
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First 

I break into a lyrical freestyle 
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles 
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two 
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do 
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow) 
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go) 
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse 
(With what?) With a little touch of ""Ladies First"" 

Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind 
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme 
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse 
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe 
A female rapper with the message to send the 
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen 

My sister, can I get some? 

Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb 

Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am 
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American 
You dig exactly where I'm coming from 
You want righteous rhyming, Imma give you some 
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid 
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay 
Pay me every bit of your attention 
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention 
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm 
Of which is now systematically given 
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister 
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another 
Plus one more, all four 
Have a job to do, we doing it 
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it 
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E 
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E 

Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder 
Cooling on the scene with my European partner 
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax 
When I get there, that's when I tax 
The next man, or the next woman 
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming 
And I'll recite the chapter in verse 
The title of this recital is ""Ladies First""",Ladies First,1990

Queen Latifah,"My mellow Latee was kicking flavor
The R.E. posse said ""Yo Latifah we can do this""
So I paused in the thought and in my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex, cause I'm in full effect
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave to me
I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness

(Latifah: rasta chorus)
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way

Some MC's have gold and African vein
And using each other to compete with
Their subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not my fault your thoughts are shrinking
while mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness, call me ""Your highness""
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

(Latifah: rasta chorus)
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way

Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace
The crowds, they love me, they give only hugs
The shrinked-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug
As a bug, you know why?  Because I'm bugging
Of the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness

(More rasta singing)

I scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one
Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they want to be down with the 
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time, just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness

Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better 
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones 
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get 
I want a friend not just a lover 
Someone who is dedicated only to me 
Not to me and two or three others 
One who will not lie to me or think 
He can get my love by buying me 
I know I'll find him some day

He sure won't say

And if talk got any cheaper (huh)
They'll be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah
Blazay blah

This is a scene from the Queen La La
Lovely and lyrically loose
But lady like
I'm too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got
When I'm in town I give the boosters booster shots

Royal and loyal
Face the fire
Boy
You wouldn't get the time of the day
So make way
Hey
Silence I say
Lay low and have a cold one
Cause the whipping I'm dishing is an old one
I through some soul into my morning bowl
Then I rolled
I took your gold and stopped your singled
Cause it ever never sold
Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
So you could never give me body or come in my house
The Flavor Unit is doing back again this year
How many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear
Feel the force of my holocaust

I'm sure to match ya
Snatch ya

Your broken looks more like a fracture

Queen Latifah,"Get funky with it
I told you before: you burn when you play with fire
So take off your hats, matter of fact hail the new Sire
You're hungry as hell, so i'm cookin up the chowder
It's laced with ingredients, gon' come on like gunpowder
Pom-pom! lick a shot, then I got to order
I'm runnin for the border for causin disorder
Pom-pom! lick a shot, got on my defenses
I'm runnin for the fences, of course I'm relentless
The particular name of this queen is Latifah
I've often been classified as a feminine teacher
Collectively capture the heart of a nation
Love my culture and show appreciation
You're lookin for the black influ'?
I do want too give it to you
What are you mad?
Give me some of what you had!
You can huff-huff, puff-puff and bluff-bluff
But I got nuff of the ruff stuff

(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)

Now nuff of the ruff stuff, that's what I do, and I do it well
The proof is in the puddin, I show and prove, not show and tell
Talk tales, you get caught up in a crossfire
Buckshot must be what you want and desire
I write concepts, I don't be frontin or be buggin
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin
It's a love thang, the Queen doin her thang
If I was a liquid, you would drink me like Tanq'
You think I'm kickin things that I myself don't even heed?
I rap not for the love of music, but for greed?
""Latifah's booty, yo, she could never succeed""
Shiiit...
You watch me do it and boom it, the Flavor Unit will snap necks
You a-fi listen a likkle, you fi go buy the cassette
You're starvin, cause you ain't had enough
That's right, nuff of the ruff stuff

(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)

You talk about flavor...
I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet
Get old ladies jumpin out of their seats
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun 'n rays
I got flavor for days
Now I'm the type that the fellas call a honey, and
From me you know you get a worth for your money, and
This is no meaningless attack, I gave you a chance
Matter of fact, yo, I ordered them to 'dance
For me', they tried to turn me 'inside out'
They felt the 'wrath of my madness', I let them 'come into my house'
It's called 'latifah's law', for the criminal to curse
And all the gentlemen know its rule: 'ladies first'
Not the typical female that tends to
Fall vitim to the 'evil that men do'
Small puff, I call your bluff
I'm not mad, I just had enuff of the ruff stuff

(Ruff and tuff)
(And all that stuff)

Everybody know Latifah love positivity
Now positivity erase negativity

Through it ever time  comin at a dance 
My man Treacherous MC  go on  let the saxophone man play a little 
Make it lovely 

[Treach]
You got beef  well what we do  talk to the bunny  sunny 
He's the man  Bugs the thug wit the money 
Funny that you should mention as my family  they covered 
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers 
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together 
No matter what your whatever, endeavor, find us better 
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others 
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble 
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it 
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it 
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rolling spreads 
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya head 
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago 
With a new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know 
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done 
Queen Latifah the sire, give em some, come 

[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's time for rum, man, yeah man 
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's for jamming, g'yeah know? 
Every time they come, you know they come without the flow 
Soon we have a single, they're the quickest out the door 
The wickedest man, the wickedest man in dance hall, well ya know 
I'm out for rum, come!

118th Street keeps production, conjunction junction nothin 
Huh, what's your function? 
I don't mean to be blunt or front, true or rude 
How can he diss? Your honey dip looks like a honey dude 
So keep it to yourself, greedy when you're in good health 
So before you come and try the Treach, try yourself 
'cause I ain't having it, remember act like you know 
And if ya can't act jack, you best find the door 
I hate to think a trade, I slot another, see ya gator 
A stam yada, peace!, sasalama, lick em later 
Yeah, you don't have a chance, but I see ya next 
This track is KayGee's baby and he named it ""Def"" 
I'm smoking in em, it's like chimneys, I ain't friendly 
Fuck your fendy, I'm swinging for your diet kidney 
Pimples are simple to pop, I want temple's op 
Then slop your rock wit more flopping than a waffle spot 
The wickedest man alive, I am what I am and I'm 
Damn good to be a no good, hooded by 
The wiggle in the middle, simple to party thumps 
They call me the wickedest man alive, make em jump

Getting it and hitting wit it a old fashion weapon when you're slipping, I got time 
Try to stand and get rammed like a Stop sign 
The bad just got worse within one verse 
Put the shitty verse and reverse and this fella's first 
Wrecking is second, so back with ya wacked disc 
For candle after candle and still couldn't wax this 
I be the wickedest while you're still the wackest 
I need wallpaper to list what your track miss 
This is a double decker from the head wrecker, neck and head checker 
Check the check and who's def? Who's left ya? 
Standing back canning ya, plan ta stay back 
I'm down wit Kay's tracks, black, this is the payback, lay back, jack 
I have you every which way but loose, blowing your sound proof 
That's happening to me, your thanks for giving a neck noose 
This comes naturally, all day and night 
I make a party of all lefty's leave screaming out ""Alright!"" 
Talking bout needing a lot more work than you had 
Twelve years, twelve hundred, twelve inches and sold one 
Who's getting done? Who's swifter? Who's badder? 
You be able to get down wit some help in a step ladder 
This is another song, we check out the style that I've 
Picked and rip, I be the wickedest man alive

So I pull the tech close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they step

You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And we gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me, you can

My girlies caught me on a good day
I was (something) to move a job
So we took it to a club
Nigga we would make out a little
And plus at the time I was single, a little
So I said ""Fine, we could meet up about nine""

So anyway we crossing the place where bub is flowing
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we knowin'
Some people in the joint is yellin' ""Hurt me, Hurt me""
I'm working my way over to the bar cause I'm thirsty
And then I see this guy
Oh no, I think he likes me
I smile cause he's fly
He smiles back, I think he likes me

Well then it takes a twist
He sends his homeboy to talk to me cause he's scared to get dissed
I don't walk baby
I don't bite neither
You coulda asked me yourself for my number to my beeper
The worst thing I'da said was ""No""
So maybe next time you better push a (something)

Saturday moving in the house
Lookin' at the videos
At the same time I'ma tryna put on my clothes
First date (First Date) with the guy's name was Nate
Was he fly?
Yes he was
Word up, the type you have on a plate
Cause I only met him last night
So I don't really know him, but I hope it goes right
So he pulls up at my door in a twenty-four foot limo
What is on his (something), are we expecting more?
He showered me with gifts and then he kissed me on my hand
Now what was in your plan?
I really didn't understand
We're only going to the movies
Either you're trying to impress me or watch you're trying to get the poony

Listen baby, I don't want a condo
You can make me smile a little and give me convo
All I might require from my man is intelligence
And all them other material things is irrelevant

[Chorus x2]

Now if you ready to deal with a girl who consider herself a queen
And you know how to treat a queen
Then step to the scene
We can sit alone in a room and deal
We can take a ride listening to music and chill
And I can do the crazy things I never thought I'd do
And maybe I can do all of those crazy things with you
Cause you ain't gotta be no superstar honey
All I wanna find out is exactly who you are
Money ain't gone make me love ya
And even with your car
So cease with that attitude
With that attitude you won't be getting far

And I love all of my brothers with a passion
Can't a sister get the same type of reaction

Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said (Yeah me bitch) and laughed
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work, give you an attitude then you were rough
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All I knew was you, you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see (Who you calling a bitch?)

But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head and you call yourself

I saw you wilding, acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type

Have you been misled
Anything I said
Didn't mean to turn you on
The bite is oh so strong
You got things to do
But I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays to Fridays I don't see you then

Seems it's been so long
Since you thrilled me with your charms
I tenderly imagine me
Resting in your arms
You've got things to do
And I have got things too
So I'll catch you on the weekend
Mondays to Fridays, I don't see you then

	[Unknown Reggae Artist]
Because we're sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that ?
Once in a week
Sorry when we part
And we love when we meet
I know we only do that ?

We all occupied
From our own love life
This has been denied
Many feelins high
Many tears of pride
But by the weekend
Let my spirit divide

To nourish and cherish every moment
To deliver the goods I am ???
And I know you're possessed with the ingredients
Till the weekend the days seems to be long
But by the weekend I wish I could reverse its time
Good things can come in a small bag
So let's make use of the time that we have
When we are together 'cause we stay popular
???????????
When we are together you and I wonder
If this love is gonna last forever
Well then I think and I start remember
That we are a ? star

Queen Latifah,"(talk) This jam is dedicated to my brother Winki who is looking down on me from 
Heaven Watching my every move as usual....

(chorus)
There but for the grace of god do I go do I go
There but for the grace of God do I go do I go-go
I'm trying to take my time on this rhyme

But it's bustin from the seems 
Like a fantasy and eagerness of dreams
I'm moving all around
Oh yes,I'm making leaps an bounds
There's so much shit to say, no time to write it down
I'm skippin' to this and skippin' to that
I've overflowed my cup.
I'm flowin' kind of quick I hope you can keep up
Every ain't cool just cause you slap me on my hand
There're things about all of ya'll have got to understand
Latifah- never was a teacher
Never was a preacher
Never was a saint
Never was conceited 
Never was defeated
Sometimes I get tired sometimes I want to faint.
But I never shut up when things piss me off 
And if I got to curse at you to get my point across 
That's what I got to do that's how it's got to be
I've got an angel watching over me

(chorus) 2 times
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
Yes he did, yes he did
The Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world
You don't hear me
Lord is the light of my life and he brightens up my world, world,world,world
The light of my world, my world- AHHHHH yes he did...............",Winki's Theme,1993
Queen Latifah,"featuring De La Soul 
Possy Dovey! (Yes mama?) Time to get up! 

Hello  I'm Queen Latifah  how ya doing? 
I hope that you're with this  I hope that you're willing 
I want to introduce you to a cut called 
""Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children"" 

Well here comes the goy 
The truth to the goy 
You know the one  that ate up like boy 
Stepping with a step, keeping with a kept 
Making an appearance with a notty-head set 
Lunatics you lose cause the Plug 2's singing 
Peace to the negative, nah, you make the weigh-in 
Weigh-in, weigh-in, way out of order 
If you know you're better, you'd better that you caught a 
Waving mine a peace sign higher than a kite 
If you're feeling sick, it's alright it's fever night 
Don't do ""Do see do"" and dig in no potholes 
Cause if you do we calling in March Patrol 
It's no different from the verbal last heard 
Cayumbo is the ruler that's bond to the word 
He's moving more than three feet, jocking with the knee deep 
Dove is going to leave you with a tweet tweet tweet 

Next on the menu, we continue with the pasta 
Dipped in chocolate, served with lots a 
Twizzlers and honey, yum yum yummy 
Lyrics I'm flaunting is good for the tummy 
Tiptoeing in I proceed to the floors 
Selling much records like a pimp mover 
Excuse me mommy, Pos wins 
Cause I'm the A to the Plug W-O-N 
Brother freak it live for this tribe 
Now let's ride down the highway of vibes 
Pushing that we start cause the soul says please 
Cutting back with the raps and we don't get cheese 
Ducks and we sit need to get 
Cause preacher is the key to the casualty 
Polaroid flicks are back and you know 
That the soul is moving on up like the Jeffersons 

[Repeat: x16]
Go mommy! 

I'm back, a black queen upon the scene 
With a knack for funky tracks, know what I mean? 
Prince Paul produces this and it's a fly one 
It has a beat that weigh, he's one of my sons 
It's a family affair and then we're out of here 
There is no doubt here, cause this is our year 
So flex to a Queen Latifah/De La Soul sound 
(Go ahead mama get down) 
It's inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible 
We never put ourselves on any pedestal 
But the rhyme is so good it's practically edible (Say what?) 
So check the sounds of Mama Zulu 
As I relay the story untold 
And if you're wondering why I got kids so big 
They weren't born from the body, they were born from the soul",Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children,1994
Queen Latifah,"[Chorus]
The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down
[Chorus: 2X]
Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something
[Chorus: 2X]
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me
[Chorus: 4X]",Hard Times,1995
Queen Latifah,"I think you're a sucker if you stand there
In the midst of all this political fanfare
We're constantly fightin' to keep our rights, and
The more we press on, the more they tighten
Their grip, but I'm a soldier keepin' me from any rupture
Don't listen to the negative, it will only self-destruct ya
Blowin' a cloud of smoke? Yo, you must be on a mission
You want to smoke somethin'? Smoke this one

Smoke this one

[Chorus]
Who will save the day?
Lord have mercy
Who will find a way?
Lord have mercy
Who will take away the strife
Lord have mercy
Oh Lord, rescue me from this life
Lord have mercy

Who will be the leader? (Who will be the leader?)
In a government so corrupt, they get greedier and greedier
What happened to 'a government for the people, by the people'
What people? We ain't equal
Discriminated against for race, religion, education
And you call this a nation?
I'm here to tell ya, hey, there ain't a day
(That what?) we should continue goin' on this way
Who will be responsible for teachin' the youth the truth
Who's accountable for establishin' world peace?
Catch the thugs, get rid of the drugs
Cure the poor, when will the bullshit cease?
Think of what you want to say, no doubt
No one'll ever know you're stupid till you open your mouth
I'm callin' your bluff, it's time for a decision
(Ask me) but if you got more beef, smoke this one

Smoke this one

[Chorus]

I'm the Queen by virtue of her guidance, show me
Guarded by the Flavor Unit, no one can dethrone me
Latifah, the feminine professor of wits
Coldcut's on the mix
And it ticks us off when we see so much wrong
(What's wrong) World, what's goin' on?
That's a question for you to ask yourself
Or are you that caught up in your wealth?
Kids are growin' up with materialistic minds
They become cruel and unkind
Spendin' all your money on Nikes and Filas
But when you see a panhandler, it's ""Ha-ha-ha
What a bum, get a job,"" I should hit you
With another verse of lyrics that'll fitcha
The words are cunning, stunning enough to pierce
But if you want to get fierce (do what?) smoke this one

	""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 2x)

Now understand that you must (dance) because this is a beat to clap to
My brother Lance said ""Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet""
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat
Ample samples, this for example
Are made by the 45 King, so cancel
Your plans of moving to the front lines
He's a DJ, producer, and mind you a friend of mine
I hop, dip, and spend with the children
So get down with the sound and you will lend
To let me bring while I bring
Queen Latifah to the 45 King, creating
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit
That's the way we like it, so I'm doing it
So if you want to know what the plan is to be
I order you to dance for me

	""Dance to the music""  (Repeat 2x)

My voice is your choice at a stage show
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say ""ho""
With powerful lyrics I'm armed
To let a sucker step up and get bombed
By a beat created by my producer
To break you out of the stuff that you're used to
This here is a moment of truth
So take the record to the DJ booth
And let's start this, let the beat get dumb
Cause I'm a shake it all night and then some
People dancing, I can spot 'em
When I take control, you know I got 'em
Stop the music?  That's not a question
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions
If you're not on the dance tip, here's your chance to be
I order you to dance for me

Queen Latifah,"Uh huh, well the name is Latifah, you hear me coming through
the spreaker.  Hit it Mark, 45 king

I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when
It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill
I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it
You think I'm sleeping on you?  Please, don't even try it
The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine
The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out
So don't try to turn me inside out

	Latifah is the name you love
	Flying through rhymes like a dove
	Slapping suckers with a glove
	Challenge me and you will burn
	Yes in the fire you will burn

It's so so simply done
When I find that I have to run
Lyrics to music by the King of Swing, The 45 King
The words we bring I write, and sing
Cause I am Latifah, the Queen of course
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost
Mark conducts the beat, I watch it hit them
Won't you chill? I don't need another victim
To add to the list of aggrivation
Subtracting suckers like a math computation
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples
This is a King and Queen creation
So hello hello hello and how ya doing?
Forget the smalltalk now, it's time for me to ruin
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying
When I put up the wall of words ain't no way into my Queendom
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the Ruler Lord Ramsey
The Ruler Lord, to him there is no equal
He grabs it and starts bombing people
Don't listen to me to figure me out
Because you can't turn my mind inside out

	Latifah is the name you love
	Flying through rhymes like a dove
	Slapping suckers with a glove
	Challenge me and you will burn
	Yes in the fire you will burn

Rhyming's not a question of one superiority
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me
But I came here just to party
If it's a show you want, the show it live
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived
When Mark requests my approval, I nod
And after each and every single rhyme I thank God
although a taste of my body would soothe you
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it
And Lord have mercy on those that try to steal it
Latifah is a name meaning ""delicate and sensitive""
But I have no problem formulating sentences
To break you down to the ground
I won't use violence, the color of this is brown
And I am down, but never ever down and out
So don't try to turn me inside out

	Latifah is the name you love
	Flying through rhymes like a dove
	Slapping suckers with a glove
	Challenge me and you will burn
	Yes in the fire you will burn

Jah know?  Cause ah...

Queen Latifah,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in Paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..",Lush Life,1998
Queen Latifah,"[Chorus: x2]
Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl?
Standin' 'round, waitin' for my queendom to fall.
Well I think not, styles are pipin' hot.

I'll tear your state up, so set the date up,
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it.
Who did it, who does it,
From private to public,
Anywhere I'm in there and been there.
So recognize this, who the nicest?
Sit down and settle for your consolation prizes.
Whatever you want, I got.
Whether you ready or not
It's about to get hot when I drop.
So notes, pause another spot.
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you.
Don't try to be me, do you.
Be coo' to you and do you.

But so-so, slow mo's comin' in like the po-po's.
Don't want rocks comin' at me the wrong way,
Packin' much rocks, it's gonna be a long day.
And for real, spittin' on imbeciles, and spinnin' wheels
On my six hundred, you want it, you must be blunted.

See, physically you not ready,
Lyrically you not ready,
Mentally, maybe.
Who talks tough, time to get the baby.
No threats or small bets on my bond, we can get it on
From dusk 'til dawn, from night till morn.
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks,
Till one of us admits it's a battle a whisk.
So look, I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker,
Thinkin' I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor.
Are you out of your mind, doubtin' mines, out of line
Talkin' out your behind, shoutin' rhymes out of time?
It's all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now?
Now you hush, hush now, ain't sayin' too much now.
Thought so, haunt yo' sleepin' ass, creepin' fast,
Like you was doin' somethin', now I gotta ruin somethin'.
You image, your career, lookie here, you whole life is hangin' in the air.
Like a Chandelier, poppin' off like a can of beer, understand is it clear,
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty.
Even though I'm low-key, you know me.
You be singin' over my tracks like it's karaoke.
If you don't know the half you gon' feel the wrath.

Boostin', tearin off tags
And sticking souvenirs into our bags
Slipped up, almost got caught then tried again

I was nervous you were too but wouldn't admit it
You were the best I had that's why I want all of you

Queen Latifah,"My mellow Latee was kicking flavor
The R.E. posse said ""Yo Latifah we can do this""
So I paused in the thought and in my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this

Now you should want to flex, cause I'm in full effect
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying for somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave to me

I'm coolin teaching those needing schoolin
The mic, this mic in my hand, I'm rulin
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness

Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness

[Latifah: rasta chorus]
Cost of living getting higher cause them to rhyme our way
Queen Latifah getting higher cause her to rhyme our way

Some MC's have gold and African vein
And using each other to compete with
Their subjects I pity because their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste, but don't consider biting

There's penalties for those who don't do writing, just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not my fault your thoughts are shrinking
While mine are growing, yes you know like all the woman inside of me

Despite what you do or say, and even in spite of me
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness, call me ""Your highness""
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King

You tremble for my treble, you're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious, the same as the pace
The crowds, they love me, they give only hugs
The shrinked-to-fit buttonflies fit quite snug

As a bug, you know why?  Because I'm bugging
Of the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex on the sounds that I'm pumping
I'm jumping with the energy to turn your mind to gladness

Come on, just get into it, don't lie and say you've been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness

(More rasta singing)

I scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face, you don't want to feel the taste
Don't try and play me out, cause I am not the one

Brothers on my brastrap, sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they want to be down with the 
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand

For those who want to bite, don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteous maximus
Suckers on the tip, you're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this

Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up
(Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle

Black medallions no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase

For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y (why)
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny
I seem (very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Oh let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands

Queen Latifah,"Welcome into my Queendom (My Queendom), come one come all
When it comes to lyrics I bring them (I bring them)
In spring I sing, in fall I call out to
All the ones who had a hard day
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to par-tay
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move
(One nation under a groove) House music always soothes
So get with the flow, let's go, yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better off position can you be in?

The pool is over, come into my house

Bass and treble flow through the speakers
Ride the rhythm, I know it's gonna reach ya
I'm the Queen, Latifah
Now it's time to run through it
45 King? (Yeah, baby?) Cue it
Yeah, there you go, I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it? (That was cool) I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum, give me some
With the Flavor Unit I've come to say ""Ride the grooveline""
Don't swing the pipeline, listen to the smooth line
Throw away the white line
It's a house party I'm hosting (What?)
Come and rock with the one that's chosen
It can't turn me inside out (Uh uh)
For those that dare, come into my house

You ask what is it I'm doing?
Hip-hop house, hip-hop jazz, with a little pizzazz
>From the Queen, the Queen of Royal Badness
Remember me from ""Wrath of My Madness?""
It's my rap that rocks this party
I'm a hijack and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude
Keep in mind I move multitudes
The asiatic black woman, hardcore beat drumming
It's hard to keep a good woman down, so I keep coming
Blow for blow, I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
It's an open invitation, come into my house

All maid and chef
Why you sit around here like you do heck
A woman? Nah you need a blowup doll
A chick like me, I was born to ball
I'm a chick with her own doe for the mall

In their rendition of 'The Cell Block Tango'

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh Uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

You know how people have these little habits
That get you down like Ernie
Ernie like to chew gum, no, not chew, Pop

Like, I come home this one day and there's Ernie
Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said
""Ernie, you pop that gum one more time"" and he did

So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots into his head

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single and we hit it off right away
So, we started living together

He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner
And in storms my husband Wilbrin in a jealous rage
""You been screwin' the milkman""

He says and he kept sayin'
""You been screwin the milkman""
Then he ran into my knife
He ran into my knife ten times

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Mit kersek, en itt? Azt mondjok, hogy a hires
Lakem lefogta a ferjemet en meg lecsaptam a fejet
De nem igaz, en artatlan vagyok
Nem tudom mert mondja Uncle Sam hogy en tettem
Probaltam a rendorsegen megmayarazni de nem ertettek meg

But did you do it?
Uh uh, not guilty

My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us
With the last number in our act
We did 20 acrobatic tricks in our world

One two three four five, splits, spread eagles
Flip flops, back flips, one right after the other
Well, this one night we were in Cicero

The three of us, we were in this hotel room
Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some

I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming, they had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it, in spite if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

I loved Alvin Lipschitz, he was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He go out every night looking for himself
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it comin', they had it comin'
They had it comin' all along
'Cause if they used us and they abused us
How could they tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Hit by a stray, but I pray their's a hood in heaven

Ain't the paper, that makes me daner
I just see the strangers they look at me stranger
They all give me more lip
So I give ya more music, more smackin'

I stepped up to salary cappin'
Passin' traffic and lookin' what happened
See how life takes a turn (uh huh)
More paper earned

Always poof, the case's adjourned
I am what I am, I come from North
So crème de la crème (uh yeah)
And specially when, ya pray for my downfall

That's why I try to stay from round why'all (let's go)
Till my days in the dark, they find me (let's go)
Like me the maids when I park and I'll be
Still, doin' me, still so beautifully 
I ain't brushin' off haters nothin' true to me

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Go and do your thing
'Cause people will talk 
Baby it's the way
The way that you are
Keep your head up to the sky
Confidence high
They're the ones that hate you
'cause they're the ones who make you
Go and do your thing

Yo, yo, yo
Now just imagine how the world'll be witchu cruisin' 
Sacked down, popped the blouse, get girls aroused 
Popped out, shot the brows

Knocked the clothes and copped the house
Could it be that you feel you need me?
Huh, you love the way I flow 'cause it comes to easy
When life imitate artex where the hatin' start

You gotta love dat, try to stay good at
Who knew I'd come this far
Who is this woman, a movie star?
My moms always told me I come from God

And the stress that come from why'all keep taking
You be there keep waiting
Keep trying be patient
Why'all wish I can stand united 
And really fall in love in hearts provided 

[Chorus: Mario Winans]

Lately, it seems to me 
That people ain't what they seem to be
They all want me torn up
I know there's snakes in the grass

So I pay my staff, to keep the lawns cut
I see all the drama you bringin'
I combine that with posit thinking
I'm me till I'm old and grey

When that day comes
I'm a teach my daughters do be the same way
I am the way I am, I'm from the hood
So crème de le crème

And specially when, ya pray for my downfall
That's why I try to stay from round why'all (that's why)
You never keep me down
So I'll always be around, forget about it

Still doin' it, (still doin me)
So beautifully I ain't brushin' off haters nothin' true to me

[Chorus: X 2]

[Ending: Mario Winans]

If I can't double up
It's like I didn't get enough
Call me greedy if you want, just do it

I don't get no complaints

Two time lovin' makes me smile
One time love just ain't my style
Repeat the love and I have found
More the second time around

And you can try to stop my dancin' feet
But I just cannot stand still
'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums
Then I found my way

A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
The best that I can today

'Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean
Or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat!

So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today
'Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreamin' of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
'Cause you cant stop the beat!

You can't stop my happiness, 'cause I like the way I am
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas Ham!
So, if you don't like the way I look, well, I just don't give a damn!

Just subsided through the haze

Just drifted off into deeper thought
So I broke my mind and searched my heart
Finally whats blindin' me was just as clear as day.
I figured out whats stressin' me, depressin' me
Mummy that man was lancing me
No..

Was only 5 years old I couldn't seem to tell a soul
I didn't know how to let you and daddy know
And I can't go on, like this
That's the kinda thing that make ya slash your wrists
But now that I realise this
What happened to me I gotta fight this


[Chorus]
The devils are probably lyin' (runnin' round and lyin')
Tryin' to move out
Is he gonna take my crown?
Gotta get up, stand up, fight for hours
Every second of every minute of every hour
I see your face

Help me with what happens in the world.


Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare.

(The world)

The world'll put you right on top
Then snatch the bottom from under you
And just watch and laugh as you drop

Lesson number one the world ain't fair
It'll chew you up and it'll spit you out
So put your faith in it if you dare.

(The world)

Whooooah..
The world'll put you right on top
Then snatch the bottom from under you
And just watch and laugh as you drop


Runnin' around the school as you tried committin' suicide
He asked what would make a 14 year old boy wanna take his life?
It'd be the fact, that he got a dad, who uses him, as a punchin' bag
Beats him till he's blue and black and wont stop will he makes him cry.

You kept it to your self and made excuses for the bruises,
Took painkiller to kill the pain from a daddy who's abusive,
He was telling you, you were useless
Never heard the words ""I love you""
Made you feel like you were worthless
He's tryin' to save the trouble and

He can't go on, like this
That's the type thing that made you slash you wrists
Somebody shoulda told you that you're priceless
Put your faith in god and we can fight this.

(chorus)
The devils are probably lyin' (runnin' round and lyin')
Tryin' to move out

That we livin' in (livin)
Where we leave our babies in the back seat of cars (cars)
Found my pass is blind (blind)
Desperate minds and emotional teenagers
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Well loves so right
You so never wanna test it
Who's your momma who your daddy?
You, can't even tell.
You're shinin' on chattin'
See news at eleven.
Were all walking through this place with
Vain visions of heaven

[Chorus]
The devils are probably lyin' (runnin' round and lyin')
Tryin' to move out

Queen Latifah,"You can't stop an avalanche
As it races down the hill
You can try to stop the seasons, girl
But you know you never will

And you can try to stop my dancin' feet
But I just cannot stand still
'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums
Then I found my way
'Cause you can't stop the beat

Ever since this whole world began
A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
The best that I can today

'Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean
Or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna, but I never ask why
And if you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you can't stop the beat!

You can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea
You can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just can't be!
And if they try to stop us, Seaweed, I've got the N double A.C.P.

'Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round 
And my heart's keepin' time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way
'Cause you can't stop the beat!

Ever since we first saw the light
A man and woman like to shake it on a Saturday night
So I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today
'Cause you cant stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above
You can try to stop the paradise we're dreamin' of
But you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay
'Cause you cant stop the beat!

You can't stop my happiness, 'cause I like the way I am
And you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas Ham!
So, if you don't like the way I look, well, I just don't give a damn!

'Cause the world keeps spinnin' round and round
And my hearts keepin' time to the speed of sound
I was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way

Oh, Oh, Oh
You can't stop today (No!)
As it comes speeding 'round the track (oooh, child yes!)
Yesterday is history (be gone!)
And it's never comin' back! (look ahead, 'cause)
'Cause tomorrow is a brand new day, and it don't know white from black (yeah!)

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh ahh

A man or woman like to shake it when the day is ooh ooh 
And so we're gonna shake and shimmy it and have some fun today!

When nobody needs me
My heart wants to know
And so I must go
Where destiny leads me

With no star to guide me
And no one beside me
I'll go on my way
After the day
The darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow

Queen Latifah,"A toast to the groom!
(To the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
To the bride!
(To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
From your sister
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
Who is always by your side
(By your side, by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide
(You provide, you provide)
May you always (always)
Be satisfied (rewind)

Rewind!
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I remember that

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place
But Alexander, I'll never forget the first time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said ""hi"" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame
This is not a game

You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

I'm sure I don't know what you mean, you forget yourself

You're like me, I've never been satisfied

Is that right?

I have never been satisfied

My name's Angelica Schuyler

Alexander Hamilton

Where's your fam'ly from?

Unimportant, there's a million things I haven't done
Just you wait, just you wait

So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? it's
The feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev'rything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
He's a bit of a flirt, but I'm 'a give him a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face and she is

Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time

I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
Cause I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! that doesn't mean I want him any less
(Doesn't mean I want him any less)
(Doesn't mean I want him any less)
(Doesn't mean I want him any less)

He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why
I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
(I will never be satisfied)
(I will never be satisfied)

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say ""I'm fine""
But she'd be lying

But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadn't sized
Him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life

A toast to the groom!
(To the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
To the bride!
(To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
From your sister
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
Who is always by your side
(By your side, by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide
(You provide, you provide)
May you always
Be satisfied

And I know (yeah)
She'll be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied",Satisfied,2016
Queen Latifah,"Oh, I've been down about a time or two
But You picked me right back up again
When I reached out for You, oh Lord
You brought me strength to my weakest parts
You showed me the way, yes oh Lord
I'm so glad I trust You
And now all I can say is

Oh, Lord! Thank You for loving me
Oh, Lord! Thank You for giving me
Your grace and Your mercy
Through my darkest days
Thank You, oh, Lord

With You, life I can win

I'm grateful for music and the stars above

You saved my life

And I was with you through all of your darkest moments
Feels just like yesterday when we were homeless
Got you some bread, and started treating me bogus

Talking about you wanted something new (something new)
Like I wasn't good enough for you
Guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
Maybe you should take a look in your rear view

'Cause obviously you forgot all the times
That I held you when you cried
And don't you remember that
Even if you was in the wrong I stood by your side?
No, I guess not, I guess not
'Cause you let them thots take my spot
Congratulations to you
What you wanted is what you got now (you got now, baby)

So you don't got to worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around comes around

You don't got to worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around comes around

I remember when you said that you could have somebody better
And I can't even lie to you, it really messed my head up
Have me looking in the mirror disgusted with myself
Wishing that I look like someone else
Like the girls you liked on Instagram, damn

And you really had the nerve to call me insecure
Maybe it wasn't you
Maybe it's true I didn't know my worth
Maybe maybe I should have loved me first
Maybe maybe I should have loved me first

So you don't got to worry about me
You made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah
Go ahead and have your fun now
Just remember what goes around comes around

You don't got to worry about me (you don't gotta worry)
You made it clear that you're unhappy, yeah

But I ain't been feeling it lately
You say you love keeping me fly but
Can't keep me from looking' so crazy
Come in at six in the mornin'
Where you been, where you been?
Who is that texting your phone?
Just a friend, just a friend (okay)
My intuition never lies
There's nothing you can ever hide
Already got the screenshots
So there is no need to deny
You been creepin' and freakin' and sneakin'
Like you'll never lose me
Steady claiming that everyone know we together
But you steady choosing

Swear I cannot win for losing
I been out here being faithful
I always got this on lockdown
But that ain't been keeping us stable
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine (hey, yeah)

How would you like it if I do the things you do
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue
Give another guy everything that belongs to you
I'ma call up Brian, I'ma FaceTime Ryan
I'ma text Lorenzo and I'ma leave you cryin'
Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you, same to you, yeah?

You don't like it
Now you telling' me that I should fight it
Why you be out here playing the victim
When I am the one who been cryin'?
Why dish it out but can't take it?
I want revenge, I can't fake it
Wanna see the look on your face
When I drop my clothes and I get naked
Not for you, but for him
Now tell me player, how does that make you feel?
How could you play me when the love I gave was real?
I even took you back and you still had no chill (no)

Boy you ain't gon ever learn
Play with fire you get burned
I don't think you'll understand
Till I hit you where it hurts (hit you where it hurts)
So I guess I know what I gotta do
Give you a taste of your own medicine, hey yeah

How would you like it if I do the things you do (do the things you do)
Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes (entertain these dudes)

Don't get it twisted I can play this game too
How would you like it if I did the same to you, same to you, yeah?

All of those tears I cried
I can't count the lonely nights

Forgot about the past now what you want

It's kinda simple 'cause it's nothing just to make hits 
Peep the facts, keep 'em stacked 
When the streets are Black 
Ladies scream he's the Mack 

'cause I kick (what) 
Shit that make the fly chick you with my chick 
And plush funds just ridiculous 
'cause I'm rich 
We are TR, you see, QP, that's we, Blackstreet, gone

Enforce that then I'd make my hips bump and grind

Queen Pen,"fI'm taking you back 
I'm taking you back 
Here's another one 

Uh yeah 
I remember being on that nigga's chair  hard 
Back in the day in the projects 
Chasing after him  a lil' young chick 
Seeing him made me go back in my lab 
And write this lil' shit like this 
Check it out 

Here's how it goes 
Used to see you when I went to the store 
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window 
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with 
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash 

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes 
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive 
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs 
With hopes to get close to you 

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep 
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets 
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet 
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet 

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew 
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you 
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do 
To give all my love to you, my God 

Can't feel myself 
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy 
There's not a minute, hour, day or night 

I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list 
'cause I'm always thinking of you 
(Take it to the bridge) 

All my love 
('Cause all my love's to you, my girl) 
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough 
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one) 
I just don't want to stop 
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much 
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge) 

Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew 
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew 
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning, 
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit 

Talked about that sex like I was used to it 
Lying about how many you used to kiss 
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real 
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels 

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that 
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched 
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt 
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work 

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad 
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young 
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you 
My God 

Can't feel myself 
Don't want nobody else to ever love you 
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy 
There's not a minute, hour, day or night 

I don't love you 
You're at the top of my list 
'Cause I'm always thinking of you 
(Take it to the bridge) 

All my love 
('Cause all my love's to you, my girl) 
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough 
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one) 
I just don't want to stop 
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much 

The breakdown, now bounce to this 
Yeah, dedicated to the first love (right) 
Uh, you know who you are, from the hood 
It's all good (yeah) yeah 

We goin' bounce ta dis 
We make moves with this

Me'shell: so queen tell me, where did you meet her,

Queen Pen: On the sunday, mac, she was walking out ???
I was just chillin, mindin my own business
Sittin on the corner, waitin for my sister
When she slid by, maybe 4 or 5 times
Wanted me to notice the rhythm of her thighs
Oh boy, uh, girls are just so funny to me
I can see how niggas get into these beefs
She knew she had a man when she came up in the piece
She said she was a regular and how about me,
If she gave me her digits would i call her after three
The way she fliked her hips made you move to have to see
How these chinese jamaican tried to draw it by me
It never ceases to amaze me

Me'shell: Ain't nobody gotta know just how much you want me
(chorus)
(verse 3)
Now how i've ran, you've only a few
But you can back track and ask them how i do it how it is
Who the flyest chick, with the phattest whip
And run her all night, like a burger with a chip
And if it's all good then i feature it again
Like a fix remix, (if you need a fix)
See you gots to be real like my ex beverly
You don't have your man just stressin out on me
Coz he can't control how you throw your pussy
I'm a baller and i been for a ???
And if i choose to jerk her off then it's all on me
See you claimed that was your girl, well that's not how it seems

Queen Pen,"Uh, it's all for you, my melody boo
This lovin' is all for you, break it down, how you feel about this

[Verse 1]
Reminiscing to back in our beginning
Sweet politicking in the heart of the village
We slid digits on low, exchanged a couple of 'hellos'
As you slid out the door
I remember clearly makin' moves up the steps we made eye contact
It was his gleam that brought me back, legit
How we met on some real ghetto star shit
Mad chicks on my melody's dick
See he got this kinda grace about himself
Dealin' with fast life all flooded up with wealth
So for him, cuties just be comin' like a dime a dozen
Smooth talkin' brothers always get easy fuckin'
But I ain't mad, at all of his cutie head lovin'
And all his playin hard to get was worth tryin' to get my loving
He's got personality for days
The kinda melody others bad talkin' many ways
The kinda beat that always stays paid, my special kinda boo who always 
Appreciates gettin' laid
My melody

Just the way. I want to be loved
Yeah

[Verse 2]
True, we been together from the very beginning
Since blocks be turned into states, baguettes be turned into cakes
So he be knowin' how I'm down by law
Plus his knowledge himself be havin' his mentality bore
He gets first bids when I'm blowin' in from tour
His sex is respected behind closed doors
Listen, he the bomb, I can't tell you different
It's a fact how he mystify me like Kaiser Sosack
Uh, it feels good to know how others wish they could be loved
In the clubs bitches screwin' up their mugs because
They envious to how my boo is true to this
Gold diggin' bitches always be disputing shit
That don't even concern them, I'm learnin'
The next chick that try to make your melody a B-track
But true, he be bigger than that
My boo be realizin' that his wifey'll always have his back, uh
Check out my melody

Cause you love me baby
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Communication be never a mess
Coz he be keepin' street conflict away from this relationship
He's got a mind of his own
He's a leader, not scared to be a dreamer, my black man digger
And I be down till the day that I die, loyalty bonafied
So how ask why I, dedicated all my love to his cause
Financially lock him down, hide his monies from the law cause
No matter what my melody be's a good man
No matter how he ran on the actions of his plan and
I be down till the day that I die
Loyalty bonafied, my melody and I

Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah, It's so nice lyin' here in you arms
Your personality has that charm
Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Oh I could stay here for the rest of my life
I want to be your lover, want to maybe you wife
Cause you love me baby,
Just the way I want to be loved,
Yeah, yeah, you love me baby",My Melody,1997
Queen Pen,"Yeah, it's ninety-seven going into ninety-eight,
And I've been doin' this for mad years, payin' dues.
This is my heart, my purpose in life,
And finally I'm on. 
Which brings me to realize that the tough life that I had only made me 
Stronger, true.

Richard Stites.
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.
A ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know this much is true.

Growin' up, didn't want to have nothing to do wit' you.
Make you hittin' everybody went to high school wit' you.
Want to play you close and jump in the pool wit' you.
I don't know what to do, but this much is true,
And in the hood, they all like to knock your career,
And turn right around when you hot a gear.
I played Midas and told them that it's God I fear;
That the man upstairs, he control this here
And it's funny how, soon as the money piles,
Everybody want to play with that brother now,
Run me down, but when the doe gets low, only a few friends roll, you know.
And Mama, bless her heart, she used to give me strife,
Said ""Lynisse, please do something with your life.""
And how it's gon' play out, I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

And I remember when, I used to feen for calls,
When I hit number one I had to scream out calls.
Used to see my Mama strugglin', worn from work,
Told her when I made it big, she never gonna work.
I used to wish at night that my brothers in the street,
Hustlin', s***, they would live to the light,
And see another day somehow, find another way I vow.
To all my soldiers, I hold you down.
From standin' in the rain, to the rovers now.
I'm screamin your name, to warn you that the rollers is around,
To on-stage throwin' it down.
No matter where you at, represent your hood.
No matter where I'm at, I'm representing my hood.
And how it's gon' all play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

[Chorus]

I've opened up my eyes to a brighter day,
Nobody in the block gave their life away.
We all tryin' to take it easily,
And everybody want to make it seems is free.
Today it's all good and it seemes so strange,
Since you look up in the hood now things done changed.
Kids they used to be wheelies for blocks,
Is out ridin' their bikes, doin' wheelies for blocks.
And b****es on the bench, still gossipin', who's she slidin' in,
Who's she slidin' with, outside partyin'.
Old timers in the back playin' dominoes.
Kids freestyling, all kinds of flows.
Girls flow through with designer clothes.
It's day now, but you know how night time goes.
And how it's gon' play out I don't have a clue;
All I know is this much is true, true.

Intro/Chorus: 911 
The girl was lookin good 
Like a lady should 
I remember where I saw her 
I saw her in the magazine 
Her body's tight, her fingers right 
Reminds me of a girl from around the way 
Ooooh oooh, I saw her in a magazine 
Verse 1: Queen Pen, 911 
Uhh, I heard you been lookin for me 
Diggin me down, giving me nothin but peach 
Ha please, you know where to find me when you need me 
Queen P, got you charmed out like them trees 
or Lexus, heck a car load full of G's 
Impress thee, wit the realism technique 
Automatically, pulled you right into my lead 
Feel me, as you indulge in your magazine 
I couldn't believe my eyes 
When I opened up that magazine 
It was the finest girl I ever seen 
I think I knew her face 
I saw her hangin out around the way 
Watchin all the players play, whoaaa 
Her smile sets off this glow 
and when she walks, it's such a sexy flow 
I think I want to let her know, that

Just as fly as she can be, ohohowoh

Verse 2: 911 
I, often dream of us 
and I can't believe it feels so real 
It gives me such a freaky thrill 
I like to hold her hand 
and tell all the fellas I'm her man 
But my dream came to an end 
Now that she's on my mind 
I just want to make her mine 
We'll be together til the end of time, ooooohhhhhh 
(Yes I can make my dreams come true) 
Then everything would be so cool 
and I would never spend one night without you

uhh, ain't no need for awakening, 'cause you're not dreaming 
I mean your optics be as clear like semen 
It's me, squeaky clean, mentally and physically 
I be's the one to weigh you down like a triple beam

In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Queen Pen,"You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

[Chorus: x4]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spins the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Chorus: x4]

Cause that's my peeps and we row G
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be taking you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking jacks never been my flavor
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncey

Seeing him made me go back in my lab 
And write this lil' shit like this 
Check it out 

Here's how it goes 
Used to see you when I went to the store 
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window 
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with 
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash 

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes 
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive 
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs 
With hopes to get close to you 

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep 
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets 
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet 
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

I shouldn't loved him
I shouldn't wanted him
I shouldn't trust him
No I shouldn't fucked him
Now here I am carryin his seed
That makes two for him and a fourth for me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm wreckin my brain, tryna to figure out
How we can come to this, how we even came about
We never took the time to measure the proper amounts
Or beef we would cause of sneakin around
If my brother even knew shit he'd proably flip out
And up until tonight we never had doubts
remember the first time that you slept over my house?
We made love to Donnell Jones, damn we so foul
But now its been a year from that day today
We still meet in the cut I can't live this way
Can't be no more us, fuck you feelin lame
What about me feelin loved, is sex all that its worth?
When it comes to us, I know that you love me
Its deeper then a nut, I know that you care for me
Its deeper then a nut

[Chorus: 3x]

[Verse 2]
You keep blamin it on him clamin him as a friend
Talkin about you and that nigga is tight like brothers
Fuck him, and I can put that on my life
So what he my baby daddy he don't do his child right
Tryna to explain I got tears in my eyes
This lump in my throat tryna hold back my cries
You talkin about me and ya booze ain't wise
Me and you has a cup Queen it just ain't right
You said it could never be yo niggas B.D. a wife
Tell me how would it look to the rest of my crew
You fuckin wit me Queen that's just bad news
I'm breakin rules but we just can't stop
I said we in too deep I'm not killin ya seed
I say we in too deep nigga I'm keepin my seed

[Verse 3]
It really broke my heart to see you pushin that whip
When you couldn't even cop a new coat for yo kid
It really broke my heart when you cocked backed on me
When I was six months pregnant still beatin on me
It really fucked me up how you put me in debt
Fuckin up QPs dollars and sense
To think I catch your doughs and your whiz in my crib
Jeporadize a lively hood on me and my kids
And which one of those seeds belong to you
God would've been better of makin a cat or a baboon instead of you
Nigga I mean you ain't worth shit
A man that don't take care of his kids ain't worth lint
Now here I am I'm in love wit yo friend
And the only thing standin in the way is you bitch!

Is worthy of a place in line

we lost 2 ill niggaz B.I.G and 2pac
this goes to all of us so peep the session from your nigga
you can be loved by millions but one clown can pull the trigga
see you aim to get bigger they break for your downfall
your life is how you living kid just give it your all
we strive to be the best that's what they taught us in the rhyme
smoking weed and getting bent we've all been through hard times
much respect to your hood love is love that's all good
the plan's to make you niggaz understand, understood
yo here's the deal for real you can't get killed from entertaining
but that's all we know cause from the street we got the training

this be a ghetto dedication from my family to yours
how hard is this to explain when it rains kid it pours
instead of bringing ?crime ills? and senseless wars
you niggaz need to expand, buy land, open stores
you talk of revolution but you're very much afraid
take that chip off your shoulder let's all get paid
direct it to the world because we all need peace
we all livin in the belly of the beast

yo, now many lives are lost still to this day we ask the reason
all the suffering we've been through niggaz still is into squeezing
mom dukes on welfare ghetto love no more we share
you rising to the top but then get hit from the rear
one night up in the hood I found my own self thumpin
cause niggaz out there they felt that I owed them something
talk behind my back they don't attack that don't offend me
a 13-year old could just up, and end me
if he wanted to, blunted with the brew in his hand
now does that make shorty rock the man?
not only in your hood but in my hood we lost 2 good fellaz
it's more than what they motherfuckers tell us
now if a cop got shot someone's caught the same night
that's the bullshit you motherfuckin right
so take heed to what I say, LB Fam pray in they own way
to the motherfuckin day

2 of the illest rap artists underground bodies slain
they both did they thing went platinum in the game
at home where I zone there's a TV I watch
BET, MTV, video, music box
it bugs me out for real I'm in the zone kid that's ill
it only goes to show up in the rap game it's real
it's just a little something on my mind how I feel
now niggaz kick raps, and caps get peeled

kid I thought we was rhymin man fuck that actin tough
enough is enough let's dead that East and West stuff
I'm callin niggaz bluff yo my rap game be tuff
let's take it to the stage and let the lyric game buss
I'm tryin to live a hundred plus in this crazy world
to hold down my fam, Queens, and my baby girl

look here we tryin to make it but they tryin to hold us back
that's why I'm speakin my opinion on this track
the media they tryin to throw dirt in the game
but me and my fam we found ways to explain
throughout the pain I try to gain and keep the shit the same
it's quite strange how these cats keep playin games

How could she set me up like that?
I caught my balance, shot back 
I'm jettin down the fire escape I started sprayin
I'm takin five steps at a time enemy is gaining
on me, my niggaz tried to warn me when my steppin
It's good though cause on a low a nigga had his weapon
I'm jettin down this dead end thrill
I hit the street I got no jacket on my back 
But I got my Tim's on my feet 
when my life broke across me back against the wall
I'm lookin for my enemies I'm searchin for them all
No bullets being fired so now a nigga's jettin to the corner
that's where most of the people settin
I break-away my burner now I'm searchin for the train

Talkin about my work and talkin she bring me back

He follows with de-cursing em I know that some of my crew been hurt
My mind need a touch I roll a touch up while I'm walkin

Can't put my finger on just what happened 
Me and shorty actin in the ghetto tappin and then they clappin

Human race that we run
It left me crawling
Staring straight at the sun
Only a moment I notice
Every dog has his day
I paid attention
Cost me so much to today

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
It's a waste of time

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

I wanted something
Nothing blank I don't know
It's all deflecting
Stones are easy to throw
Only a moment I notice
Hours, days left behind
Of wasted, useless
Selfless, none of a kind

Into fore wood
Fan the flames

And the sword of right will guide your way

And thus you'll find that only demons fill your mind until you wake
But only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from today

Burning dreams cause your mind to wonder
Iron crosses are the calling numbers
And the fight for the answer still remains old

But the night will reflect the hunger
And the blackness will pull you under

I see something that reminds me of you

Your rosary wrapped around your throat
I lie awake and sweat, afraid to fall asleep
I see your face looking back at me, looking back at me

And I raise my head and stare

From the eyes of a stranger
Afraid to know what
Lies behind the stare

How many more lies will they tell me

Ten P.M., I feel the rain coming down
My face feels the wet, my mind the storm
Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour
Moving silent, through the streets, they're mine, they're mine

Midnight, she sings praises in the Hall
To saintly faces hallowed be their names she can't recall
Sister Mary, virgin Mary, silent with her sin
(""What are you doing out in the rain?"")
She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks
(""I've been waiting for you, come in"")

Help us make it through the night

Binds my arm and feed my mind
The only peace I've ever known
I'll close my eyes and you shoot

No Mary, listen, you've got to pull your strength 
(From my lips, I pray I feed you well)
Your precious cross is gone, it made me wait so long
For what you gave to everyone
The priest is cold and dead on his knees he fed
(From my barrel of death, he turned)
The Holy water red, as he died he said ""thank you""

I feel the flow, the blessed stain
Sweating hands like fire, and flames
Burn my thighs, spread in sacrificial right
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight

Always alone
Blind you search for the truth
I see myself in you, parallel lives
Winding at light-speed through time

No time to rest yet

(Before madness has the final laugh)
Too much bloodshed
We're being used and fed
Like rats in experiments
There's no final outcome here
Only pain and fear

There's one thing left to see
Will it be him or me?
There's one more candle left to light

Don't turn your back on my disgrace
The blood of Christ can't heal my wounds, so deep
The sins of man are all I taste
Can't spit the memory from my mind
I can't cry anymore

Queensrÿche,"Last time in Paris was a little strange,
Had time to myself,
Headed out to see the city sights.

Met a little thing on the Champs-Elysee's,
Stole my heart away,
You know I never could pronounce her name.
She didn't mind at all.

We were sitting there,
Seemed like hours
Pass the day away,
Till they said we had to pay,
Or do the dishes or something,
I don't know.

Living at the plaza Athene,
Got to rest for the show.
Man at the front desk knew my face.
Said he had a room with a view for two.
But he forgot to say,
Renovation next door starts today.
Can't fing another room.
All day long they banged,
14 hours.

Show time on my mind,
And wringing somebody's throat,
Last time in Paris
Last time in Paris
Last time in Paris was strange
Last time in Paris
Last time in Paris
Last time in Paris was strange
Overslept, missed the bus to the show
Had to find my own ride.

Took the metro out to Avignon.
Man at the backstage, didn't know my name.
Said hey, I'm with the band!
You and everyone today.

What is this guy new?
15 minutes fly,
Someone sees me.

Inside let me go
Hey Geoff, we need photos

And it's another rainy night, without you
Guess I'll leave the light on for you
It's just another rainy night without you

Listen, there's a foghorn blowing from the coast tonight
Remember making love in the rain?
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
Raindrops taste like tears, without the pain
I'm not much without you, can't leave if I wanted to
Maybe that's why you stay around

But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called

I've seen the world through a bitter stare
But my dream is still alive
I'm going to be the best I can

I want to be a busy man
I want to see a change in the future
I'm gonna make the best of what I have
I want to write for a magazine

And I won't let go

Chase the light I see ahead
Luminate the path I tread
I live to be the best I can

Straight ahead, focused on the big attack
On a roll and I'm never slowing down
I won't be torn between

Read your name in the lights
All the ads and people say,

A cavern, ten thousand steps down
The only light was fire fly glow,
Reflecting in the blue crystal show
Feeling in the darkness surrounding me,
Roots of giant Sequoia trees
Anchor the canopy of life that's above
The answer to the mystery of life is

Traveled through the jungles of the Yucatan
And drank the potion from the magic man
Held the starlight inches from my face,
Pushed the door open, # 7.
I walked the path way to heaven
Saw the same face of God.

[Chorus]
Seems every where I go
I see the same face, I feel the same flow.
With every one I meet and every hand I shake,
I'm every man, trying my best to get to know
Because everything's at stake

We're the same tribe.
Passing through Morocco for the faithful is a trip
Hallucinating visions drives my desert ship
For a thousand miles we could not fail,
Can't enjoy if you can't inhale
Clearly a lifetimes need of some experience and
For the record, peace

Smiling, the needle crying
Walking out of his room
With mirrors, afraid I heard him scream
You'll never get away

Cold and shaking
I crawled down alleys to try
And scrape away the tracks that marked me
Slammed my face into walls of concrete
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall

Queensrÿche,"You think you're smart, inventive
Because you've figured out my game?
Pride is a handy substitute
When you've got only yourself to blame

All my dreams I've realized while you were indisposed
While you've spent eighteen years watching TV
I've watched my fortune grow

Here I am I'm finally on the outside and
You're nowhere near where I've been
I've got you where I want you at last
You've got no idea who I am

We circle around each other waiting for reaction
We circle around each other waiting for reaction
Wanting satisfaction for the past
I want nothing from the past

Always been so easy you're like a puppet on my string
Throwing down hollow threats, unsure of what to think
Why should I care? You wouldn't dare
You're nothing but worthless I swear

From where I stand I've got you where I want you
You'll never take me! Never take me down
I've seen all I need to put you in the ground
Revenge is normal, a typical reaction

I've seen your cynical reaction
If you're standing outside of in
Always on the outside of in

Here we are at last facing oblivion
And this is where finally it ends
You don't belong here
Holding fast to each of our sins

With hope by my side, I'll survive to see the dawn
Believe me or not you owe me, I owe you nothing
I gave your life a purpose
I owe you nothing but your death
Without me you wouldn't have learned a thing

Oh, Antônia brilha
E qualquer uma

Sei que sou capaz de lutar
E com dignidade minha paz encontrar
Força para resgatar!

Com sabedoria vou me libertar
Eu tenho o dom, esqueça a guerra faça um som
Vou trazer de volta o sonho de vencer
Vou te mostrar como lutar como viver

Ei, mulher! O grito, a força!
União, perseverança
Lutar, crescer, saber viver
Fé! compaixão e amor no coração!

Pronta pra jogar estou
Vou avante! Sou lena!
Sou forte e vou rumo ao gol
Jamais parar, insisto!
Não desisto, corro o risco e não me esquivo
Não desisto, corro o risco e não me esquivo

Um mundo novo onde ficar
Pra ser do bem, amar sem olhar a quem
É só querer barbarizar então, vem!

Orgulho é batalhar pra viver
Cantar é minha arma pra vencer
Nada pode parar!
Ninguém vai me calar!

Oh la la la la, sou do time Antônia!

De uma mulher que é Antônia de verdade

Quence,"Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me ""don't touch me""
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggaz give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said ""I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes""
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said ""Ye' you don't love me""
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly

We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me

Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good the bad the ugly","The Good, The Bad, The Ugly [Exclusive]",2013
Quentin Harris,"Last night, I had the time of my life
It's true
For last night, I made love for the very 
First time
With you

I never knew love could be so sweet
It never made a difference to me
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you made the difference 
Now love is so clear

And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel 
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we
And Oh I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me

Last night, you bought something special
Out of me
And for the first time
You made my dream a reality

I never though love was meant for me
For I was blind and could not see
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the 
Difference
Now love is so sincere

And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel 
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we

Cause your love is so strong
I don't want to do wrong
Girl your love seems like it's true 
Protection
You just give me a call
And I'll give you my all

Quentin Harris,"I really miss you when the nights are long
And only silence is heard in this world of song
But life goes on
And forever more
Ill be haunted by your love

I see you walking through the gates of home
And then I wake up to find
I'm still all alone
I should have known
But forever more
Ill be haunted by your love

Lonely is the river
As it tumbles to the ocean
Searching for our future
We can find our way back home

My only comfort is the love we share
And as I walk through this world
With sadness everywhere
I've had my share
And forever more,
Ill be haunted by your love

And forever more,
Ill be haunted by your love

Standing in the doorway
As the sunrise greets the morning
Searching for our future 
We can find our way back home

I really miss you when the nights are long
And only silence is heard in this world of song
