Set Before Us,"Impressions shape and mold, they teach you right and wrong
The ones close are the ones that leave a mark
We carry a blindfold from a young age, blind from birth we stumble into the dark 
We are a disease that has brought us to our knees  
We are an avalanche that has left us buried beneath our own weight
Now everywhere I look, war, greed, pain and scars
The blindfolds off

I try to be my own man, but the weight of the world pulls me down
I try to live my own life, but the weight of the world pulls me down
Fingers pointed in every direction, who is to blame? 
We’re all the culprits and we’re all the victims

A generation born in darkness, going in circles with no direction 
Masters of our own world, where the blind leads the blind
In which we are the cure and cause, the key and lock
The blindfolds off 
The dice roll that determines what we become
Hope placed into the hands of Lady Fortuna 
Can’t control who we are, can’t control what is written in stone  

I try to be my own man, but the weight of the world pulls me down
I try to live my own life, but the weight of the world pulls me down
Fingers pointed in every direction, who is to blame? 
We’re all the culprits and we’re all the victims",Avalanche,2018
Set Before Us,"I can hear the ocean calling me home, and the undertow pulling me below
Skin and bone, will I turn to salt and stone as the waves of eternity crashes over me? 
Give my body and soul to the unknown, bury me, lay me to rest

My body will be returned to earth
The circle closes, my prize is payed 
The seasons end, is this peace? 
Piece by piece, stone by stone 
What is beyond, what is below? 

This silence speaks a foreign tongue, a void, a prison, a tomb
Ashes and dust, angels hymn as the curtain falls
A final show, a last goodbye
This song speaks in a familiar tone, a portrait, a reflection, a last note
Piece by piece, stone by stone 
What is beyond, what is below? 
Beat by beat, step by step 
What is beyond, what is below? 

My body will be returned to earth
The circle closes, my prize is payed 
The seasons end, is this peace? 
Piece by piece, stone by stone 
What is beyond, what is below? 

Will I pay a coin in toll or wander the shores for a century or more? 
Are these gates concealing fire and smoke, or angels and gold? 
We always try to find answers of what we don’t know
We always try to find reason in what we don’t know

My body will be returned to earth
The circle closes, my prize is payed 
The seasons end, is this peace? 
Piece by piece, stone by stone 
What is beyond, what is below? 
My body will be returned to earth (I am a passenger upon rivers unknown)
The circle closes, my prize is payed (I am bound for a vortex with no shore)
The seasons end, is this peace? (What awaits this vessel at its final port?)
Piece by piece, stone by stone (A coin in hand)
What is beyond, what is below? (And nowhere to go)

Set Before Us,"A time of surplus, an age of unequal prosperity
When our obstacles disappear one by one (one by one) we create new 
We dwell in the past, drowning in what we cannot change 
Seeking redemption from ourselves 
Repeating our doubts in an endless cycle
Seeking redemption from ourselves 
A time of surplus

The only problem is where we go does not exist
The only problem is where we go does not exist  

We travel through space and time 
But going nowhere, ever stuck inside a loop
We seek refuge in shelters built by our own desperate hands
But they crumble and as the storm draws close

Sometimes we are at peace 
We feel like the world is ours for the taking 
Yet despair sets in as realization comes
That we are only prisoners in the eye of the storm 

Separate from yourself, you are not your thoughts 
Find strength in the present 
The only moment that matters 
You are not alone, thousand souls share cage
You are not alone (alone), some has broken out
Free from the chains of fear 
Seek knowledge from those who came before 

We travel through space and time 
But going nowhere, ever stuck inside a loop
We seek refuge in shelters built by our own desperate hands
But they crumble and as the storm draws close

It creeps closer, it creeps closer
It falls
You live your life and your mind lives another 
You live your life
It goes on, it’s not your fault
You live your life",The Eternal Fight,2018
Set Before Us,"Have you ever faced Everest or a white whale? 
A force so great that it drowns all hope, left to die on the shores of despair 
Try to make your way to open waters but the tides keep knocking you down 
Water in your lounges and the abyss below, sink or swim
Currents so unforgiving, harsh and strong
So, swim the best as you can, no one will help you, not a single soul
I have a mountain before me, but it will not stand in my way
The path before me is my own, sink or swim

No mountain, stick or stone will hold me back, no more 
No matter how unkind your words are they won’t face me, never again

Run as fast as you can or try to hide 
Escape is not the option because the tide is coming, flooding everything you hold dear

No one will help you try to fight the currents that are trying to hold you down (In my way)

Your secrets I can't keep inside.
You're suffocating all the good we see in you.
This is so hard to swallow, it's a bitter pill to take.
You are ruining what feels smaller than the rest
Of your troubles (so) let's move on,
It's been unspoken for so long.",Unconditional,2011
Set Your Goals,"So let's take this slow,
As if I should even be one to talk.
Constantly moving on all my luck.

So fast, like a rabbit, then getting stuck.
I cannot give up.
In a briar patch I knew I would meet you
But I'm stopped, not sure it's entirely true.

Deja vu of people that I knew already
And what I did to them…this is getting heavy,
And spinning me places that I wish I deserved to be.

I have to block it before my intuition deceives me.
I rocket back to the earth like an alien
Looking for blue-planet rays to become human.
I have a gift that tells of every curse,
So make a move for the exit.

But your laugh shakes me up and it makes me clean
Between an XM pop-rock takeover queen and
An old friend who left a spell,
Lifted every curse,
And made a move from the entrance.

So I'll get nervous one more time,
Watching hands (not mine) shaking 'maybe' signs,
Tying hair with a flare that's ready
To fly aboard civilian crimes.

They're knife-cutting all the lines.
I don't at all care why.
I'm staring like I've got a better idea.
I saw you scrambling numbers and
Highlighting fluorescent wit
With a study pen on airline standby trends.

Believe me, I see things.
Not crazy.
I've come clean, not wasting.
Not lazy, done chasing.

I knew you would be there but I couldn't believe it.
My friends know I'm out there to speak truths and take dares.

The cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together

'Cause I still miss someone

It's all because they're free

Seth Gueko,"Je suis venu vous rappez le blues d’un clown triste
Qu’a pas raté qu’l’avion comme Macauley Culckin
Qui veut que son passé soit remaquillé comme Kiss
Nique les lécheurs de croupes
Les commissariats de Paris détiennent la coupe des plus grands leveurs de coudes
Ex-meneurs de troupes, semeurs de troubles
Quand mes potes tombent de bécanes ma mère viens les recoudre
Ét ouais ma couille c’est au kegré qu’on va se restaurer
On est la jeunesse endiablée
On enfarine sans regret la jeunesse dorée
La mal-bouffe nous laisser avec brio une brioche
J’suis pas de ces mioches qu’on été voir Bambi au cinoche
Une vie violente, tu peux te manger une barre de fer dans le crâne
Comme taper des barres de rire au ventre
Trop macho pour avoir une femme gouvernante
Une chance sur deux d'avoir des billets recouvert d'encre

On rit pour masquer nos peines on est marqué par la haine
C’est l'asile à ciel ouvert, du poison dans les veines
Se faire du mal, à nous mêmes, c’est la nature humaine

J’rigole frère car à défaut de rire, je picole sévère
J’veux plus jamais que la haine pilote mes nerfs
On nous a lâché dans le tier-quar comme des p’tits Rotweillers
À renifler l'odeur d’la merde a être vif comme l'éclair
Ma mère c’est pas une caille mec c’est une Al quaïdette
Si tu me balances elle te découpe comme Simone Weber
Ça criquette à c't'heure ci plus besoin de revolver
Ton ennemi te renverses alors qu’il ya le petit bonhomme vert
Et même si j’suis expressif comme un rideau de fer
Les yeux d’un môme triste m'affaiblisse
Comme si j’étais atteins dee la maladie des os de verre
Je veux pas faire la une du journal du hard a la rubrique fait d'ovaire
Capiche? En gros me fait pas un gosse dans le dos, nan
Ou un avortement coup de part-choc allemand te sera offert
On a tous été par-choqué psychologiquement
Si la faucheuse m’a sur sa liste je change de nom chez le faussaire
À Noël on décorait pas le conifère
J’voyais ma mère dans son Rocking chair, abrutie au somnifère
Mais en somme, j’pouvais rien y faire

On rit pour masquer nos peines on est marqué par la haine
C’est l'asile à ciel ouvert, du poison dans les veines
Se faire du mal, à nous mêmes, c’est la nature humaine

Je rigole frère pour oublier que des truc me surine l'âme
Que pour des histoires de terrain y’a des grosses fusillades
Qu’une p’tite balle peut suffir à coucher un rugbyman
Qu’on reconnaîtra du meurtrier que son blouzon Furigan
Papapa! Batard!
Que mon pote et sa malette reviendront pas du Surinam
Que face au mal-être, se taper des barres est notre unique arme
Dur de se dire qu’on reverra plus Hicham
À cause d’un casque de becanne
Il est monté sur sa moto avec la classe de Beckham
Aujourd’hui le lieu du drame est recouvert de liasses de pétales
Allah ya larmou

On rit pour masquer nos peines on est marqué par la haine
C’est l'asile à ciel ouvert, du poison dans les veines
Se faire du mal, à nous-mêmes, c’est la nature humaine

Seth Gueko,"Approche, approche toi
Je vais te raconter l'histoire de Tonino

Totino, c'est la voix off des cas-sos
Des McGyver, du hebs qui s'font la sauce
Qui fabriquent seuls la chauffe
Avant lui aussi engraissaient les rats du patio
Aujourd'hui son chauffeur l'attend dans sa Murcielago
Il donne toujours a ceux qu'ont pas
Et sache qu'une Pellegrino
Ne fera pas digérer la délation d'un comparse
Et que c'est ton crane qu'il faut qu'on casse
Si t'as un compas dans l'oeil quand il s’agit de faire sa compta wow
Il bombarde, il déboule sur les boulevards d'paris
Armé, bourré comme les p’tits fils de Kadhafi
Il est friand d'évasions à la scie
Quand il sort avec sa cavalerie
C'est un défilé d'chez Cavalli
Il s'entraine à cavaler car en ce moment chez les keufs
Ils sont en train de serrer un max les lasc' et les keups
Mais y'a que Ya Rabbi qui lui fait reu-p
Il s'entraine a rer-ti sur les cannettes de 7'ups

Il a un gros Beretta, Totino la mafia
Il fume des Cohibas, Totino la mafia
Il boit que d'la vodka, Totino la mafia
Il mange que des pizzas, Totino la mafia
Il a l'cul entre deux mafias, Totino
Russia, Italia, Totino
Margarita, Zubrowska, Totino
Allez joue avec Totino la mafia

Il a les chargeurs garnis comme les bouquets d'fleurs d'Interflora
Fini la fête foraine
A c't'heure la il défouraille pour des bons au porteur
Il t'fera la bouche en coeur
Quand il s'offrira des nuits à l'hôtel Astoria
Sur la tête des chiots
Il aime trop les ppes-sa
Il jettera tout dans les ttes-chio
Si ça pue les re-shta
Ouais pépère le chat
Il déambule la noche
Déforme la haute couture avec son corps amoché
Jusqu'au resto il est filoché
Ses femmes cachent ses pistolets
Elles s'parfument pas chez Yves Rocher
T'es fou j'ai Van Cleef & Arpels
Il est à zeul' ma gueule
Il a les feuilles d'la Brinks dans larfeuille
La Rolex d'Augusto Pinochet
Ca fait sbwax des qu'ses plombs font des ricochets
Il pette l'éthylotest y'a aucun keuf qui le test
Dans son coffre y'a des kilos d'C
Mais ça qui le sait

Il a un gros Beretta, Totino la mafia
Il fume des Cohibas, Totino la mafia

Allez joue avec Totino la mafia

C'est un homme, un vrai
Avec son quota d'poiles sur l'torse
Tu seras son pote
Si tu sautes la salle du coffre
Totino a un rêve depuis tout mioche
Voir le banquier ligoté avec du scotch
Faut lui couper l'doigt pour prendre son louis d'or
Il est fagoté comme un milord
Son deuxième blaze c'est Igor
Personne sait où il dort, c'est un taulier
Il tringle toujours en criant ""Na zdrowie!""
Petite barbe au collier
Il laisse toujours des gouttes sur la cuvette
Si tu veux lui parler sors la calculette
Ca fait belle lurette qu'il fait des bracos d'bonhomme
Il paranoï il voit partout des chapeaux d'cowboy

Il a un gros Beretta, Totino la mafia

Totino n'existe pas
Qui n'aimerais pas être un parrain d'la mafia

Quand on était p'tits, les anciens nous envoyaient acheter des canettes
Aujourd'hui ils nous sucent la bite pour qu'on leur avance une galette
C'est la galère ouais, mais nique sa mère, on a l'feeling
Investir dans un calibre c'est mieux que d'faire d'l'haltérophilie
À la mairie, on leur a demandé un terrain d'foot
Ils ont refusé, on s'est mis à bicrave et on a ouvert un terrain d'chnouf

J'ai vendu la galette darwa, j'ai fini au Quai des Orfèvres

Seth Gueko,"2Pac attend que je meurs pour pouvoir faire un duo
Ma femme m'a offert un flingue, je lui offert un plumeau
Mon rap réchauffe les clodos et glace le sang des bobos
Tu rappes la street avec les doigts croisés dans le dos mytho
Nous on tire des traîneaux de blèmes-pro
Cette année je veux pas de cadeaux
Je veux juste une échelle assez grande pour tchek mes proches qui sont partis là-haut
Ouais décroche quand je t'appelle
Pti't narvalo de javel
Si t'es en enfer avant moi, prépare le Nespresso
J'ai de l'or entre les jambes et du plomb dans la cervelle
Écoute pas les petites putes qui veulent rapper comme Gueko
En léchant Julia Channel, t'as un peu sucer Rocco blaireau
Je suis la goutte d'eau qui fait déborder le string
Le couteau qui égorge les porcs, les skins
Maragwé, je me suis tatoué Seth Guex sur les mains
Je te rentre mon blaze dans le crâne à coups de poings, mon copain

Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec
Je veux mourir en paix comme ceux qu'on bu l'eau de la Mecque
Tu te fais des lignes de blanche avec ta carte black
T'as la main sur le cœur seulement pendant les crises cardiaques
Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec
Je veux mourir en paix comme ceux qu'on bu l'eau de la Mecque
Ils ont tous le barreau sur mon avocate
Tu te sens moins seul en cellule avec le Iphone 4

Y a que les perles rares qui nous rendent visite au parloir
C'est pour ça que je préfère les huîtres au caviar
Sorti du placard en limousine, désosse le corbillard
Et sabre le millésime
Les jeunes veulent rejoindre le crime organisé
Pas de piste pour l'ennemi juste un coup de chaussure ferré
En sape ou en rimes, le niveau est élevé
Le plan a carrément échouer
Avocat libre,on garde notre part d'ombre tout comme Karim Achoui
Frère, j'ai un plan en or
Je sors avec une bijoutière
Les flics froids, on les accueille avec un frigidaire
Si t'es mon frère, prouve le moi comme Cyril Khider
Mettez moi au quartier disciplinaire
C'est mort, je reste muet comme un cimetière

Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec
Je veux mourir en paix comme ceux qu'on bu l'eau de la Mecque

Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec
Je veux mourir en paix comme ceux qu'on bu l'eau de la Mecque
Ils ont tous le barreau sur mon avocate
Tu te sens moins seul en cellule avec le Iphone 4

Trop jaloux pour qu'elle voie un gynécologue homme
Pti't narvalo de Cologne
Si je veux t'effacer de ma vie, mon gun est ma gomme
Je fais mon trou lentement mais surement comme les Gog et Magog

Comme dit Axiom, mon argent a été blanchi
La coke et les amphét' circule dans les amphi'
On s'enfuit de-spee comme Valentino Rossi
Ligoter ce monsieur qu'ont violenté nos reu-soeu

On se ref'ra pas à 40 ans donc faut pas se louper
Si je fais des doigts sur les photos, y aura Fifou pour flouter
T'as un pipo entre les amygdales, tu penses qu'à flûter
Moi j'ai le cigare d'Hannibal et la tchatche a Futé

En tant que surveillant, les flics ratés postulent
Pas besoin de tank, on fait la guerre en costume
Les filles traquent les thunes et un joli mec
Mercedes, c'est notre bébé comme une migeli mec

Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec
Je veux mourir en paix comme ceux qu'on bu l'eau de la Mecque
Tu te fais des lignes de blanche avec ta carte black
T'as la main sur le cœur seulement pendant les crises cardiaques
Je rappe comme si je revenais de l'au-delà, mec

Attends j'te récapitule
Ça fait huit jours que j'tourne en rond dans une putain d'cellule
Jamais vu d'aussi près l'bitume
J'souhaite à personne le placard pendant la canicule
Ce putain de soleil, ces putains de grilles aux fenêtres
Sur mon lit j'fais bronzette, j'ressemble à une gaufrette
J'écris des lettres pour le coiffeur, pour la muscul'
La juge sait plus quoi faire pour que j'me sente minuscule
Mais bats les yeuks, on s'fait la causette de fenêtre à fenêtre
T'es pas content, on t'fait ta fête
La recette! deux, trois boîtes de thon dans une chaussette
Bracos, peu-stu, faux chèques: on est tous là pour chose-quelque
Même un chien voudrait pas d'la gamelle qu'on mange
Mon co' veut rouler son pét' et aussi démouler son cake

J'appelle Foued pas au phone-télé, nan par la fenêtre, j'ai eu la fouille ministériel
J'ai du le planquer, dahwa t'inquiète pas
Dans la maine-se je reprends une ce-pu et je me rebranche, nan
Il m'en faut 2 ouais, il me faut une puce Bouygues et une puce Orange
A cette heure ci, je me verrai bien en train de me habat dans un ranch
Woogataga, un petit verre de Vodka, avec un zeste d'orange
J'ai envie de faire du rodéo, une petite lehsa et que des coups de hanches
Mais trop souvent on m'a boycotter, je suis rancunier envers beaucoup de ens-g
Qu'ils aillent se faire enculer, la roue elle fait pas du sur place
On m'a dit, aide toi et le ciel t'aidera, dahwa c'est pour ça que je me surpasse
Je sais pas ce qui ce passe dans ma tête, je sais ce qui ce passe dans ma cité
Les petits, ils ont repris rrain-té donc les grands sont sur-exités
Quand la tension devient trop forte, les plombs ils sont obliger de sauter
Armé de mes cordes vocales, l'instru' j'étais en train de la ligoter
Si t'as pas de parloir soit débrouillard, obliger de traficoter
Quand t'es en plein coeur de la chose faut juste voir le bon côté
Quand on me pose la question, ""wesh You alors comment vont les zamours?""
Je réponds, ""ils vont bien, ils sont sur la 2, le sbah presque tous les jours""
Dites à Zemmour qu'il s'étonne pas que je contienne autant de haine en moi
J'observe que plus les années passent, plus elles se font rares les peines en moi
J'ai envie de faire beaucoup de hébètes, investir dans mon bled
Je kifferai rendre à bel Mohamed ce que jadis était à Mohamed
La charité faut que je l'ordonne bien donc je la commence par moi même
Les faux je leur donne rien si ce n'est un savon quand je suis au hammam
J'ai un fusil, je fais pas de K-1, je suis le genre de mec qui vend de la one
Dahwa moi je viens pas de l'usine crois moi, là-bas profite à oi-m

Je suis à l’hôtel, allongé dans ma room
La chatte à Sailor Moon, leur gagne pain c’est leur moule
Je suis en peignoir, j’attends l’arrivée de Maloum
Je me sers un Jacko, je me crois dans un saloon
Y’a pas glaçons? Je vais mettre une grande baffe dans la gueule du groom
Dans le Rap Game, y’a que des sucettes, comme dirait Loon
Devant la patrouille, pas un mot sort de ma glotte

Je sors de ma grotte un Glock sous la redingote
Ca traficote avec les Thaï, sous une paillotte
Ma pouffe dort comme une marmotte, à l’hôtel Mariott
Direction l’île Mayotte
Je crache ni dans la soupe, ni dans ton Yop
Je t’envoie tout dans les cheveux, comme du Vivelle Dop
Big up aux petits roufs, mes petits reufs qui te rendent ouf
Je suis bien dans mon tieks, dans une chatte, ou dans mes pantoufles
Le vent souffle, pour moi les MCs sont morts de trouille
Je connais un bled où tu baises contre un bol de nouilles
Défilé de punchlines, c’est de la haute coupure,
Mange pas la gamelle, dedans, ils mettent du bromure
Étincelant, comme un sourire avec 2 dents en or pur
Je rappe le dos au mur, ouais, petit joueur
Je vise le top of the world,
On fait des fausses fiches de paye, avec Windows Word
On met pas de baggy, on nique Eisenhower
T’es belle comme une fleur, je te fais une Golden Shower

On roule sur toi comme sur un ralentisseur
Je veux baiser maintenant, pas dans 10 heures
Achète l’album, l’écoute pas sur Deezer,
Ou on roule sur toi comme sur un ralentisseur
Tu suces mal comme un téléchargeur
A mon signal, videz les chargeurs
On roule sur toi comme sur un ralentisseur
Je veux baiser maintenant, pas dans 10 heures

Viens à Phuket si tu veux me régler à coups de batte

Ibuprofène et filles obscènes remplacent mes nuits de sommeil
Complètement saoul comme Ben l'Oncle
JE m'endors dans une chatte quelconque
Des lendemains de soirée différents, toujours la même honte
Trois-quarts des gens n'ont pas vraiment d'amour, ils calculent
Les grandes salopes traînent toujours avec les petites crapules
Quand je vois les commentaires sur le net, je rêve de dictature
Vous serez tous foutus dès que j'aurai mes cinq cents signatures
C'est pour mes adultes immatures, mes types qui mènent une vie de raclure
Mes smicards qui taffent dur, mes jeunes dépressifs qui saturent
Cinq heures du mat', plus de mélange, on finit le sky pur
Je déboîte, j'aurais dû sampler des bruits de fractures
T'as une voix de chiotte, va sampler des bruits de chasse d'eau

Je fais pas du rap français, je fais du rap de Français
Prochaine pochette je serai habillé en fermier
Sur mon père j'écoute le game, je suis ""mort de lol""
Je vais me tailler la queue en triangle, ils vont chier du Toblerone
Les petits de mon hall, ils ont les crocs comme des Australopithèque
Ils ont tagué ""Zdedededex"" sur leur cahier de textes au Tipp-Ex

J'ai du Clan Campbell pour combler mes cases vides
Paris me fatigue, je crois que je vais me remettre à fumer de la weed
Adolescent, je pensais me branler jusqu'à ce que j'aie de l'arthrite

Hommage a toutes les M.A.M.A.N
100 % vraie, 100 % naturelle
Je traite les femmes comme des princesses car je fût élever par une reine
Je me fous de faire pleurer la leur tant que je fais pas pleurer la mienne
Dès que je trouve pas un t-shirt directe elle le ramène
C'est pire qu'une magicienne, je fais un trou elle le raccommode
Dis le a personne, je cache même des trucs dans sa commode
J'irais pas jusqu'à braquer le podologue
Même si les clefs du paradis se cache sous les pieds de ma daronne
Elle squatte la fenêtre pire qu'une parabole

Pas de sacoche Lancel, ni de sacs LV
C'est tout pour ses enfants ouais c'est comme ça qu'elle vie
Elle t'aurait mis une lime dans le gâteau pour que tu scies tes barreaux
Pour elle la bande à Sarko c'est la race après le crapaud
Ouais c'est comme sa qu'elle dit
Pour elle tu l'insultes si tu lui offre un sac Fendi
Elle préférerait le revendre pour remplir le Frigo-gidaire
Cherche pas chérie, c'est elle la prioritaire

Mon plus belle exemple de dignité hé
Comment me faire pardonné, hé

Ma mère c'est ta mère
Si tu lui portes les se-cour
Elle t'ouvrira la porte de secours si les portes s'écourtent

C'est comme la mer, c'est la piscine à tout le monde

Le Machin dans l'ffre-co ou dans l'faux plafond
T'as l'caca collé au caleçon, t'es un gros blard-fon

Officiel, remballez vos Opinel, vos crans d'arrêt

Mec, j'ralentis puis capture
Des charmantes filles, des femmes mûres
C'est garanti sur facture

Dans l'répertoire des bolosses
Au nom d'Roberto Carlos
Parce que l'Machin c'est d'la frappe

On parle de sang, la police est sur les nerfs
Mon rap de franc-maçonnique est funéraire
Bombardement atomique et nucléaire
Montagne de blanche, narcotique c'est plus mes rêves
Machin est grave toxique

Never imagined I'd be

Want to be tempered, sick to be tested
To see it all clearly, whenever it's rested
Want every lesson, the lessons they teach me

Give me a season, show me some reason

Seth Lakeman,"Out of the moonlight in the month of May, 
This ship would take her last breath. 
Her full mast it was draping, 
Like a mermaid she was dressed. 

Her lonely heart is setting free, 
As all her cares they went sailing out to sea. 

And all those people they gathered round, 
And flocked to view that lovely sight. 
And all young maidens they came to town, 
They waved her out on through the night.

Her lonely heart is setting free, 
As all her cares they went sailing out to sea. 

She tried to clear the rocks with swelling 
Sails, 
The ocean beat her everytime, 
And with a crack her body failed. 
But the sea engulfed and filled her eyes. 

Her lonely heart is setting free, 
As all her cares they went sailing out to sea. 
I can hear her calling,I can hear her calling,
I can hear her calling back to me.

And when the news returned to the town, 
Well every maid sat on the pier, 
If lovers lost and fathers never found, 
For now that mermaid's dressed in tears. 

Her lonely heart is setting free,
As all our prayers they went sailing out to 
Sea. 
I can hear her calling,I can hear her calling,
I can hear her calling back to me,

Now that mermaid's dressed in tears,
I feel that mermaid's dressed in tears,
I see that mermaid's dressed in her tears.",Lady of the Sea (Hear Her Calling),
Seth Lakeman,"The day comes in, the girl walks out, 
Summer sings and Winter shouts. 
Seasons breaking over me, 
All I do is sit and dream. 

Before my face her picture hangs, 
A brighter image of this land. 
Step it up or speed me through, 
Come along and take me with you. 

April in your eyes 
I search through the sunshine, 
For April is your time, 
As the world passes by. 

Go out to meet, but stay within, 
I can see that beauty begin. 
The view is free, so much to see, 
The best of summers waiting with me. ",April Eyes,2002
Seth Lakeman,"Breathing sunshine from the flowers, 
A little wisdom from the leaves, 
Carry comfort to the sad tree, 
How the grass it did grieve, 

There's a moment we remember, 
Its a feeling we face, 
Take me down to that world of wonder, 
Into the Garden of Grace 

There's a tree of temptation, 
From the seed of despair, 
We know all our attentions, 
Are for the bodies we bare, 

Chorus 

It's a jungle to the gentle, 
It's a bed for the dead, 
It's a field full of reasons why 
All the soldiers have bled.

Recaptures my face, 
And that angel up from heaven high, 
Gave that Garden its' place

Seth Lakeman,"How much a tale you know is never told, 
How much of youth is growing old, 
How much a thought it will make you think, 
How much you made me get another drink. 

How much you lose you never spend it, 
How much you buy you never lend it, 
How much you risk you never help this, 
And you're straight back on me for another kiss. 

Mean, green eyes they never go, 
Mean, green eyes, but they said so. 
Mean, green eyes they never go, 
There's nothing to reveal. 

How much a fool he wises up, 
How much you talk you can't give it up. 
How much a thought it will make you think, 
How much you made me get another drink.

Seth Lakeman,"Show me a great place, 
And pick me that sweet taste, 
I've been so bitter and blinded, 
But done the best they say. 
And love will find my way. 

Lay me on old ground, 
Play me that soft sound, 
I fall from a tall tune, 
Into the best they say. 
Love will find my way. 

The image of love, it'll dig you out, 
And tunnel above to the heart-filled house. 
So tear down those walls and reach the day. 
The Image of love will lead the way. 

Show me your leisure, 
With a chest full of treasures. 
We'll go searching together 
Until we find our day. 
Love will find our way.

Seth Lakeman,"A maiden might be pure in grace and harmony, 
Problems arise, she'll be there to sacrifice 
And set the mind, as all our cares sail out to sea, 
Into the unknown, a favoured face you stand alone. 

May the colour of your dreams be good as gold, 
Painting pictures 'til that wish unfolds. 

It's all your world.... 
A maiden might be full of grace and harmony, 
When problems arise she should be there to sympathize. 
Set the mind free as all these cares sail out to sea, 
You're more than that friend, a coast to coast, an end to end. 

Chorus ",It's All Your World,2002
Seth Lakeman,"You, you should be sipped not drunk, 
You should be sailed not sunk. 
Take a look outside your window, 
A little look outside your window. 

You, are you a friend or foe, 
Are you the man I know? 
Get a look outside your window, 
Another look outside your window. 

I'll be seeking sunshine after rain, 
I'll be keeping comfort over pain, 
I'll be feeling freedom has that view to carry on, 
Do you want some? 

Go, look outside your window. 

You, are you all wet and wild, 
Have you a certain style? 
Take a look outside your window, 
A little look outside your window. 

You, you should be picked not punched, 
You should be sailed not sunk. 
Take a look outside your window, 
Another look outside your window.

Seth Lakeman,"It was Monday morning in heavy rain, 
When Josie went from our house, never back again, 
Out beyond the hillside where the cattle stand, 
With her recent lover holding her right hand. 

They both went out together in the Monday mist, 
She never saw it coming, waiting at his wrist, 
He struck her swiftly and she fell right down, 
Flowers grew around her a body never found. 

Whenever you`re walking out in the snow, 
Think of poor Josie all on her own, 
Wherever those flowers stand out unknown, 
Youll be steppin` on her gravestone. 

So tell me where is Josie and where`s she flown, 
You both went out together you`ve come back alone, 
You sit so sadly with a face so cold, 
You`re no more paler though than the life you stole.

Down that tunnel and shaft 
Working out my season. 
Oh how it better not last, 
By twenty my hearing, 
Oh had suffered those days, 
Blood upon the copper, 
Oh how I fade away. 

Working in the darkness day by day, 
With nothin` but the dreams to light my way. 

Nothin` but a short life,

Oh no money to save,

Oh how I fade away

If he see that angel with her love 
The bold knight above,

Our toils and our troubles our plot and our plan
We left our fair country, and all our friends and our homes
Across to the deserts wild and the mountains to roll

We traveled three weeks 'til we came to the platt
Set up our camp ahead of the pack
In just a moment low we heard a faint yell
Five hundred cavalry they were riding from hell

[Chorus:]
We fight for favor
We will fight for pride
And oh we will fight for favor
We will fight 'til they die

They made a bold dash came near to our train
Bullets fell around like showers of rain
With long rifles at hand we fed them hot lead
'Til many a brave warrior fell down, and around us lay dead

We travel by day but guard in the night
Across all those mountains so high in their might
Now in a green valley we live beside a clear old stream
Our journey now ended, thank god, in the land of our dreams

We will fight for pride
And oh we will fight for favor
We will fight for our lives",Fight for Favour,2004
Seth Lakeman,"Worthy of a friendship lying underneath a stone, 
He was a proper master, all of a ship his own. 
For houses and great land many gold in store, 
I know he`d spent the whole lot and would again I`m sure. 

The blackbirds are singing, 
At the breaking of the day, 
When poor old Henry Clark, 
Left and went away. 

For twenty years he scarcly slept upon a proper bed. 
Sleepin` with that faint heart inside a weary head, 
In the weeks he`d gaze out over Plymouth bay, 
To show off all those great girls when the boys are back one day.

Willingly I stole his face

Three times I struck him over his head 
It was my first murder, a blood soaken bed

We`ll guide this fair ship and sail towards the morn, 
Come on all alas, now here`s the master dear, 
I fear this deadly storm is coming to us near. 

We sailed from Plymouth Sound in a week or three, 
with not that far to go boys, some canons to retrieve. 
The night it grew much darker and the wind it came in strong, 
And it grew upon us lads and there was nothing to be done. 

The waves grew higher and broke upon our ship, 
Then poor old master`s taken with nothing left to grip, 
Drop the anchor downwards and throw him out a line, 
Poor old master`s overboard he be swalled by the tide.

Seth Lakeman,"The streams of lovely Nancy are divided in three parts, 
Where young men and maidens meet their long sweethearts, 
It is drinking of good liquor that has caused my heart to sing, 
And the noise in yonder village made the rocks ring. 

At the bottom of this mountain runs a river clear, 
A ship from the Indes did once anchor here, 
With her red flags a`flying and the beating of her drum, 
With sweet instruments of music and the firing of her gun. 

At the bottom of this mountain where the birds do fly, 
There is one amoungst them that flies so very high, 
If I had her in my arms near the diamond`s cold black land, 
How soon I`d secure her by the kindness of my hands.

Go write unto your love wherever she may lay, 
With her rosy lips entice me and her tongue she tells me no 
But the angels might direct us wherever we should go.",The Streamers,2004

All those people gathered round,
Flocked to view that lovely sight.

sails,
The ocean beat her everytime,
And with a crack her body failed.

Take no prisoners, take no rogues.

up and down.

Steal your soul away

And our wives along that pier
""Cheer up"", they said
""You'll soon return in half a year""

So we sailed up north to reach the ice
We took full sails
Each boat was manned with guns
And rope to hunt that whale

We know, that we're fighting
In this frost on our own
And we'll see no sound
Or sight of our homes

And our lovers will be
Waiting there till spring
It's a ramble and a race to be king
Race to be king

Now we've been sailing a league or three
Till we glimpsed that shore
The night was dark and won no hearts
So we stayed on board

There fired a shot along our deck
And down one side
And it cracked our mast and swept in fast

Was such a raging storm, no man could speak 
That lifeboat thundered through an angry sea 
Was called Solomon Browne and her company

On our heroes brave and bold
With courage, it was cold
On board that night 

Now the stricken coaster called the Union Star 
Her maiden voyage, she never thought that far
With Captain Moreton and his four man crew 
A woman to save and her daughters two 

Now, never had a lifeboat fought in vain 
She could have made a dash for port but she tried again 
All sixteen perished in that mighty wave 
It tossed them overboard into a watery grave 

With courage, it was called 
On our heroes brave and bold 
With courage, it was cold 
On board that night 

Now back at Penlee Point, time stood still 
Twelve young children cried for their fathers killed 
A nation shed tears for years as the news went round 
The constant courage of our Solomon Browne.

With courage, it was cold 
On board that night

Seth MacFarlane,"When you get all set 
To go into your big love scene
The night must be right
The mood be slow
The wine must be high
And the lights must be low

And I recommend some music in the background
For when you're fumbling for the right words to say
You'll find that music will go a long way

Music is better than words
You break the spell when you start to speak
That technique is all wrong
Just forget about words and sing her a song

Music was made for romance
Love and a sweet song go hand in glove 
Every lover knows this
And the sweeter the song, the sweeter the kiss

When you're without love you cry
And your song is the blues
But when you've got love you're high
And your song is a gay refrain
A happy strain that sings out the news
Don't let the night go to waste
Looking for ways to say 'I love you'
Take your cue from the birds

And father will be pacing the floor - listen to the fireplace roar

I wish I knew how - your eyes are like starlight now

I ought to say no, no, no sir - mind if I move in closer? 
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - what's the sense of hurting my pride?

Ah but it's cold outside - baby it's cold outside 

I simply must go - but baby it's cold outside

You've really been grand - I'm thrilled when you touch my hand

Still asleep in separate beds

Dizem até que nasceu lá

O Samba taí
O samba tá
Tá no sangue daquele que sabe sambar

Quando desceu lá do morro, compadre
Ele desceu numa boa
Manifestou emoção
O samba andou de avião
O samba andou de canoa

O samba pintou o sete
Com dama e valete
Sabe como é
O samba está na cabeça
E na palma da mão e na sola do pé

O Samba taí
O samba tá
Tá no sangue daquele que sabe sambar

Vou pedir pra São Jorge guerreiro
Que é meu padroeiro
Pra me abençoar
Tá no sangue daquele que sabe sambar

Vou pro samba de noite e de dia
A preta sabia antes de casar
Tá no sangue daquele que sabe sambar

(Ô, no sangue daquele, daquele, daquele que sabe sambar)

Tá no sangue daquele que sabe sambar

(Ô, no sangue daquele, daquele, daquele que sabe sambar)

Tá no sangue daquele que sabe sambar",O Samba Tai,2002

As nuvens queimam o ceu, nariz azul

Na lua o lado escuro e sempre igual
No espaco a solidao e tao normal

Viver bem
Estar bem, querer bem
Não é nada mau
Viver bem, estar bem é particular 

Ela sabe que eu quero, muito lhe espero
Mas agora o assunto é particular
Não acabou o amor, só o compromisso
Isto não é banal, está com um novo amor
E batalhou por isso, isto é muito pessoal.

Ela sabe que eu quero, quanto tempo o espero
Que desejo, me derreto com seu jeito de me olhar
Porque o seu amor já virou meu vício 
Eu posso até me dar mal
Por não ser seu amor, por não ter compromisso
Isto é particular.

Agora eu vou lhe dar uma dica, uma dica
O mundo é tão lindo
Ainda por cima tem eu te querendo, te querendo
Acordei pensando nisso

E o bom da vida é viver bem
Estar bem, querer bem
Deixa eu namorar

Last night I had a dream that was so real
I woke up in a cold sweat, it felt so ill
I stared into the face of an angel
Tainted by the city, you ain't from this place it'll change you
Walkin by, I thought I was sly
Offered to try, at first I thought she was shy
'Til I saw this guy at the bar talkin to her reckless
She ignored him, cast a glance in my direction, started dancin to my section
Her body flyer than a jet pilot
What a smile and the eyes like wet violets
They flutter by like the wings of the butterfly
Keep it tight, Eva Mendes in ""The Other Guys""
Got me in another zone they call her Sunshine like
""Put your mother on the phone, I ain't comin home""
Put a deposit on a place in her heart
All along she a place from the start

Man I fell in love, man I fell in love

Se você quiser colar com a gente, não tem nada não
A gente vai correndo junto nessa mesma união
Brasil o povo da mistura, raça, pé no chão
Objetividade na vontade de crescer

A feeling of panic engulfin the whole planet
Yet my words are slow dancin, my language is romantic
Vocabulary that's bustin your capillaries
My freedom'll taste sweeter than juices of blacker berries
My adversaries speak ill of my name, I'm so sick
Attack is very guerilla, my game is so pimp
Everything fall into place, it's gravitational
Profit stay in the black, the shade is so un-fadeable
Healthy relationship make your other ones better
I'm Lee Scratch Perry, they call me the upsetter
For the cheddar get the bread up
Mr. International call it the bruschetta, the spiritual newsletter
I wish you knew the arc of the story and knew your part
You're lookin into my heart or just lookin to be a part

Seun Kuti,"Cuando la percusión fluye
Tu cuerpo se construye y se destruye
Se caen los huesos, la piel se te estira
Todo lo que tiene ritmo respira
Todo tiene ritmo, todo se menea
Aunque seas paraplejico tu corazón bombea
Marcando el tiempo, un patrón de movimiento
Uso mis latidos como instrumento
Todo lo que suena lo siento
Aunque sea sordo lo siento
Hay que moverse, hay que asumir el rol
Como los planetas giran alrededor del sol
La misma órbita, diferente velocidad
Desafiando la ley de gravedad
El volumen de tu cuerpo dando un concierto
Como un huracán moviendo el viento

Todo se mueve, La tierra se mueve
Las piernas se mueven, el agua se mueve
El tiempo se mueve, la sangre se mueve
Cuando yo recito tu te mueves
Todo se mueve, La Tierra se mueve
Las piernas se mueven, el agua se mueve
El tiempo se mueve, la sangre se mueve
Cuando yo canto tu te mueves

El sonido baila aunque no lo veas
Sube y baja como la marea
Si te detienes el corazón se atora
Lo que no se mueve no se mejora
Se enferma y se queda quieto
No se reproduce, envejece sin nietos
Por eso no hay excusa para el que no menea
Si no tienes cuerpo menea las ideas
Por dios menea lo que sea
Si no felacuti te va a dar con la correa
No te justifiques, no quiero quejas
Si te aburres solo pues busca una pareja
Lo mio con lo tuyo rima
Como Peru rima con Lima
Baila con todo lo que te rodea
Cuerpo con cuerpo como si fuera una pelea
Nuestra movida violenta mete matadora
Judo, lambada, patadas voladoras
Tirame con todo pero que sea ahora

Las piernas se mueven, el agua se mueve

Qué es lo que el negro tiene de blanco

Y los mataron, de un palo los ahorcaron

Qué es lo que tiene
El manco de blanco

El negro de manco

Pa’ llegar al congo yo me guió por el corazon del sol donde no hace frío

Que desemboca en la sangre pura  que pinta el paisaje una dictadura

See what we got to do is learn to make a change
Stop being plain, use your brain cut through the chains
Believe in consequence, regain confidence
Live your life saying there ain't no stopping this
Now a good example of what that did to me
Look in my eyes tell me what do you see
Envy, punk. Yeah, that's right
Instead of using fists, we use mic's to fight
See now Phil and me,
We're gonna break it down for you people
Just to show you that we're equal and evil
Sit back relax, it's just a game
You're about to find out the true meaning of fame
So get your SM58 instead of a 9MM (Double M)
Plug that shit up, and let the games begin

And when you look around,
Tell me what you've found

You talk all that shit, who's on top
You think this ain't no thing
Don't let me get you in the ring
Yeah, but see when you go for yours bro
I'm just gonna choke that throat

Never getting called back again

'Cause what you say, don't mean shit
I guess that's what it takes to make a
Hit, boom bip, and now the script is flipped

The record skips, ignite like propane
You better take that ass to the store for Rogaine
Oh and on that tip, what's even sadder

So I paid my dues, I took the time that it takes
Freestyle separates the truths from the fakes
And that's the breaks
It takes time to get your game
25 years I'm finally breaking out the frame
And out the frame so simple and plain
Reminisce the place from where we came
Went through so many phases
That it amazes me so
From single to Double A 
And now we're playing the Pro's
Touring in the van thinking these are the days
Having nationwide dreams,
Tour buses, and getting paid
So we're thinking while we're drinking
About the choices we made
And the road that we paved for,
Love that needs to stay

When will I ever see,
That face looking back at me
We spend our time alone, don't you know
It's getting hard to breathe

And all the memories I look back on
Still accomplish nothing at all
And all the dreams & happiness 
Were shared between a man
And his woman of gold

No longer can I touch your
Face again will I ever be
Able to feel your skin from under

Neath the ground I reach out
I try to pull you in
But over & over again 
I swear I see that face
Looking back at me again",When,2002

Throw your hands in the air

Well I would cry tears 
But they stopped falling long ago 
Back when my visions and dreams 
Reportedly did not show, so 
I cannot be the sympathetic soul 
That you are searching for 
But best believe that when you leave 
You'll hear the slamming of the door 
Yeah I'm alright, 
Cause I'm not perfect like you 
And if you had a clue 
You'd know my mental stays true

And do it right, right now (Right now)

Oh, right now!
It's what's happening
Right here and now

Tell me, what are ya waitin' for?

Sev Statik,"When the moon shines at noontime, and the sun blazes at midnight
Dark and Night coincide, I stay inside and keep the lid tight
Catch side of the morning that passes by through my window
Another child is born, another dies, and still the wind blows
Spin slow, drawn into strong voice of reason
Standing there in soul thinking of summer ?
Just longin' for another season
For no particular Reason hear I stand-
Just rocked another show, just can't remember where I am
And my families far from here, but the stars are bright this evening
On this morning on this afternoon, just got here now I'm leaving
And I shall remember the marble just as clear as I do yesterday
Never dance with the Devil, 'cause I can't afford the hell to pay
When I blast through your speakers every time your pressing play
When I fish the phonograph so we could set the record straight
Dear god I pray-
Just let me show this world a better way
How you helped through to your heart and all the times you fade away
I get to, say these words and speak my piece to Catholic Crowds
Not certain if it's Day or Night but I know the time is NOW
And if we ever lose the purpose as a prelude to the sound
Lets just call it a Day, and burn my empires to the ground...

Ya, amazingly, Cask of Amanciatto
Cracks wide open and vibrates your bravado
So I escape, body-bagging, like I'm kinda like Monte Christo
World Tour, DL, Koffeshop, and I'm coming to your Bistro
We show bright when it comes to your ability
I'll be yellin' out homonyms 'cause I dwell in possibility
We gonna call it a Day, 'cause I know your feelin' me
Listener, Rapper, Popuri of Life- all synonyms of Cornucopia
I'm so glad you have a wife- In this wolf eat samurai world
You better grab your swords and saw your nads off
You'll get chopped off by the needle as it spins over to my rhyme, yo.
Rap Music guys have a self-title: artist to life
Please think twice before you say your things in the microphone
I might not be, but I take it seriously
When you really listen to the words, an your not just hearing me...

[Chorus]
Day and night
Wrong or right
Spill our guts with every breath on the mike
And hope you call it tight
If it's blind give it sight
If it's Dark make it Light
Some call it Music
Deepspace calls it Life

Workin' it out (out), placin' my feet to concrete
Hittin' the street with vengeance, steangence, so sweet
What bitter we consider every circle we pass
Probl'why the reason that I reason with class, so step fast
We pushed and finally pushed that was burnin' staying determined
And yearnin' 'cause the lessons we learnin' were life long (life long)
Its my song, I place to erase
And transpose all these average Joes
With weak flows-
Who knows not, -
The true livin' roles who ascended, blended
With the beat, compete, and apprehended
Today's feelin' all right, color all right
 Being blocked by the shotgun and pray every day and night
Now I've gone a full day without some wackness heard
The One's speakin' absurd-
Are finally heeding my word.   (ya right)
And now I'm left with nothing else to say
That be the Night that I Called it A Day (Called it a Day)

I'm gonna throw thoughts to a page
Let 'em fall where they please
Let 'em rise to the sky, rain down, on four seas
An ocean of possibilities that dwellin'
Yellin' at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon
A nocturnal being of love since the grown of time
Watch the sunrise with both my daughter's eyes
Permanent Shine, refine my reflection inside
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, and all glory given back to God

It was the Night that 24 turned into 12
Had to adjust my spiral off, from the top of the shelf
On the blank page, using the utensil of potential
I'm diggin' in my Brain so I could Rip the Instrumental
With 20 bars left, and I'm consistent from the intro
Lighting candle sticks, as the rain hits my window
Need to focus in, take the topic and let it flow
Got 8 down for the count and 16 to go
The Writer's blocks are stepping stones
Towards the metronome
I'm racing dead last
I'm head last
Placed on my prose
Nocturnal with my journal, a wordplay professor
The aggressor, resembling soda cans under pressure
I'm shakin' but not stirred, deterrent from my train of think
Now I'm aligned, readjusted to infuse the ink
I want to handcuff the hands of time
No great spirit here allotted for here's the sunshine...

[Chorus]

Bet I'm casting nets and dreads
The deep blue ways are wet?????
God's Silhouette, I want to palettes painted pink by suns and sets
BURNT from a long days work, but feelin' fine
Tip his cap and path the moon on his back, his day declines
Candlelight Switch as you slip into the evening
A courtesy to the sun, as it dips below the ceiling
Feeling sort of satellite, like the wind beneath my wings
Or the tightrope, or gravity keeps lunar kites on orbit strings
Man on the moonlight, dream before my time
Like the moon reflects the sun, I make the black begin to shine
Like the moon rewinds the waters, makes the ocean recline
I collapse your mind; I'm Syntax, but melancholy kind
Redefine the best, framed fresh in terms of holiness
Bless the mike, device, 'cause I get nice to keep the conscious
And I split tense mint's spit words like sentence fragments
Moon dust the must 'cause I ain't' in it for the cabbage
The incandescent presence spins, as I'm your present flame
But my name would flicker out my name syntax the wax and wane
For the name above names, I'm so glad that Christ came
The black bird bright the night, we called it a Day...

Shadows step on the one, on, under every tongue, run
Spoken sentence frags., spoken on shattered breaks
It's a black hole soul with my faith as I take

Break Minutes back with father time to coordinate seconds
I surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon

Villain threatened to sweat the syndrome of the wicked
Heading for your Auditory where the Listener would stick it

Fiction, we're steel, when it breaks from the construction
Crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption

Sunrays, like a score with notes my surfacing
Great mad at meteors or record the all heed

And when the, Sun Sets
Some one lets the mike down
We pipe down, unplug it and leave it hide down
But not before we retire the pen
'cause yo tomorrow we'll be back just to do it again

Uh, shackled and scarred
I still maintain my praise of dark days
A sullen world covered in pain
So from Dusk 'till Dawn, I represent his word
Deepspace 5: set to serve
We travel in this land of the lost and we understand
We battle with the possible chance you take the cross
On your block, in your speakers Dudes is paid
We out for a change, in The Night We Called it a Day...",The Night We Called It a Day,2002

Back when we first met

Yo, yo, I'm 'bout to tell you what I like

I'm with five individuals, they say we not original
We all started underground like Digital
Now the haters lookin' pitiful, we humble and un-spittable
But lyrical, we still sh-sh-shit on you

I got a number two, Nelly got her number too
We call a tip, girl, you prolly call it a switch-a-roo
We be at Amoco, D's on that cantaloupe
Wit my folk's pocket full of bread and toast

In my Timb's and coat, do it big in the winter time
Prolly full of Air Force Ones up outta Finish Line
And I call myself normal, casual or formal
I still be blank like a carnival

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy

You see I'm young with information, I don't play like Station
'cause it took education, dedication and patience
To get a record deal, fo' real, this ain't no fluke
To you, we like a fat dude playin' a flute

Like my granny do in the troop instead of the James Brown
Look at all these boys reppin' the same town
Come from the same moms and owe dues
Aunties and uncles, man, they went to the same school, yeah

St. Louis ain't that big
Ayyo, we stay on the hill and steal a 30 ball to get to the crib
And I can do it on a quarter tank, a quarter of dank
It's ya home, wake up and maybe go to the bank

And I think you people need to open up like mail
If you can't tell Skool Boy, normal as hell
So don't let the TVs confuse you
'cause if you didn't knew, now you knew

Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy

I ain't different from those that think I'm different
Still enjoy fat checks overtime, I'm just like you
I ain't changin' for nobody, mixin' up your talent wit yo hobby
End up wit no jobby

I guess you got personal problems
The bigger you are, they start openin' up ya personal closet
A Ram 150, man, still couldn't dodge it, dislodge it
Take advantage derrty, live off ya profits

You right, I ain't ya average lil' dude
We had the number one song when I was still in school
Shoot, I can say it though, I'm glad that we made it mo
No neva bein' in class, song pop up on the radio

And it's a beautiful thang
To turn street money to legal money and beautiful change
Yo, I gotta use my beautiful brain
And understand when I'm sprinklin', man, in my rain

He's a regular guy

I can't deny

That it makes you want to die

Put your Savior on the throne

When you feel so dead inside 
It's hard to see what you've been given 
It's hard to find the hope in life

Quand on était p'tits, les anciens nous envoyaient acheter des canettes
Aujourd'hui ils nous sucent la bite pour qu'on leur avance une galette

Investir dans un calibre c'est mieux que d'faire d'l'haltérophilie
À la mairie, on leur a demandé un terrain d'foot

Ich singe als Antwort im Dunkel mein Lied

Ein bisschen Frieden, ein bisschen Freude,
Ein bisschen Wärme, das wünsch' ich mir.

Und dass die Menschen nicht so oft weinen.
Ein bisschen Frieden, ein bisschen Liebe,
Dass ich die Hoffnung nie mehr verlier .

Ich weiß, meine Lieder, die ändern nich' viel.
Ich bin nur ein Mädchen, das sagt, was es fühlt.
Allein bin ich hilflos, ein Vogel im Wind,

I'm Murphy Lee and I'm Zee Lee, yo
And I'ma muthasuckin' L you N A T I see, say what?
Yo and I'm here, 'cause I'm here
Yo, plus I'm here, cause I'm here
Yo, yo, I'm 'bout to tell you what I like

I'm with five individuals, they say we not original
We all started underground like Digital
Now the haters lookin' pitiful, we humble and un-spittable
But lyrical, we still sh-sh-shit on you

I got a number two, Nelly got her number too
We call a tip, girl, you prolly call it a switch-a-roo
We be at Amoco, D's on that cantaloupe
Wit my folk's pocket full of bread and toast

In my Timb's and coat, do it big in the winter time
Prolly full of Air Force Ones up outta Finish Line
And I call myself normal, casual or formal
I still be blank like a carnival

But y'all won't let me be or see
'cause I'm so D F that I'm considered a G
I be H I off J's, K's and L's
Um, M, N, to the O's, they can't tell

He's a regular guy
(I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy

You see I'm young with information, I don't play like Station
'cause it took education, dedication and patience
To get a record deal, fo' real, this ain't no fluke
To you, we like a fat dude playin' a flute

Like my granny do in the troop instead of the James Brown
Look at all these boys reppin' the same town
Come from the same moms and owe dues
Aunties and uncles, man, they went to the same school, yeah

St. Louis ain't that big
Ayyo, we stay on the hill and steal a 30 ball to get to the crib
And I can do it on a quarter tank, a quarter of dank
It's ya home, wake up and maybe go to the bank

And I think you people need to open up like mail
If you can't tell Skool Boy, normal as hell
So don't let the TVs confuse you
'cause if you didn't knew, now you knew

He's a regular guy
(Ya, I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy
(Yo, I'm just like you)

I ain't different from those that think I'm different
Still enjoy fat checks overtime, I'm just like you
I ain't changin' for nobody, mixin' up your talent wit yo hobby
End up wit no jobby

I guess you got personal problems
The bigger you are, they start openin' up ya personal closet
A Ram 150, man, still couldn't dodge it, dislodge it
Take advantage derrty, live off ya profits

You right, I ain't ya average lil' dude
We had the number one song when I was still in school
Shoot, I can say it though, I'm glad that we made it mo
No neva bein' in class, song pop up on the radio

And it's a beautiful thang
To turn street money to legal money and beautiful change
Yo, I gotta use my beautiful brain
And understand when I'm sprinklin', man, in my rain

He's a regular guy
(I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(Yo, I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'

Les balles qu'on tire, wallah, viennent du Caucase
La fumée s'propage comme des phéromones
Starfoullah l'héritage qu'on a offert aux mômes
Avec classe, on s'échappe par l'vasistas
Face au fisc on balise pas
Vu qu'à la douane les valises passent

Ou qu'ça tire à blanc dans la galerie marchande

C'est Giorgio Moroder

Sur moi, ne lé-par pas
Car chez nous la trahison ne se répare pas
On prend les sens interdits
T'rentre dedans comme la vachette d'Intervilles
Crois pas qu'chez nous c'est fantastique
À mettre la cagoule, les gants en plastique
Les 'tasses de tess', c'est pas ma tasse de thé

Quand on était p'tits, les anciens nous envoyaient acheter des canettes
Aujourd'hui ils nous sucent la bite pour qu'on leur avance une galette
C'est la galère ouais, mais nique sa mère, on a l'feeling
Investir dans un calibre c'est mieux que d'faire d'l'haltérophilie
À la mairie, on leur a demandé un terrain d'foot
Ils ont refusé, on s'est mis à bicrave et on a ouvert un terrain d'chnouf
Bouffe pas la galette des rois, tu trouveras pas la fève
J'ai vendu la galette darwa, j'ai fini au Quai des Orfèvres

Laissez passer les têtes de cabochards
Enfouraillés au 79, rue Quentin Bauchart
Donne toujours une pièce quand tu rencontres un clochard

En bon couche-tard, j'ai la gueule du Capitaine Caverne

Everything else is bent and broken
I would still be there for you
The twilight of the love I cheated
Forget everything that I thought I needed
I still remember this

I shut my doors to you
And you still got through to me
Did you give up everything
Just to find there was nothing left

Well you seem to disappear
The closer that we got
Did I do the vanishing
Pr did you just swallow me up

Making plans for some new scene
I'm always lost in some far off land
Looking for a deeper shade of Green
But Jamie doesn't mind at all
She likes it that way

Well, I've been thinkin', and I've been drinkin'
And I still cannot find a better place to come home to
It drives me crazy, all these maybes
But still you're on the way I always come running back to

Seven Nations,"Crooked Jack
(Traditional; arranged by Seven Nations)

Come on Irishmen both young and old
With adventure in your soul
There are better ways to spend your days
Then by working down a hole

I was tall and true all of 6 foot 2
Til they broke me across my back
By a name I'm known that is not my own
For they call me crooked Jack

And I curse the day I went away
To work on those hydro dams
All our sweat and tears our hopes and fears
Bound up with shuttering jams

For I've seen men old before their time
Their faces worn and gray
But I never thought that I myself
Would soon be the self same way

And they say that honest toil is good
For the body and the soul
But I'll tell you boys it's for sweat and blood
That they want you down the hole

That's the way it should be
He's floating 'round the day 
Won't come down no way 
No reason 
And I found out today

It seems my eyes are growing tired of staring in the light 
The more I see, the more I feel, the less I want to know 
Because if you think to much you'll blow your mind 

You might just lose control and scream 
I walk the line ahead of me my eyes fixed to the ground 
I hear a voice that calls to me I don't dare make a sound 
You can see the hate you can taste the anger 
You can hold it in your hands 
I could take a knife and split it open but still I wouldn't understand 

And I scream from the earth 
I scream at the sky 
And I scream for all I'm worth

Believe in life 
I hope you're coming soon

Is there anything I can do

Seven Places,"Jesus Christ our Savior who is the propitiation, the satisfaction if you would, for our sins, and not just for our sins, but for the sins of the whole world. The blood of Jesus Christ flowed from seven places. The first place He bleed from, the blood that poured from His head that day. The blood from the thorns in His skull cleanse you from thoughts, the blood that was on His face He has covered the things that you may not want to face up to because of what you've seen or heard. Know this, the blood fl owed for you. ""Yeah, but Jon, you just don't know I've backed away from the Lord, I've turned my back on him."" Well they took a flagellum and they beat His back and blood flowed from His back, it reduced to hamburger meat that day, His back was beaten so brutally. And if you've turned your back on Him and walked away from Him, know this, the blood, the blood that poured from His back, cleanses you sprinkles you. ""Yeah but Jon, you just don't know what I've done with these hands."" Those hands were pierced, those hands were pinned to the tree, spikes driven through those hands where He bled to cleanse you and cleanse me from the stuff that we've handled that we ought not to have handled, the stuff that we've done that we ought not to have done. Hey, understand, the blood flowed from His hand. ""Yeah but it's stuff that's inside of me Jon, It's just things that I feel in my gut, I have bitterness towards them, and I'm angry with her."" Jesus wants you to know that blood flowed from His side when they thrust th at spear into Him when He hung on the cross. ""Feet that walked where I ought not to have walked."" Blood flowed from His feet too, when the spike pinned Him through the feet, to the cross of calvary. And now I realize things that I can't face up to, thoughts that I've had that are not right, not good, not true, bitterness inside of me, stuff I've touched that I ought not to touch, places I've gone where I ought not to have walked. And I look and I realize the seven-fold flowing of the blood of Christ clean ses me in every area from all sin and I'm free, and I'm forgiven, by the blood. What can wash away my sin, nothing but the blood of Jesus. Seven times perfection, Seven places, that's what He went through, for me and for you.",Awakening,2003

Seven Witches,"How many times must I go through this pain?
So Many loved one slost with nothing gained
Sometimes I feel like I can't go on
Where do we go when we move to the great beyond?
It really seems so hard today
Don't think I can keep going on this way
So Many things that remind me of you
Please tell me what is there left for me to do?

I know that someone must feel the same
This cold hard emptiness drives me insane
I always feel as if something's wrong
These feelings I have are really much too strong
Sometimes I don't know what to say
It weighs too heavy now - it kills my brain
So Many times that I think of you
Please help me do what I need to do

So Many fears so much pain
So many tears who is to blame?
Out of my mind thinking of you
Why must we die what can I do?

Don't fear it today
I'm looking for the answer

Seven Witches,"Deep within the oceans depths lies a sight
you must behold
Time and time again the tale is told
A super race of human kind light years beyond us all
then disaster made the greatest city fall

See them racing towards the end
For them the sun son't shine again

Once this place was paradise before the great flood came
Man and beast in harmony the same
Waters edge now rises high, the time to flee is here
All their lives it's what they've learned to fear

Oceans of time will call into the night sky dying
Now hear the spirits cry, the great Atlantis rising
Oceans of time will fall into the black depths crying
Now feel the spirits fly - the great Atlantis rising!

Many seek the city lost to see if it was true
Not just some bedtime tale once told to you
A massive grave beneath the sea is all that now remains
An Atlantean escape was made that day

See Atlantis rising
See Atlantis rising
See Atlantis rising - rising!",Atlantis,2006
Seven Witches,"Where is it that our souls are laid to rest? Is there life
after death, an afterlife, where we reunite with our
family and friends? Do we go to a place far better
than where we are now? Do we meet the One who
created the flesh and bone that was to become each
and every one of of us, the One who breathed life into
veins? Do we live in peace with the ones we love and
the ones who love us? These are the questions we ask
ourselves. We pray that these beliefs become truths,
and that we may finally know...",The Question,2006

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love's never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise. 

Hey there
You on that high-flying cloud 
Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday she'll come to you. 

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She's got you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care 

Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear?
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all going in one ear
And out the other?

And touched him
Then lost him, somehow

Until she came between

At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

Sevendust,"I'll stay right here
With all these familiar faces
And shutout everyone else
From the world we created
Instead of becoming the sick and twisted
I'll lose myself in a song again

[Chorus]
There's nothing wrong
In being far from right
Another skeleton song
Stuck in my head all night
And there's something wrong
When everything goes right
Another skeleton song
Will save my life tonight

Was it that hard, to open the door for faith
When everyone feels the same
A different face but on the same page
We don't need something
That hurts more than nothing
So I lose myself in a song again

[Chorus]

So I try my best to see how you can relate to so much grief
Never stop forgetting why it is you came here
For awhile it seems to be, 
It's all you ever think and sleep
Just reach back for me, I'll find another place to go",Skeleton Song,2003
Sevendust,"Hate all the blood on my hands
And the sins that bleed from my soul
Take it all away make it go away

The last one to know

[Chorus]
Fade into a dream
Try and save me from myself now
Save me from myself now
Fallen from the world
If I could ever breath in the
Air maybe then I wouldn't suffocate

Face all the things that were
Real to me long ago to save my
Name I never thought it would
Be such a long way to fall

Sends me chills now

I'm lonely scared to be lonely
Thought until death meant
My fears were safe within now they begin
To be lonely scared of the only
Thing I knew best so I thought I knew everything
Until now I see I'm lost and lonely
Shatters everything in my head consumes me
Blinded by one thing obsessed with the need to be loved
Screams become whispers instead assuming
I know I'm losing all the things closest to me
I'm lonely scared to be lonely
Thought until death meant
My fears were safe within
Now they begin to be lonely
Scared of the only thing I knew best
So I thought I knew everything
Until now I see I'm lost and lonely
Angels swirl around me
So now I know I'm not alone
Only scared to be lonely

I'm stuck on this road and life just keeps passing me by
What can I do to get from beyond these walls that are laughing at me?
Sentenced to life and the prison is in my mind.

Losing my mind and pushed to the acts,
Someone stop me from running away.
Losing my mind and pushed to the acts,
Someone stop me from running away.

Followed my feet to nowhere again, think that I'm going insane.
Searching for peace by the outcome is always the same.
I wanna believe that I'm here for something
More than just taking up space.
Running away cause I just can't deal with this pain...

Never really knew me

Have I hated who I was
Lost sight of what defines me
‘Cause of airbrush magazines

But now I’ve come
To cherish who I am
Sick and tired of faking
A life that wasn’t mine

And I hope they see
Instead of following

Finally awake

Ain't nothing but the clothes going down
I'm in the game and the fires the same
My music is infinite like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses
And I'm still coming off like this my first here

I hope you giving head today
'Cause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Baby we gon celebrate (Celebration)
You bring all your girls and I'mma bring my crew
(Let me be the one you take home at the end of the night babe)
Let me be the one (I only want you to myself babe)
Let me be the one (But you know I'm always open to suggestions)
Let me be the one (Down for you, should never be a question babe)
To blow your mind

Don't waste my time baby
To blow your mind

Now DJ Quik got a bitch from the Bay
Say she wanna fuck his lil homie, got her sipping on that Alize
You ever had your dick sucked to Mausberg before?
And had a Mossberg pump leaning on the front door?
Treat my dick a newborn, hold the head
I told a bitch ""Pimpin' ain't dead, hoes are scared
So stop that bickering,"" I got a bitch from the
Nickersons that got a fucking bounty on my head, uh ho

I'm rhyming with Chuck Taylor too, he doing something new
Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady, go on and work those hips
Like them inmates work those divs
And when I get there baby work your lips
If it don't make Dollars don't holler
It's DJ Quik in any year Impala
And if it don't make Sense then don't flinch
What you hear from a bull that don't chew no grass? No shit

I hope you giving head today

And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Ahh!
Nikki!
Oh

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind

Nikki wasn't there

Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Du coup nos adversaires veulent qu'on se taise
L'ange de la mort, lui, ne passe pas de coups de fils
Pour être rongé par les vers, akhi, y a pas de profil

J'veux pas griller comme les cigares que les patrons fument

C'est avec des missiles que les chefs d'état font taire
Les prières des victimes qu'elles prononcent une fois le front à terre
Sachant que la patience et la réussite font pair

J'me fais chier comme un gosse dans une galerie d'art
Et j'ai l'impression qu'on me l'a mise comme un afro-cainri d'Harlem
Je mettrais bien la boulette comme devant un feu orange
Je gagnerais bien quelques sous histoire de faire plaiz' un peu aux rent-p's
Des fois, j'aimerais être quelqu'un d'autre
J'aimerais être un pieux qui se contente d'eau et quelques dattes (Je te jure)
Ma vie m'fait peur, j'sais ce qu'il y a après la mort
J'veux pas m'faire défoncer comme les cain-ris à Pearl Harbor
Ici c'est pas les chats qui te-mon sur les gouttières
Mais les petits cambrioleurs, j'les entends rire d'leur coup d'hier
Je les ai même vus ser-po dans le Noctant
Petite bouteille en plastique mais crois même pas que c'est de l'eau dedans
Et ça c'est rien, y'a bien pire chez les filles du seize
Certaines ont plus de conquêtes que les femmes qui vivent du sexe
Il se passe trop de choses, heureusement je sais pas tout
Mais je serais pas dans la merde si le Diable n'avait pas chié partout

J'ai peur que mes actions soient celles des gens de l'enfer
La clef du paradis se trouve pas dans un sac Lancel
Lointaine est l'époque où les homos se maquaient en scred'
Maintenant se galochent en ville avec des sappes arc-en-ciel
Mais vas-y, bouge (Vas-y bouge), toutes ces pratiques ne sont pas saines
Nos corps seront qu'un tas de cendres, la mort sera qu'un passerelle
Ma mémoire s'est fait plomber par une armée de gros bédos
Sans son stard-co, Sarko ressemble à un camé de Soweto
J'ai la dalle d'un Haïtien qui cherche à se barrer de son ghetto
Mais trouve aucune issue à part qu'il a raison d'être pauvre
Car ceux qui se trouvent dans des palaces remercient peu, ne rendent pas grâce
À leur Seigneur, sont des sales races, ils font tout pour que les liasses s'amassent
Changer le monde est impossible comme taper le foot les os rompus
Je désespère encore plus quand je vois que les frères sont corrompus
Les tentations sont nocives mais on fait semblant de pas le savoir
Quand l'Homme bâtit sa maison sur ses passions que sur son savoir

Les prières des victimes qu'elles prononcent une fois le front à terre
Sachant que la patience et la réussite font pair

A mon avis, je serai pas trop regretté quand je m'en irai
Tout comme les violeurs à la Guy-Georges ou Fourniret
Poto, ça part en litres, dans le ghetto les parents flippent
Les parrains se tuent pour le titre, moi j'vadrouille sur quelques sites
Hé, ça c'est du lourd, ça ressemble à oim et mon petit reuf
Bientôt, je serai banalisé comme les tournois de la Coupe d'Europe
Renoi, on nous a dit ""Demeurez dans ces taudis
Où la lumière a dormi"", l'obscurité nous a tout dit
Tendu quand on avance pour rentrer, c'est sous défonce
Go quer-ni le voisin d'en face pour éviter les dé-con ou quoi
Je m'ennuie dans ce monde, je me rabats ça fait des semaines
Qu'on en parle, ça fait des oi-ms, viens pas me voir quand je suis dans ce mode
Putain, à part les vrais, les Marega, les reufrès

Que pour les hassanats il faut pas trop d'absences
Que toute la vente de coke au fond là n'a pas de sens
Qu'on est pas con, qu'on est pas contre, la peine
Ah mais par contre t'as compris que les patrons saoulent
Que nous tâtons le sol, qu'on veut tous des fleurs sur nos balcons
Quoiqu'on vise on échoue, car pour la gloire faut du flouz
Quand un des nôtres monte on l'étouffe à croire qu'les kainfr on est fous
Qu'on veut des cris et des coups, on est grillés du coup
On veut des femmes et de tout, ça donne des camés et des mecs saouls
C'est pour les mecs qui prennent des claques et tombent
Tous les cœurs vides que seuls les quartiers comblent
Toutes ces mains sales, à la rue servent d'éponges
Et sur 10 mecs au bord d'la merde y en a un quart qui plonge
On est séduits par la night, séduits par la maille, c'est dur
Car c'est dur tah la marque et que le manque de graille t'éduque

J'ai l'truc qui choque comme un tocard sur l'périph
Comme être accusé de viol, faire de la garde av' pour vérif'
Comme un mec qui a vu sa vie défiler lors d'un incendie
Y à 3 ans dans un foyer juste à côté d'place d'Italie
T'étonnes pas si le monde est froid comme le salut d'un invalide
Comme un mec que t'as mis ienb, mais son nouveau pote possède l'avarice
Imagine ton bête de sauce qui baise ta reuss, poto qu'est-ce que t'en dis?

Choqué parc'qu'à 14 ans elle nique elle

Si y'a des gens dans la hass, c'est forcement qu'y en a d'autres qui s'gavent
La capitale devient Resident Evil, à Paris nord c'est GTA Vice City
Des vies défilent, et des filles quasiment nus pour des produits genre Taillefine
Moi ma vie à 22 ans j'la voyais pas comme ça, j'la voyais couper décalée ou bien macossa
Puis des femmes issues de métissages avec en scène ""Mamasaymamasamamakusa""
Depuis tout p'tit la télé te baise, de Scarface à Télétubbies
L'Etat m'a dit bah t'as cas t'soumettre ou bien faire des jobs à la Katsuni

L’œil de verre se voile la face pour mieux assouvir ses envies
Dissimule la vérité ce qui fait souffrir les gens dignes
Il a des problèmes au cœur qu’un cardiologue peut pas résoudre
Dès qu’il a un petit peu de sous j’le trouve chelou il parait saoûl
Il s’fout d’aller pisser et chier sans gène dans d’l’eau potable
Pendant qu’pour un verre d’eau des miséreux s’mettent des coups d’lame
L’homme vénère l’intelligent en oubliant qu’Hitler l’était
Ne pense plus à l’hiver quand l’soleil éclaire l’été
Ce monde une paire de pompe dans lesquelles j’me sens serré
J’prefère marcher pieds nus car sans elles j’me sens serein
Un homme est digne que dans le Din pas dans le deal ni dans les thunes
Ta cousine joue les coquine aimes-tu entendre que s'en est une
On perçoit notre vie comme un dessin fait dans la nuit
à partir de quelque trait l’œil humain s’fait son avis
Bécoter des decolletés c’est très coté pas boycotté
Boy, j’suis gout-dé, faut m’écouter, y'a à mon goût beaucoup trop d’gays
Une personne qui sourit n’est pas toujours très sage
Le cœur exprime des choses illisibles sur le visage
Comme toute ces filles sales qui mettent des strings ficelle
T’admires ce 50 Cent et tu craches sur une vie saine
Un aveugle qui prie voit mieux qu'ces gens aidés d’un satellite
La connerie des hommes est contagieuse et c’est pour ca qu’j’l’évite
Du mal à croire en l’homme té-ma les dégats d'Nagasaki
Laisse-moi un peu qu’je tire des balles et des balles dans ta patrie, akhi
M’oblige pas à t'parler d’cette fameuse guerre Hutu Tutsi
Où certain butèrent leurs frères juste pour avoir tout tout d’suite
On fait pas d’la médecine avec un scalpel rouillé
Donc construis pas d’mosquée avec des scalapes souillés
Tu zappes ton pote quand il ber-tom donc quand il sort t'es grave géné
Le respect s’est fait tout p’tit et la rue crie écrasez le
J’rigole tellement qu’mes larmes valent cher si j’suis en chien j’pourrais les vendre
Si l’Somalien riait comme moi il pleurerait pour s’bourrer le ventre

L’homme voit sans méditer de l’œil de verre est l’héritier pour son ego est sans pitié
Mais pour donner semble hésiter
L’homme voit sans méditer de l’œil de verre est l’héritier pour son ego est sans pitié
Mais pour donner semble hésiter

Celui dont l’œil est de verre voit mais ne regarde pas
Vers la verité, il ne veut même pas faire un quart de pas
Non, n’incarne pas le rôle de celui qui s’entête
Qui voit les signes mais les rejette car au fond de lui il se sent bête
Les miracles du Très Haut n’lui suffisent pas
Il préfère parler de mère nature decidement il vise bas
Tempêtes et cataclysmes sont les coups d’pression divins
Mais ça ne l’touche pas plus que ça il change de chaine sur son divan
Il voit c’qui s’passe dans l’monde les gosses qui crevent la dalle
Et pourtant, même un ogre ne finirait pas c’qu’il y a sur sa table
Il voit dans quelles conditions certain vivent et s’abritent
Mais n’se soucie de rien tant qu’il a ses livres et sa pipe
Il voit des gens mais n’regarde pas leurs qualités
Il parle comme s’il avait tout vu mais n'a en aucun cas lutté
Il soigne son apparence mais délaisse son intérieur
C’est pour ça qu’pour lui les gens modestes sont inférieurs
Il est froid et dur avec sa femme mais il ne voit pas combien elle l’aime
Elle a toujours été sa fan, de même
Pour sa mère qui pour lui a donne sa ive
Il pense peut-être qu’un coup d’fil ça serait gaspiller d’la salive
Il ne donne peu d’valeur aux gens qui sont proches de lui
Il voit rarement ses marmots comme un mec qui bosse de nuit
Il ne degage pas d’chaleur meme son meilleur pote le dit
Il a du fric mais n’en donne pas et s’fache quand ses poches se vident
C’est qu’un pauvre connard, j’crois qu’son cœur est dans le coma
Le peu d’bon souvenirs qu’il avait de sa mémoire, il les gomma
Même la vie après la mort il veut l’oublier
Il préfère se dire qu’une fois sous terre, on peut roupiller

L’homme voit sans méditer de l’œil de verre est l’héritier pour son ego est sans pitié

Sexion d'Assaut,"Oh Lefa, wesh c'est quoi les bails
T'es là, t'es dans ton coin, t'es calme, c'est quoi?

Ouais en ce moment je pense à des trucs
Je sais ap tu vois, parce que avant que t’arrive
Tu vois j'étais avec un kemé en cellule
Et bon depuis qu'il est sorti il m'envoie des lettres
Il m'envoie des mandats
Mais là ça fait longtemps j'ai pas de nouvelles tu vois
Je m'inquiète pour lui quand même parce que

Nan mais tranquille, à mon avis il est avec la famille

Nan, je sais ap parce que tu vois lui son histoire elle était bizarre
Tu vois j'ai peur qu'il lui soit arrivé des trucs chelou tu vois

Quelle histoire?

Bah

C'est l'histoire d'un accusé Non Coupable
Son nom c'est Malik c'est p'tet pour ça qu'le juge ne l'écoute pas
J'étais son co-détenu il m'a tout raconté
Encore une histoire de meuf qui habitait la cour d'à côté
Il taffait pas toujours posé au centre-ville
Avec ses potes la majeur partie du temps le ventre vide
Malik ne roulait pas sur l'or mais
Il avait du charme les gos d'la tess ne pouvaient pas s'en remettre
Mais t'as vu, lui c'était plus un footeux
Tout l'monde le traitait d'fou parce que les foufes il s'en foutait
En plus de ça, il avait du talent
Tous les recruteurs d'la région voulaient faire de lui leur étalon
C'est pas pour autant qu'il prenait la grosse teuté
Toujours au service des daronnes à porter leur courses d'ED
Le peu qu'il avait il le partageait
Malgré qu'il économisait pour que sa mère quitte son p'tit appart' à chier 

J'avoue, ça doit être un bon la wiss hein

Ouais c'est un bon mon frère, dans le din et tout en plus hein

Ouais j'avoue mais pourquoi il est béton la wiss

Bah t'as vu en fait ça a commencé dans une ré-soi 

Ce soir là ses potes avaient un plan ré-soi
Malik était pas chaud mais c'était ça ou rester chez soi
Dans l'ambiance une go lui proposa d'sé-dan
Il accepta sans savoir qu'à cause d'elle il prendrait sept ans
Le soir même elle le couchait dans ses draps
Elle le tentait en s'demandant putain mais quand est-ce qu'il cèdera
Il mit les voiles direction la baraque
Quitte à s'retrouver d'vant la rediff' d'un épisode de la star ac'
Manque de pot la meuf pris la ge-ra
Elle jura : ""Sur la vie d'ma mère Malik en chiera""
Il s'trouve qu'son beau père était avocat
Quelques jours plus tard il en fit part au proc' qui le convoqua putain
C'était la parole de Malik contre la sienne
Téma l'actrice tout l'monde cru au viol t'imagine la scène?
Le baveux d'Malik était bof commis d'office
Lors du vérdict sa mère cria ils m'ont pris mon fils
Sept ans d'placard pour un acte qu'il n'a pas fait
P'tite conne j'serais pas soulagé même si j'la baffais
Malik s'est retrouvé sous écrous
Les larmes aux yeux en repensant à tous ses projets qui s'écroulaient
Imagine la colère de Malik et ses collègues
Comment tolérer cette image qu'ils lui collèrent
Bref c'est à cette époque que j'ai connu Malik
Il parlait que d'dîn, j'croyais qu'il sortait de l'école islamique
J'l'ai pas cru quand il m'a dit ""c'est une go qui m'la mise""
Mais j'l'ai cru quand il m'a dit à partir de maintenant j'porte le qamis
On a passé vlà l'temps dans la même cellule
Pas une fois on m'a brouille-em sans qu'il soit venu dire ""laissez-le"" 

Ouais je vois, toi et lui en fait vous étiez poto quoi

Ouais c'était mon gars sûr!
C'était mon gars sûr!
C'est pour ça tu vois depuis qu'il m'écrit plus là
Je sais pas je me pose des questions
Tu vois j'ai chaud qu'il lui soit arrivé quelque chose tu vois

C'est quoi le délire?
Pourquoi t'as chaud explique

Un jour pendant la promenade
On a appris un truc qui nous a tromat'
Y avait un mec il s'tuait à la muscul'
Il était connu pour être le chef de son groupuscule
Ce mec là, il venait d'tel coin
Le même coin d'où venait l'vrai père de la belle tchoin
On a vite compris pourquoi il était bé-tom
Malik n'était pas la première proie d'la go au coeur en béton
Lui son but, c'était d'se venger d'elle
Il jurait qu'à sa sortie il l'attendrait devant chez elle
Malik n'était pas chaud pour ça
Il voulait refaire sa vie à 100% (C'est mieux ça)
Il a tenté d'le raisonner
Personne peut décider pour l'autre si son heure a sonné
Finir assommé au mitard complètement sonné
Personne pour te consoler aucune lettre de la zon-mé
Nan! Elle en vaut pas la peine
Et puis la haine que t'as, tu finiras par la perdre
Mais rien à faire, le gars était décidé
Si il pouvait s'venger il n'serait pas question d'hésiter
Tous les jours, il peaufinait son plan
Nan, le gars là ne faisait pas semblant 

Hé le gars il était déterre hein

C'est pour ça je t'ai dit, le gars il était déterre un truc de ouf!
Malik il lui parlait du dine en mode frère mus' mais rien à faire quoi!

M-m-ma-malgré ça?

Malgré ça, le gars il était trop déterre mon frère!

Malik est ti-sor plus tôt que lui 
Pour bonne conduite tout le monde sait qu'il était trop clean 
Depuis Malik m'envoie des lettres et des mandats 
Il me dit ""c'est des mithos crois pas que la taule forge le mental"" 
Il pète un cable il est trop resté au trou raye 
Avant c'était les cassettes mais maintenant c'est dvs et Blu-Ray 
Sur son front y a écrit ex-taulard 
Les gens le regardent comme un terroriste du Hezbollah 
Mais ce qui le rend fou par dessus tout c'est pas ça
C'est que le musclor doit sortir et il sait bien ce qui se passera 
Rien qu'il y pense, il me dit qu'il peut plus pioncer 
Ce que l'autre a l'intention de faire tourne en boucle dans ses pensées 
Dans sa dernière lettre, il disait vouloir l’empêcher 
De faire le con et de commettre un grand pêcher 
Akhi depuis j'ai plus de nouvelles 

Ah je comprend maintenant pourquoi tu t'inquiètes tout ça

Ouais tu vois j'ai pas envie de le retrouver dans un sac poubelle mon frère

Ah l'histoire de ouf

Je te jure

Wallah l'histoire elle est auch cousin

C'est pour ça tu vois les meufs mon frère faut faire trop attention!

Tout ça à cause d'une meuf Khoya!

Tu vois ce que je veux dire?
En plus il l'a même pas ché-tou! C'est ça le pire!
Tu vois ce que je veux dire
Et ça ça arrive dans tous les tiékar, dans toutes les villes du mondes

Même là, je suis sûr dans le bat y en a un tas qui sont béton pour ça! 
Y en a un tas qui sont béton pour ça

Oui bonjour matricule 75-0-0-9!
Ouais c'est moi 
Je vous prierais de vous asseoir s'il vous plaît! 
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Je tiens à vous annoncer le décet de votre ancien co-détenu monsieur Malik (Biiip) 
Wesh comment ça? Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé?
Écoutez, apparemment il a tenté de s'interposer dans une affaire de tentative de meurtre
On n'en sait pas vraiment plus pour l'instant
On n'a pas trop d'informations donc
(C'est quoi les bail?) 
Bon, nous vous tiendrons au courant par la suite si nous avons plus de nouvelles
D'accord? Bon, toutes mes condoléances, bon bonne journée

Akhi, tu nous a peut être vu dans un cauchemar
Sous pression tu priais pour que ta lampe de poche marche
Voilà mon équipe, prenez en de la graine
Sans nous le rap français est comme un re-noi sans la crème
Si ça pète, vite cache tes gosses akhi
Le bitume déteint sur nous, on débarque en costard gris
On cogne Starsky, Hutch goûte au taser
Et tous les ch'tars crient, ""Faut qu'y ait leurs photos dans nos classeurs!""
Vieillir dans le rap comme Snoop Doggy Dog
Bientôt j'arrête mais méfiez vous de l'eau qui dort
T'es bête ou quoi sur Paris y a pas plus lourd
On pèse des tonnes, le reste des MC's sont poids plumes
Mais tu vas où là, hop je te mets un grand pont,
Reste en défense, pour jouer en attaque il faut les crampons
Sexion d'Assaut, A.K.A la locomotive
On recrute ap', nous envois pas ta lettre de motive

C'est Sexion d'Assaut, c'est du lourd t'es bête ou quoi
Une équipe de type kickeur, pas de loveur comme B2K
Face à nous, vous voyez qu'ils sont re-lou vos
Flows d'ancien la famille, écoutez plutôt le renouveau
Faut pas nous laissez la place, les mecs vous aurez plus la cote
Car vos sons sont démodés comme les bananes Lacoste
Un incendie commence toujours par une flamme
Toi tu seras humilié comme un macho qui taffe pour une femme
Y a pas que du flow, t'inquiètes nos lyrics aussi chocs
On va te mettre mal à l'aise comme un non-fumeur dans un coffee shop
Les soldats de l'équipe marchent avec un mental rude
On déboule comme un obèse sur une montagne russe (Oh)

T'es bête ou quoi, t'es nul, t'es con faut pas t’étonner
T'es, t'es bête ou quoi?

Je veux juste que tu mettes que du Sexion dans ton iPod
Le meilleur moi j'en ai pas peur, mon son fait danser le pape
Je vais tout retourner comme papin, y ma faut du roro pour papa
Le but c'est pas les putes dans les clips comme Lollipop

Écoute akhi soit pas bête on est là que pour mettre le paquet
Ego trip sale y a pas de thème donc j'en place une der pour baden

Cesse de faire le survivant on t'as vite ché-cou sur le divan

Tu préfères les bons moments où t'as la tête entre deux eins
C'est 2009, c'est le futur les gens sont deuss,
Les dealers n'ont plus de poches, ils foutent leurs tos-ma dans les seufs
Les indus marchent sur la braise, moi je marche sûr de moi
Si tes hommes naissent en taule, d'autres naissent à Kinshasa
Akhi, petit mais vif comme Gimli,
On redonne pas le sourire à un mec du Darfour en lui faisant des guilis!
Tu trouve pas nos sons, pas étonnant (T'es bête ou quoi?)

C'est le petit fils de celle qui t'as dit ""casse toi!""
Et ce fameux tête à tête au restaurant

Garde à vous des pots j'en ai claqué des fous plaqués menottés
A s'faire té-shoo comme des ballons d'foot

Casquette à l'envers chez moi c'est comme ça que mes potes la mettent
Je préfère lever l'oi-d j'veux pas tourner le dos pour qu'on m'la mette

On a des yeux dans l'dos
Donc on porte nos casquette à l'envers
Et ça dans n'importe quel cascade
Aller op une casse-ded à ceux qui la portent comme un casque

A ceux qui la retourne pour mettre des coups d'plafond

Échoué, le plan a échoué
Tu peux passer du blanc au noir, du bien au mal

1, la soirée se passe ils jouent leur avenir à 2
En 2 minutes hop, ça devient la guerre de Troie
Ils étaient 4 ou 5 sous l’emprise du 666
Et de la weed oui, surtout d'la 8-6
Cette fois-ci stop, ce jeune homme voulait du neuf
S’marier avec sa meuf, bref avoir 10 enfants
Il en a marre des coups, avec ses zinc’ c’est simple
Mais une chose qui est sûre, c’est pas passé 5 sur 5
Un dîner au chandelles, et tout se passe à merveille
Il négocie la main d'la fille en espérant que sa mère veuille
C’est la soirée d'sa vie, depuis hier Samir veille
Il se dit qu’il veut de l’argent propre, qu’il en a marre d’salir l’oseille
Il esquive même son cousin qui lui demande de faire des coups
Des groupes de mecs le cherchent : ils voient sa tête, ils la découpent
Du coup, Samir s’est rangé tout ça grâce à sa petite amie
Il passe une soirée parfaite en songeant à sa petite famille
D’un coup des mecs à l’entrée rentrent, giflent le videur
Déboulent dans le resto à 5 avec Samir dans l’viseur
Courent vers lui à toute vitesse, coups d’bouteilles au futur gendre
Ils mettent des coups d'pression aux gens, des coups de couteaux aux jambes
Des couples goûtent aux insultes y a que le serveur que ça enchante
Ils mettent la go en sang, en plus elle est enceinte
Ils bousillent les tables les chaises et enchaînent le vacarme
Ils débranchent les câbles, vident les caisses et dépouillent le placard
Ils profitent des femmes et d'leurs fesses
Traitent leurs mecs de bâtards (sale bâtard va)
Et ils mettent en flammes toute la pièce c'est devenu un bazar
Changement d’ambiance que d’la peur, personne pour l'dire aux keufs
Belek ici en 10 minutes tu peux passer du rire aux pleurs

Ok 5, re-noi dans une caisse immatriculée Neuf-Quatre
Sur un fond sonore du Prototype 3
Fonçaient vers la capitale quand l’un d'eux
Sortit l’flash de rhum pour se mettre bi-en
Il est minuit 6 quand ça part en cette-su
La caisse fait des loopings, ça devient le grand 8
Dire qu’ils s’étaient mis yes, p'tites vestes, jeans neufs
C’est l’histoire d’un cauchemar hiver 2010
- Allô?
- C’est ""un tel"", bien ou quoi mon gars sûr? J’ai la caisse, ce soir on sort?
- Si si bien vu t’assures!
- Préviens les autres on s’capte au café qui fait l’angle
Ce soir on s’fait pas recal' : j’ai 4 tickets d’entrée
- Ok!
3h plus tard, tu connais les blacks
Mais bon y a le plein pour fuir si un keuf reconnaît la plaque
Du Sexion à fond, direction la capitale
Ça va clasher du tiek’son jusqu’à Pigalle
Flash de rhum pour s’mettre en condition
Mauvaise idée, car maintenant ""un tel"" conduit saoûl
Il serre un peu trop près le taxi devant
Un radar, le taxi pile et c’est l’accident
Le passager devant s’cogne contre le tableau d’bord
Sa boîte crânienne se fracture, un morceau d’cerveau sort
La carrosserie s’écrase comme une canette
C’est maintenant qu’il pense à Dieu et l'appelle à l'aide
Mais c’est trop tard :
Les vitres explosent les bouts de verre s’enfoncent dans les corps
La caisse part en tonneau et fonce dans l’décor
""Un tel"" sort, et voit les gens en ang-s
Voilà ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance

Échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)
Le plan a échoué (échoué, échoué, échoué)

Vu l’ambiance, valait mieux décal’ wesh on était pas plus de 7
Debout comme à l’armée à s’esquinter les vertèbres
Faya sous cool-al mais ce coup-ci c’était whisky
Sans cesse à débattre sur le dernier X6
Ce soir c’était nuit blanche des clopes j’en avais plus que 5
4€ d’nnaie-mo pour aller graille' s’mettre ien-b
3 képis qui rodaient en camtar' en moins d’2
Les mains contre le mur au bord des nerfs mais je m’abstiens
Y avait d’la se-ti du pilon c’qu’il faut pour sm’ettre ien-b
La ptite équipe d’élite 2-3 tits-pe qui s’trouvaient dans l’coin
Tout s'passait pour le mieux, mis à part un peu d’boucan
Un contrôle inopiné ce qu’on appelle un changement d’ambiance
A la base, ils étaient venus nous demander d’bouger
Refus d’obtempérer, contrôle d’identité
Comme d’habitude, faut toujours qu’y en ait un qui s'branle qui jacte
Comme chez nous, faut toujours qu’y en ait un pour les ficha
Ce soir là, y’avait l’poto qui dormait dans sa caisse
Réveillé pour donner sa pièce, contrôle alcootest
Il avait bu, il avait mal garé son 307
Brutalisé sous l’me-seu du capitaine et ses collègues
Manque de pot la mif est grande, y’avait 2 d’ses frelons
Ça part en couilles de tous les tés-cô, outrage et rébellion
Strangulations, balayettes, patates dans la mâchoire
Dispersion on s’revoit main-de, là faut vé-squi l’tier-quar

J'suis qu'un fusible, donc je pète les plombs

Ils doivent se faire monter en l'air pour mieux redescendre sur terre

J'serais pas l'idiot qui s'baisse chaque jour pour chier et qui s'dit oh 
J'ai pas d'sous et plein d'soucis, une envie fou de s'mettre sous weed

Quand elle éternue, les bicraveurs tombent et prennent du ferme

L'être humain n'est que du sperme vêtu 
Les mécréants voudraient voir Dieu 
Essayes d'abord de regarder le soleil dans les yeux
J'me demande plus quand tout ça cessera 
Marre de m'battre pour un quartier qui porte le nom d'un ciste-ra 
Puis ça m'fait chier 
Donc si une meuf me plaît de trop bah je l'imagine en train d'chier 
J'vise la tête j'ai plus le temps pour les essais

La beauté de l'homme est dans sa poche

Si on est dans l'son c'est pas pour qu'on dise qu'on a l'truc à peu près
Des phases que t'as du mal à voir v'nir comme les te-trai'
Oui, oui! Tous ces rappeurs qui posent, ça sonne pas pro'
Oui, oui! Y'a des hommes qui s'enculent au sens pe-pro'
(Ouh) J'ai graillé l'pain sur la planche
Regarde moi bien, j'suis rare tah un noi-ch' qui fait la manche

Depuis ""La Terre du Milieu"" rien qu’ça kick
Passe un coup de fil à ceux qui nous prenaient pour des tits-pe
Dis leur qu't'as vu la couleur du projet, que t'as pris des coups bas, des crochets
Pas l’temps d’être cool ou d’causer, passe nous l’titre

Ça c'est pour mon gars sûr : Dawa' qui s'dévoue
Et pour les cotes de ceux sur qui les dékiz' s'défoulent
Couz' on attire des foules, mais dans le tro-me' on de-frau, t'es fou
Si tu crois que tu vas me voir dans la jet set à tter-fro des foufs
S-E-X-I-O-N, v'là l'dernier jet-pro qu'est ti-sort
J't'aurais dit : ""T'as qu'à passer nous voir"", mais gros j'ai peur qu'y ai du sang
C'est pour la famille, les amis, présents depuis v'là les années
Qui se sont salit malgré qu'ils s'avaient que ça allait être salé
2010 : ça s'annonce violent
La concu' va nous traiter de sales insolents
Ok, dégage, j'dégaine, j'dégomme, j'décoche des gauches
J'débite, j'dépite les types qui flippent d'l'équipe

Akhi, dégage, j'décoche des gauches, j'dégaine, j'dégomme
J'débite, j'dépite les types qui flippent dl'équipe
Akhi, Allah y rahmou à Shakamouss, là c’est l’équipe de Chaka Zulu
Chacun d’nous choque, j’sais que ça rend nerveux chaque jaloux
Chope ce coup d’tête, plus d’chico mais c’est toi qui a voulu
Nous on sép' sur l’échec, j’veux des chèques car c'est sec avoue-le
Ok, Sexion d’Assaut, casse toi au cas où ça fait mal
Kaw fé ti mal akhi, on t'met K.O. ce coup-là
1 pour ko soucila les Soukouna, les sous qu'on a
C’est pour les darons, les vre-pau, as pour les chards-clo sous cool-al
Ils veulent du cocktail molo-flow, tu penses qu'on ira molo, faut
Pas d’lyrics molle au fond, faut que des vérités à t’faire mal au front
J’apprends pas ma leçon, j’te l’a fait et ça devient malsain
On a fait v'là les sons, j'te l’affirme et on reste menaçant

Sexion d'Assaut,"Paname, Paname lève toi
Paname, Paname lève toi

J'ai vu Paname au réveil, crottes dans les yeuz'
Silencieuse comme ceux qui piochent dans les keuz
Les VRP s'lèvent pour voler les ieux-v
Et les dealeurs d'crack s'lèvent pour droguer les gue-sh'
Tic-tac, lève toi c'est l'heure
Vite trace mais ve-esqui les leur'
Dans l'tro-m on est tous cuits mais on s'entasse
De ceux qui puent d'la gueule tu veux l'pourcentage?
Les mioches mettent leurs cartables et foncent en classe
Les joys mettent leur pare-balle et s'mettent en place (Akhi)
On s'vé-le tous pour la même chose
Son steak, c'est juste qu'on l'fait pas cuire dans la même sauce

Faut, faut, faut p't-être qu'on s'magne
Faudrait, faut, faut, faut p't-être qu'on maille
Moi y'a, moi y'a, moi y'a ma maille
Il est 5 heure 45 Paname, alors lève toi
Paname, Paname lève toi
Il est 5 heure 45 Paname, alors lève toi

J'vois pas Paname du même coté que les touristes (Akhi)
Derrière le papier-peint, pas d'assuré tous risques (Paname!)
Si j'te bute je plaide la rime passionnelle (Pétasse!)
Bientôt 6 heure du mat' et j'trouve pas l'sommeil (Putain!)
Les éboueurs ramassent les keus dans les poubelles
Mais c'lui qui plonge la tête la première dira toujours : ""Tout baigne"" (Encaisse)
Les timp' se passe le relais en même temps que les condés
A l'aube c'est dans les ruelles que la bac t'éclates les vres-lè
En bas des monuments le chic s'entremêle au choc
Pas très loin des boites, là où les p'tites s'font entraîner aux chiottes
Les ouvriers sont déprimés, y'a du sang sur l'sol
J'crois bien qu'la France d'en bas viens d'atteindre le sous-sol (Akhi)
J'traîne devant les stores, les porches ou les abris d'bus
Quand il pleut des cordes, avec mes potes faut s'bouger l'matricule
Paris l'matin, les chômeurs ont butés l'coq
Moi j'attends le premier tro-m tout en fumant ma dernière clope

Faut, faut, faut p't-être qu'on s'magne
Faudrait, faut, faut, faut p't-être qu'on maille
Moi y'a, moi y'a, moi y'a ma maille
Il est 5 heure 45 Paname, alors lève toi
Paname, Paname lève toi
Il est 5 heure 45 Paname, alors lève toi

J'ai vu l'Afrique réunie dans un wagon du tro-mé
Vu l'heure et l'endroit, quelque part ils ont du s'tromper
Moi c'est Pétrodollars, premier négro est à-l
J'fonce à Châtelet les halles, j'vois d'ja des trucs pas très légals
Tu veux faire un rail ou sauter d'dans, c'est p't-être que la vie stresse
Si on s'lève le matin c'est pour finir blindé comme la ligne 13
Si t'es encore en vie c'est p't-être un signe des cieux
Le temps c'est d'l'argent, on dort que quand on cligne des yeux
On y va seul pour des belles sommes qu'tu sois hindou ou Camerounais
On a le seum quand l'réveil sonne, on est un tous peu comme Rooney
Travailleurs, travailleuses, Parisiens, Parisiennes
Si Nico' dit d'la merde, n'l'écoutez pas, ne serait-ce que par hygiène
Tu vends des portables ou tu taffes au marché aux Puces
Personnes n'l'a attendu, on travaille plus pour gagner plus
Les caissière de chez ATAC au ministère de la défense
Aux keufs qui mettent des coups d'matraque aux mini-stars de la défonce

Le 7-5 c'est risqué, wesh détends-toi t'es crispé
Si le soir tout est *chut* c'est que les shlags ont *snif snif*

Chez nous ça gueule jusqu'à 6h du mat'
Comme d'hab', ça rentre à l'aube, mais ça dépend, sinon c'est tard la night
Paname ça deale, ça rode et ça pillave
Ça termine à l'hôtel ou ça prend l'tro-m à Paris Centre Ze-Art
Tu vois l'ambiance quand y'a plus trop d'gent-ar, ça fait les sorties d'boites
Avec l'équipe quand ça lère-ga, c'est à s'khabat
Ça sent la résine, laisse tomb' à la GAV
Rentrer chez oi-m, c'est c'qui m'reste à faire, mais pour l'instant j'suis à-l
Y'a des taxis man H:24 (Paname!)
Prend ton Noctambus poto si t'assumes 'a-p
République, y'a du défilé d'gamos, y'a ceux qui draguent défoncés
Y'a ceux qui lâchent des galettes et y'a ceux qui graillent, tu connais
Y'a des clodos chire-dé sur tous les trottoirs, ça promet
Y'a des daronnes épuisées qui partent au taff (Akhi)
Paname le tam' ça part en freestyle
Attends 6 heures moins l'quart la famille si tu veux des punchlines

Faut, faut, faut p't-être qu'on s'magne
Faudrait, faut, faut, faut p't-être qu'on maille
Moi y'a, moi y'a, moi y'a ma maille
Il est 5 heure 45 Paname, alors lève toi
Paname, Paname lève toi
Il est 5 heure 45 Paname, alors lève toi
