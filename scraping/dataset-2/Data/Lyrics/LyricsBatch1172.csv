The Remo Four,"Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me.
It's not the same but I'm to blame, it's plain to see.

So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own.
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone.

I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home. 
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me.
I know I'll never be the same if I don't get her back again.
Because I know she'll always be the only girl for me.

But 'till she's here please don't come near, just stay away.
I'll let you know when she's come home. 
Until that day

Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.
Don't bother me.",Don't Bother Me,1992
The Remo Four,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life,1992
The Remote Viewers,"Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin' anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over, mmm mmm
Something's comin' over me

Inside a malfunction

I wish you would do
Calling with some good news

These days I may not be so happy
After all, after all that I have gained
I still feel sad when I'm all alone
I may have felt that path? decay?
I may not be so swift after all
All the chances you have given me
I just let you go
I guess I've been like this before
Sometimes I can't stand up and be a man
But God why would I lose it now
When I need my strength at hand
You know sometimes I can be real cool
All the words just seem to flow right along
But when that girl approaches me
Well it all goes wrong
These days leave me hopelessly lugubrious
I wish these days were gone
Oh please end

They brought you down
To watch the merry-go around

You wouldn't make a sound

Writes 'em down, it seems
When she sleeps, she's free

About the favors that you did for some other guys

Jumping with the ankle to distract my thinking with another kind of pain

Around to where it began in time

That we'd never even met in the first place
And my skin felt so clean

ESKIMO IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO N. SENADA WHO STARTED THE WHOLE THING",Epilogue,1978
The Residents,"Angakoks, the Eskimo men of magic. are widely held as symbols ofmortal power among the tribe, Stories of their feats are very popular at tribal gatherings.
The whales whistled as the Eskimo tribe danced on and on to the lively beatof the ceremonial band. For twenty days they danced. And sang. And prayed. And still the ice floe hugged the shore line preventing the Eskimos from being able to kill their most valuable prey, the large migrating whale. Anger had been building in the people towards the Angakok who allegedly had the power to remove the ice that was blocking their passage. Finally a hunter challenged the magic of the Angakok with hostile words, and others soon joined him in the traditional taunt of ""necki, necki, necki"", until the Angakok rose up before them and silenced them with a single cry. A spell escaped from his lips and the sky darkened. A curse slipped from his finger and the seas swelled. The ice was cracking at last. But that dull roar?? The Eskimos looked at one another with fear in their weathered faces. Then it appeared. A ""giant snake which stands on the water"" wiggled before them with its head in the clouds. They briefly watched it eat a path through the ice floe, then hysterically ran for safety. But the water spout had one more job to do. The hunter who challenged the Angakok's magic was never seen again.

The Residents,"Arctic hysteria is a phenomenon that occurs in the dead of winter,primarily to women. The weeks of darkness and general sensory deprivation lead to the eventual temporary loss of a firm touch with reality.
Darkness prevailed everywhere. Beside her igloo, a woman sat in the windsinging softly to herself while beating the snow from her husband's seal fur clothing. Her voice and mind drifted with the soft tones of the nearby kooa player. Her song was about her work, but her unfocused eyes revealed a growing distance. The darkness seemed to confine her, and the singing voice seemed not to be her own.
The realization struck! ""I am dead, or at least the others believe I am"",she thought. Already she hears the pounding of the tribe's hands packing down the snow on her icy grave as they sing their song of farewell. The rhythm of death sounds in her ears.
She feels cold no more as her worst fears are realized. She has been sentto the ""Land of the Crestfallen"", where only the spirits of poor hunters and badly tatooed women spent eternity snapping at butterflies. But wait! Even worse! Instead of butterflies, the dreaded Arctic locust swarmed into the evening air devouring all in their path.
The men in the tribe had become aware of the woman's hysterical sufferingand joined in a circle to sing a chant of releasement. ""Chukaroq, chukaroq, chukaroq, ei"", they sang, until finally the woman once again returned to beating the snow mindlessly from her husbands clothing, virtually unaware of what had happened as her song of work faded into the wind.

The Residents,"Since the most important person in the Eskimo community is thehunter, and since hunters are always male, female infants are ritually killed if there is no infant male who will someday need a mate to cook, sew, and chew leather for him. This social condition adds to the drama of birth.
The pains were coming in regular intervals and she knew that if she didn'tstart moving now, her legs might collapse under her before she could reach the ice cave. The ceremonial band was already playing birth music and the other women sang in an attempt to comfort her. But as her steps carried her toward the ice cave and the ceremonial band's music became lost in the wind. the true lonliness of her situation loomed even larger in her mind. The gaping mouth of the ice cave eagerly awaited. And although she felt fear, she knew the cave also offered relief from her quickening pains, for this journey had been made many times before.
Her pace remained unchanged as she entered the cave, which now enlargedbefore her and engulfed her in the sweet music of slowly moving ice vibrating within its own cristaline formations. Deeper into the cave she went. The men were playing the kooa and chanting for the birth of a male.
Finally she reached the furthest chamber where stood the Angakok. Deliverybegan immediately as the magic man filled the room with protective prayers. The child was born. The Eskimo woman reached forth with her hand, gently across the already frozen crust on the infant's belly to feel the child's sex; the other women came into the chamber singing the song of life and bore the infant away.

The Residents,"Perhaps no holiday is more important to the Eskimo than the DeathFestival. More than a tribute to the dead, this festival marks the beginning of the yearly cycle by being held at the end of the six month Eskimo night.
Something moved in the dark. A face as tall as a man -- a big, round,evil face wandered at random. More faces and the realization: the dead walk the snow. Whistling and chanting, ""We have stolen the sun and you will have to live in darkness"".
But the women of the ribe, who were hiding in their igloos, then rushed outshrieking and beating their chests, proclaiming their right as the source of life. The dead spirits were frightened by the women and fled into the darkness. As the Eskimo band picked up their song, the women gathered in a circle, symbolizing nature's golden orb, and sang a hymn asking the dead to return the sun to the mothers of the snow.
The men, having removed their ""dead spirit"" masks, joined the women infestive songs and hand-clapping games until, at last, the first rays of sunlight of the Eskimo year began to appear over the horizon, signaling the end of six months of winter darkness. Gratefully, the dead had released their hold once more.",The Festival of Death,1979
The Residents,"One of the many strange Eskimo phenomena is the disappearance ofchildren. In such inclumate conditions one can easily understand how this can happen. However, Eskimo mythology speaks of children being stolen by the spirit of the weeping seal, which is half seal and half woman, and who, because she can have no children, must steal any she finds unguarded.
Pop! the bladders went. Hunting season had been good and there were manybladders to burst. The band played gleefully, eager to get to the next peak in the music so all could explore the inflated bladders the creatures which had fed and clothed the Eskimos all year. Finally, the music ended and everyone immediately ran toward the sea, eager to throw the burst bladders through a hole in the ice so the souls of the animals could return to the sea and be caught again next year.
Because of the excitement, an important Eskimo rule has been broken. Achild was left unattended. Tears froze on his cheeks as he stood crying behind an igloo. Suddenly, there was another sound in the wind. A whistle, a bark,. a growling whine filled the air around the terrified child, whirling him around in a flurry of ice.
The Eskimo soon returned to discover that the child was missing, andrealized the folly of their over-excitement at the bladder festival. The Angakok started a chant to halt the fleeing spirit, but he knew the chant would only delay the spirit of the Weeping Seal's complete takeover of the child. They would have to go to ""the world beneath the world"" and fight.
Several dog sleds sped away across the tundra, whips cracking at the barking dogs. On the lead sled the child's father and the Angakok crouched, defending themselves against the blast of Arctic wind. The ride was long and tiring.
As they neared their destination, the men sang a chant and the Angakok spokea spell. A dog which was brought before him was decapitated, and the head, still containing the dog spirit, was quickly taken down to the neather world, while the other dogs, smelling the blood fo their own kind, howled into the cold night. The Angakok raised the god head into the air and called forth its spirit to battlethe Weeping Seal and force it to return the stolen child.
The two spirits met and intertwined in the air. With the Northern Lightsthey danced and sang, and then they disappeared slowly as the men returned to their village in hopes that the child would be there.",A Spirit Steals a Child,1979
The Residents,"Walrus hunting in kayaks among the floating ice must sometimeproceed in the winter darkness or in a condition known as ""whiteout"" when atmospheric conditons turn the sky into a virtual mirror of the snow and ice below and orientation becomes difficult. At these times, women on shore blow a large horn made from a giant narwhal's hollowed tusk and chant to give directional orientation to the hunters.
Winter had almost arrived, for the wind had a more pronounced bite in itsinsistence. The noonday sun sat momentarily on the horizon before hastening back into the icy waters. Floating on the rising winds, the sounds of the narwhal horn and chanting combined to give assurance to the Eskimo hunters. The paddling of the kayak was smooth and steady. Not much light was left and a sleeping walrus could easily hide in the deep shadowed recesses of the floating icebergs.
But wait! There, on the ice... yes, a walrus! A happy but silentdiscovery. The sling-like harpoon was removed from its leather container and spun rapidly around over the hunter's head until sufficient speed was reached to send it zooming toward its unsuspecting prey. The walrus was hit. Cheers rang out from the men as they all paddled toward the animal which had plunged into the icy sea; but the water offered no protection as the Eskimo men reached for their whale bone clubs and bludgeoned the creature. The walrus floated quietly in the water and the kayaks moved on in search of other sleeping prey.",The Walrus Hunt,1979

The Residents,"And so my story winds on down toward an ending that's been found to come
whenever all is said and done. I've lived my life and taken chances and if
some were strange by standards that were less important than my needs,
then I guess I could be crooked, evil, bent and twisted, looking down upon
the strings I tried to pull. But I see the strings extending up and down
and never ending as we dance around our selves and jerk to all the tunes
that only we hear and the voices only we fear each inside an island all
alone. But the contact that we do make, as we give and take abuse, stays
and its value only multiplies. Yes I'm alone, but not forgotten, for each
comes and sees me often, sitting on a seat beside my bed, and we laugh and
reminisce about a life that once was bliss before an act of passion made
us part. Of course they'll always be together, but their bond is made of
leather not the flesh and blood it used to be. They're still full of life
and healing, but it has a different feeling and only for the few that seek
their sort of pain and pleasure when they merge and give into insistent
urgency that lives for seconds at a time. For pain and pleasure are the
twins that slightly out of focus spin around us till we finally understand
that everything that gives us pleasure also gives us pain to measure it
by, and I also realize...that all our lives we love illusion, neatly
caught between confusion and the need to know we are alive.",Pain and Pleasure,1988

Her teeth were in her hands and her tongue was hanging out;

The cup was full of pennies; it spilled when she got up.

He could be catching butterflies if there were any there.
All the freaks are not inside the tents
Some pay to come and be in the audience.
I saw a great big guy who had a little gun;
He pulled it out and smiled and then he sucked his thumb
His wife was standing by with a leather leash
Fastened to a child who cried beside their feet.

And her face that's coated with a quarter inch of cream-cold cream
She's the one who freaks the freaks out

was make em runny make em runny honey... doilies doilies where have all
the doilies gone...
Roses will whither and die
Along with the lace and the lies
Nothing is nicer than death
At matching the bad and the best
Heh heh... he hated me he hated me and hate is white and hate is hot
but I'll not even have disdain for him not even a stain on a memory
looked up to, lacking all respect for him I'm blacking out the specks
of decent thoughts that linger in me and leave only white white
peaceful white calm white swans silently flying in the snow look down
and see the bleached bones of a noble knight who died trying to save
his lady his lovely white lady who brought her man milk in the
moonlight but it was too late too late too late he said
Scratch out all the pin holes
Open up the sores
Don't look out the window

A solid hunk of meat

His tattoo shines with heat

Enraptured by his stance

And give a troubled glance
The barker looks into the eyes
The stranger tries to bend
The barker swears to more delights
For all who seek within
The stranger enters canvas doors
And smells the fresh cut hay
The barker points to Siamese twins

The eyes of horse faced women
Watch the few who wander through

And smell the sweet taboo

My self esteem, my stability, and my argyle socks

One that is, not belonging in my Kino sphere

I want to see your paintings come alive
I want to see you smile when I say, I love thee

As my thought hit the sky
All this nonsense, all this beauty
Has truly come alive

Drive all night, middle of nowhere
Ship-wreckage, left of this page
And on the bottom and in the top
Where are we going, maybe we should

I don't want to hide behind my music

The Reverend Horton Heat,"Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and roll feelin' in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

I met a shoeshine boy never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bendin' low at the peoples feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street

When I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all the trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and roll feelin' in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight

He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again

Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on get rhythm, when you get the blues
It only cost a dime, just a nickel a shoe
It does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues

That's my epitaph

The Reverend Horton Heat,"Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer 
had a very shiny nose. 
And if you ever saw him, 
you would even say it glows. 

All of the other reindeer 
used to laugh and call him names. 
They never let poor Rudolph 
join in any reindeer games. 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve 
Santa came to say: 
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"" 

Then all the reindeer loved him 
as they shouted out with glee, 
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, 
you'll go down in history! 
",Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,2005
The Reverend Horton Heat,"Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randalph's not too far behind
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Randalph he can hurry, he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy child ""What have you been longing for?""
""All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar""
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star

Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Can't you make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl child ""What would you like most to get?""
""I want a little baby doll that can cry, scream and wet""
And away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet

Run, run Rudolph, run, run Rudolph, a running like a son-of-a-gun.

The Reverend Horton Heat,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Are you happy with what you see?
I know that things aren’t right between you and me
Under the scope, I’ve done all that I can
And I have been watched by many of jealous men

Who are you?

This one goes out to all my fallen friends
I know that we’ll all be together in the end
So hold your loved ones close
For forever and a day
I know only God can tell when we’ll be washed away

Who are you?
Who are you still inside of me?
Who are you still in love with me?
I told you so

All that she needs is a banker, a toy, a boy and a dress
All that he needs is a lock on the door
Some love in his heart to fill this hole in his chest
You could be the love, I could be the fight
We could say forever, staying up all night
This is about as low as I could be tonight
You could be the love, I could be the fight

Who are you?

Who are you still inside of me?
Who are you still in love with me?
My place is cold, I’ve been up all night
I’m alone, but it’s alright
Is it in the air?
I feel it in the air

Oh, oh, oh

I’ve said it too many times
The places I go could white out your eyes like the color of snow
The rain or the sun could never prepare you
For the seduction that comes with a fare
Hot fire sex in the third degree
Burning blunts, blowing lines, popping ecstasy
I’m free from their world
It had its hooks in me
Still a fish out of water, but now I can breath
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
All that she needs
A banker, a toy, a boy and a dress
It’s all that she needs",BTBD,2014

Swimming the unconscious stream
That flows into the mansion of my mind

Let there be longing for a better way of life

Hanging from the fallen string
Unraveling the fabric of my time

The only reason was fun, fun,­ fun
Got no excuse for every mistake

We needed riot at all
We went to a lot of demonstrations
Till everybody could hear our call

I felt like a red
I believed in a lot of ideas
And in my heart punk's still not dead

Big hats with gorgeous stones, honey designed the slacks
With two attempts on his bottom bitch, her name was Precious
Silky skin, priceless pussy, she took karate
Her bubble ass got Pretty Chipp rich
You can smell her perfume on every street corner
A sexy motherfucka with the mean face on her
Precious, sported bulletproof dresses, defending caring sex

Control the south side, her name rings
Lookout for the black cherry pussy extortion

Cause these niggas don't know how to act
At the Apollo, Ray Charles told me

He taught me the talks, he taught me the walk
Cause I'm Chipp's bitch, we dine and resort

Is worse than a thief

And tell you more lies

She drove me out my mind

She's a Baltimore special
Got a fine brown frame
When you see her in motion
Evil woman is her name

Did I tell you 'bout the Eastman
Lord what a shame
He run off with my baby
And scandalized my name

Well I went up on a mountain top
To call my baby back
She was gone with that Eastman
Down that lonesome railroad track

If I ever see that Eastman
I'll shoot him with my gun
I'll cut him with my long Jones
And dare that pimp to run

Little Liza, little Liza
I couldn't sleep last night
Come on back home baby
Everything will be all right

Let me tell you, let me tell you
I don't care what you say
If my woman ever comes back
I'll give my life away

If you ever see a dark cloud
A-rollin' in the sky
It's my woman gone to heaven

The Rich-Tones,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

You speak and I hear violins

The stars desert the skies
And rush to nestle in your eyes

Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland
Oh, it's magic

How else can I explain
Those rainbows when there is no rain?
It's magic, why do I tell myself
These things that happen
Are all really true

The magic is my love for you?

A girl could feel special on any such like.""

It's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952.

And I've seen you on the corners and cafes, it seems.

And down to Boxhill,

But I'll tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man;
For I've fought with the law since I was seventeen.

I've robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine.
And now I'm twenty-one years, I might make twenty-two.
And I don't mind dyin' but for the love of you.
But if fate should break my stride, then I'll give you my Vincent, To Ride.""

""For they've taken young James Aidee for Armed Robbery.
Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside.
Oh, come down, Red Molly, to his dying bedside.""

He was runnin' out of road. He was runnin' out of breath.
But he smiled, to see her cry.
And said, ""I'll give you my Vincent.

Said James, ""In my opinion, there's nothing in this world
Beats a '52 Vincent and a Redheaded girl.
Now Nortons and Indians and Greavses won't do.
Oh, they don't have a Soul like a Vincent '52.""

Well he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys.
He said, ""I've got no further use...for these.
I see Angels on Ariels in leather and chrome,
Swoopin' down from Heaven to carry me home.""

And he gave her his Vincent.

The Richard Thompson Band,"I was nineteen when I came to town
They called in the Summer of Love
They were burningbabies, burning flags
The Hawks against the Doves

I took a job in the STeamie
Down on Cauldrum Street
I fell in love with a laundry girl
Was working next to me

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

Brown hair zig-zag round her face
And a look of half-surprise
Like a fox caught in the headlights
There was an animal in her eyes

She said, young man, O can't you see
I'm not the factory kind
If you don't take me out of here
I'll surely lose my miind

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

We busked around the market towns
And picked fruit down in Kent
And we could tinker lamps and pots
And knives wherever we went

And I said that we might settle down
Get a few acres dug
Fire burning in the hearth
And babies on the rug

She said O man, you foolish man
It surely sounds like hell
You might be lord of half the world
You'll not own me as well

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child
She was running wild, she said
As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way

We was camping down the Gower one time
The work was pretty good
She thought we shouldn't wait for frost
And I thought maybe we should

We were drinking more in those days
And tempers reached a pitch
Like a fool I let her run
With the rambling itch

Last I hear she's sleeping out
Back on Derby beat
White Horse in her hip pocket
And a wolfhound at her feet

And they say she even marriend once
A man named Romany Brown
But even a Gypsy caravan
Was too much settliing down

And they say her flower is faded now
Hard weather and hard booze
But maybe that's just hte price you pay
For the chains you refuse

She was a rare thing
Fine as a beeswing
And I missher more than ever words could say
If I could just taste
All of her wildness now
If I could hold her in my arms today
Then I wouldn't want her any other way",Beeswing,1996

You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away
I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

And she never thought twice

And walked into the night

And silver wings carried her 
Over the sea
From the west coast of Ireland 
To West Tennessee

To be with her sweetheart, 
Oh she left everything
From Galway to Graceland to be with the king

She was humming Suspicion, 
That's the song she liked best
She had Elvis I Love You 
Tattooed on her breast

When they landed in Memphis, 
Well, her heart beat so fast
She'd dreamed for so long, 
Now she'd see him at last

She was down by his graveside 
Day after day
Come closing time they 
Would pull her away

Ah to be with her sweetheart, 
Oh she'd left everything
From Galway to Graceland to be with the king

Ah, they came in their thousands 
From the whole human race
To pay their respects 
At his last resting place

But blindly she knelt there 
And she told him her dreams
And she thought that he answered 
Or that's how it seems

Then they dragged her away 
It was handcuffs this time
She said ""my good man are you out of your mind?""
Don't you know that we're married?

Well, I'm a-wait, wait, waiting for Valerie

Hey, Valerie, she got a scar down here
Valerie, she got gold in her ear
A figure like this, lips like that
Red fingernails, teeth like a cat

She never gets home till five or four or three
Well, I'm a-wait, wait, waiting for Valerie

Well, I'm soft in the head, I give her hard cash
She spends all my money on junk and trash, nylon fur, plastic shoes
And fifty-seven things she's never going to use
Never, never, never going to use
Oh, Valerie, oh, Valerie, oh, Valerie

Well, Valerie, you're going to choke or drown
Valerie, why don't you put that down?

If you don't get over this eating jag
They're going to take you home in a body bag
I can't stand to see one more calorie
Well, I'm a-wait, wait, waiting for Valerie

Now every time I turn my back
She's 'round the corner, looking for a crack
It's going to be the ruin of me
Well, I'm running on nervous energy
Running on nervous energy

Oh, Valerie, she want to move out of town
Valerie, she want the money down

She want leopard-skin this, tiger-skin that
Matching luggage, lipstick, hat
I can't afford her on my salary

All passion to the eye
All cold to the touch

There's a chink in your armour
A crack in your defenses
When your iron will
Gives way to your senses
Your whispered sweet nothings
All sound like expenses
And that's enough
He won't believe your words of love

The Richard Thompson Band,"One door opens, another shuts behind
One sun sets and another sun she rises
Love comes to you in old familiar ways
Love comes to you in shadows and disguises

She may quit you, she may forsake you
Drift away like a phantom in a fever
Who walks in to your heart of solitude
Who walks into the lair of the deceiver

They say it was my turn
They say I had it coming
They say that’s what you earn
For living through a lie

If I could have my way
I’d leave it all tomorrow
There’s sorrow if I stay
I’ve other fish to fry

When love breaks like a precious string of pearls
A thousand memories, they roll away and scatter
Make believe that there’s ice runs through my veins
Shrug my shoulders as if it doesn’t matter

The Richard Thompson Band,"Sidney Wells he drove the country North to South
On the walkie-talkie, shooting off his mouth
All the lorry drivers thought he was a laugh
They didn't know the truth, they didn't know the half

Sidney Wells he had a lovely line in chat
Before a girl could think he'd have her at his flat
Dansette playing soft, a gin'll do no harm
No one could resist Sidney Wells' charm

Cheryl was a waitress at the works canteen
Older than she looked, she'd pass for 17
Too pretty to be working such a lousy job
Beauty queen smile, hair cut in a bob

Sidney Wells' rig came weaving down the road
At Hennessy and Sons he dropped his heavy load
Cheryl checked her makeup, looked up at the clock
She had a date with Sidney at the loading dock

He led her to the woods, the sky was getting dark
She thought it was romantic, thought it was a lark
Buried in her mind there rang a small alarm
But no one could resist Sidney Wells' charm

Then he took off her clothes and threw them in a pile
He watched her stand there cold and shivering for a while
Then he picked up her stocking lying on the floor
And wrapped it round her neck until she breathed no more

He tried to burn the body, he didn't do it well
Up on a pile of tires, it was an awful smell
They found her poor remains and summoned the bereft
And took her to the church to bury what was left

Now Sidney Wells he was a heartless kind of rake
The blood within his veins was colder than a snake
He didn't run, he carried on just like before
Until the CID came knocking at the door

The judge said, Mr Wells, the evidence is strong
Said Wells, ""I'll not deny, what took you all so long?
All you see is victims, all I see is brides
I'm guilty to the gills, and 7 more besides.""

They took him to the jail, ready for the worst
Justice would be served, but who would get there first?
He bled just like a pig slaughtered on the farm
The inmates weren't impressed by Sidney Wells' charm",Sidney Wells,2012

Just long enough for a little light to shine

Well, she just kept howling all of the night

They said, if that nag even stays on her feet
We’re gonna give you first prize

Oh, both ends burning, both ends burning

Oh, both ends burning, both ends burning

She ran so fast that it took my breath
You never did see such a win
But when she crossed that finishing line
I was just too tired to grin

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2017

I've got my rock and my roll instruction
Playing every club in the land

I made a deal with the angel of music
And I found what you said was true
If you give it to the people like the people want it
They'll give it, they'll give it
They'll give it right back to you

I can't think of anything that I wouldn't do
As long as someone wants me to sing
You don't have to label me a Hollywood hero
Just let me do my RIGHTEOUS thing!
‘Cos when the crowd they're just waiting for you
And the lights they check-out okay
There ain't no words to describe the feeling
That everybody's come to hear you play
(Yes I will)

I made a deal with the angel of music
And I learned what it's all about
If you give it to the people like they wanna hear it
They'll let it, they'll let it
They'll let it all hang all night

You know I, you know I made a deal with the angel of music
And I found what she said it was true
If you give it to the people like the people wanted
They'll give it, they'll give it
They'll give it right back to you

I made a deal with the angel of music
And I learned what it's all about
If you give it to the people like they wanna hear it",Give It to the People,1974

Do you even notice I'm there?
The road goes on to the end
And you're the friend of a friend

So we meet and we smile
And inside I'm only a child
But lies have lost their appeal
My eyes betrayed what I feel

I've been waiting so long for this dream to come true
And maybe we can work it out this time
But is it so wrong to feel like I do
For someone who'll never be mine?

I've been hoping so long you would want me one day
Perhaps this time around you'd just might
But is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so right?

Do you see and do you know?
If you do, you don't let it show
The world is on all around
And I can always be found

So I walk and I ran
And I prayed it isn't too late
For who knows better than I
If time is passing me by?

I've been waiting so long for this dream to come true
And maybe we can work it out this time
But is it so wrong to feel like I do
For someone who'll never be mine?

I've been hoping so long you would want me one day
But I never once believed you really would
And is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so good?
Tell me, is it so wrong to love you this way
When loving you feels so good?

The Righteous Brothers,"First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

Will your arms open wide
At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I, I can feel
You are love, you are real

When a love affair is over?

Now she's gone away and I'm alone
With the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad, I see it still

The Robertsons,"Now the night before Christmas, I was sitting in my house
And there wasn't nothing  moving around, not even a mouse.
The socks were hung by the fireplace to dry,
In hopes that old Santa Clause would bring me some pie

My children are grown, so nobody's in bed
And I got the sound of duck calls stuck in my head.
Mama's in her gown, and I got on my cap,
And I ain't tired, cause I took a three hour nap.

When all of a sudden, I heard a big crash
I figured it was some coon, diggin' in the trash
I went to the window, and slipped on my shoes
Cause I don't like critters, snooping around in my refuge

Now the moon was bright, and there was no sight of snow
And hey, I have the eyes of an eagle, just so you know.
When all of a sudden, what seemed to appear,
Was a tiny little tree stand, and whole lot of deer. Hmm

I knew I had seen him, he was acting very silly
And I was convinced, it could only be Willy
Now he was yelling and screaming, calling out names
And those deer started moving, and all those suckers came!

Now I thought he said ""Hey, Dasher, hey Prancer, and Spitzer
Maybe Comet, something about Cupid, Donner and Wolf Blitzer
Let's head to the roof, from there they would spring
These deers had magical powers, and all of them had wings

Now I took off my glasses, cause this was too weird
Big bucks turned into ducks, is what seemed to appear
Hey they circled around, and I swear that they flew
These deer had bags of my garbage, and big Willy in there too

And then, in a a flash, they was tearing up my roof
I heard the stompin' and chompin' of each little hoof
As I drew out my pistol, not knowing what to say
Down the fireplace came Willy, he must have got away

He had on a mink coat, from his bandana to his foot
And his clothes were all nasty, covered it ashes and soot.
He had my bag of garbage flung over his back,
And he looked like a fat raccoon, lookin' for a snack

As I stood there, wondering why he was not in bed
I yelled, ""Hey, I don't have any cookies you crazy knuckle head""
His mouth was wide open as he stood there in shock
Then I realized, I was in my tighty whites, with only a top

Alright, quit laughing boy

OK, Willy looked like he was smoking a pipe
I know I never seen that, and it didn't seem right
Not sure it was Willy's face, but no doubt it was his belly
With the unmistakable shake, cause hey, Willy loves his jelly

Willy's chubby and plump, like a fat little mouse
And I got tickled at seeing him and said ""Why are you at my house?""
He winked at me and smiled, as he set down his stash
I saw it was not my garbage, and it certainly was not my trash

Hey, this cat didn't say a word, as he pulled out some toys
And not just cheap crap. This stuff was for big boys!
He was doing a job, and he was going to work
This could not be Willy, because Willy, he's a jerk!

He left me some goodies, then he sprang in the air
I wasn't sure what I just saw, but hey, I didn't care
And I heard him yell out, as he left with his pack

The Rocco John Group,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense

A cupful of pencils and a self help guru

But it's bad for me

It's so good for me so new for me
To see someone in such a stew for me
And when you say you'll do all you could for me
It's so good for me it's bad for me

I felt 'til you whispered to me
Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself

It's a boon for me a break for me
To hear that your heart's on the make for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me

O how I count the hours 
Since we were torn apart

On the road to Fairfax County
I spied a highwayman
He wanted all my money
My heart beat like a drum

I gave him all my money
And sweet he smiled at me 
His beauty eye took pity
Beneath the old oak tree

We kissed but for an hour
The sun was newly warm
The clouds were as the flowers
That bloom but for a morn

He gave back all my money
And bowed most gallantly
He promised for to meet me
That night beneath the tree

We'd flee to some far island
And there we would be wed
And freely we would live there
With no price upon his head

That night I went to meet him
With my inheritance
He kissed me 'neath the half moon
And joyful we did dance

O love betrays all secrets
It whispers in the breeze
The sheriff he did follow
With all his deputies

Like hounds rushing to slaughter
The fox whose luck is run
And he stood erect and cursed them
God damn you every one

They seized him in a fury
And heeding not my plea
They hung him from the oak tree
Where he made love to me",On the Road to Fairfax County,1982

Beyond this world came a power
Struck into me I don't know how
It happened slow I want you to know
Her love is true music and it
Radiates around

Here comes a new day: clouds roll away
Don't ask me, I don't know a thing
Let's drive to town across the border line
Her love is true music and it
Radiates around

My chance for true happiness
It waits upon her kiss
How can it be, it feels so good to know all this

My heart may break and it might fall
She is mine and I am hers through seasons all
Let's drive to town
Across the borderline
Her love is true music
And it radiates around

why are you coming so close?
You might erase
The line which no one crosses

aren't you afraid you'll disappear
Without a trace
Wild thing with eyes as big as saucers

this sign says no trespassing unless its you

who would imagine in so safe a place as this
A person could find a spinning wheel

all of my life I have been dreaming of your kiss
I'd like to believe the way I feel

some enchanted forest we are walking though
Who do I think I'm talking to?

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Was alive as he could be
And the children say, he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me, come on

So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop""

Hey, Frosty, the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin', ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

Their watch of wondering love

And praises sing to God the King

The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may his His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

Who was captured
By a big, grumpy, invisible wizard. he locked her in
The tippy top of his
Tower and late at night when she was very tired,
Getting ready to fall
Asleep on her bed of stones, she would look out the
Window, up into
The sky, and twiddle her thumbs and sing a song that
She just made
Up. she didn't know why. it was just about a feeling
That she had. and it
Sounded something like this...

I love you from far away
Like I love the moon
You are the brightest star
In my cartoon

someday I'll find you
Whoever you are
I know you are out there
But where?
You couldn't be far

now this princess got very very smart after years of
Thinking in the tower
And it began to dawn on her that perhaps the
Invisible wizard wasn't
Even there! so, she approached the gigantic door
That kept her locked

into the tower and she OPENED it! then tiptoed
Carefully down the
Stairs to the bottom where lo and behold she walked
Into a clearing in
The woods and she was free! and you'll never
Believe it but there was
An entire village of forest animals and people
Dancing and singing. they had been
Waiting for her all these years! they sang together...

I love you from far away
Like I love the moon
You are the brightest star
In my cartoon

someday I'll find you
Whoever you are
I know you are out there
But where?

All you jabronis in the locker room
You can all come kiss The Rock's ass!
'Cause you know after The Rock lays a smack down
On some big fat ugly hermaphrodite!
The Rock needs a little distraction
And a slice sounds just right

The Rock's, thanks ladies, and more kind words
Grandmother said (Be polite, eat mine first
So I sat down, tried her, she looked quite glad
Had a strange tastin' mold, but it wasn't so bad)
That's right (The Rock, havin' pie in the country
Devoured, here's her aunt, and Stella was hungry)
That's all Rock said? (Bored, readin' the paper
Til finally a plate of the next door neighbors
Dogged it down fast, 'cause it really did please)
I mean it tasted so good, Rock was talkin' Chinese!
(Ching-bang-wing-gon-aiiiii!! That good pie!)
Oh, that's the pie you was talkin about

Oh yeah, The Rock knows the millions can smell it now
It's tough to be The Rock!
No, no, no, no, it really is
Because you all know, The Rock is the most!
Electrifying man in all of showbiz!
You see when The Rock gets too much, too much of the fame
And all the bright lights, he loves to kick back and have a slice
No, no, no, no, no, The Rock is gonna eat the whole damn pie!",Pie,2001
The Rock,"Yo this is the Rock kicking it with the Refugee camp
And you're bout to smell what the Rock is cookin'

Yo this is strictly a club record
Dedicated to everybody who used to stand outside in the cold
When the F-L-E-X was spinnin at the Red Zone, hooded down
And these tired bouncers would not let me in
YouknowwhatI'msayin?

Yo, yo, yo
I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

Back in the days it was all about the clubs
And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!
Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday
Me, I used to stand outside
Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!
Who's performin tonight?  He said Shabba
Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector
(Stop drop the Rock's up in here)
Disrespect emcees and catch a smack in your left ear
Light up like Vegas when it's time to gamble
Girls scream for me like I was part of the Beatles
But I'm not honey, but I could be your Paul McCartney
and ""Ebony or Ivory"" into my Jacuzzi
Foundation like Kool Herc, or DJ Red Alert goes bezerk
The needle ain't skip the record jerked
Cause y'all jumpin' too hard
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

I got fifty Bentley's in the West Indies
(It doesn't matter!)
I got a pocket full of cheese and a garden full of trees
(It doesn't matter!)
What? I just won the bingo bought a crib in Rio
(It doesn't matter!)
Yo cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin
Yo Rock I just bought a fresh Bentley
(It doesn't matter you just bought a fresh Bentley!)

How many of y'all ever been to a barbecue
And you always got an aunt or uncle
wanna show you how the old dances go
And they start it off like this
Electric slide on the dance floor
Freaky-deaky like Studio 54
GIRLS!! Until the IRS raids it
Drug money get converted into music
The dope man becomes an entertainer
Leave that crack alone! I told the customers
I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend
You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine
And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk
Excuse me I gotta cough
Girl you wearin' so much ice you could freeze New York
You're man must really love you, what does he do for a living?
(He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week)
That's when she said a little too much conversation
Think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation
So I proceeded with the conversation, I said
Can I offer you a glass of Merlot Mrs. No Name?
(Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica)
She had the ass the size of South America
She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera
way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca""
What hood you come from?
I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem yup, that's short for New Jersey
Checked my watch it was a quarter to three
Slid to her crib when we opened the door
Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

Now what it look like, it ain't really that
(It doesn't matter!)
So he cocked the gat at my top hat
(It doesn't matter!)
Are you crazy? You was married!
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin

Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man
And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more
And she said this

Take me home, to the place
I belong at the Refugee Camp
And the Booga basement
That's where I live, oh

Come on
Yo Rock I sold like seventeen million records
(It doesn't matter how many records you've sold!)
Alright I'm with you, yo check it out
You wanna go get diamond rings?
(It doesn't matter if the Rock wants to go get diamond rings or not!)
Man listen, listen
I just got two new Grammy's man
(It doesn't matter about your Grammy's!)

I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean
He plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist
A pinball wizard
S'got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?

He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets a replay
Never seen him fall

The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him

So keep going till you know when its time, when its right
Keep showing yourself in that light
Cause back in school man that gets cruel
But one thing is true is that man now look at you
Your heart is big enough for two

Because I can hear the memories in my ears
Back to the years and all those tears
But hear me when I say I'm glad because we're here

But we're just so stuck in this moment and it's clear that we're coming undone

And you see it's hard for me to breath
When I got all worked up with these feelings
And I don't know exactly how it is
But we can be so mad we consider it to not exist
But we both know that there's so much love clenched within our fists

The goodbye waves, in the driveway
Just resonate
And, yes, I'm throwing it right back at her
While we're drowning in rivers from our face
As we just want to know ""if this, is this, over""
A trembling silence fills the air
As we stand here
So impaired 
But so aware

Sit in this house
Alone with fresh photographs
And I just can't relax
Cigarette smoke 
I'm starting to choke on this
And half of my soul is on the road in a car with the girl in a dress

And see it's making it hard for me to breath
When I got all worked up with these feelings
And I don't know exactly how it is
Just to say you're right, you're wrong, we both lose to it

The goodbye waves, in the driveway
Just resonate
And, yes, I'm throwing it right back at her
While we're drowning in rivers from our face
As we just want to know ""if this, is this, over""
A trembling silence fills the air
As we stand here (oh whoa)

So hey now
Maybe we're being stupid
Maybe we're being dumb
Maybe it's time that we stopped and we realize 
That fighting will win 
We are one
How at first it's pure and lovely
The battle can be torn to shreds

With time and with patience
And with love and affection
Can beat this with needles and thread

Because I love you
And do you love me?
And nothing will make that sway
I said I love you
And do you love me?
And nothing will make, could make, could make, could make it sway
So remember me

Remember me
(Yeah)
Remember me

I'm wanting this to be
A super natural flood of life
And not just make believe
Singing about what's real to me
Gasping for air, trying to breathe
While being put down by me
While thinking
Oh so hard to just stay alive
Treading over time
While I'm slowly dying
I take one last breath
And one last prayer
To survive
The waves they break me
The air hits my face
My unthinking prayer
This new found grace
I swallowed the air
Quick to erase
Its such a beautiful day

I was to myself
Thought I was on my way

When you don't have a thing to say

looking for the folks who try to say
that we don't know until were old cause
that's how it goes but what do i know, oh
And please pick me I'm a terrible mess
You know I just can't help it and I just gotta confess

Oh! Oh! you know I gotta know, yeah, oh no

So I'll be making up things for you to see
Like romantic lights surrounding Italy
Cause you deserve the very best, and I'll never rest
So I'll be sure to pass that test
And I just smile and say whoa cause you just gotta know
That every time we stay you never lose your way
It reaches to the stars shines up the clouds and lights up this whole world
Bless your heart you've made me happy again
It's been so long and I'm sick of pretending
You've enlightened the pain in my heart

I do want to make this go on for too much longer

Stops. Try to please the world and beat the ticking
Clocks, but I, I'm not letting it happen this time.

No no because if you don't fail, and reach your bail,
I feel so secure when I'm in this jail, but I, I'm not letting it
Happen this time

So I'll move to the other side of the block
So we won't ever have to stop making the rounds, having the laughs
Singing the sounds of relaxing, and on the other side

That I left my name on her lips
Cause when it ends they'll swear it is

About all the things that forever
Will kick me down the steps
For being too nice
Cause everyone's searching for treasure

And they'll just dig, dig, dig
Until they can't get out

There's so much I just want to get out
Since graduation was long ago
Please somebody get me out of this hole
Cause I don't want to get stuck in here
When I am thirty-four just talking about high school years
No I don't want to be there an I feel so stuck right here
Back and forth side to side oh my dear
My foot to the floor I will drive to the place
Where I can kick it with friends through the night
A place well talk about now and the past what the future holds
Hanging out with not much to do
Just aimless with each other is what we do

Cause this ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But its like were our own brat pack
Were always kickin' back nobody can take that
That is that it's like its all we have

Whoo whoo ya oh come on

Say oh oh get on the floor
Dance till you got no more
I know its there somewhere
Don't worry ill be there to rock the party all night
To rock into this night our fists in the air
Fightin' a good fight
Cause we were singing along to Peter Gabriel sledge hammer song
You know it's clear that tonight we belong in this place
So I stand back to reflect in this town I hate
At least just for a second I think I might stay

This ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But its like were our own brat pack
Were always kickin' back nobody can take that
And that is that

So ill run away to the hopes that I have
That still I fall asleep in the arms of my past
And when I wake so helpless and thinking of that just lay back down

Again

Everyday

So maybe later toady ill know
What I will do with my life as I know it
Maybe for now ill drive back to that place where I belong
And hope to god it hasn't changed

This ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But its like were our own brat pack were always kickin' back

That every time I'd fall.
Sometimes I wonder why I talk.
I don't know how I could have thought
That you had found a place to stop,
Just hoping like me you had thought
That we're all we've got.

Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in the hood and they take everything you wearin

Back in the days it was all about the clubs
And the so-called thugs used to dance the break for love
The girls, they wouldn't say HEY!
Unless you bought 'em champagne like it was they birthday
Me, I used to stand outside
Hustlin my way in I'm on the guest list plus five!
Who's performin tonight?  He said Shabba
Mister Lover Daddy he be the selector

Drug money get converted into music
The dope man becomes an entertainer
Leave that crack alone! I told the customers
I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend
You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine
And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk

You're man must really love you, what does he do for a living?

(Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica)
She had the ass the size of South America
She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera
way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca""
What hood you come from?
I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem yup, that's short for New Jersey
Checked my watch it was a quarter to three
Slid to her crib when we opened the door
Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

Now what it look like, it ain't really that
(It doesn't matter!)
So he cocked the gat at my top hat
(It doesn't matter!)
Are you crazy? You was married!
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin

Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man
And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more
And she said this

Take me home, to the place
I belong at the Refugee Camp
And the Booga basement
That's where I live, oh

Come on
Yo Rock I sold like seventeen million records
(It doesn't matter how many records you've sold!)
Alright I'm with you, yo check it out
You wanna go get diamond rings?
(It doesn't matter if the Rock wants to go get diamond rings or not!)
Man listen, listen
I just got two new Grammy's man
(It doesn't matter about your Grammy's!)

The Rockin' Ramrods,"The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go

They were right, I was wrong

The Rockin' Rebels,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream

The Rockin' Vickers,"The moon is bright above
Oh, what a night for love
And as I hold you near
I whisper in your ear
 
I go ape everytime I see you smile
I'm a ding-dong gorila and
I carry on cave man style
I'm gonna bop you on the head
And love you all the while
 
Well, I'm a monkey's uncle
Who's a cousin to a chimpazee
Like I was reelin and rockin
And swingin from a coco-nut tree
 
Oh, honey can't you see
You bring out the monkey business in me
 
Orangotango ring-ting-tong
I'm related to old King Kong
Honey won't you say you're mine
With no hunky dunky monkey shine
 
When you hold my hand
I'm a pre-historic man
I go ape!
 
Like a barrel of monkeys
On an aba-da-ba honey moon
I go squealin and screechin and howlin
Like a big baboon
 
Well, baby I'll explode
If you don't come and kiss me soon
 
Yeah! Ooh!
 
Ohh... Honey you know that
I'm gonna be true to you
I'll keep you in bananas 
and bring you coco-nuts too
And we'll settle down
In the nearest county zoo

The Rockin' Vickers,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
