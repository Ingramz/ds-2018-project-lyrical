(KL)
Whenever I call you friend
I begin to think I understand
Anything we are
You and I have always been ever and ever

(KL/SN)
I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do, always takes me home to you
Ever and ever

(KL)
Now I know my life has given me more
Than memories day by day...we can see
(SN)
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

(Chorus) (KL/SN)
Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
Sweet love flowin' almost every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
Sweet love flowin' almost every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it right

(SN)
Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are you and I were meant to be
Forever and ever

(KL)
I think about the times to come
Knowin' I will be the lucky one
Ever our love will last
I always want to call you friend

Stevie Nicks,"Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh ooh ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh

And the days go by
Like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own
I begin again
Said to my friend, baby
Nothin' else mattered

He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him all alone
On the edge of seventeen

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh

I went today maybe I will go again
Tomorrow
And the music there it was hauntingly
Familiar
When I see you doing
What I try to do for me
With the words from a poet
And the voice from a choir
And a melody nothing else mattered

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh

The clouds never expect it
When it rains
But the sea changes colors
But the sea
Does not change
And so with the slow graceful flow
Of age
I went forth with an age old
Desire to please
On the edge of seventeen

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh

Well then suddenly
There was no one left standing
In the hall yeah yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
I went searchin' for an answer,
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing
Come away come away

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh

Well I hear you in the morning
And I hear you
At nightfall
Sometime to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you
My love
I'm a few years older than you

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Oh baby oh said oh",Edge of Seventeen,1981

Let yourself lay back within your dreams
Take on the situation but not the torment
Now you know its not as bad as it seems

Well I know you'd like to come away
But baby you can't come
Your fortune is your life's love
Oh and anytime you think about leaving

Stevie Nicks,"There was no message to be found anywhere in sight
Inside or out
I had looked everywhere but the only lamp left on in the house
Was a blue light, a blue light

I was not ready, I'm no enchantress well I was too proud
Go find some Christmas angel then give that to her
If that's what she wants, guardian angel
Guardian, if you were wiser you would get out

Downstairs the big old house is mine
Upstairs where the stars still laugh and they shine
Downstairs where the big old house is mine
Outside where the stars still laughin'
Stars still laughin' shinin'
Stars still laughin' cryin' shinin'
Stars still laughin' cryin' shinin'
Stars still laughin' shinin' shine!

Don't listen to her listen through her
Some Christmas angel
Huh freedom well give that to her ooh
Well is that what she wants guardian angel
Guardian if you were wiser you would get out ooh yeah
Ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh

And the light that shines through the shinin' night
Is the lamp that I carried from my mother's home
And the light that burns through the window pane
And the love remains",Blue Lamp,1981
Stevie Nicks,"There is a gate
It can be guarded
Well it is not heaven
And it has a garden
So to the red rose
Grows the passion

And the guardian
Well it's now you know
It's just a few days away
It's now you know
And it's then
It's just a game that we play
Someone steals it

Someone steals it away
Scares you to death
You don't give in to yourself
You give in to your friends
Don't send an answer
How many times have you said

Do I love you
Well I always did everynight
Nobody knows nothing 'bout it

Well it's now you know
It's everywhere

Should not be left alone
Two in love should confess
And not be left alone

Then there's one thing that I'd like to say
Take a look at your life and your lovers
Nothing ever changes

Oh it was just the first time
That I ever played for you
I could be the dancer of your dreams

I can turn all your music on
I can make you feel alive
I am gone but I'm never gone from you
It was just the first time

Come back little boy
Baby come back yeah little boy

Stevie Nicks,"Learn to be a stranger
Blond on blond
In silence she says Excalibur
I beg of you now
What was it that fell
Was it

One fallen leaf
Like the feather that it was
Was freedom by choice
Or baby was it love
Was it a thorn in your side
Something that you hide
Something you don't touch
Because it hurts too much
Oh

Well have you come to see
That my face is not seen
Oh outside my frost covered windows
Oh and just how deep
Do you hold that dream
In your hands each night this time
In your hands each night this time

Oh was it you
I heard calling which voice
Well I know that you are going
Which voice
Did I force you to remember
In the sacred name of love

To be brave save the stranger
Sable on blond
Dark upon light
Because it hurts too much
Just how deep
Do you hold that dream
In your hands each night
In your hands each night
In your hands each night

Ooh I beg of you now
What was it that fell
Well this time I think it was you babe
This time

This time
Oh well I think that it was you baby
This time",Sable on Blond,1983
Stevie Nicks,"You say I have everything
Well I'm living on dreams and chains
But I sing for the things money can't buy

You say you don't believe
Well could you just look at me
Look deep into my eyes my love
Well have you ever been in love
Have you touched the soul of someone
Did the fear inside you make you turn and run

I'll take off my cape for you
I'll take down my hair for you
Anything you want me to do my love
Well, I'll sit home and wait for you
Oh darling there's nothing that I'd rather do

Anything you want me to do my love
Make you turn and run away from me
Oh, she said anything baby",I Sing for the Things,1985
Stevie Nicks,"Baby how much closer could we be
I swear you've become a part of me
You are with me everywhere I go
If you feel it I already know
Everything I say to you is true
I don't want to tell you what to do

But if I were you
I would take the love I'm giving to you
Oh if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If I were you

I would trust in me like I trusted in you
Oh, if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I know what you're dreaming when you sleep
You have secrets I will always keep
And in every morning when we arise
I see my reflection in your eyes

Every boy must learn to be a man
Maybe I can help you, yes I can

But if I were you
I would take the love I'm giving to you
Oh if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If I were you

I would trust in me like I trusted in you
Oh, if I were you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Well, I believe that love is a living thing
Born into our destinies
From a single moment of inspiration
And as it grows it changes your life forever!

But if I were you
I would take the love I'm giving to you
Oh if I were you

Stevie Nicks,"He says to her why do you do it
She says to him why do you stay
Then they say unspoken words to explain it
He says, baby, I hate to see you this way
I hate to see you
I hate to see you cry

Well, you can get her
But you can't keep her
And you can't catch her fall
She will call you
When she needs you
You know where she lives
The Imperial

She sits across the table the same glass table
Cries to her friend why am I so alone
He says, wo baby, baby, baby, baby
This is the path you have chosen
She probably goes under another name
Well, that's a good idea

So, you can get her
But you can't keep her
And you can't catch her fall
Well, she will call you
When she needs you
You know where she lives
The Imperial Hotel

Who's there
Where has she gone
But, I think she just went home

Sits across the table same glass table
And she cries to her friend why am I so alone
He says, whoa, wo, baby oh, my baby
You have to know you have to know

She knows in her heart
That he will stand by her
Anywhere don't cry, baby
I can save you
Don't cry baby, I can save you
She's at the Imperial Hotel
Don't cry baby, I can save you",Imperial Hotel,1985
Stevie Nicks,"Thrown down through the arms of sleep
She fell through the ivory morning
Deep into the waters
Of the one she called love
She paled in the wake
Of what some call a dream
But, you cannot know a dream
Till you've known the nightmare

When I stood with you against the storm
And I tried once again
Well, I said, ""I'd like to leave you
With something warm""
How many times
Drowning in the sea
Drowning
That was when the dream took her prisoner
And she knew the dream was over
But, the nightmare was not over
Still some call that a dream
The nightmare... the nightmare

Well, you cannot know a dream
When you turn away
You don't know
You'll never care
The night is not your friend
And you have not had her
And when the nightmare ends
But, you never understand
When you're gone
She wakes up calling out
Oh, calling out
As children may cry as she will

Anytime, oh, anywhere
Blinded by the light of the day
She has known the nightmare

So about the moon and her sisters
How dare he take them prisoner
Well, if she had flung out her heart against him
Then in all of her wisdom
Oh, well that was a mystery

That was when the dream took her prisoner
And she knew the dream was over
But the nightmare was not over
Somewhere in her ancient ways
She walks through the night
And then she tries to get through the day
Some will never know
Or share any kind of dream

The nightmare
This is not the world
This is not the world
This is not the world
The nightmare
She wants him to fight, anytime, anywhere
She wants him to stand up
She wants him to win
This is not the world
This is not the world
This is not the real world
Blinded by the light of the day
Blinded by the light
She was blinded by the light of the day
Blinded by the day",The Nightmare,1985
Stevie Nicks,"I was just that old
That August dark, dark day
Swear that you never saw her face
Swear that you never heard her say

No small command
What was it she wanted
They say she had everything

From the pages of a book

Well I either say too much, or I 
I don't say enough
Well I play too hard
Still I'm not tough enough

Ah, ha come around
Tonight, indecent baby well,
You fill the room
With the rain and the wind and the water

If you tell me,
One more time
Oh baby, take it easy
Well, you won't see me ever again

With the faith of a child
And so go the faithless

Even when it's calm, still rock a little
Just like the sea, I rock a little
Say it was just like me
Still rock a little

Then you knew her, funny little dancer
And you watched her all night long
You were trying to learn from her teachers

She would not be tangled up, in it

Oh, I know lily
Rock a little

She says rock and roll ballerina

Where does she live?

Well, I think you will like Sister Honey
She will help you
Make up your mind
Even if you don't need her
Tell her you need her
She needs you brother
She needs you brother

Strange fascination
Some kind of temptation
To know Sister
Never having allowed yourself
Do you understand the word, pleasure
Well, you say it's just never crossed your mind
And she believes you

Can we still be friends
The answer's always yes
Even best intentions turn around one day
Saying

Nobody's right, baby
All the time
And a fool never knows what he's leaving behind
So take some time to know the real story
Cause a soul that's true is your ride to glory
Don't let that golden hair get in your way , baby

Can we still be friends
The answer's always yes
Even best intentions turn around one day
Saying

Come back solemn stranger
It's your last chance
She's almost gone, now
And she'll go fast like a jet plane
And then fast like a star stream
She'll hit you with a fury
Whispering the words one more time, baby
One more time
And she says don't let that golden hair
Get in your way now",Sister Honey,1985
Stevie Nicks,"In the beginning I believed in love and things
It happened like a hurricane
I could never really tell you what this did to me
I could never make it better for you
Anyway

Thing is
Time was
Part of me used to love you
Part of me still does
This light here
Some become strangers

Did it have to be so easy to live without it?
I was hoping to remember you with just a smile
Now the memory of giving you is giving out
Well, I could say that I knew it all the while

[Chorus]

Didn't want to be the one to
Say goodbye
In a stranger's eyes
Look how we've changed

I don't really need this in my life
Why don't we forget about it?

Thing is

Part of me still does

Baby, you're no stranger
You're no stranger
Not that I am

Stevie Nicks,"I can see we're thinkin' bout the same things
And I can see your expression when the phone rings

Don't turn around ,there's nothing here to fear

You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free,baby

Dusty words lying under carpets
Seldom heard well must you keep your secrets
Locked inside hidden safe from view
Well,is it all that hard
Is it all that tough
Well,I've shown you all my cards now isn't that enough
You can hide your hurt
But,there's something you can do

You can talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
I can set your secrets free,baby
La, la, la, la

Though we lay face to face and cheek to cheek
Our voices stray from the common ground where they could meet
The walls run high, to veil a swelling tear
Oh,let the walls burn down,set your secrets free
You can break their bounds, cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt,cause you'll find no danger not here

[Chorus]

Oh,I can see you running, I can see you running
I can see you running all the way back home
I can see your expression when the phone rings
And I can see your thinkin' bout the same things
Is it all that hard
Is it all that tough

Hey I thought I was smart, I'd won her heart
Didn't think I'd do, but now I see
She's worse to him than me, let her go ahead
Take his love instead, and one day she will see
Just how to say please, and get down on her knees
Hey that's how it begins (uh), she'll feel those needles and pins
A-hurtin' her, a-hurtin' her

Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up and tell myself I'm strong

Because I saw her today, I saw her face, it was a face I loved, and I knew
I had to run away, and get down on my knees and pray that they'd go away

All's asleep, one sole light,
Just the faithful and holy pair,

Stevie Nicks,"Somewhere out in the back of your mind
Comes your real life and the life that you know
It seems like it was the creation of some of those same old things
It seemed to be the only thing left out in the light
She had trusted many
But been unfamiliar with
Almost everyone but you

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself
I have known this much longer than I've known you

She had trusted many
And then there would be someone who would enter into her presence
That she could sense for miles
She dreamed of her wanton luxury
And she laughed and she cried and she tried to taunt him
And he hated to be separated
From that picture No

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Ooh, well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself
Well I have known this much longer than I've known you

Long nets of white cloud my memory
Long nets of white cloud my memory
Ooh there is magic all around you
Everytime you walk in the room

Everytime that you walk in the room

Stevie Nicks,"Well I heard she flew down to the Mountain City
He said that's not what I heard I hear she went higher
She depended on her friends to tell her when to stop it
To make a statement this is me talking to you

Like Alice through the Looking Glass 
She used to know who she was
Call out my name call out my name
But I get no answer she prays 

Better run for your life cried the Mad Hatter
Alright said Alice I'm going back 
To the other side of the mirror I'm going back
Oh no, you cannot tell a gypsy ooh, that she's no longer a member
Become a deadly weapon now along with everything else
Oh call my name

Like Alice through the Looking Glass 
She used to know who she was
Call out my name like Alice through the Looking Glass
But I get no answer she used to know who she was
And she prays for the world that she comes from

Each had their own charm 
Buried beneath a solid piece of armour or a steel plated vest
Some carry a stiletto in their garter along with everything else
That they carry oh, call my name 

Like Alice through the Looking Glass
She used to know who she was
Call out my name like Alice through the Looking Glass
But I get no answer (she used to know who she was

You can try, but you can't get me 
Into the fire

And, baby, I can't walk this wire

'Cause I got just one thing to say to you
And, baby, that's all

It was very nice...it was everything

""Cause I'm doing the best that I can

But I paid a price for it...

And it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
And I'm trying hard to change...I'm doing it the best that I can
Well because fate causes fortune and fortune takes it away
Well it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can

I was silent...I was locked away
But I covered my tears...
Silent all day
It's out of my hands here

In my distress...well I wanted someone to blame me
In my devastation...I wanted so to change
In my way...disaster was the only thing that I could depend on...

But it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
Yes it's alright, baby...I'm doing the best that I can
Because fate causes fortune and fortune takes it away

Stevie Nicks,"A huge fire was burning
And her eyes grew strangely bright
She turned around in her room 
What could she take and still survive the fire
But then again, there was a window
You know it's an illusion 
There is no fire burning just a soul crying

So cry for me take a little time and then stop
It's just something that you cannot see so stop
She swings around on the second story 
I'll get down she says
Well there is no fire burning just a soul crying

I will you know
So I take it to the limit
I will you know as I always have
I understand your position 
I withdraw my decision
Well I've got no more information for you

So still there is a fire that no one sees
She doesn't even see it either 
Or so everyone thinks 
But then again, there was a window

There were many nights
And a few of them, were all that you had dreamed of

And the ghost of the past that you live in

It's just the ghost of what you really want
And it's the ghost of the past that you live in
And it's the ghost of the future you are frightened of
So you look to your guardian angel

So long ago I was an innocent 
It had nothing to do with age
One day they were lovers one day they were friends
There was nothing else to say

Well just the ghost of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
It's the ghost of the future that you're so frightened of
So you turn to your guardian angel

And a few of them were all that you really dreamed of
Love was the thing 
So the silver-haired girl looks for escapism

To feel the empty spaces she's feeling
She depends on her music like a husband
And she knows it's no good to fall in love again 
One day they were lovers one day they were friends
There was nothing else to say

It's just the ghost of the past of what you want to be
And the ghost of the past that you live in
Ghost of the future that you're so frightened of

For ending what we had begun

She consults her book of miracles

Cry and the wind says fly on

You're back out on the road again for a million reasons
Well, you're back out on the road again

And you try to tie together some connections 
You get some ribbons and some bows
And get back out on the road again

So you found a queen without a king
Oh yes, and everyone here loved her
No one was wrong

But you're a little bit like her
You're just a little bit like her
A little bit like her, a little bit like Juliet

And there's a mirror I'm looking through
Lost in the place where I was born
Without a hand to hold on to

Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

In the docklands where I was born 
People keep moving to and fro
Everybody's pushing, trying to make it happen
I beg of you, I beg of you, I beg of you 

I miss you more than I thought I could
I need you more than you know
I was there when they took you away from me
I'll be there when they let you go

And then the people who roam the docklands
And all the ships passing in the night
And the thousands of things that I have dreamed
Stay in the daylight
Sometimes I feel like I'm in a foreign land
And there's a mirror I'm looking through
Well, bring me back to the place where I was born
Without a hand to hold on to
Give me your hand
Give me your hand, give me your hand
Give me your hand in the docklands
I beg of you give me your hand 
In the docklands",Docklands,1994
Stevie Nicks,"Rhinestone collections all the time
I wonder what Greta would say 

Another lady another time 
Another heartbroken state of mind
Alone in her chambers she dreams of her home
Outside she's got a movie star view
Outcries well where will the kings go 
Where will the kings go now
She's got her eyes wide open 
And she's ready to stare you down
She says in words unspoken she's from out of town
Well some cry well I really don't dance down
Stormy weather it cuts like a knife

She's got her bags packed 
And she's off to the valley where the
sun meets the sea
You understand that 
She wants to live by the ocean 
And no one is pleased
She gets a house in the mountains 
The next day the next day she leaves the station

Do you really want to change her 
Or is it your right

Ooh alone in her chambers she dreams of her home
In a very real way she's the purist art form
I bet she said just how many art lovers can one
Get to know
She doesn't have an hour 
She doesn't have five minutes 
She's got to go!

She's got her bags packed 
And she's off to the valley where the
sun meets the sea
You understand that
She wants to live by the ocean

Stevie Nicks,"Such a little girl, such a hard life
She could look a challenge, right between the eyes
Disappointment, would become her middle name,
Up against the wall, Jane
So her nights became nightmares,
As she fought for their souls
And the days became worse,
For the ones she had lost
Children of the world,
The forgotten chimpanzee
In the eyes of the world,
You have done so much for me

There are angels, here on earth, angels
There are angels, here on earth,
Angels, send from God
Come away from the wall, stay with us
Well you can, Jane

So she watched as they put them all into cages
Well they might as well have caged her very own baby
They might as well have put us both into prison
Through a window, all our sorrows,
Would become our only visions,
Nothing more

There are angels here, angels
There are angels here on earth, angles
Angels, send from God
You will never feel, that you have ever done enough
But you have, Jane

Such a little girl, such a hard life
You could look a challenge, straight between the eyes
Disappointment, would become her middle name
Up against the wall, Jane
Nothing more then the shadow of a man
Come away from the wall, Jane
Well they might as well have put us both into prison
Come away, if you can, Jane
Through a window, all our sorrows, 
Will become our only visions
Come away, Jane, 
Come away, come away if you can

In the eyes of the world, you have done so much",Jane,1994
Stevie Nicks,"Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand outside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately he sees her ribbons and her bows 
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman--yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman--yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary she's my friend
Yes, I believe that I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Till she finally finds out that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pills

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear

That I just don't fit?
Yes, I believe it's time for me to quit
When we meet again introduced as friends
Well, please, don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

I fake just like a woman--yes, I do
I make love just like a woman--yes, I do
And I ache just like a woman
But I break, yes, I break like a little girl

It's just something I must do
Yes I can see you're waited for all over you

A symphony of sorts
Strange kind of love affair 
A declaration of war
No I won't be here tomorrow night 
You won't see me smiling
Tomorrow when it's very dark No crying 

I think that is the meaning of love
And I prefer to kick it
Yes I think that is the meaning of love

You must have many things to remember
Cause nothing else in your life has really changed

And I don't want to do this anymore

I'll be there when you fall

Is there are none at all

Why would I
Be a fool and break these ties

A different name
A different face.
No ones gonna see me cry

Stand by me, just one time.
I hope somebody stands by me
Stands by me, just one time

Where to let go
All I know is here I am baby
Won't you stand by me?

I'm not bending tonight
But, I'm twisted and turned
And broken down

But I'm starting to know 
The sound of something,
No one, and yet,
Everything.

Well if God's here tonight
Are you here tonight?

Maybe you could grab me up,
Stand me on my feet
Give me strength
Set me free.

I'm not giving in till
I've had enough.

And the heart skips a beat
So you're lonely
Creature of the night
It's been almost a week
Can you love me only

Look at me, for a very long time
Long enough to know
Love is a word - I've been trying to find
Words don't matter
They don't matter at all

Maybe it's only a dream
I don't want to feel that
Well it's one more link - in the chain
I don't believe that

So you're still lonely
You say that it's been forever
Maybe you never knew me
Maybe you thought that
I'd never change but
You know I'm changing
You're wrong

And it's been like dying
No love's that hard to find 
And I'm tired of 
I'm tired of trying
Outside the rain
And the heart skips a beat
So you're lonely

Look in my eyes
Touch my face
Baby, there's no one
That can take my place

Look in my eyes, touch my face
Baby there's no one that
Can ever replace that heartache

Said no to him again and again
First, he took my heart, then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I say unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First, he took my hand, take me home

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line
Standing in a line
I would cry

Do not turn away, my friend
Like a willow I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came

So I walked on down away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love
And that was all

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line
Standing in a line

That I've ever known
And love is only one
Fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades

The loneliness of a one night stand
Is hard to take
We all chase something
And maybe this is a dream
The timeless face of a rock and roll
Woman while her heart breaks
Oh you know the dream keeps coming
Even when you forget to feel

For me it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades

For me it's the only life

And love is only one fine star away

So I know how it feels there 
Well look up it's a shooting star
But it's as black as night no stars

Well this is the first thing,
That I've written
Since I wrote about freedom 
And then the wall came down
Well we thought it was a great beginning
People were free to cross the line
But then something happened in the desert
Something broke the stars into pieces

Well I live below a great red mountain
In the shape of a great huge beast
In a place the indians call Paradice Valley
Well this has always been my sanctuary
I send that to you too
There on the other side of the world
In the desert 
And we are the guardians
No black clouds just the faces of you

So where is my father,
Where has he gone
Where is my husband
Where is my son
Where is my father
Where has he gone

Is it real This war 
This can't be happening

The one that comes and goes
And only the highway-woman
Keeps up with the likes of those
And she in all her magic
With hands as quick as light
Took him to be a challenge
And went into the night

And he in all his glory
Was far ahead of her
But she was never sorry
For wishes that would burn
Enter competition
She chases beneath the moon
Her horse is like a dragonfly
She is just a fool

And she wonders is this real
Or does she just want to be Queen
And he fights the way he feels
Is this the end of the dream

And then he sees her coming
Heartbeats on the wind
Considers slowing down
But then, he could never win
And she, out in the distance
Sees him against the sky
A pale and violent rider
A dream begun in wine

And she wonders is this real
Or does she just want to be Queen
And he fights the way he feels
Is this the end of the dream

A dream as the thunder wakes her
And her highwayman disappears
On a life already lived before
In eyes welled with tears

With your sleepy eyes

And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by

Well don't you know, as you walk on by
That great temptations never really die 

Ooh the two of us 
Estranged sometimes for their very survival
Outraged at each other engaged to each other in their hearts 
But they live apart 

Two kinds of love 
One for the way you walk 
One for the way you love me 
You're a great temptation 

Two kinds of love

One for the way you love me

Have you gone so far from the eyes that 
Speak trouble and even when the warning is

Eyes that are all over you
That only some 
Make you lose your composure

Long before I knew it
There was a danger
And the danger was
To fall in love

Say you're leaving

Don't give up at all

Stevie Nicks,"Do you always trust your first initial feeling
Special knowledge holds truth bears believing
I turned around
And the water was closing all around
Like a glove
Like the love that had finally, finally found me
Then I knew
In the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal-like clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet
To the sea
How the faces of love have changed turning
The pages
And I have changed oh, but you...you remain
Ageless
I turned around
And the water was closing all around
Like a glove
Like the love that had finally, finally found me
Then I knew

Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal-like clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet

And it's seasoned my soul
And with every step you take,
I watch another part of you go...
I continue to build a wall...
You were so strong, 
I fell to my knees...
And I don't think I can handle this at all...
One more night 
I'd like to lie and hold you
Yes and feel...
To make you smile,
I'd like to be there for you--
Have you forgotten me?
And the days go by
Doing nothing about them...
How much time
Will I have to spend?
My mind won't rest
And I don't sleep
Not even in my dreams...
If you ever did believe, 
For my sake...
If you ever did believe....
And the days go by
Doing nothing about them...

You make me happy with the things you do,

But I'm beginning to wonder why.

Stevie Nicks,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

[Chorus]
Mama's in the fact'ry
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for the fuse
I'm in the streets
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

[Chorus]

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

The tears of rage I cannot fight

Nothing's true, and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
'Cause you can't change the way I am

Are you strong enough to be my man

Lie to me, but please don't leave

Just try and love me if you can

Stevie Nicks,"And when she walked in the room
After so many years,
He looked up and saw her
He was standing at the crossroads
She was moving in slow motion
Everything was the same,
Except that everything was different

In that very moment, everyone was silent
And everyone was friendly,
For the first time in years,
Everyone was smiling
Though their pain was apparent
And the floor was wet and slippery
With the tracks of their tears 

And then I see someone standing
At the side of the stage
Not standing in the shadows
I see her face
Glowing in the darkness
In her own angel way
""I have come to make you better,
I have come to take you away."" 

No one slipped and fell
This time, everyone was steady
Someone held my arm so that
I would not fall
For the first time, in a long time
Everyone was ready
No one said a word
And that simply said it all 

And then I see someone standing
At the side of the stage
Not standing in the shadows
I see her face
Glowing in the darkness
In her own angel way
""I have come to make you better,
I have come...to take you away.""
I'll make you better 

Walking through the room together
In suspended animation...
No one saw us go... no one said goodbye
But in my heart, I leave
Great expectations
That you will find the answers
To your questions
And that life will once more...
Be a celebration...
And that you will be touched by an Angel
And that you will be touched by an Angel
And that you will be touched by an Angel

I didn't ask when you shook your head 
I always accepted what you said 
As the truth and the truth only 
Well it's not enough that you depend on me 
And it's not enough that you say you love me 
It's not enough to just save face 
Because sometimes 
You just fall from grace 
Sometimes 
You just fall from grace 

Maybe I am calmer now 
Maybe things are fine 
Maybe I made the whole thing up 
Maybe it isn't a lie

Love is
You've got the softest lips

You know that I cannot stay
Yes, I know

Oh, yes it does
Do not call or come around here
Do not tell
You know that I loved you then

You've got the softest lips

Oh yes, I am
But when it's over
How then will you feel
Will you miss those arms that used to go
Around you

In the dark

Stevie Nicks,"The bright light is lying down
The earth and the sea and the sky
Is at rest with the ocean
And the days go by

They go into the seas that have no shores
Haunted by that same closed door
Looking up at skies on fire
Leaving nothing left of us
To discover

And the planets of the universe
Go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon
Or by the day
You and I will simply disappear
Out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be
No light

No doubt, no pain
Come ever again, well
Let there be light in this lifetime
In the cool, silent moments of the nighttime

And the planets of the universe
Go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon
Or by the day
You and I will simply disappear
Out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be
No light

We will never change again
The way that we are changing
Well, you'll forget the chill of love
But not the strain

Now I know
Well, I was wrong
To live for a dream
If I had my life to live over
I would never dream, no
I still wish you gone
And I will live alone
Yes, I will live alone

And the planets of the universe
Go their way
Not astounded by the sun or the moon
Or by the day
You and I will simply disappear
Out of sight
But I'm afraid soon there'll be
No light

You will never love again
The way you love me
You will never rule again
The way you ruled me
You will never change again
The way you're changing",Planets of the Universe,2001

Breaking my heart 
Injuring my mood 
With all of the things that I thought I knew

Will you write this for me 
He says no, you write your songs yourself

It made me hold on to me 

Well, I remember 
You caught my eye 
It was late September 
It was no surprise

No one spoke like him, he was someone
And I carried on, like I couldn't stop

Stood between me and my friends
It was my sin, it was my shame
You were unconscious to the pain I was in

And consider this...

I make excuses for you

You can consume all the beauty in the room, baby
I know you can, I've seen you do it
And it brings up the wind
And it rises around you in pillars of color

But the promise has been broken
As you walk through the shadow of death
You try to see no evil
But you are so heartbroken
You say, dear god, make it stop!

Before the dawn of separation
Brings up the wind
Rises around you
I hear there's trouble in shangri-la
In pillars of color
Trouble in shangri-la
I make accommodations for you

Things could go that far
We all believe in people...
That we think believe in god
Somewhere in the night...
Someone feels the pain
The ones who walk away
Try to love again...

And I come home
I hope to see this boy I know
I cant wait for us to be alone

Flipping through the radio
We sing along to the indie show
The songs they plague me more than I can say

In the tape I made you
Hope you think of me when it plays through
Feel kind of sad now that its done

And you think my times were free
All the ways you say to me
Sweet versions of lets wait and see

But you're always a golden boy
And I'm the girl that you enjoy
My parents say Is'nt he a gifted son
Time is always passing by
And still I have to wonder why
You cant come to tell me I'm the one

Summer goes and we have grown
We have our friends live on our own
Still I'm not the girl you want me to be

Say gravity can bend the time
Funny I always liked your mind
But this whole thing is crushing me

But you're always a golden boy
In this girls heart that you destroyed
You smile at me then have your fun
Time is always passing by
Still I give you another try
And hope that you will see that I'm the one

Say your scared
Get too close
Come lets see how it goes
See you now at the show
7th in the 7th row
Now when you look at me
You see what I've known for so long
Sad that you can be so lovely and so wrong

Came to say that I've moved
I see your face
You don't approve
I guess you could say that I'm already gone

But your always be my golden boy
I'm the summer girl
That you enjoyed
Some melodies are best left undone
I feel the time pass away
But in my songs you'll always stay
Don't need for you to tell me I'm the one
No, no
I don't need you to tell me I'm the one
You'll never know that I was the one",The One,2007

They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.

Giving up this circle dance
Worn out steps from long ago
Don't give love a chance

These twisted parts we play
I'm not her and you're not him
It just turn out that way

Can't go back to make things right
Though I wish I'd understood
Time has made things clearer now
We did the best we could

I'll be home soon, that's what you'd say
And a little kid believes
After a while I learned that love
Must be a thing that leaves

I tried so hard just to hold you near
Was as good as I could be
And even when I had you here
You stayed so far from me

Can't go back to make things right
Though I wish I'd understood
Time has made things clearer now

Well, I wanted you to know

Was to know that you were dreaming

Stevie Nicks,"It was many and many a year ago
In a kingdom by the sea
That a maiden lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee

This maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me
She was a child and I was a child
In this kingdom by the sea

But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged angels of Heaven
They coveted her and me

And the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines, but I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven
Went envying her and me
That was the reason, as all men know
In this kingdom by the sea
That the wind came out of the clouds that night
Killing my, my Annabel Lee

And the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines, but I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side

But our love was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Many far wiser than we
Neither the angels in Heaven above
Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee

And the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
And the sun never shines, but I see the bright eyes
I lie down by the side
Ohhh ohh

I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my life, my life and my bride
I lie down, by her side
I lie down, by her side
My darling, my life, my life and my bride
I lie down, by her side
I lie down, by her side oohh
I lie down, by the side oohh
I lie down, by the side
Of my darling, my life, my life and my bride
I lie down, ohhhh
I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my life, my life and my bride
I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my life, my life and my bride
I lie down oooooh
I lie down lie down
By the side",Annabel Lee,2011
Stevie Nicks,"What's cheaper than free?
You and me
What's better then alone?
Going home
What does money not buy?
You and I
What's not to feel?
When love is real

What's faster then a fast car?
A beating heart
What's deeper then a deep well?
The love into which I fell
More important then freedom?
Being needed
More exciting then high fashion?
High passion

Stevie Nicks,"She was so enticed by his smile
She was so unaffected by his dream
For his dream of her was just not possible
She was so not that girl
It was just one of those things that happened or didn't happen
A strand of golden hair tangled 
Like the words of a song, like a spider's web
Then he said, 

[Chorus]
Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home
No one really knows you
I'm the only one

She was so enchanted by his voice
She was so shaken by his words
His plan for her was just not possible
She had no words
It isn't just that we cause each other such pain 
At home or on the stage
Sometimes was heavenly sometimes was too heavy
I looked the other way

[Chorus]

Don't come here again 
Unless fear of fire leaves you cold
And the cold makes you tired
If you feel at all
It's all about desire
About when you were true
About a bird on a wire and that was you

She does still hear him all night long
The same song over and over, it heals her heart
No voice of a stranger could play that part
Broke her heart, 
Broke her heart

Everybody loves you
But you're so alone
Everybody knows your name
But you can't find your way home

Everybody loves you
But you're so alone

It tears you apart

Stevie Nicks,"Some call her strange lady from the mountains
Well, yes, and others say she's not really real
Like a candle burns bright
And it wants to burn faster
Well, maybe then, at least, she really feels
She really feels

Burning like a candle in the middle
She's lonely, lost, she's disconnected.
She finds no comfort in her surroundings.
Beautiful, insecure, she has nothing.
She moves from situation to situation, like a ghost.
Then she see's him, candle burning.

[Chorus]
It's strange, she runs with the ones she can't keep up with
It's so strange, slows down, so desperate to stop her
Meet her in the middle, they both run from the one who hunts them.
They drop to the forest floor, frozen,
They drop to the forest floor, frozen

He loves her, but he loves his life alone as well
But does he know the road or the reasons why
Well, if he leaves her
He'd be losing the chance to stay alive
Well, the candle burns bright
Then the candle dies
Burning from the middle
Like a candle

[Chorus]

Strange, she's laid on the floor in silent pain
Strange, she sat in the chair for months just staring
Strange, she knows too much to walk away
Strange, she couldn't do it anyway,
Strange, she's laid on the floor in silent pain
Strange, she sat in the chair for months just staring
Strange, she knows too much to walk away

When he first saw her, he fainted to the floor
Floor, floor

She was distant and arrogant from the start,
She did not see the fragile state of his heart
She fell in love with him, on that very day
She became softer, in every way

Even though they were so in love,
She drew a line in the sand, just because
They did not know each other, they did not trust
The only thing that they did together, was to make love

So paradise found was not paradise to him,
Oh yes he loved her, but he was still an English man
Tropical birds in the heat and the ocean,
Oh, it drove him crazy, drove her away from him

Even though they were so in love,
They drew a line in the sand, just because
They did not know each other, they did not trust
The only thing that they did together, was to make love

She burned his house down, saying you may have forgotten me,
But you'll remember this, you fell to the ground when you saw this
My face, my eyes, my lips,
You may have forgotten me but you'll never forget that kiss

Even though they were so in love,
They drew a line in the sand, just because
They did not know each other, they did not trust
The only thing that they did together, was to make love

When that big house burned down
All around her, in the smoke and the fire,
In the devastation, they never found her
She went back into her her red dress
Back to her white house
To her ocean and after that no words were spoken
About the two of them, ever again

And even though they were so in love,
They drew a line in the sand, just because
They did not know each other, they did not trust

'Bout even dying

So my friend is continuing
On a destructive road
His life passes before him like an
Unfortunate circumstance
He and his friend are at odds
And he is not winning...
Why does someone always have to win?
He says it matters...
Strange things do follow when you love someone
So you put that someone in exile
How about I call you Beloved Exile...

He called today
He says, ""Don't give up""
I ask him, ""What are you talking about?""
I said things are not the same...
Since you've been gone Rome burned down
And still it's all the same
So I moved away from the house that held nothing
But waiting for messages
And all through the day's seasons
I went running with the sun
And I pray every day for the answers
In a still and almost silent night
He began to hide his beauty
And I learned to say the words
Well, just whose side are you on, anyway?
You change sides
What does it matter?
Still you change sides
Every other day you just change sides

So, continue on your destructive road
Oh, your life passes before me
Like an unknown circumstance
You and your friend are at odds
And you are not winning
Why does someone always have to win?
And all those races that are run
They cause patterns
Strange things do follow when you love someone
So you put that someone in exile
And you say, ""I'll write a book about it and call it Beloved Exile""

Well, her life was a gas
Simply everything that happened
Well, the old lady said, yes it was sad
She fought a losing battle
One day at a time
She might even make it through tomorrow
Maybe in another show, natural inner beauty

Think it outta be all right with me

Listen, when I try to talk to you, baby
And let you know just how I feel
All you tell me if I don't like it
There's someone else out there will

Oh, I done got wise to you, woman
You're not the only bird that flies in the sky
Or if you don't ask me no questions, darling
You know I, I won't tell you no lie

Because I like love your arms to be 'round me
And your lip to be close to mine
Oh, I want to love you, woman
Be with you all the time

I'm comin'
Yeah, come on, I got her strength
Come on, call me
Yeah, going on down to [Incomprehensible]

Ooh, I done got wise to you, woman
You're not the only bird that flies in the sky
Or you don't ask me no question, darlin'
You know I, I won't tell you no lies

Because I like love for your arms to be 'round me
And your lip to be close to mine
Hey, I want to love you, woman
And be with you all the time

You know what I said
Ooh, haa
Come on now

Stevie Ray Vaughan,"Suck it up, going down
30 seconds till we smash into the ground
Passengers, have lost their smiles
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train

Another day, another flight
There's not a chance of going down
But then we just might, so this is it, this is goodbye
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train

Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
But I'm going nowhere
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
And I really don't care

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train

We're going down, we're out of sky
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind

I try to reach her, but she's not there
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
I ease the seat back and start to pray
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays",Going Down [Live][#],2000

She tried to give me that ""Coming to America"" spiel, y'knahmsayin like
""Some guys, put in an hour - some of 'em, even an hour and a half""
""But a man gotta put in overtime for me to get off"" [laughing]

[Chorus]
Work it baby (work it baby)
I'ma give you extra, you deserve it baby (deserve it baby)
Put a star next to you cause your perfect baby (perfect baby) all the time
Clock out, clock in for overtime (overtime)

If you think we 'bout to go to sleep - forget about it
You really doubt it, though we can make the synergys link
In the middle of the night I'm fixin to enter the pink
Never the one to be stingy I leave my dinner, she winks (geah)
Cause she think she got me and her percentage be Brinks
But I'ma stick it without a ticket in the tender she thinks
Suck me up and then I can become her energy drink (gyah!)
And that's what she gon' need (geah)
Punchin the clock, I'm not gonna be done on three
Baby you probably wanna kick it and get 'er done on E
But you ever have steamy sexual fun on weed?
So I told her N9ne!
No I don't look it but I'm the older kind
But that dont mean I'ma stick it and quit it, forget it
Because tonight I'ma 'bout to get it in overtime

[Chorus]

Said I - love your body, love your pace
Love it when you maneuver your body off my space
and weather the chase, and have your body off in a daze
Now could'cha feel the hormones, they off of the rage
Now check it - let me take a little dose of the page
I'm hittin for hours and hours, hours hours and days
All the positions I'm feelin real kinky today
I've waited to play my trombone have a parade (have a parade)
Kitty kitty kitty kitty c'mere
Well there's a couple little things I wanna say in ya ear
I'm shiftin gears, love it when I strike the wheel
Leave ya stoned in the bed I'ma freak for real!
Baby girl, I'ma freak for real
A little too much tongue got me head over heels
Wetter the chill, head shot ready to kill
Ready to deal, head watch, watch you will

[Chorus]

Baby, baby gave me a job and I love it
I know you'll be lovin the way you'll throb when you hug it
When I got the punani I thought the job really was it
Before the punani you take the job and you shove it
Feel like a nigga makin love when I does it
On the clock I'ma stop it, when it buzz I'ma plug it
Good enough for me to be your husband in public
You really be wantin to pack a stud in your luggage

Uhh! Pack a stud in your luggage
Break down baby Stone gon' love it
Finally bang her, make a nigga wan' love it
Make me wanna snatch it, C2 grub it
Huh! It's one of a kind
You and your girls, and I come on with the N9ne
Spread them legs and open wide
Give you that overtime

Couple birds in the stash

Bring in a map
Make my way through the middle northwest and head to the south
What you think this a game

Heading down outta lane I detoured on the route
They said that I'm over rated
Pussy I beg to differ
You want that
Dumb dumb dumb
Then I'm that nigga
Snake and Bat on my chest
Zodiac is a lie
Alter ego is animal put it on on the line
Bitch I'm breathing I'm live and well and I'm leading the line

Zombie out your fucking body then it don't even matter
Smoking drinking snow leaning nigga four piece platter
Got your club turnt up volume pumped to the maximum
Do it big keep it strange mane when we traveling
Weed and this other thing, Mayday got the marinade
Party with the zombies till the bodies hit the barricade
Maybe at a Tech Nine show I got some head in an alley
From a drunk white bitch that thought I was Krizz Kali

I'm a killer still in the back but I'm clapping though
In a matter of fact I been acting, so
Out of wack and my brain is on overload
I don't call anybody, ain't nobody calling me
Maybe I don't need a phone no mo'
Guess I won’t pay the bill and the villain is
spillin' venom in him till i’m a goner
And haters are catering to me with
Wishes that I wouldn't win any longer
Idiot, you're just making me stronger
Wanna kill me, then pay me no mind
Get a record to spot a bit longer
If you don't feel me then get on your grind
I don't mean to be mean but the measure
Is simple when you try to weather the outcome
Now I don't need a reason, killing any season
In fact I am better without one
You don't know anything about heat or the
Temp of the weather that I'm coming out from
And I wouldn't consider you equal like other people
Where the fuck is your album?
Shit to you is a hobby and obviously y'all
Ain't knowing to measure at all
Murdering it for pleasure, ain't fucking with godi
I'm sick with a medicine ball
Couldn't give 'em a shit, not even a little bit cause they haters, we know it

Seeking a miracle from a stained-glass Jehovah

Some are dead and some are living

There is no one compares with you

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",Somewhere Over the Rainbow,1998

Stevie Wonder,"Close your eyes; beddy-bye, tin soldier.
Mommy says that it's time for sleep.
If my folks were wiser and older,
They'd know kids and toys don't need sleep.

Don't be bad, little cotton dolly.
See how nice Mickey Mouse sleeps now?
Even my brass drummer boy has stopped all his noise,
Cause he knows it's past bedtime for toys.

Ya know, every Christmas, Santa Claus goes all over the world with his reindeer,
Sled, and a big bag of toys, and he'll come to your house this year, too.
But sometimes, just sometimes, he doesn't have enough time 
To see every little boy and girl, because the world is so big.
So maybe we should sing a song for all the children that Santa didn't visit.

Bless the child who has no tin soldier;
No brass drummer boy to put to bed. 
He will still grow wiser and older,
Loving one small rag doll, instead.

He won't have a cotton dolly;
Mickey Mouse won't come to his house.
Hold that rag doll to your heart; nothing can destroy 
The beauty one shall find in one small toy.",Bedtime for Toys,1967
Stevie Wonder,"It's Christmastime and its magic is here
It's Christmastime and its wonders appear
The scent of pine fills the Christmasy air
While the church bell chimes and there's joy everywhere

Some precious gift lights a little one's eyes
God's blessed lived, stays the weary and wild
This Christmastime, keep its magic right here
Within your heart everyday of the year

This Christmastime, keep its magic right here
Within your heart everyday of the year

Stevie Wonder,"Once upon a Christmas Eve
A shepherd who believed
That peace could come to any man
Made a promise to a star above
The day that love began.

""I will give to Him my lamb,
A shepherd's all I am.""
And so he walked the lonely sand
To find the place his heart was dreaming of
The day that love began.

Over meadows, over mountains
They came from valleys and from streams.
Every poet and every king
And one little shepherd with a dream.

But as the shepherd knelt to pray
His lamb just ran away
And teardrops filled his empty hand.
He broke his promise to a star above
The day that love began.

Then the smiling face of Mary
Beckoned the shepherd to her side
""Today you gave Him the best gift of all
The moment that you cried.""

Oh, once upon a Christmas Eve

That peace could come to any man

But a chair is not a house, and a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight,
And no one there you can kiss good night.

A room is still a room, even when there's nothing there but gloom,
But a room is not a house, and a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart,
And one of us has a brok, en heart.

Now and then I call your name,
And suddenly your face appears,
But it's just a crazy game, when it ends, it ends in tears.

you and me
Eternally
You and me
We're a reality
Peace of my mind 
Others are searching for
And never find 
We had it all the time

so in love 
That's how we live
Never take 
Darling we always give
Happiness
Is everyday
But it never would be 
If it wasn't for you loving me

I was lost
Like a rolling stone I had to roam
As if I knew
In time I'd find my way to you
Here I am
In a paradise just built for two
It's good enough for me
It's good enough for you

you and me eternally
You and me we're a reality
Peace of mind
Others are searching for
And never find 
We had it all the time

one more thing
I wanna to say
I sacrifice day and night
To keep me a good one

one more thing I forgot to say
I blessed the day I found you
Cause I feel my world around you

you and me eternally
You and me we're a reality
Peace of mind
Others are searching for
And never find 
We had it all the time

that's how we live

But it never would be if it wasn't for you loving me

I'll blow you a kiss or two.

Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky,

""Oh please Mr. Father Tree, the tallest of all,
I'm so afraid and so alone
Could one little Christmas tree
So tiny and small light up someone's home?""

'Cause one little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy

One little angel who was riding a star
Cried as she looked down at the tree,
""Oh please Mr. Father Tree, wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me?""

Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world,
""Go down little angel girl and give him your star,
Tonight he'll light the world""

'Cause one little Christmas tree
Can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day

But I want you to know:

Don't wonder why, my baby.  (No.)  Don't wonder why, my baby.

I can't let my heaven walk away;
Just can't let my heaven walk away.
Just gotta find a way to make her stay.
I don't know what I've done wrong.
Look up and find my heaven gone.

Called her name, but I called in vain.
I know she can't answer from a picture frame.
Only an hour ago, I held her in real flesh and blood.
She just grabbed her coat and said: ""please, I've had enough.""
She kept me well like a Sunday prayer.
Just like my own right hand, the girl was always there.
To every man but me, her eyes were blind.
I was in the promised land long before my time.

[Chorus]

I accused my baby of being a liar.
I said the flesh is weak in God's key trial.
I only asked her to hear her tell me no,
But my question back-fired; I didn't expect her to go.

Evil, why have you destroyed so many minds
Leaving room for darkness, where lost dreams can hide

Evil, why do you infest our purest thoughts, with hatred
Evil, why have you stolen so much love
Leaving everyone's emotions lost and wandering free

Evil, why have you taken over God's children's eyes, evil
Evil, before they could really grow to see
That your way, is not the way, to make, life what it should be

Crystal ringlets paint a picture of a gold sunrise above

Little girl you're sad
Though all you have
Is visible to you
Within your heart
There stays a part
That like the sky is blue

Shifting breezes, grace the inner spectrum of your glance
Leaves on branches, for your pleasure, perform a soothing dance

Little girl it seems
In all my dreams
Your happiness is due
But still they last
Their in your past
Events that make you blue

Thoughts of love are in your mind
Yet splintered hopes push them aside
A look at life is what you need to try

In an instant there'll be sunshine
Sprinkled every place
Drops of rain will kiss the softness of your lovely face

Little girl be fair
Show yourself you care
Let others care for you
Before it's too late
'Cause time won't wait
Till your heart's no longer blue

Little girl be smart
Don't break your own heart
There is love waiting for you
Before it's too late

Til your heart's no longer blue",Girl Blue,1972

Go knock on her door

Than just an ordinary pain in your heart

That it's more than just

But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart

Tell her you're glad
It's over in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back
Takin that ordinary pain from your heart

But tell no one else
That it's more than just

Forcing dangers way with his breeze

But just where or when he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find

Before your cycle ends?

When the true reflection of you that they see
Is love besieged by years?

Her beauty speaks of what we are
And her freedom makes us free
Her now is in eternity, infinite to all that see
And her dreams have been achieved
Now there is a sound of laughter
Nature sings out her name
For the world to know her fame

When they knew your love could cast its spell
And consecrate their eyes?

Stevie Wonder,"Born to open for mankind nature's door
A life known by a few
And those who knew that shared
Their knowledge fewer cared about what plants could do

For most felt it was mad to conceive
That plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we
But with instruments Bose would devise
Would take science itself by a surprise, so

On we go to where who knows
To a place where there's still non-believers
What will it take for heaven sakes
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in
It's that same old story again

Born of slaves who died too soon to realize
The need his life would be
Selflessly he gave
His wisdom to a way where first no minds would see

He said, ""If farm land was to be rich
We must plant crops to replenish it""
But it took him persuasion and tests
To convince them Canver's way was best, so

On we go to where who knows
To a place where there's still non-believers
What will it take for heaven sakes
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in
It's that same old story again

Provides the purest air we breathe

But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being

We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

A species smaller than the eye can see
Or larger than most living things
And yet we take from it without consent
Our shelter, food, habilment

But who am I to doubt or question the inevitable being
For these are but a few discoveries 
We find inside the Secret Life of Plants

But far too many give them in return 
A stomp, cut, drown, or burn
As is they're nothing
But if you ask yourself where would you be
Without them you will find you would not

And some believe antennas are their leaves
That spans beyond our galaxy
They've been, they are and probably will be
Who are the mediocrity

Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping 
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say 
Before his father said hey boy get right back in that bed

To find out who could really boogie the best

But his sister said please let him go so the world can see

Look at him he ain't nothing but a baby

You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer

Stevie Wonder,"I am a veteran of the war
I up and joined the army back in nineteen-sixty-four
At sixteen, I just had to be a man at any cost
I volunteered for Vietnam, where I got my leg shot off
I recall a quote form a movie that said ""who's more a man
Than a man with a reason that's worth dyin' for?""

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill
To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill
They put a gun in my hand and said ""shoot until he's dead""
But it's hard to kill when ""please, I'm your friend"" echoes through your head
Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life
But then put in the jungle where life has no price, no

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

Back in the world, the paper reads today
Another war is in the brewing
But what about the lives of yesterday?
And the many happy families that have been ruined?
My niece is a hooker and my nephew's a junkie, too
But they say I have no right to tell them how they should do
They laugh and say quit ""braggin' 'bout the war you should have never been in""
But my mind is so brainwashed I'd probably go back and do it again
I walk the neighborhood, parading my purple heart
With a fear of agent orange that no one will stop, no

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
They had me standing on the front line
But now I stand at the back of the line when it comes to gettin' ahead

Remnants of the feelings that we can no longer hide
Mighty, shining and clear
Are but mere expressions that don't come near
To the ever glowing eminence of light in our eyes tonight

Cause moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Feeling with tender love-bloom

Gentle, quiet, so soft
Are the wings of love that can send us off
To an ever splendor unknown to all in our time
Trusting in the unknown and giving in to what feelings have shown
Will take us to altered intimacies in our lives
Where we'll find

That moments aren't moments
Until they are moments like this magic moment of ours
And magic's not magic
Until it is magic like magical love in our hearts
Feeling with tender love-bloom

Stevie Wonder,"Every time I think our love is drifting apart
Something always throws it back together
And every time I think I've found someone new for my heart
After one kiss my heart tells me never

[Chorus]
Oh everyone has got a weakness in life
Girl, you just happen to be mine
Oh everyone has got a certain weakness in life
Your love just happens to be mine

Every time I think your love has no more to give
You do something more to take me higher
And every time I think that for someone else I could live
I'd be living love out as a liar

[Chorus]

We keep thinking that our love won't last beyond tomorrow
But our hearts say we're gonna stay in love this way

Or are my eyes playing tricks on me

Cause if I don't I'll have nothing left

Since Daddy caught me trying on his shoes
Now, I'm too old to be acting like this

My heart is beating like a big bass drum
And my mind is saying that girl's the one

Stevie Wonder,"You were brought up in a small town
Where everyone greeted with a morning smile
I mean the place was so free from crime
You could leave your front door open
And if your eyes were drawn from a lack of food
Or your pockets were short on cash
There was always someone close at hand
That you could always run to 

You could have been a doctor
And you could have been a nurse
But these things weren't good enough for you
So you decided to pack up all you own
And get a one-way ticket there
To a place where all the successful people went
In order for them to do 

I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl

L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, the land of la la 

You get off the bus, pick up a paper
And look through the classified
So that you might find a place
Suitable for you to move into
Then you turn around to pick up the duffel bag
That you brought along
But much to your surprise you find
Your bag has taken off walking 

You dig in your wallet
To get your last dime
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper
You're much too prideful
But pride has no defense
When all you've got in your possession
Is the wallet in your hands 

I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl
Remember only the strong can survive

You might get everything you want
But not want everything you get
Being in la la land is like nowhere else
Living in the land, one hell of a land, a land full of lost angels
Movie stars and great big cars and Perrier and fun all day
And that's enough to make anybody go wild
In the land of la la

Stevie Wonder,"I met her at lover's park
One rainy April Monday
Smiling soft and warm as on
A clear December Sunday
Wearing taffeta and lace
That matched her braided hair
With their coraled beads that sang to me  

She said 'hi' and asked me why
Was I looking with sorrow
When there were much brighter days
In store for me tomorrow 

I looked up at her and smiled
And said, why I don't know
But would she agree, to stay with me
And she said
Never in your sun, she said
Never in your sun, then she said
I will only come
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain 

So if you are at lover's park
And someone looks with sorrow
Ask them why are they so sad
When sunshine's theirs tomorrow
They'll reply they don't know why
And ask you please to stay
'Til the end of time, and when they're fine 

Be kind and say
Never in your sun, just tell them
Never in your sun, then say
I will only come
In your pouring rain, to relieve the pain, never, ever
Never in your sun, never in your sun, believe that
I will only come

Stevie Wonder,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far
For you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over love, over me

Over heart, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over love, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I

There is a missing person that I've just got to find
Now just how long they have been gone
I can't say at this time
I glanced outside my window surprisingly to see
The reflection of a broken man who looked somewhat like me 

I'm trying to find my whereabouts, what shall I do
When nothing seems to follow through
In me, trying to find my whereabouts, I'm turning blue
But wait I may have found a clue
My whereabouts are somewhere in yesterday with you 

Where is the missing one, the missing one

To try to match the feeling
In the joy I used to have
I traveled through the moments that held a special place
But every time what came to mind is that smile upon your face

Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else

Made everything right

No football hero or smooth Don Juan

Stevie Wonder,"No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Stevie Wonder,"Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon in the sky for our love

If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love

There's a ribbon in the sky for our love",Ribbon in the Sky,1996

Was for Christmas what would be my toy

Would not get a thing

Joy the day would bring

To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
But thought I told you not to go outside
Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her

Just don't tell I'll give you

Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right

Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason

You just say nothing's changed

Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours

Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours) Here I am baby,
oh, you've got the future in your hand
(signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
I've done a lot of foolish things
that I really didn't mean
Hey, hey, yea, yea, didn't I, oh baby

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touched them they did nothing, girl
Oo baby, here I am, signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours, oh I'm yours 

Oo-wee babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you are my only desire

Stevie Wonder,"Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love
Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love
Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love",Isn't She Lovely,1997
Stevie Wonder,"Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
Gone too soon",Gone Too Soon,1997
Stevie Wonder,"There was a girl I used to know 
She was oh so beautiful 
But she's not here anymore 
She had a college degree 
Smart as anyone could be 
She had so much to live for 
But she fell in love 
With the wrong kinda man 

He abused her love and treated her so bad 
There was not enough education in her world 
That could save the life of this little girl 

How come, how long 
It's not right, it's so wrong 
Do we let it just go on 
Turn our backs and carry on 
Wake up, for it's too late 
Right now, we can't wait 
She won't have a second try 

Open up your hearts 
As well as your eyes 
She tried to give a cry for help 
She even blamed things on herself 
But no one came to her aid 
Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell 
That's what we'd like to tell ourselves 

But no, it wasn't that way 
So she fell in love 
With the wrong kinda man 
And she paid with her life 
For loving that man 
So we cannot ignore, 
We must look for the signs 
And maybe next time we could save somebody's life","How Come, How Long",1997

I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

Still it scares me when I hear what I hear
You see, everybody's talking and they whisper in my ear

That I'm not just a run-around baby

They gamble on the time and the date it will end
Not much longer, they swear

When they say that we're in trouble
Cuz they don't know what they're talking about
It's just too bad we've got what they've never had
So they just stay busy talking

For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting
Whenever you are near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly, oh, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world made for you and me

Whenever you are near I hear a symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby

Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes
I care not for myself but for those
Who've never felt the joy we've felt
Whenever you are near
I hear a symphony each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air now
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Oh so close to me, baby, baby

Ah it goes on and on",I Hear a Symphony [#],1998
Stevie Wonder,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,1999

And I say it's taken Him so long
'Cause we've got so far to come

Tell me people
Why can't they say that hate is ten zillion light years away
Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul
Why must my color black make me a lesser man
I thought this world was made for every man
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me
And I say it's taken Him so long

Feel His spirit wow oh woo

I, can't say that heaven is ten zillion light years away

Just to walk her righteous streets I pray
Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls
For those who don't believe will never see the light

Inside please let Him be

And the joys of caring will not be replaced

They won't be hard to find

Will echo in my mind

I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

Until the ocean covers every mountain high, always 
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea, always 
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream 

Did you know that true love asks for nothing 
Her acceptance is the way we pay 
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee 
To last through forever and another day 
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning 
And the seasons know exactly when to change 
Just as kindness knows no shame 
Know through all your joy and pain 
That I'll be loving you always 
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow 
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear 
For I'll know deep in my mind 
The love of me I've left behind Cause I'll be loving you always

Can make you wish you were born in another time and space

You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell

For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.
Whenever you are near, I Hear A Symphony, 
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms.
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine.
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind.
I'm lost in a world made for you and me.
Oo love me.  
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby.
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within, 
Don't let this feeling end, 
Let it go on and on and on now baby.
 
Baby, baby, those tears that fill my eyes, 
I care not for myself but for those 
Who've never felt the joy we've felt.
Whenever you are near,
I Hear A Symphony each time you speak to me 
I hear a tender rhapsody of love, love.
Baby, baby, as you stand up holding me 
Whispering how much you care,
A thousand violins fill the air now.
Baby, baby, don't let this moment end,
Keep standing close to me,
Oo so close to me, baby, baby.

Stevie Wonder,"We have time for racism
We have time for criticism

We make time to debate religion
Passing bills and building prisons
For building fortunes and passing judgments
When will there be a time to love

At this point in history we have a choice to make
To either walk a path of love
Or be crippled by our hate

We have time to cause pollution
We have time to cause confusion
All wrapped up in our own illusions
When will there be a time to love

We make time to conquer nations
Time for oil exploration
Hatred, violence and terrorism
When will there be a time to love

We have a choice to make
Father God is watching
While we cause mother earth so much pain
It's such a shame

Not enough money for
The young, the old and the poor
But for war there is always more
When will there be a time to love

We make time for paying taxes
Or paying bills and buying status
But we will pay the consequences
If we don't make the time to love

Now's the time to pay attention
Yes now is the time to love

Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

Just pass me by, don't even speak

Have a male friend to ask for me

But I'm the envy of ev'ry single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye.
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style,

But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true.

In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids.
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy,

No football hero or smooth Don Juan,
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son.

A letto mi son girato
e non ho ditto niente
E ho ripensato alla tua voce
così fresca e strana
Che dava al nostro gruppo qualcosa di più

Enrico che suona,
sua moglie fa il coro
Giovanni come sempre ascolta
stonato com?è

Canzoni d?amore
che fanno ancora bene al cuore
Noi stanchi ma contenti
Se chiudi gli occhi forse
tu ci senti anche da lì

L?altra domenica siamo andati al lago
Ho preso anche un luccio grande
Che sembrava un drago
Poi a sera in treno
abbiam cantato piano
Quell pezzo Americano
che cantavi tu

Canzoni stonate
parole sempre un po?sbagliate
Ricordi quante serate
passate così

Se chiudi gli occhi forse
tu ci senti anche da lì
Canzoni d?amore
che fanno ancora bene al cuore
diciamo quasi sempre
qualche volta no qualche volta no

Stevie Wonder,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

Morale, you've lost that loving feeling
Don't talk
Close the door
You've been here before

Your shape dim
I'm an old man now
The air's thin
The walls very damp now
And if I don't go
I'll always be stuck here in this poor little room
With a view of the corner

I don't forget
Though I've grown weak now
Experience is useless
Unless you can learn
And I've never met anyone
Who used their knowledge
To avoid those mistakes made again and again

And if I don't go
I'll always be stuck here in this poor little room
With a view of the corner

You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it (baby)
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that loving feeling
Whoa, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And girl, you're starting to criticize little things I do

Whoa, that loving feeling
You've lost that loving feeling

If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah

So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away

Brothers is wack by popular demand
Chasing fame and girls living they life on cruise control
But tell me, what do it profit a man
To gain a whole world living trife but then lose his soul?
I'm here to wake my peoples up from they dreaming
Kill every demon and snakes that make, even feds steaming
Even though my star gleaming man my life ain't trouble-free
Homie take it from me, Snoopy D-O-double-G

It's no better people who have left the problems of today
Leaving to conclude that for their life is not the way
But every problem has an answer, and if yours you cannot find
You can talk it over to Him, He'll give you piece of mind
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with good
Hey yeah hey

[Snoop Dogg]
So much drama on the ave, the copper just laughed
Man the West is wild, that old hit was wrong
Cause out here, momma don't have, and poppa don't have
As God blessed the child that can go get his own
And we struggle hard suffer long, I'm feeling like this life is a trip
Trying to keep our hearts pure through the sins
But the race ain't to the swift or the strong, the wise or the rich
But to them they can endure to the end and win

Stevie Wonder,"Been through the storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs man
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin' to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin' down my do'
Wonderin' where my next blessing is comin' from

My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a youngin', peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin' against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin' the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin'
Blendin' in with city folk, down in Flat-bush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin' I been through it
In other words I

Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin' to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guyanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin' into shit
Like we innocent, actin' older than should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin' all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin' 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin'
To hell with just gettin' by and economizin'
It's kinda hard bein' humble in the belly of struggle
Doin' things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin' money while we keepin' it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin' the faith
Mom and pop be worryin' for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin' look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin'
Across the line until somebody tryin' to cap me, oh shit

Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With ""Boy thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (""You nasty boy."")
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it-it sure felt out to sight

And something about her lips, the way she kiss
The way she walks them heads go

It knocks me right up off my feet, now baby, I see her like I should

How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the canon balls fly before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died?

With an equal opportunity

And you'll keep what's yours ?cause that would only be fair

We used to have the best love of all

So why did we break, can't say our love wasn't strong
But I know with time things that start to mend

So let's fix these hearts so they can't be broken again
You need a man who sees how lonely you've been
don't worry, I will start all over and then
We will get back the heart that we both created together

Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss

Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor?
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us

And greasy foods; I don't believe the news

But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac?
Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at?
Endangered in our own habitat
Them guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for, now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap, you would express it too
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans

You know, you know, you know, 
One way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.

You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.

It's impossible to love you
If you don't let me know what you're feeling
It's impossible
For me to give you whatcha need
If you're always hiding from me

Struttin' her stuff on the street

Touching her skin feelin' silky smooth
The colour of cafe au lait
Made the savage beast inside
Roar until it cried, more, more, more

Now he's back home doing nine to five
Living his grey flannel life
But when he turns off to sleep
Old memories creep, more, more, more

Stewart Michaels,"Share my life, take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't want to have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
(Your love I'll remember forever)

Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me...
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you.

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of you love
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

If I should stay
Well, I would only be in your way
And so I'll go, and yet I know
That I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
'Cause we both know that I'm not
What you need
I will always love you
I will always love you

And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I love you, I will always love

I, I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you",I Have Nothing,2006
Stewart Michaels,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2006
Stewart Michaels,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Stewart Michaels,"The moon is full but my arms are empty
All night long how I've pleaded and cried
You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July

Your bags are packed and not a word is spoken
Guess we said everything with goodbye
Time moves so slow when promises get broken
On this cold day in July

Sun's comin' up, comin' up down on main street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away

You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
Looks like spring and feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July

Sun's comin' up, comin' up down on main street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
