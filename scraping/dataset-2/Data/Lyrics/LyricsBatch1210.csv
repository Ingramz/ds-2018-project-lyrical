Tommy Dorsey,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

Tommy Dorsey,"Sweetheart if you should stray a million miles away
I'll always be in love with you.
Although you find more fish in someone else's dish
I'll always be in love with you.

I can't do any more, I tried so hard to please
But let me thank you for those tender memories

I wish you happiness, as for me sweetheart I guess
I'll always be in love with you.",I’Ll Always Be In Love With You,2015

Tommy Dorsey,"LULLABY OF BROADWAY
Dorsey Brothers Orchestra

Come on along and listen to, the lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train, the rattle of the taxis
The daffydils who entertain, at Angelo's and Maxi's
When a Broadway baby says good night, it's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn:

Good night, baby
Good night, milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day. Hey!

Come on along and listen to, the lullaby of Broadway
The hi-dee-hi and boop-a-doo, the lullaby of Broadway
The band begins to go to town, and everyone goes crazy
You rock-a-bye your baby round, 'til everything gets hazy
Hush-a-bye I'll buy you this and that, you hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat, to sleep all day:

Good night, baby
Good night, milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight,
Let's call it a day - - -
Listen to the lullaby of old Broadway

Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"[INTRO:]
You're completely unaware, dear, that my heart is in your hand
So for love's sake won't you listen and try to understand?


I dream of you more than you dream I do
How can I prove to you this love is real?
You mean to me more than you mean to be
You just can't seem to see the way I feel

	When I am close to you the world is far away
	The words that fill my heart my lips can't seem to say

I want you so more than you'll ever know
More than you dream I do, I dream of you

I want you so more than you'll ever know
More than you dream I do,         I    dream    of you",I Dream of You,
Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"I should care, I should go around weeping
I should care, I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough, I sleep well
Except for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep

So I should care, I should let it upset me
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do

I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do

And I do",I Should Care,
Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"Melancholy serenade every time I hear it played
Right out of space your haunting face appears

There were other serenades broken promises we made
Why must I pay day after day with tears

Alone in my room I watch the ghost of you
Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear

Alone in the gloom once more I'm close to you

Melancholy serenade as the music starts to fade
I feel your kiss and then you disappear",Melancholy Serenade,
Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"April showers, overhead offer me a chance
To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
It's an opportunity, something to enjoy
Helter, skelter fly for shelter I'm a lucky boy
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon 
No one can see us
Rain It's so cozy in the rain
There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon

Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"This love of mine goes on and on,
Though life is empty since you have gone.
You're always on my mind, though out of sight,
It's lonesome through the day,
But oh! the night.
I cry my heart out, it's bound to break,
Since nothing matters, let it break.
I ask the sun and the moon,
The stars that shine,
What's to become of it,
This love of mine.",This Love of Mine,
Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed, 
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end

Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,
Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over it's face
You kissed me and went on your way
The height we called it a day

I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament In my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the the dark
A hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No sadder was he than I

The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day",The Night We Called It a Day,

Don't forget your hat
But leave your worries
Leave 'em on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sun sunny side of the street

Pitter-pat
You know that happy tune is my step
Life sorry
If you dig that beat 
On the sun sunny side of the street

Used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
What a drag old man
Getting stuck in my shade
Get hip

Don't be afraid
Move it on over
Kill yourself in the clover

Only here for a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller

Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"Daybreak, another new day
The mist on the meadow is drifting away
For it's daybreak, the sun's in the sky now
And flowers break through their blanket of dew

To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on through the blue
At daybreak I did dream of you","Daybreak [Based on ""Mardi Gras"" From Mississippi Suite]",1975
Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra,"By a country road wild roses grow that need my special care,
So I haven't time to be a millionaire
And a cheerful brook on a mountainside is sad when I'm not there,
So I haven't time to be a millionaire

And a friendly gang of robins are peeved when I forget
That I'm the second tenor in their quartet.
So with all the things I have to do, I'm very much aware,
If I wished for wealth it wouldn't be quite fair,
'Cause I haven't time to be a millionaire.","I Haven't Time to Be a Millionaire [From ""If I Had My Way""]",1975

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

The day I take my ""Candy""

This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension, 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension. 
Yet we get a trifle weary 
With mr. einstein's theory, 
So we must get down to earth at times: 
Relax, relieve the tension. 
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved, 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed. 
Refrain 
You must remember this, 
A kiss is still a kiss, 
A sigh is just a sigh; 
The fundamental things apply, 
As time goes by. 

And when two lovers woo, 
They still say, ""I love you,"" 
On that you can rely; 
No matter what the future brings, 
As time goes by. 

Moonlight and love songs never out of date, 
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate; 
Woman needs man and man must have his mate, 
That no one can deny. 

It's still the same old story, 
A fight for love and glory, 
A case of do or die; 
The world will always welcome lovers, 
As time goes by.",As Time Goes By,1990

Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner,

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

A paradise where roses bloom

In my heart it always will remain

But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes

There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

When slop bucket fell from the window up above

Send photographs of Mars

The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,

But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Tommy Eyre,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

Tommy Flanagan Trio,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall

Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room?

Threw my heart away each spring,
Now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter,
All I've got to show?s a splinter for my little fling!

Spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post,
I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Morning?s kiss wakes tres and flowers,
And to them I'd like to drink a toast,
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
Spring can really hang you up the most.

All afternoon those birds twitter twit,
I know the tune, ""this is love, this is it!""
Heard it before and I know the score,
And I've decided that spring is a bore!

Love seemed sure around the new year,
Now it's April, love is just a ghost,
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear? 
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Spring is here, there?s no mistaking
Robins building nests from coast to coast;
My heart tries to sing so they won?t hear it breaking,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

College boys are writing sonnets,
In the ""tender passion"" they're engrossed,
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Love came my way, I hope it would last,
We had our day, now that's all in the past!
Spring came along a season of son,
Full of sweet promise but something went wrong!

Doctors once prescribed a tonic,
""sulfur and molasses"" was the dose,
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,
Spring can really hang you up the most!

Old man winter was a gracious host,
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover

That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, down and down I go
All around I go, in a spin
Loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,1994

It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me

How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire
Doesn't it seem like we've been here before?
Over an ocean the heavens will open
Nothing lives up to the visions we see
Everything's clear when you step through the mirror

Carried away to the fog in the distance
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share
Hot balloons of open air

Step out of rhythm and fall into place
Try not to think of the hours I wasted
Open the shutters, now how can it be?
When did this picture become so unreal?
Moving along on an endless supply
Somehow I feel like the only survivor
Try to remember the moment we spent 
Lost in the rain as we floated together

Carried away by the dream that we're sharing
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share
Hot balloons of open air

What does it matter, the world will still spin
Another day ends, and the end will begin again
Dancing in circles, and clapping out time
Telling the truth and forgetting the lines

Waking together, you lifted your head
How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire

There's no love lost
Don't take me for a fool or

Deceived, run short of luck, double crossed

Shot down, follow behind 'til I find you
Running ahead of me, let down
Tables have turned, and I see you
Staring right back at me

Walk, in silence you were gone
Now all is lost, you always said that I'd be the one
To cut you from the pack, I should have known
Seeing that dust where you've flown
My love has gone, it's way too late
You sleight of hand deceived me and sealed our fate
You've taken back the cards, lost one by one
And in the game we've begun, undone
Run short of luck, double crossed

Shot down, left on the ground but I see you
Staring right back at me, let down

Where bitches are apart of nigga found dead in alleys
Buttnaked with the brain stain 
From the bullet bleed all a cousin creed
2 G's and a pound of weed (the bad seed)
That's my mindstate I ate cause my tape causes ear drum rapes
Rainy days wake my mind to a haze that ease the craze
I break a sack and blaze, headrush, rush by cause the weeds will be giving
you a whiff of the fifth that I'm sippin'
Straight rain now making me fowl let's bow 
I'll flow a fool like Nile and follow a fool into exile
Fear, the fowl lifer eye of the sniper 
Playin' pussy time to pay the piper
Now stay out the shadows my mind rattles 
Cause of tention bring back reminishion to my system
A prism of realism, keeping me trapped
Fat doobies to the dome yo make you death
Slapped in the face by the fear of my enemies
On a life and death mission I can soak Hennessy 
Fuck fear

They'll never take us again my minds equipped 
While Cali got me trippin' on some Nino Brown type shit
Coco rocks and weed spots balck techs and glocks
see-no lots able me to take herb hits like an oc, paradoxs 
I murder tight rhymes cause of the rhythm bends in my brain
Bionical vision, I beat down basslines cause sometimes
I got shit danceing in my down about hardtimes
I bards mine with the 9 nino ross, run a wrong get tossed
That's the cost, kids lost, catcht up my styles maturing

Trailing this rusted wreck

Tommy Hayes,"My history is no secret it's written in the stones
In the hill beside this river rest my mother's gentle bones
And daddy there beside her among his next of kin
And their legacy passed down to me the sons of mountain men

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
If that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
When they lay me down remind them I was just my father's son

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

Is there something I can send you from across the sea?
From the place where I'll be landing?

There's nothing you can send me, my own true love
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Maybe silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

If I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
That's all I wish to be owning

Oh, I might be gone a long ol' time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy passing?

How can, how can you ask me again?
Well it only brings me sorrow
Oh, the same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from his ship a-sailing
Saying, I don't know when I'll be coming back again
It depends on how I'm feeling

If you, my love, must think that away
I'm sure your mind is a-roaming
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country where you're going

Take heed of stormy weather

We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree

And I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy",Above and Beyond,1964

Are my fears coming true
How I wish I knew
Am I losing you

Is your love really true
Is there somebody new
Tell me what to do
Am I losing you

Am I too blind to see
What's then happ'ning to me
Ev'ry road has a bend
Will I be sweetheart or friend

Will the sweet things you do
Be for somebody new
Tell me what to do
Am I losing you

Tommy Hill,"Tonight while the snowflakes are falling
Here in my dreams I can see
The wild cherry blossoms of Shamon
Where I walked with Anna Marie

Anna Marie, Anna Marie. my heart remembers and sighs
See'est vous, see'est vous. Mon ami beaucoup. 
I miss you Anna Marie

My love was pledged to another
But I knew as I crossed the sea
That I'd never love any other
As I love my Anna Marie

Anna Marie, Anna Marie. my heart remembers and sighs
See'est vous, see'est vous. Mon ami beaucoup.

Tommy Hill,"Back about eighteen hundred and some
A Louisiana couple had a red-headed son
No name suited him, Jim, Jack or Joe
So they just called him Billy Bayou

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go
If you're walkin' on quicksand, walk slow
Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days

Billy was a boy, kinda big for his size
Red hair, freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years from the day he was born
Billy fought the battle of the Little Big Horn

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go
If you're walkin' on quicksand, walk slow
Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days

One sad day Billy cried, ""Ho Ho!
I can lick the feathers off of Geronimo""
He started off, the chief got mad
This nearly ended our Louisiana lad

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go
If you're walkin' on quicksand, walk slow
Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days

One day in eighteen seventy-eight
A pretty girl walked through Bill's front gate
He didn't know whether to stand there or run
He wound up married 'cause he didn't either one

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go
If you're walkin' on quicksand, walk slow
Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days

To see a little girly oh

Who's got a million friends
And every time he passes by

With a hole in his pants 
And his knees stick out 
He's just big enough to walk

Hat light up like a star
And the way to light them up

Cracker jack and bubble gum

Just to beg him for a bite

He's always got a shaggy dog 
A pulling at his clothes
And everybody calls to him 
As down the street he goes

Tommy Hill,"Out where the bright lights are glowing
You're drawn like a moth to a flame
You laugh while the wine's over flowing
While I sit and whisper your name

Four walls to hear me
Four walls to see
Four walls too near me
Closing in on me

Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting
But my walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love, not for hating
So here where you've left me, I'll stay

One night with you is like heaven
And so, while I'm walking the floor
I'll listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on my door

Four walls to hear me
Four walls to see
Four walls too near me
Closing in on me

Closing in on me",Four Walls [#],1987
