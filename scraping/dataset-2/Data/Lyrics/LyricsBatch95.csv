D.I.N.,"She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
There's not a man alive that wouldn't want to hold her
And the way she moves, just the way she moves
Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn
Keep me on a slow burn

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn
Keeps me on a slow burn

When we touch this fire breaks out
And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

And the love we made is so deep, so strong
That when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, a slow burn
A slow burn, slow burn

She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
Keeps me on a slow burn
In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
Keeps me on a slow burn
When we touch, when we touch

D.I.T.C.,"Ahh  you don't stop 
You don't stop  you don't stop 
O.C.'s on the mic and you don't stop 
You don't stop  you don't stop 
Big L is on the other you don't stop 
You don't stop  and you don't stop 
Mr. Walt on the beat you don't stop 
Check it out yo 

Yo, I'm lookin for the big see notes like Al Pacino 
Here's a new slang word: you pussino 
What it means is just that: PUSS 
My nickname to some  know me as Mush 
Fly like a Testarossa, my God 
Do not attempt to diss me and my squad 
Diggin in the Crates crew click my brother 
I'm on the mic, Big L is on the other 
For those that know me, indeed I flow 
maneuvers, like shells bust from a Luger 
Satisfaction, I bring the action 
Blowin your backs in, with only a fraction 
A mic set, mindset; O.C. design this 
finest, rap lord, Your Highness 
Pulsatin, vibratin, Shorty Wop 
on the dancefloor with the hips gyratin, come here 
Ass swingin like a chandalier; like 
a cat in heat, with her ass all up in the air 
Bust this, who said I can't cut the mustard 
Rappin is a bitch boy and I got a lust for it 

[Chorus]

If you want it, we got it 
Ladies, spot it 
No doubt about it 
Fly and exotic 
When we on the scene it's a major plus 
And whoever facin us we dangerous 

[Chorus] 

I be that smooth cat you never seen rollin with clowns 
One of the few from Uptown that's holdin it down 
Hoes is on me like I'm welfare, even rich ones 
that live in Bel Air, is this Big L yeah, hell yeah 
Word up, I use a chrome gat to push domes back 
Watch how you talk when you call me, Feds got the phone tapped 
This rap game, I put my life in it, chain got 
mega ice in it, push an Infinite, chrome rims, light tinted 
You can see pal, it's all about me now 
Twenty G's a show punk three thou just to freestyle 
I made this cheese it didn't grow on trees 
Can you hold somethin? Sure, you can hold on these 
Yo I'm fat like the old Cray-on, smooth as Rayon 
L is who the ladies stay on (yea baby play on) 
I chew chumps like chewsticks, known for poppin new hits 
I know you want me hoe if I was you I'd want me too bitch! 

[Chorus] 

Time to show, who get it on like soap 
Derived from nature so I'm pure like snow 
Brown skinned nigga with a low cut Caesar 
Travellin the world with my name on the visa, as said 

Legendary already 
Rhyme flow cut like a machete 
First time rappers, I bust your cherries 
Bitch hold still so I can put it in steady 
The more you squirm, the more pain I'ma inflict 
She stayed still and let me pump this dick 
Microphone raw diggin, almost won't fit in 
I'm still hard when I'm bustin off semen 
Semi; y'all in my way, OK rhymes are gay 
I'ma make you a M.I.A. 
'Cause I find you not a itsy-bitsy bit raw 
I'ma grind you like the bicuspidses in my jaws 
When I rock it feel like you bein fucked 
on all fours, this ain't meant for the stores 
This is for the niggaz in the clubs with thug mugs 
And for the chicks thinkin they cute without mustard 

Shaolin... ""makin money"" 
Niggaz in Brooklyn... ""ma-makin money!"" 
Queens and the Bronx... ""makin money"" 
Yeah, Manhattan.. ""ma-makin money!""  

I rock the blue face Prezzie, pockets heavy with cheddi 
I met these two lezzies in a Chevy Betty and Desi 
They like to menage-a-trois, then blase blah 
with L Corleone cause I'm a suave star 

No doubt Baby Pah, platinum rings, mean niggaz 
lookin at my ice from the chain it swing 
In the party, pop Dom, lampin like a Don 
Low key smilin at the bitches with my gold teeth 

You can't fuck with the place cause we just too hot 
So all that mess you pop I suggest you stop 
Quit while you ahead cause you ain't built like that 
Better chill cause on the real cats get killed like that 

Mmhmm, two crisp type figures, clean cut niggaz 
Plussed out cribs rock twin Ac' Vegas 
Livin' life to the fullest gettin rich ain't far 
Chillin with women bankin dough avoidin sluts and scars 

[Chorus]",Dangerous,1999
D.I.T.C.,"Uhh
Yeah, why'know
Shit is wild, heheh
Can't complain though, I'm alive
Healthy and allathat, knahmsayin?
Just tryin to do my thang
Praise to all

Bust it, that nigga Slick Rick said
I waited long time sweatin it
I got jerked but now I'm gettin it
Hazy like asthma bizarre disaster
Stress almost held me down from bein a master
The faster, preacher, poet, a teacher
""It's been so long"" like Monifah
Believe that, I'm needed, in rappin, I breathe this
Some pick up a microphone and can't even achieve this
Oscar award winning your shit I'm bored with it
Stop copy-catting son (why?) cause your dog did it
Get your own lingo, make up your own jingle
Ten years later you be bitin my single
Primo, take it Downtown, Swing it
Intervenin on the board, sensimil steamin, yeah
Catch the vibe like a tribal dance
In the clubs on the low with the be	-boy stance
Money rubbin with a shorty got bumped by a chump
Tell him, 'Step off, I'm doin the Hump'
Yeah

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
and if you stand in my way you bound to get dropped

Some wish that I was gone cause they know I'ma win
In a minute I 'll be makin six G's times ten
I'm the computer, printin out data take notes
then analyze the information and press send
Freaky like porno, Ron Jeremy saw no
obstacle or pussy to stop him from bonin a hoe
Me and the mic double trouble
Chicks look at us like twins, all lovable and huggable
Prognosis, on the, mic I choke out
Had the same effects from coughin blowin smoke out
Architect, rap technician, man listen
It's no doubt you gonna pump this in your system
My skills ill, and all of that above
Confidence, I'm not worried bout a street buzz
I'm O.C., who you?  I never heard of ya
Get out my face 'fore I turn into a motherfuckin murderer
I want the green like indo, a mansion, a car
A wife who's never been a bimbo
Too much to ask well to me that's simple
want to retire on a yacht called the S. S. Minnow

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped
(repeat 4X)

Top choice, this here nigga got poise
Ain't a man alive who could stop my noise
I snatch a star from the sky, spark up your lye
You stand astounded wonderin how I did it
Now you're star struck, like I truck gold
Treatin me like a nigga havin a million records sold
Now a starchild, phenmonen like the X-Files
Rappers know I'm comin so they go in exile
Czar in this rap shit, comin on your mattress
Microphone fiend I make beats do backflips
Fear me like genocide, serious
How I do it through your stereo, mysterious
O.C. do demolition, nil competition
Like robot Kong on a destroy mission
A matter of life and death you try to fight for breath
I snatch your heart from a slice through your chest
Who the best, from New York to Bogota
Who got face thinkin they scare me with a scar, shit
What I be bringin is a terrible sight
A performance never again performed on the mic

I say it's my world, and I won't stop
And if you stand in my way, you bound to get dropped

O.C., yeah back in the scene muthafucka
Me and Premo, you know, East New York
Bushwick, Bedstuy, and all those good places

Yo
My main frame, discipline like a soldier
Ready for war, pushups get my chest swoll up
What's the deal Preme? I mean the scaze
I think I got it locked in nigga, War Games is the theme
Rap commando, what's my handle
O.C. ample to rock shit
Battle niggas who pop shit
Green bareen thought slicka
I'm one step ahead, slide thru enemy lines like a black ack figga
Camouflage, runnin thru you zone with detection
Cuz the dark skinned marksmen
Run thru your section
Flesh ya bones, physical built like titanium
Bugs cover my grill like Iranians
Ill gorilla so called killas
I fear no man but Allah, for the god is he is still in us
The Renaissance Man, I roll with real like grenade
sharp like gem stars
Cause massive scars
O.C.'s all in it, dope I've been for years
Now I'm back in the scene, and I declare War Games

I bust off like a M-16
Rippin thru screens from head to toe, blood soak up your jeans
Rap veteran, earn my stripes, faught wars
Opposing forces, would O.C. take losses?
Naucious, you feelin kinda like throwing up
Cautious, watch ya step, land rhymes blowin up
Havin a pity for foes, fuck G.I. Joe
He's a sucker, slap the taste outta wild motherfuckas
Design a rhyme, like a plan for the government
Six Million like Steve Austin, costin
Apprehended if I am
In times and my body will erupt *explosion*
M-16 tapecatin, voids filled with ammo
Bust it through a crowd, a bitch nigga sing soprano
When I get you in the square, then I end you career
All MC's lets make one thing clear
You're all the same, I will remain, fuck the fame
Feelin the lane to shoot, I declare War Games

[Chorus: x2]
I declare War Games
For niggas who flaunt figgas for more fame
Gorilla warfare, tactics issue unlimited access to ammo
With fire proof camouflage and power

Precise pinpoint it, pull it, when I cock back
This here rap will slap you and your team, and that bad bitch
Sleaves from my uncut, raw like cope
Preme dig up boys, roll up and smoke
Then toge it, back to B.I.
See I can do this, I'm professional
Too much weight to weigh any style
Dutch Master superior blend, inhale me right
Young Phillies take a toke of my rap, and get the
Willies para-
Noid, niggas all non void
Fuck with O.C., get your life destroyed
Like a marine, I'm a trained rap killing machine
Fiend to rock a mic, set from New York to New Orleans
Over seas I conquer, rough like blanca
Love to eat actors, gotta take for drama
When I flow I get comatose
In my own world
From the first verse, you saw my plan unfurl
I mean team same name, never change
My ammo is the demo competition on the mic

Or betta yet DT 'cause brothas can't see me
Even ya girl says ya got a small wee wee
Now ya want to go upside her head (What you talkin bout!!!)
Then you feel intimidated by the things she said (Yo chill!!)
Don't worry bout it 'cause I paid her back, (you know I)
Took her to the rest then I laid her back
I go on and on like popcorn
Wit da butter, aiiiyaayyaayyayo
I used to stutter
But I fall on track-in, some may say I'm wack-in

Rock is my man and
So is Dapper Dan and
I'll shake a hand and

Bases are loaded, bottom of the ninth
I step to the plate 'cause I know my shit is great
I can't walk down a street
(Aiiyo Diamond, can you make me a beat)
Ya gotta have cheese
About a couple o' g's, huh
But if I know ya, I might just throw ya
A li'l somethin on the side troop
A funky bass line and a hype loop
I got a thousand old records in my crib
I used to hustle but I neva did a bid
Some people call me Jo Jo
I keep a low pro
Non-stop props, so act like you know bro
Pass me a mic and I'mma keep it
Yeah boy, I'm the best kept secret

Yo, I'm deadlier than Michael Myers
My style will embrace you like a pair of pliers
But don't sweat it G, why don't'cha let it be
'Cause Diamond D is a pedigree
In other words I'm official
I neva go out like a wet piece of tissue
Ruff and rugged
Stronger than Bounty
New York is the city, Bronx is the county
Learn from the best so the rest just fest
Now I'm gettin booked at the Philmore West
Or either in the village so kill it skillet
Ya ask ya'self
Will it eva cease?
'Cause Diamond's sharp as a crease
I only use bees wax, I'll neva use grease
On my dreads but instead if you want some kicks
Step to the mic I'm an 8 to 1 pick

That nigga Diamond, prone to shining cause I'm nice 
I turn, men to mice walk around with the ice
On my necklace, in the 7, drivin reckless 
Hon-ey you blew it if my CD ain't on your check list 
See you should expect this so blow see it's the bro
Who gets the dough, on the low like Piss Capone
What you ain't know? Steady flow's my deposition
I bet you wishin you had it but you suffer from repetition
I bet you listen, I catch you slippin on some smoke
Crush your throat, plus your broke, your just a hoax
When it comes to this here, cause this year
I'm lettin competitors know, that whenever this predator goes
I leave foes on the verge, niggas see me on stage, lose the urge
My style merge together when words come together to spurge
My endeavors on meat, furs, and leathers I use verbs
Some better pronouns, you better go now
You don't want to throw down seen how I knocked the other foe down
Yes-ter-day, seems niggas had less to say
Didn't wear your vest today, lets just say

Find a nest on mercury speculations

Get vexed, like I'm hittin some new butt
And fade MC's like a crew cut
You do what?, not to the greatest and when you play this
Some Mercedes not even after a 3 year hiatus
The kid is still nice with his, tight with his 
With no advice to give son, so suffice to this
To say I'm on my way, see ya paid 
And you could catch us on belay chillin in Bombay
My palm stay holdin, federal reserve notes
I bet a few've your nerves broke in a tussle
I'm tryin to eat lunch with Russell, flex my muscle
While your busy bitchy, my record label doesn't hustle 
Enough for me, it's tough to be in the spot light
You froze under the hot light, and wonder why your pockets not right
I'm elevatin sip Moet and Bruce gone celebratin
Through the Bronx, acceleratin on private blocks
Nuthin about it stops like powdered rocks

D.I.T.C.,"[Lord Finesse]
Check it out, for those that know me
Ya wonder why I always play low key
I know I got people and fans that like me
But all the noise and attention don't excite me
So I just lounge and play the D.L
In the crib with just me and a female
I'm still slick besides the others
Cause a player like me
Yo, I'm smoother than the Isley Brothers
When I'm on the scene I get feedback
Brothers runnin up, wassup, where you be at?
I be by myself just coolin
Cause I don't have time to sweat what someone else is doin
Cause their not equal to me
I got places to go, money to make, people to see
What'cha gonna do
The man is comin through
(You got it goin on)
Hey yo, that ain't nothin new
But my fame is stressin others
So you always got some that always want to test a brother
But I'm wildin at home kid
I'm straight makin papes, so tell me what ya problem is
Ya talk about unity, but when I turn my back
You talkin about what ya want to do to me
Yeah, you could keep riffin
I ain't the one, I sent ya home with ya teeth missin
So stop runnin at the mouth
Straight up and down

I'm out to get dough
Makin brothers petro
Some suckas don't like me
But I could care less though
Cause I'm a command y'all
I'm smackin' brothers up like Puerto Ricans play handball
But I ain't the funny type that joke around, huh
I gotta get my money right
And I got the right game
I'm definetely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
Cause I got strategy
I'm rollin head cracks, trips
And makin all the brothers mad at me
They might as well give up
The way I'm takin all the dough, this might as well be a stick up
Cause it's a mans thing
The way I got things sold
Yo, they can't do a damn thing
Tryin to gain props
I ain't the one to see
Ya clowns mess around and get played like a drum machine
You gotta find a better way
I'm pullin everything from your car to your resume
Cause I don't play clown
I'm tryin to get mine 
That's why my face stay frown
I don't smile or try to play my foul
I light your boys like ?tile?
Hey yo, you know my style
So just slow down, cause y'all can't throw down
And y'all can't accept that a brothers makin dough now
And I'm livin better, true
I makin more noise than the loudest heavy metal group
It's the cool man, brother with the smooth plan
That's why I'm seeing more papers than a newstand
So peep it, don't try to run and speak it
Point blank that keep my way about secret
While brothers is packin still, actin ill
I'm on the D.L, with a female
And I'm stackin bills
How ya livin?  Yeah I'm livin swell
Cause a brother like me 
Yo I'm ringin bells

Ain't no future in frontin

Step up and get beat into submission

Exotic trees leave a trail of scuffed up knees
So please you couldn't touch this cat with a stick
Quick to inflict tricks blaze up in the flick
Son I'm sick and you could put that on my mama
Exclamation point, quotation, comma
Lay up on the beaches when I'm down in the Bahamas
The skills go back to the days of wonderama
So pass the scama, son its time to get this money
So we can relax and recline where its sunny

I went from standin on the corner sellin cocaine
To rippin shows live on stage the hoes yellin my name
To be precise rippin mics is the light of my life
You frontin like you trife but never pulled a heist in your life
The price of my ice is sky high, I'm a fly guy
Its every thugs dream I really love cream, its in my blood stream

My whole click's wild I'm rich Pah 
No more sticks I'm makin' hits now 

I drink Cristal I'm through breaking laws 
I don't sell coke anymore I do tours 
So get that flashlight out of my face 
To bring me down Jake do whatever it takes 

Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped 
Praying that I fall for the mouse trap, I doubt that 

[Chorus]
Why do I end up in so much shit 
I don't came way too far to be calling it 
Jake want to lock me up even though I'm legit 
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick 
 
Hey yo enough is enough federals try to set me up 
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lost into dust 
Plus they want a nigga
But they know Big Joey Crack ain't never rat a cat that he know 

I left the streets alone, and almost killed his mama 
So I'm a keep doin' what I'm doin' 
Pursuin' my dream til there enough cream to start my own union 
And show these kids how legit it is 

Shit is real I use a steel but now I own several businesses 
So where is your witness that you claim to have sayin' 
Extortin' New York and not payin' tax 
I lean back playin' the role playin' too low 

But it's the same ol Joe so don't get K.O. 
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did

There's only one way for me to explain  the key to this game 
Is longev  keep it the same 
The seeds'll remain  only if they bringin the pain 
Hip hop don't stop like the heat in my vein 
The streets know my name  Don Carta bomb harder 
My persona is honored in the Bronx as my alma matter 
I'm smarter than the average Joe, packin a flow 
That's stackin the dough, let's bring the chips in the bag and let's go 
It's Fat Joe, I'ma set it straight 
If you do your hist I exist through Diggin In The Crates 
I'm bringin in the ace, had to stay up late 
Playin the corners but never seen a day upstate 
Until the day I escape or see Tone at the pearly gates 
I continue to runch it even after the computer breaks 
You know the rates, fifty-thou for every verse that's foul 
And I bring rhymes to life like the birth of a child

""Blow out your tweeters""

We all got cars wit extra features 
It's a bunch of y'all, one got dough, the rest is leeches 
You probably mad 'cause I be sexin divas 
I should pull this pistol out and make you touch your sneakers 
I'm on some cool out shit, but I will pull this tool out quick 
And put some holes in your new outfit 
You frontin hard 'cause your whip a Range 
But it's a 4.0, you nerd nigga, you heard Jigga now get your change 
You ain't a willy you a small solider, give it up son it's all over 
And you never sold a, pound a cane 
You a clown wit fame, goin down the drain 
All yo' shit sound the same 
I'ma shine pop-o, 'cause when you got dough your rocks glow 
L got a hot flow that rap coppo 
I'm Uptown smoothest, first album left you clowns clueless 
Sayin I'm wack, you niggas sound foolish 
Niggas hate to see L bubble, they'd rather see L struggle

The whole city's under siege when we come through wit guns blazin
You need to take a seat son, you just started shavin
Respect ya elders, stay in a child's play
The monotone flow stayin even wit the bass
Oh good Lord, we throw it like a javelin toss
Arrogance is the feature that we added for floss
Come and get headline, destined to get riches
From either rappin our ass off or brick shipments
Cover all regions, makin sure the protty gets spread out
We talk behind the mac you bust lead out
Wit next prospect, no particular concept do we follow
Smooth but yet solid like marble

Niggas ain't fuckin wit D, fuckin wit me
Lookin at me like ""Yo, what can it be?""
In the wide body-7 while you suckin the D
Spent out in the wedge while I'm fuckin for free
Scared to death like you stuck in a tree
I'ma stretch your ass out like I'm cuttin the deed
Frontin like a big man but you stuck in a three
So you know your floss game ain't nuttin to me

Twenty karats on the wrist ain't nuttin to me

Aiyyo Tone, let's Touch these niggas wit the wand
Then blow up like a bomb
Made moves faster than the autobond
The Kid Capri is a institution, and all ya'll niggas is pollution
Starin up a whole lot of confusion
It's simple, let's move out all these corn cats
And disc jock dissin MC's that got the borin raps
Fuck what ya got, grimy niggas don't want to hear it
Niggas take it, soon as they near it, you better fear it

Got heavy wit gats to push your face back
Trash-ass album sound like you played it on eight-track
Rip you from the roots and under
Triple gooses in the summer
Mean long guns is producin the thunder
Convertible Hummers, we shit on the glock
Try to put the roof up, I'll tell Show to piss on the top
Wrist on the watch, roll wit a click or a glock
Plan on gettin a lot, from spittin or not
Cool wit niggas that be flippin a lot
Probably got shit on your block
And if you hate, I'll take it back to '88 (Nigga, get off the top)
It's two-g's, let's get this money, you wit it or not
But I'll switch topics like my bitch wit thongs in the tropics
Make hits, straight hits

So get Tide wit bleach when I rhyme wit beats
Niggas do crimes to eat
No pork, I don't talk, the nines just speak
I'm the kind to creep on your block wit the heat cocked
Got the street locked, smackin niggas out they Reeboks

Lay my life on the lines if the odds is right

All the moves you make, e'ry step you take
Get you all alone and bend you 'til you break
Wait then give you back to the cat in the cake

Nah, I ain't a sucker, I'm all about my papes
Just 'cause you caught the vapes and tryin' to hang like drapes
Mess around and get your feelings crushed like grapes
I give it all it takes to shake just like quakes

D.J. Rogers Jr.,"When the song come on hands in the air

We surfaced consumer's pre-purchase
Guess who's back on the charts and he's nervous
Elite service, amongst men that beat murders
Fish-fillet lover, brother, don't eat burgers
Rap slowest, those that hold the gats know this
Biblical facts I'm about to re-enact Moses
Uh huh
Misery's back, I'm calligraphy on niggary tracks
Epidemy, it's seems like most consider me that, literally
It's like wizardry with me and the raps
And getting rid of me, somebody's insecurity lacks
Lucid, never biting or track boosting, it's too confusing
I supply what the fiends shooting
Front's is needed, I was once young and anemic
'Till I found a few players to team with

When the song come on hands in the air

I'm like the spring in a .45 colt pistol
Know the initials I gleam like a coke crystal
With most fickle, too serious to joke with you
Weak lungs was too laid-back to blow whistles
Far away and two cellphones with calls waiting
Parlaying two red-bones and I'm more patient
Spreeing on the form's fragrance
Leaving stores on every floor evermore vacant
We all chasing the thoughts of assort places
Bringing serenity back from all the court cases
And lost races, chose to expose little
Rap rugal, cockback smack your screw's loose
Axe Noodles rose amongst who ever
A Jewel tellers smooth fellas
Elders schooled me to do better

When the song come on hands in the air

O's kept, dice out, no bets
Lights out, I'm a Vet, y'all no threat
Piped out, something stretch, it's cold sex
Nice house, run around, in old sweats
Can't see me, don't try it, can't be me
Won't tire, y'all cowards can't leave me
Locked in, flow-wise I'm top ten
Hop in, low-ride, I'm not him
Hold heavy, it's hot, hope glow's ready
So deadly, this is not Hov' and Kelly
We hog tie 'em, nothing's plated, dark iron
The god's rhyming, through the conduit the car's flying
Coke wit it, the doe did it, hoes get it
Unstable, still able to blow digits

D.J. Slack,"Verse one:

Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause When i heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It simple ain't it but quite clever
Some of you been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause if not and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long coz I'm a move on 
The dancefloor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

Move the crowd

Imagine me  wit the heat that's made by solar,
It gets stronger everytime I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving or eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth, shut!
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric be	 is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise due to Allah and that's a blessing
Wit knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees, I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven,
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving

D.J.N.K.,"I can't believe how far I've come
Now watch me stumble and come undone
If you take away these memories
Then all that's left is just me

'Cause I don't want this
And I don't need this
And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this anymore

So you choose to break my heart
I should have seen this from the start
I'm haunted by your apathy
All that's left is killing me

And I don't feel this
It seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
And I can't fake this
And I won't take this anymore

Do you believe that the way you choose to be
I've always had to see
The brighter the side of this 
So I don't lose my faith

Now the sun has gone away
It's getting colder every day
So before I freeze to death there's
Something I should I say

And I don't need this
And I don't feel this

I can't shake this

You still won't face this

I carry my sacrifice.
For the sake of the millions.
All night you be the light on the water.
You be the pride and the sorrow. 
Shower your love to me there.

Unify every soul together be lonely.
Ride on follow me to the sunrise.
Save me the world that is broken.
Nothing but love to be there.

Soldiers, father and son are soldiers
Nowhere to run we fight ore we die.
For what are we living for, boys never cry. 
Soldiers mother and child are soldiers
The meek and the mild we stand ore we fall.

Never mind, dry your eyes you never be far away.
Forever beside me hold out I will be your tomorrow.
I will walk trough the fire ,nothing but love to be there.

Living all the daydreams and nightmares don't do me no good.

D.K. Davis,"How can I convince you what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while",The Search Is Over,2002
D.L. Byron,"I need love, love to ease my mind,
I need to find, find someone to call mine,
But mama said you can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,
I remember mama said,

Can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take
No matter how long it takes.

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes.

Martin Luther King basically alluded to the fact that all lives matter

Side by side on the inside
Breaking up our minds on the front lines
Never again, never again will I be denied
Here I come

'Cause here I come

I've waited all my life to get out of the trenches
I'm ready to fight for what I believe you can steal from me
I won't take this
Gonna fill these trenches and stand up

Wake up, I won't give up
'Cause here I come, here I come

Breaking up my mind on the outside

War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride

Timbaland, he produced, if you're a fruit, produce
Riding it in the old school
Living like I'm old school
She french kissed my neck 
And then I told her merci voux cou
Put it in your bag, no baby I ain't fat
When I fuck you it's a wrap
I'm a put you in the cab
Better be happy I rap
If I wasn't I'd be trapped with the mass
And I, and I'm coming for your stash
When I find out where you at
I'll be shimmying your lock
Get the fuck up out your bed
You better give me what you got
Want your money, money, money, money
Blind like there's no money, oh gotta go money
And his pocket's fully drained
And he's back to nothing change

And I'd wish he'd come run up on me
He gone find that he'd done made the wrong move

I ain't changed, still the same
D.O.E be the name
I'm from north side queens
Next up

Ha, ay yo, believe that's me 
(And what's your name?) Bran'Nu A.K.A Brandy
(And where you from?) Mississippi 
But was raised in Cali

Why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (I got it, I got it ha)

It's been a long time coming, I'm back
Like I forgot something important
Hey, have a problem with me?
I've faded to black like church slacks
Now I'm in a range, no Cadillac
So you don't want it with me
I'm on the tip of your tongue like bubble gum
I got you head strung
It's my return like the kingdom come
I'm taking off like a rocket
I got this beat in my pocket
I keep your heart dropping (Bran'Nu)
Never gonna hold me back
Timbo put me on the map
Now you wanna say I act brand new
Just like my Pradda boots
Strutting like a model do
Don't you wish you had another chance to
Get up under my skin
Fronting like you getting in it
You keep running your mouth like them frogs do
I gotta learn, you like a school dude
Cause clearly you don't have a clue
So next up

Yeah, ay yo believe that's me
(And what's your name?) Attitude on the M.I.C
(And where you from?) Alabama be the bigger G

And why don't you get on the mic
For the symphony (okay)

All this dope shit never mediocre
Plenty bread so you know I gotta keep a toaster
On my side, pride leashing, it's over
Come to fly to drive, I'm a need a chauffeur
I get a whole lot of, like a G's supposed to
They can put me in the fed for what's in my sofa
Rap, wait, smack 'em if they say a part
Diss me, I'll put the ratchet
On you and your fading heart
I know that man never thought that it could happen
Got my shit on and then I hoped in the Aspen
Every chick I cash in, bigger pain in the ass and
Better new freak, she thicker then the last one
Naw I ain't never homie, music is my passion
I ain't show compassion at all, I be fucking
Yelling I'm the shit, if you with nobody's asking
Oh I'm on fire like the shit in the ass man
That's why I stay soaked on player
Like how we are fucking up the ozone layer
I drop a hit every time I got some shit to say
And If I miss I come back like a ricochet",Symphony,2009
D.O.E.,"Didn't I conquer this last year?
Tell me what I missed 'cause I fear
That it's coming back up again
Must be something I ate
Some song, some show, some hate
The devil wants to extend the game, free throws
And when it ends he wants to make the sequel
'Cause if he has another chance
He feels like he can take
My joy, my peace, my faith

See the devil, he learns from your mistakes
Even if you don't
That's how he keeps you in cycles, cycles
Cycles, cycles
But I'm not going in cycles, cycles
Cycles, cycles

This will end like I want it to, I win
The enemy will have to lose again
See, I'm a different fighter now
And I have God to thank
'Cause His joy is my strength

See the devil will learn it's a mistake
When I am sure
That I'm not going in cycles
I'm not going in cycles
I'm gonna break these cycles
I'm not going in cycles
I'm gonna break these cycles
I'm not going in cycles
Cycles, cycles
I'm not going in cycles

Ooh, so Lord, help me
Be free from all of my passion
See, Your love is enough
To make me new
And help me in these cycles, cycles
Help me in these cycles, ooh Lord, cycles
I need You to help me in these cycles
I rebuke him in the name of Jesus, oh
Cycles, cycles

See I'm not going in cycles
I refuse it, cycles
I refuse it, cycles
Oh, refuse it, cycles
Oh, woe, depression, cycles
Oh, all I'm saying, cycles
Oh, I'm not going in cycles

Papi yo me busco el peso, pregúntale a Homie
Tengo money, en par de países loco un par de Cholis
Ahora tengo par de pesos, en efectivo
Me mantienen vivos los billetes se llevan conmigo
Benjamin es mi mejor amigo, Jackson es mi primo
Washington mi compadre y fue a la escuela con Lincoln
Revolucionario como tu Duatlon Santo Domingo
I'm a king, en puertorro Luis Muñoz Marin
Yo siempre he sido un soñador, quise ser compositor
Luego me convertí en cantautor
Quería ser un liricista
Puñeta artista  y me convertí en inversionista
Al envidioso digo Tranquilo Bobi
Matarte es mi hobby, en el closh como Kobe
Pa las mujeres soy seguro un orgasmo
Duro y dulce, me llaman el durazno

Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando
Con un combo de locos que no estan jugando
Andamos sin miedo y por eso
Salgo pa' la calle siempre con dos peines largos
En los bolsillos siempre con dos pacas ando
Con un combo de locos que no estan jugando
Andamos sin miedo y por eso

Hacen reuniones pa' setiarme, dicen que quieren cazarme
Mamenmen el bicho, de ninguno voa dejarme
Aborrecido, harto e' odio damos fuego con los palos también
Que paso? No te gusto? Yo no soy un billete de 100
To' van pal casco, pa' que les de agua los fiscales
Te vamos a procesar con los metales (rascabolas)
Y a los titeres de embuste dile que hagan los ajustes
Que andamos borrando hocicos con un par de fulles
Hoy hay trabajo, hay otro carro que vamos a desmantelar
El que pillemos en la avenida en su madre se va a cagar
Esto no es relajo, lambebicho, demuestre su hombría
A sangre fria si te agarro, pa te voy a dejar de dia
Puro malianteo, ya salieron Los Menores
No riego veneno, pero papi sin cojones pai a mi me tienen
Mucha tormenta es lo que viene
Con musica hija e' puta es que Ñengo se mantiene, so cabron

Ya estoy manso muchachos o quieres ver como me agacho?
Le engancho el peine a mi macho y sin pensar te la respacho
Ustedes son queso con nachos partirme, tu estas borracho?
Acho en cualquier sentido te desparracho
Las pacas y los billetes las he visto encurrucha'
Hago todo lo que quiero, y si no quiero escucharte, ya
Yo mando a regar la voz, los burros estoy dando dos
Se te adelanto lo siento lechon llego Navidad
Jingle bells, el panzon como Santa Claus
Mi pipa y la glock, siempre sujeta' en el calzon
Bebo date un resbalon, que me has dado la impresión
Que tu tienes mucho combo, pero no con corazón brra

Ya Los Menores salen pa la calle
Los mas que suenan en la calle bebo se han quedao
Las cosas ya no son iguales
Y del caserio no salen

Pa hablarte claro, ustedes están dando asco
Mientras yo ando por ahí, willeando en la moto sin casco
Millonario, cabrón yo estoy tirao' pa' atras
Lo que vale el carro tuyo, vale un canto de mi Four Track
Soy el terror de muchos, el chamaquito incorregible
El que a los 22 tiene 3 casas y convertibles
El favorito de la calle, y del genero el mas terrible
El que entierra a los demonios y a los muertos los revive
Soy yo, el que la sigue llevando
El que le han tirao' la mala y como quiera esta matando
El Titerito, el que sigue comandando
De to' ustedes el mas que esta facturando",Salgo,2014
D.P.,"Yeah, yeah, Z-Ro, DP, Billy Cook lay it down
All night long, smoked all fire, yeah yeah

[Z-Ro]
We can ball all day, four play in the hallway
Taking trips overseas, France, England, and my way
I'm the Don Datta, but you can't be my baby mama
Let me save you the drama, roll on like a Yokohama
We can, go half on the room, and half on a sack
And while you breaking the buzz down, I'ma be hitting it from the back
Bend over baby, I got something to show you baby
Turn around on your back toes up on the shoulders baby
Steady deep stroking don't mind me, just keep smoking
Bust a lot to break the serve and the soda water open
But you ain't my may thang, just a little something to the side
So don't talk when I'm talking on the phone, you keep quiet
Just open your mouth wide and let me put it inside
Smoke a sweet and to finish my cup and then it's time to slide
Don't worry about nothing cause it's confidential
Open up your runway for my ?con? to dent you

(Chorus - 2x (Billy Cook vocalizing in background)
All night long, all night
We be smoked all night
All night long, all night
As we flip and sip pink sprite

[Z-Ro]
Put a six in a Cris we gone sip on that
It's harder than a roll of quarters put your hips on that
Removing your thong, penetrate the pick and it's on
Still sipping and smoking stroking steady making you moan
I'm number 0 City Don, got a cottage by the barn
Automatic gauges vicious dogs roaming the lawn
You got to worry about nothing except for keeping me happy
And if it's with you than a bitch steady tapping and nappy

[DP]
Steady tapping and nappy, getting the headboards clapping
Hell shot, pussy with your man asking what happened
And no excuses out your mouth cause you've been riding with me
Arrange my soldiers, T-H-you-G
See you can tell from the smile and the way that you strip
Something ain't right, though nigga been all up in the guts
Better soak on some alcohol, and leave me alone
Bitch ask for the cash I get it

(Chorus - 2x)
[Z-Ro]
I need a thug bitch, a shop lift and sell drug bitch
But don't be tripping when I'm pimping in the club bitch
We can hit the telly and get under the sheets
Knocking you down till I move around back on the streets
And keep rolling, got to keep my benjamins folding
Then I'm coming back to beat it up until it's swollen 
Baby it's non stopping fix a nigga a plate
So don't worry I be coming to your house real late
Meanwhile I'm a soldier in the battlefield
I'm on a mission trying to get it, I'ma make a mill
With or without you, but if you down
Then we can do it together, drank rubbers and automatic rounds
But don't be tripping when I say I need space
I ain't cheating but it's some reason it's a knee case
I'm a block bleeder, you got to share me with the drugs and shit
But when I'm fucking you it's beautiful I love the shit

To lay with me while she was so far away

Infiltration in fifteen minutes, I wish my password wasn't my name
That's real nigga shit, now I gotta deal with this bitch
Mouth in her hand submissions
Gotta watch 'cause her stance South Pole position
Plenty swings all missin' 'cause she rather be kissin'
Crazy 'cause it took two months to get it
Probably went through way too much to hit it
But I got it and I'm tryna keep it

Decisions make my head spin round
Make me drunk, sick and tired
Keep me up 'till I retire
And while I could be out bar hopping
Meat market, rocker-chick shopping
Out there, chasing my dick
In it's never-ending search for chicks
But, I'd rather be sleeping

D.R.I.,"Hey, punk, with that bottle in your hand
What makes you so sad?
Could life really be that bad?
Sure, you've got your reasons
But your alibis are lies
The story is an old one
It's been told a million times
You were glad to be alive
On life's journey
You were excited
But you were not in a hurry
For years, you walked up and down each road

You had to try them all
Looking for your place, I guess
Where you could rest and feel at home

Now, tired of walking
You've started to run
Passing everything by
But at least you're having fun
Good karma, bad karma
You'll get what you deserve
There is good and evil
You've got a lot to learn
There is love, there is hate
You can't do as you please
Wash your face, take a bath
Your aura's still filthy

In someone's bathroom, turning blue, puking green
You're senile, senile at seventeen
Scars on your brain from drinking beer and smoking weed
Another acid tab, another shot of speed

Good karma, bad karma
You'll get what you deserve
There is good and evil
You've got a lot to learn
There's no lie, only truth

In reality
You hat love, you love to hate
Your soul is so diseased
You are just a fish in a sea of human beings
Lost in, caught up in, someone else's dream

Afraid to laugh 'cause you might drown
The true mad, sad clown sinking down
Into the darkness where no one
Would dare venture to save you",Karma,1985

Mad man, he'll call you a whore
Mad man, he'll brand you a slut

D.R.I.,"I am an old man living alone
My loved ones stuck me here in this nursing home
I've lost all usefulness
I want to die
I have them all the best years of my life
Then Maggie passed away, now I've got no wife
So kill me, young man, or hand me your knife
I want to die
My beautiful daughter says I get in the way
I depress her because I'm old and grey

She can't stand to see the wrinkles in my skin
By golly, girl, you're my only kin
I want to die
Like an old horse put out to pasture
Too old to be of any more use to it's master

And though I'm costing them money, I don't care

D.R.I.,"No, there are no easy answers
To sum up the problems which we face
History's a lesson, let us learn by our mistakes
Just don't expect to make sense
Out of what you see
For I can tell you now that
Knowing is believing
So if you open your mind you might understand
You're the victim of a bigtime government scam
And though you may not be inclined to believe
The man behind the desk does get paid to deceive
You live in your little dream world

You're much too cool to care
I really have to warn you
I think it's only fair
They await the final hour
As happy as they are sick
Laughing so hysterically
At all those who they've tricked
But then who an I to tell you who to believe in
When all the masks they seem so damn deceiving?
How can I say to you, ""You be Free""
That would never bring about mass anarchy
Now, would it?",Snap,1985

But I won't conform
Unlike my mindless vacant peers
They're the norm

Finished, may I use the bathroom please?

You're wincing, convulsing
You're aching with pain
Gasping for breath, and you're feeling insane

Hole after hole
Just proving your point
Point after point
Just digging you hole
Slow digging with a spoon

Hooked!

You're hooked on a drug that's controlling your mind
Hocking your soul for that measly last dime
You're dragged off and thrown in your own padded cell
You've reached end of rope at bottom of well

So put your dollars in the stack
The second coming's getting close
So pay up now and get the most
Form a line for all to pay
And do the same next Sunday
Step right up and clean your soul
Single file, young and old
I've made my decision

D.R.I.,"The day has come, the time is near
For all to end. It's true, it's here
It's all over now, no way to stop
The button's been pushed, the bomb's been dropped
The city is melting, the sky burns red
The ocean is boiling, we'll soon be dead
Death has come knocking, the door's open wide
He's let himself in, no place to hide
A tidal wave of power coming over the hill
A great well of thunder swooping down for the kill
Leveling, destroying everything in its path
Just seconds left now till we feel its wrath
The city is melting, the sky burns red
The ocean is boiling, we'll soon be dead
People run rabid from the great blast
The beast is upon us, it's here at last

All through the universe, but no one will hear",Oblivion,1987
D.R.I.,"Probation

They set the rules
They want me to break
Take all my money
Set me straight
Then they confine me
Make me check in
Analyze my piss
Ask me where I've been

They send me to classes
That say I've been bad
Take some more money
Prove to me I've been had

And they'll keep on trying
To straighten me out
And the more that they try
The more I doubt

D.R.I.,"Eyes full of hate, quick to condemn
Just stay in the dark and wait for an end
You don't really care, it's jut give and take
Keeping the distance, keeping it fake

Waiting for something that doesn't quite jell
Just cursing existence and hating your hell
Blinded by anger you don't really know
It's play by play as you put on a show

Your making your stand for nothing at all
Delighted with problems, a chance for a fall
Causing a scene to distribute the pain
It's all for one, such a nice little game

Your time flies by with nothing gained
Just talk of change and who's to blame
It's the same old story we know so well
With a premade ending you don't want to tell

Still waiting for something you haven't found yet
Just hide behind vices and a bunch of regrets
Blinded by anger that won't go away
Treading on water as you sink day by day",All for Nothing,1988

No more bandanna round my dome bandanna in my right pocket
B**** I'm grown f*** what you on
Now watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump I'm a fly and look into the eagles eye
And see I am nothin' like you, why?

I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat

I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man

You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative, baby, hold your head up, don't you let up
One bit on these motherfuckin' suckers, you're a soldier, get up
Stand up for what you believe in, long as you breathin'
They jealous of you man, that's the only reason they beefin'

My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons, I never show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons, I never did show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

It's that Dirty Dozen renegade, you done pulled the pin out my grenade
.38s'll move your shit up out the way
You niggas won't forget about McVeigh, you got somethin' to say?
Let it out today or watch these bullets spray

From these ten black fingers huggin' these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm dirty, so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater

You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers, Swift did it
You packin' somethin' special in your crib, then bitch get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils

You get splitted and guess what, I'm blowin' up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em

My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons, I never show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons, I never did show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

I'm eatin' crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper
(Why not?)
I only fuck animals
Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch

One on one in this bloodsport, I'm in divorce court
Sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your Honor)
Six times I been arrested, how would you feel
If you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?
(It happens)

I'm smokin' dank, drinkin' drank
I can't have any kids 'cause I'm fuckin' shootin' blanks
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?
Nicole's a whore, I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut

Responsibility, I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, should be stabbed
Let Richard Simmons be the President
Call me a weirdo, call me Bizarre
While I stick it up yo' ass while you shittin' diarrhea

My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons, I never show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons, I never did show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fuckin' gas for thirty minutes this mornin'
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day in a dress wit a sex change

I'm havin' a bad day
My fuckin' dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fuckin' mad 'cause I don't have AIDS
All I want to do is die
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right

Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab wit bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve-step program
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a chokeslam

I swear to God, this 'Pac poster comes any closer 
I'm kickin' this whole fuckin' wall over
Two more shots and it's all over
I'm all over this wall, tryin' not to fall over

Put your mother in a full-nelson while my boys take turns
A unibomber tryin to escape this country
Tell O.J. he better be comin' up wit my money

Bizarre goes commercial? Nigga, you can forget it
Bitch suck my *dick* that is the radio edit
I'm quick to smack the shit out of a foe
I ain't had pussy in a while, I'm too busy fuckin assholes

Do I really need to hear it?

I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life
And I'm such a tortured artist, let me make music about it
And my tragic love life!"" Am I on to something here?
Come on, man, it's not like that
You know what? Just hand the fuckin' thing over!
I'm done talkin' to you!
Think you can just come and go as you please

That's why I lets my dogs out on the baha men (bark)
As bad as the life I had, I'm not mad 
I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad (punch)
My whole family's country, my grandmothers old fashioned 
She keeps asking me why I rap with a honky 
But granny I'm a flunky, I could be	 a junkie 
I could be hanging with the hoochies outta the club scene

For all the independent women in the house (house)

Your mom and dad probably mad at us (for what?)
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers 
They like where I'm from (uh huh), we don't bite our tongue (yea)
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns? (blah blah blah)
Its sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme 
When you work, you ain't getting paid for that overtime (damn)
Its only music, media know it, but they blind (that's right)
I ain't in you're life so stay the hell up outta mine (nigga)
And your the reason why princess Diana ended up dying
You people get offended, I don't care 
(stop crying) 
Trying to get us to leave 
'cause what we say just ain't playing
But holding me back from what I say just ain't me 

[Kon Artis]
Now what's these parents so mad for? 
(Your music is bad) for teenage kids who drink more than Ted Dansonin cheers 
Carson drinks beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch(shut up) 
(poor or rich) I still do the same old shit, 
I don't jump infront of a camera and say no shit 
When they ask me about my sarcastic-ness 
I just slap them, turn around and ask them this

D12,"I'm the devil, if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gu-uh-uh)-sting
I'm (what), a human mutt fuck a being I'm a dog
Fuck lambs, I'm silencing 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walking, talking, Ouija board
Speaking in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
Hhem-delle-la, ennich-me-noughh-mi-niche-mick-norrf
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some shit, yo
""Is this some kind of sick joke?"" Shit no, motherfucking schizo
So disturbed, he just goes so berserk, he tiptoes
Fist first with scissors to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
So-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp
So lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn here comes another ""Clockwork Orange""
Look at Bizarre, you really think he's right in his mind?
What the fuck you think's goin' through when he's writin' his rhyme

You bout to, journey into the mind of a psychopath killer

It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Picking up transvestites on my Harley-Davidson (hey hop on)
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store (nigga, I'm takin these)
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (dad it's me)
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage (I'm sorry) I had to eat it (ohh)
My dick is burning, it ain't cause of disease
Because I'm jacking off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze (AHH!)
I'm living in Waco Texas, me and my girl
Fuck David Koresh, I'm starting my own world
It's called Bizarre Cemetery, it's scary
Eating a virgin's cherry, then I'm gonna laugh at you Carrie

I was born feet first, smoke 40's and drink weed
The Lord rehearsed my birth, I'm the worst breed
A nigga you ever set sight on, my right arm's
Got more power than 5 of Ivan Drago's pythons so
""Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer""
Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro-gas spiller
Psycho slash Michael Myers, Michael Jack's ""Thriller""
Rifle slash knife faggot that's your ""Cop Killer""
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was living (aight)
Cross-dressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek; I throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin' to stare at

What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs are dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz done felt
A deranged team, smokin ganja greens
This car beam'll make your fuckin head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D

Takin drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my ass, let your little brother try 'em

I'm eighteen years old, still shit in the bed
Beaten 'til I'm red, fear nothin but war and bread

It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
And drastic movement of people actin stupid

I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin like Boone's Farm
Hidin under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms
Connivin Kon, Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screamin, ""Let's get it on!""
A lush that love to drink, drunk drivin a tank
Rollin over a bank, cops see me and faint

I think I'll up my high by slittin your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street, 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street

You know why my hands are so numb? (No)
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't come (oh)

Tired of wearin this yellow thong

Have you runnin out this fuckin club in your drawers
We lovin the broads, there's nothin to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in The Source
It's fight music

I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the priest sayin, ""You hear that?""
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made 'em drop his coffin

These beads I'm swingin is stingin 'em
See all these niggaz? When I step in the club, I'm bringin 'em
If any nigga lookin too hard, we Rodney King'n 'em
Malice green to them and gasolinin 'em with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right hookin, right when your wife's lookin
Fuck fight music, bitch this is losin your life music!

Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it

Watch me, cause you thinkin you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers want to JUDGE me cause you're NOT me
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me

From parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me I'm makin 'em go crazy

Hey yo dog
I got some shit on my motherfucking chest that
I need to get off 'cause
If I don't
I'ma fucking explode or something
Now look
This is the story about
Some little fucking girls that I know
It goes like this

It's so easy for me to make enemies anymore it's sickening
People are looking for an excuse to jump on my shit list
Sticking their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that
I don't want to be in shit
I never had a beef with you corny son of a bitches
But now this shit is broke and you can't do nothing to fix it
So I'm telling you right now
Motherfucker Limp Bizkit
Now I'ma be real
B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefing
See he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'da never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpacking cyphering name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you say in it
I'da never involved you
But you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shit list and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known
That song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV
Now look who's mentioning me
That little fucking weasle, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props on that song you on national TV
Talking 'bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me
Come on dog, you was supposed to be on that song
Talking 'bout how bad you hate him
Now you all on his thong
What's wrong, you scared, and Fred, you said you was dissing himtoo
I should of knew better than to listen to you
You fucking sissy
Up on stage screaming how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act
And don't call me kissing my ass
Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song
I'm trying to prewarn you
Lethal, when I fucking see you dog, I'm swinging on you
Motherfuckers must think 'cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't draw
Up my sentence and double it tomorrow
Y'all are some

Girls (y'all are some God damn girls)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fucking sissies
You pussies keep talking shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (we all know, ha)
How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentley's
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and walk around

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't want to be in 'em
All I ask is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
'cause I don''t ask nobody to share my beliefs
Or be involved in my beefs
I'm a man
I can stand on my feet
So if you don't want to be in 'em
All I ask is that you don''t open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond
The beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show I'll strip you naked
See I was smart
I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dogs that'll die for me like I;ll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot, like I fight for Kim
All of them been with me through this fucked up life that I'min
That goes for all of my dogs from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Melman
Till I'm hoist away
In my coffin
I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I never give a fuck
I won't ever be interested
Love me or hate me
As much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I've stated
The shit that I been through
My pencil never could pencil
But I won't ever be this gullible ever again, no
Next time I'll know when someone's copying off me
I'm not being cocky
I just know when somebody's mocking me
I stick up my middle finger
He sticks up his finger
I say fuck Christina
He says fuck Christina, but meaner
So from doing a song with Method
To begging to get accepted
I'm pegging Fred
With the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal don't forget what I said
I'm fucking you up punk
You're dead
Don''t think that I'm playing
And fuck Bizkit
'cause I know you're saying fuck D12
Only not to our face, under your breath, and to yourselves
Little

Girls (motherfucking females)
Why do you act this way? (why do you act this way, huh?)
Why do y'all act like fucking sissies
You pussies keep talking shit behind my back
You just some bitches for that
And we all know (now we all know the truth)
How fucking cowards roll (keep rollin' rollin' rollin')
In fucking Bentleys
And pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and walk around

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs

And that's it
That's all there is to it dog
If you don't want to do the fucking song
Don't say you're down with doing the fucking song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfucking MTV
Talking about Everlast can whip my motherfucking ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
Just say you''re scared of Whitey Ford
That's it
That's all you had to fucking say
I wouldn't a said shit
I would of backed off
Did the motherfucking song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it
That's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fucking you up shit when I see you

I love getting shit started
I instigate a peace talk into a beef talk
Until police need chalk to chalk you up
Have bitches walking up
Smacking you in your face screaming that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Raid his pockets and stuck him
Till they gather in front of your crib
Guns and law clips
Laughing when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies
It's so believable
You run and grab your shotguns, glocks, and nines
Walking blind
Incite fights until they erupt
Instigate my own death 'cause killing you ain't enough

[Swifty]
I don't give a fuck if we beefing or not
I squeeze first
I'ma heat up your spot
I'm a nigga that breathe dirt
On these streets everyday
Snatching nigga's lle'
How you bitches needing work?
You can get it from McVay
I'm despiteful
I tie a hoe
A maniacal vile animal
Liable to leave you strapped with your Bible
I'm psycho
My bullets won't fly by you
You want to kill me?
(bang)
You got the right to
Ain't gotta wait till night to snipe you
If I don't like you
You getting hit in broad day light with a white rifle
In front of your window I'm looking right through
I love when I see a nigga get stuck

[Chorus]

[Kon Artis]
(I'm an instigator)
Drama tends to follow me
I know
I probably owe all of my friends apologies
Lie to every bitch just to get her to swallow me
Get a lobotomy?
Nigga this runs to my artery
Guns are a part of me
I pack more than pottery
I ought to be jailed for depicted mockery
Ain't gon' fight
The blood on the niggas that shot at me
I don't twist the truth
I just make it gothic, see?
I'm nothing but a liar
With a big ass mouth, dick, and fists
Big enough to knock your bitch ass out
Got no reason to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you
I rap with him
But I don't like Proof

[Proof]
Nigga fuck you
Me and Swift got plans to jump you
Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you
(I'm an instigator)
Convinced a tenth grader
To run up inside his classroom
And leave the kids sprayed up
Bitch straight up
This is the season for squeezing off triggers
On niggas for no reason
Either jump or quit running your mouth
Pull a gun out
Better use it till the bullets run out

[Chorus]

[Swifty]
I throw a brick at your crib
Having you standing on the porch screaming
(Look what you did!)
I ain't feeling no remorse
Nigga just pick up the kids
Swift got first dibs
On these cherry hot slugs 
That'll barbecue your ribs
I'm preparing death beds
Quick to bust lead
While I'm staring at the feds
Tearing off their legs
Once you drop dead
They'll be swearing it's a plague
I'm sicker than a ?
Watch the ? with dreds
You could shake if you move
Ditch with no clue
Don't put shit on your tape
With your skits and interludes
And once I finish you
They wouldn't put it in the news
I'm nuts so you hoes ain't got the guts to interview

You want me to do what?
What are those?
You want me to stick those in what?

What is on your nasty mind?
(Nasty mind, nasty mind)
Don't you want to get fucked from behind?

They treat me like a dirty slave
(Dirty slave, dirty slave)
And beat me like I won't behave
I just want to get freaky baby

I'm to Swift on my toes
To get caught up with you hoes
You don't know me (uh huh)
See I ain't gotta front to play the role (for real)
I'm a Know-G
I know when you're being phony
See you're probably boning them officers
Just to pull up on me (slut)
That's why sixty percent of women is lonely (uh huh)

They trying to creep slowly because they nosy
I ain't listen to what my momma told me
I fuck 'em and pass 'em to my homies (right)
Then he fuck 'em and pass 'em to the homies (take her)
I'm a nasty ass macaroni
You flashing fast money
You can pass the Roley
Fuck a alimony (bitch)

And ain't out screaming about your monthly
I'll be sticking your pretty ass until you turn ugly (damn)
You suddenly see stars when fucking me

But your pussy walls have had it (that's right)
It's evident that you been fucking like a jackrabbit
But I stay focused (bitch)
So I acted like I didn't notice
And fucked her with no baby lotion
And bust in the soap dish
Hoe you can quote this
Your breath is smelling like
You done sucked a senior citizen's old dick
Go spit (damn)
You gon' get chocked quick
Talking all that hoe shit
All aggressive asking for a slow kiss
No bitch (get the fuck outta here)
You like freaking
See you every night creeping
Sucking off the nice deacons
Slut you made his wife leave him (cunt)
So keep slurping
I'll be down to the fullest
But forget it bitch
Your nipples look like AK bullets (I'm out)

Yo, I'm tearing down whatever you built
Your marriage is through
'cause I answered your wife's door naked
Wrapped in a quilt
Hoes say,
""Kon Artis got a dick so big""
Man, I could persuade any bitch
To have eight of my kids
Shit, bitch
I should be locked up
For having honies' legs cocked up
In the back of my pop's truck
I'm not fucked up
I just got a fetish for shooting
Cum in coochie
'Till the pussy is booting it back out
I 69'd this one bitch and she bled in my mouth (shit)
Kicked her out
Cleaned the couch out
And beat up my crouch
I don't gotta creep in motels
I cheat at my house
See I''m a dog
I don't need to keep a secret hide out (naw)

All night I been snorting
Your age and where you're from
Is just not important (naw)
You look like one of my mistresses
On welfare, ten kids like the rest of my bitches
Dreams of fucking a handicapped bitch
Suck my dick while your teeth start to grit (whore)
Inner slave, that's how I want you to treat me
I ain't into S&M
But I love when you beat me
I told you I was a horny ass freak
While I'm beating my meat
Your daughter acting like she asleep (ya right)
My love is like thunder and lightning
After it''s over
I'm looking like I got my ass kicked by Tyson

D12,"Yeah, welcome to Amityville (Detroit, nigga!)
The reason why rappers gotta pack pistols (Why is that?)

Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

Nigga, we violently active, so fuck with us
See I'm backwards, I slap niggas and punch bitches
Just for asking, they musta been wanting to meet the Lord
When my parents talked to me, they got mean mugged and ignored
They were snooping through my closet, seen drugs on the floor
Shells from the 44 scattered over they porch
Busting pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Tryna break your neck to conversate? Bitch, I'll do it for you
Catch me laughing at your funeral when they lower you
You and your ho, you gots to go, bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow for any nigga we'll shower you
We young strapped and powerful and I ain't gotta lie to you

Stepped in the door, waving the 44
Blazing at po-po, escaping and lay low
They call my tongue ya-yo, but I spit fire
I lit five inside a fucking dick-rider
The clip slider, love to blast a Mag
You a fag, you love being ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat-spank ya
Never say that I'm a gangsta (Now that's gangsta)
Y'all niggas sound like Jigga but act like Pac
Yo my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nothing to tell, empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gon' put hell outta business
It won't be the same since we touching the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew, tuck in his chain
Y'all think this shit's a game and I'm bluffing for fame?
I'll squeeze off this tec until nothing remains

Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you

Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

The only time that I'm at peace is when I'm close to one
Cause I don't know what's waiting for me when my vocals are done
Tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggas'll put your fucking life in the dirt
Cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
Alone in the streets, bleeding, staring, laying lifeless
That's why I'm heated, you never know who starts creeping
Waking you up with AK's while you lie sleeping
I'd rather pack the heat and not need it
Rather than need one and not have it, I married this Glock-matic

You know the sound when I'm spinning round
Spitting these rounds from four pounds
While the whole crowd screaming as loud
From they mouths as they possibly allow?
Nothing is parallel to making you carousel
Aerial somersault like ferris wheels to a pair of shells
Denaun carry the nine where I go
Bullets whistle and hit you while I'm shooting at 5-0
Some semi-automatic for static's the motto
Spitting like *Columbine kids* from Colorado

Slick criminal wit, the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to

Nobody got my back in this bitch but this do
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol

This nine'll turn a softy to a hard rock
It'll make Jehovah's Witnesses, think before they knock (Sorry, sorry!)
It'll make your grandmother come outta her purse
It'll make Limp Bizkit, get rid of Fred Durst
It'll make Holyfield start fighting
It'll make Mase say fuck church and go back to writing
It'll make Shyne say he sound like Biggie Smalls
It'll make R. Kelly, give respect to Aaron Hall
It'll make Christopher Reeves start walking
It'll make a dog with no voice, suddenly start barking
It'll make a nun turn to a filthy slut
It'll make the hardest pitbull, turn to a fucking mutt
It'll make a Muslim dye his hair blonde
It'll make a redneck start to read the Holy Qu'ran (Need Jesus!)
It'll make Ike stop beating Tina
It'll make Slim Shady fall back in love with Christina

I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (AHH!)
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
I said come on, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (me!)
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb-ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around

Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out
Come on!

He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Heh, hey Von you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin' stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (EWW!)
Yeah I think I did too much, this substance equals cups

They probably wanna take each other out and date each other

Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm, old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a (you're crazy!)

I pop fo' E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Yeah, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggaz think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
And if you like smack (uh-huh) then I might too

And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (uh-huh)

I don't want to go to school, I don't need no education
I don't want to be like you, I don't want to save the nation
I just want to live my life, everyday a celebration
One day I'ma leave this world, I'm waiting for the revelation

[Bizarre]
I want to kill myself! I'm still debating
In front of a baptist church, masturbating
Praying to Satan, think I'm crazy cause I smoke crack
live on in a two-family flat? (Fuck it)
Tired of gettin hit in the face with a broom
My moms on her period, my dad's in my room (Daddy no!)
I got ten rocks and I need to get out
I told him in five minutes, out my own damn mouth (Moms smoke crack)
My poor grandmother, God bless her soul
The bitch got AIDS (aww) she just waiting to die of a cold
There's three things that keep me from being a Nazi
I'm black, a fag, and my dad's Liberace

[Kon Artis]
No matter how bad the beating, I went to school cheating
My dad whooped my ass at a PTA meeting
Stick with school I had to have nuts just to do it
Got bored and became truant
When I had the gall to go I just couldn't do it
I was lured into corners by the peer pressure shit
How would you feel if you was held by the tip of a barrel
Getting threatened to get your skin ripped to bone marrow
Bet suburban kids never got rushed for their apparel
like me, outcast, last in class
First to leave, when the teacher called on me
Best believe I had somethin up my sleeve

[Eminem]
I've been praised and labeled as crazed
My mother was unable to raise me, full of crazy rage
An angry teenager, nothing can change me back
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac
I was boosting, so influenced by music I used it
as an excuse to do shit, ooh I was stupid
No one can tell me nothing hip-hop overwhelmed me
to the point where it had me in a whole another realm
It was like isolating myself was healthy
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy
Compelled me to excel when school it failed me
Expelled me and when the principal would tell me
I was nothing, and I wouldn't amount to shit
I made my first million and counted it
Now look at, a fucking drop-out that quits
Stupid as shit, rich as fuck, and proud of it
That's why

[Chorus]

[Swifty McVay]
I was raised with a rifle and mask
Steadily beating my psychiatrist ass just for asking about my past
(bitch) I was never on that punk shit, fucking around
can get yo' beloved abducted, smothered in blood quick
You couldn't pay Swift to give a fuck
Was crazy like my father, it must of been poison in that nigga's nut
Far as probation, fuck peeing in cups
I violate at any time, let 'em see the blunt
I grew up steadily masturbating inside of cells
Young as hell, having conversations with myself
You could tell I wasn't lenient, a disobedient
Lynched and slapped teachers, bitch I'm not reading it
You don't know what dos go through, a little nigga
Sipping liquor with my old dude, what the fuck you goin' do?
I'm quick to curse you, I told my mother that I'ma hurt you
if you ever again mention a curfew

Look, my family ignored me and I don't like that
They don't even listen when I tell them I'll be right back
(Yeah whatever) This nice beautiful house ma, it don't mean shit
Cause you know daddy's a drunk and he don't clean shit
And yesterday he hit me like a grown fucking man
I couldn't stand up to him, I just ducked and ran
I'm sick of this, I wish on Christmas
that I can get a loaded four-fifth and put a fucking end to this
(Fuck it) I got no friends and I can't get a bitch
Only thing I have is dirty magazines and sticky fingertips
Nothing to smile about, I'm about to lose my mind
Got me an automatic nine, now I'm balling out

[Proof]
Wait 'til school's over, pu-pil are people to shoot through
Kids going cuckoo, with a two-two
Since my fame is this new dude, in this high school
Losing his noodle learn that people don't like you
The football jocks is, spitting on him
Popular kids in school is now picking on him
Burn out youngsta niggas now hitting on him
And his teacher in his English class keep flipping on him
And now he's grounded with no allowances
for drinking forty ounces, cause he was caught by his counselors
And why the fuck I gotta ride the bench coach?
Already got expelled for wearing a trench coat
All I ever seen is (violence, violence)
Told me to keep silent, stepped back in my eyelids
It's apparent that my parents weren't parents at all
That's why I blew out my brains and murdered you all

I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit

Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry

Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordon blew and

Which only sets off a chain reaction

And spilling liters of blood like swimmin' pools

And hit higher than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal wit you in front of St Andrew's still?
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that roll you got
You goin' see these Runyan Ave. niggas that really need some Prozac
For sure that, ask the others
But gator lay you down next to your mother's mother's grandmother

[Kuniva]
You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight and half the niggas I give dap to I don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it like the next selling Clippers' game
I kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom
You and your madame, it's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call they self screaming about a challenge
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off mere talent
My skills are deeply embedded even your hoe said it
She was knock kneed I fucked her now she's bow legged
In the middle of rapping I drop the mic
And have a stare down and jump in the crowd and start scrapping
Kuniva and Kon Artis my nigga we get it cracking
While the paramedics pick you up we on the side laughing

[Chorus 1]

[Kon Artis]
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
Shit can happen in him and yo' ass
You can be touched don't think you can't
Cause niggas ain't fucking around no more man [Repeat: x2]

[Swifty McVay]
The feds can't hold me, I hold feds
I was born wit a dark ass cloud over my head
Raining acid, you can't refrain from getting yo' ass kicked
Cause you talk too much you ask for it
I'm on some massive shit, everybody ignore me
They wouldn't fuck with me if I was performing at an orgy
These niggas get confronted, then they change stories
I touch you then they thinking everything is hunky dory
I even have you pour me the gasoline for me
Pulling up slowly, cocktailin' your homie 
You met a lot of niggas which you wouldn't want to know me
Yo' ass might not even make it home wit your rollie
Don't even try, in your system like e coli
Trying to beef with me, nigga please yo' people die
I'm so wicked that my mama gave birth illegally
I survived the abortion immediately, surprise! ah!

[Eminem]
Picture me sitting in a jail cell rotting
Or barricaded in a motel wit twelve shotguns
So when the cops come knocking each hand's got one
Cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shot puts
One man army, guns can't harm me
Young and army, worse than my Uncle Ronnie
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me
I can't stop carrying out my dirty laundry
Middle fingers flipped and censorship
Your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship
Ever since I spit some shit on Infinite
I been giving it a hundred and ten percent
Cause when I'm bent most of my energy's spent on enemies
Eighty percent of what I invent is innocent
Twenty percent is from being hungry as sin
Ten's because I love being under your skin
Yeah shit can happen, so stick to rapping
Quit the yapping or I'ma lift the mack and
That can lead to another mishap happening
Skip the crap get the can of whoopass cracking

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
It can and it will (nigga)
Fuck around with Amityville and you DIE
Insanity spills from the mentality of twelve motherfuckers in six different bodies
With their personalities split
Fucking you up wit hit after hit
Sticking you up with clip after clip
Making you suck dick after dick
Dirty motherfucking dozen
The Kon Artis, motherfucking Peter S. Bizarre, Swifty McVay, the Kuniva
Dirty father fucking Harry
Putting you down in a cemetery, you get buried
All you of you motherfuckers suck our motherfucking cocks
We are not playing, we are not playing
We are not bullshitting, this is not a motherfucking joke",Shit Can Happen,2001

Same slanging
Orangutangin
Wilding out on hoodrats that say I act like like I'm too famous
To say hi
And tell 'em what ""My Name Is""
But really I'm still nameless

[Kon Artis]
I said hold up, hold up!
I know you didn't just go shit up on that stage, bitch ass nigga.

It was like, whoa and then the fucking room started spinning and shit
And my friend came in he was like, ""Yo! Yo! Em! Em!
You putting that shit up your nose again?""
And I was like, ""Naw"" nothing like, everything was just spinning
I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster n' shit
Then I just started laughing and threw up all over the fucking floor
It's crazy

[Chorus 2:]
It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me
Do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do

[Eminem]
My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listening to it
It's got the power to get you to do it (c''mon)
So when the shit comes on, I want to see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfucking kid get stomped
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
Cause times like these, got me doing lines like these
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does
And is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids

[Bizarre]
Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!)
Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next tome
(huh?) 'Til I'm dead I''m taking blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
That I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?
Causing out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!)
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
Cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smoking a half a pound
Fucking the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down

[Chorus 1]

[Eminem]
It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy I was like out of control
And, just was fucking wasted every night, like
Waking up the next morning like, where the
Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is going on
You see what I'm saying? I was just like, out of control

[Chorus 2]

[Swifty McVay]
These Benadryl's got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowing Anacins, standing over my Bannister
Laughing with a chromed out caliber 
The weed that I'm selling this ? look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashing it, after framing a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months
Cracking capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm looking like a extra on ""Night of the Living Dead""
Until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?
This crank'll have me blowin up banks like Uncle Fester

[Proof]
Watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (oh)
Blue pills, and purple mushrooms
(Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)
Missing since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin see
Swallow Hennessy along with Tylenol 3
Grinding the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
While D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach lining, drown in my vomit

[Chorus 1: x2]

[Eminem]
Cause I like, I always tell people, ya know what i'm saying like
If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody,ya know what i'm saying?
Keep that shit to yourself, because if anybody sees that, ya know what i'm saying
When you're out in the public eye and shit
They're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, know what I'm sayin but
I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck
I'll probably end up, dying from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
""Eminem dies from, drug overdose"" you know what I'm sayin? And
And my friends, they ain't no fucking better, ya know what I'm saying?
They ain't nothing but influences, bad influences to me, ya know
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it
So do they

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (AHH!)
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
I said come on, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (me!)
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb-ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out
Come on!

Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Heh, hey Von you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin' stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (EWW!)
Yeah I think I did too much, this substance equals cups
Red pills, blue pills, and green, big pills (that's ill), mescaline!

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, somethin', some'un, some'un, some'un

Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm, old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a (you're crazy!)

I pop fo' E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Yeah, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggaz think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
And if you like smack (uh-huh) then I might too
(Swift, chill) I just wanna get high like you! (ewww)
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (uh-huh)
Speed, 'shrooms, down the valiums (uh-huh)
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers

I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

I'm at rave lookin' like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope-headed guy
Heroin mescaline, pencilnecks, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin' ill
Drugs kill (yeah right) bitch, I'm for real!!!
Shut your mouth you dirty slut, you know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt, let Bizarre nut!

Loose everything that I've brought
The house the kids and the car
I know this sounds bizarre
But we should give her a call
And see if she want in
That way its three way sex and we can all be friends

Fucking with your pussy is a handful (for real)
You think I'm drowning but I'm clowing
So basically bitch you a damn fool
And that's a given fact
Plus I remember back when you was young
I could see a hundred niggaz through your gap
And all of them was probably hitting that, that's embarrassing
You stuck with thirty children, seventy miscarriages
In and out of buildings, ain't carin' who it is
Fucking newly weds, didn't mean to do it but you did

Devil is she, she never to be (faithful)
Credit to free its better that she (tranquil)

Stop the plot through the freeze with my cash flow
Cock the Glock at them ??? in the castle

Skis in the satchel

Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem

Too busy fuckin' wit (your twelve year old) baby sitter (ha ha ha)
And all women ain't shit, only good for cookin', cleanin'
And sucking dick and that's it (I said it)
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

My adolescent years weren't shit 'til what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin' the shit how borin' it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordon blew and

Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in choke holds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep

D12,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

Shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battling
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say

Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back

When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,
Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently

I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres

I'll allergic to dying, you think not? You got balls? We can see how large

I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till your car spin, you think
Damn!

You slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
Niggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic
I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night

Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
You all don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose

?? the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit, 
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin 
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when 
You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?

Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like 
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'

I mean these niggas squeeze on me 
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you 
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"" 
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt 
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

[Kon Artis]
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it 
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back 
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you comin

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an

Haha, wake your mother fucking asses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my roof bitch!

For whatever it's worth it's worth me having my ass whipped
'Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little peasants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Hawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having a slapping
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
'Cause I'm telling you right now your not gonna like it
'Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be	
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

D12,"Yeah, homie
I thought we, told we been fucking loco
Cypress Hill, D12, bitch!

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain, 'cause I'm a psycho

We're fuckin' crazy
We'll fuckin' snap in a minute bitch

I'm a motherfucking omen, I bow down to no man
Split a nigga open, killing folks compulsive
A soldier with a motive, scrotum big as boulders
I hold 'em then unload on you, put it on a poster
So everyone can notice who was focused on us
Poking they nose in our business, hoping that I don't come smoke 'em
No one knows my notions or emotions, I'm a vulture
You niggas close to croaking any moment and I know when
I could fuck the culture up, probably rap
A maniac with anxiety attacks, I don't wanna chat
Speak when you spoken to and I don't have to read a fucking
Magazine or quotable to notice what you hoes will do

We all soldiers, we move as a unit, we all roll up
And show up at your residence, light your front door up
Get scared, life ain't fair
And I'm prepared to blast you just as fast as Dre can say ""Hell yeah!""
So watch what you say cause it can happen either today or the next minute
I can draw the heater and spray and I'm dead serious
You could be dead period, end of story
I'm on your porch with a gun and your son, sipping a forty
Nobody can hold me, I does it all by my lonely
I stomp your head when you awake, you be looking like Gumby
Aftermath and Shady, bitch, you can read it and weep
You see my poster in the 'hood for ""the G of the Week""

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho

You know what, I am crazy
As hell

Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain, 'cause I'm a psycho

Nigga I'm about to snap any minute nigga, evacuate

They found Saddam, but they ain't gon' find me
I'll be under a tree in Buttfuck, Tennessee
And I don't know too much about my daddy
Except he spit in my face and fucked me in my fanny
I ain't a racist, I just hate whites
Fags and dykes, blacks and transvestites
Thirteen years old and joined a fucking gang
Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
Am I insane? Who really knows?
Cause any second my temper can fucking blow
I get colder than December
Black the fuck out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizarre can show you what violence is all about
And this Dr. Dre beat done brought it the fuck out
Run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
And blow your brains the fuck out!

I probably got a screw loose or two
Or maybe three or four of 'em
Some fell out and hit the floor
All I know is ever since my fucking head hit the snowbank
I been a little neanderthalish, no thanks to my man D'Angelo Bailey
But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
Trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up
It's been two hours and six days and I'm still up
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill-up
Pick the new Cypress Hill up
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
And shatter his fucking lips with it

I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain, cause I'm a psycho

We wrote a song for the hoes
You like to hear? here it goes
A little something you probably won't hear on the radio

When I flee, your ass can get as naked and be as free
As you wanna be freak
But I'm taking the key with me.
You ain't gonna get shit, so don't even ask
Disrespect my wishes, I'll beat your ass
Watch me coming home floor eating half of your doggy bag
And I leave laughing, while you calling me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit
And before she cut them on, Kuniva already switched!
Your ass ain't even riding with Swift unless your going
When I'm done, I throw you out and ask you where you going

Hoe ain't the only thing you call a girl

I'm going to get my gun!
Nah motherfucker fuck you
You ain't disrespecting me like that

I bring it to niggas looking as if they want trouble
I send they body flippin' around like a stunt double
Forget about the fighting, scrapping, squabing, buckin'
I'll squeeze the piece you jumping, dodging, duckin'
Squat under trucks and screaming ""that niggas bluffin'""
I cuff my nuts while cussing ""don't trust him""
I round up Runyan, Dave, Wood and Nico
My nigga Big I and Mal' lettin' the heat blow
Heat sleep hoes got in you're neepo
'cause you keep shooting at me and missing like Shaq's free-throws
You gotta hit a little closer if you wanna try
Pistol whip a soldier, with a missile on his shoulders
You can fold or blow ya' brick house into some tiny boulders
A grimey older cab will leave you with a tiny odor
I'm doggish, you feeling frogish, you leap bitch
My car is right across the street bitch and (I'm going to get my gun!)

My whole outfit count clips
Get you're house lit the fuck up
You're spouse shit, and you're mouse clip
Betta' watch miscountless, slugs I'ma send
Watch you hollow when the hollow tips go threw you're skin
I'm in love with the sin, tell Bugz I'ma see him
When I cock back might put the door on you're friends
Make a run, gotta him, bust a slug on his chin
Ain't going no were like the drugs outta Kim
I'm a psycho icon, a mightful might bomb
Get a eye full of lid when I slight you're lights out
With a street cleaner, whipe you're life out
Bullets know at you're ears, like a Tyson fight bout
Fuck the night clout, guns, clips... (I'm going to get my)
Fuck that run bitch!
Hit the streets talks, chumps don't know me
Ain't no problem to leave your whole bod holey

My shit is all jammed up!
C'mon you cock-sucking, good-for-nothing, mother-fucking piece of shit, shoot
Yeah!, what up bitch!? say that shit again!
Shot the bullet missed, hit a brick, bounced of it, ricocheted back in his shin
Went threw his bitch on his way back, hit his friend
Payback homie, don't play that shit is spin
To be on I told you to leave this shit alone
Or...(I'm going to get my gun)

They bodyguard be stepping in trying to calm shit down (Chill out man)
Fuck that I got a bone to pick
You said it then have settle like some grown man shit
Then me and you could talk about our problems couldn't we?
Shoot a fair one and handled this situation seriously
I guess not, you wanna' resort to the heater
So I gotta grab my Mac and my Uzi and my Nina
Step in between us and get shot
But get separated with the squeaza
You ain't ready for war, Runyan ain't nothing to play with!

It's been two hours and my fucking days ruined
Hey ""Kate"" do you wanna get raped?
Have my pictures on fucking Philips 38
That's why I don't be fucking battle rapping
'cause every time I loose, this is what the fuck happens (Gun shots)
Back to these pictures I was trying to get developed
This man tried to get in front of me, I wouldn't let him
I'm ready to blow this bitches brains out
I'm nervous, I farted, some shit came out

How the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans
Nina, 2 nina's, a peace and they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one they gon' think its machine guns
Vanos vo vano, bananas in our flannels
Hands around our colt handles, hold them like roman candles
Vannas vo vannas, banana fanna fo fannas
Who come back all bananas, banna clips loaded
Managers, bouncers and the club owners, the motherfuckers don't want us
To come up and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyan, steady popping them onions,
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mixing coke with coke and nut rum up
Yeah Yeah oh, what up, see my people throw shit up
See you talk that hoe shit now when you down you don't get up
And can't sit up your so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater no heater, automatic no matic

Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run,
When the reaper comes, the repercussions' gon' leak your blood,

Snatch you out our home, like eviction notices hoe,
When I unload, I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam,
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wicked in scroll,
At the toll, when I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga.


Now it's proven it's about to be a misunderstanding
In furniture moving, bullets flying, lawyers & mothers suing
Cause niggas don't know the difference, you bitches just stick to fiction
It's sickening, you can't even walk in my jurisdiction rippin' it,
Grippin' the pump and who wanna fuck with a walking psychopathic
Pyromaniac shady cats with 80 gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst a
And since you jumpin' in front of everybody you gon' get it first

So go on and record you verses now while you got a mouth,
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle,

Maybe we would have picked another time
Or chose another way
Or maybe my prayers would have convinced him to choose another soul
Shit, its just me and my mentoni now
Man you look so peaceful now, how can I argue wit that
They say

[Chorus]
They say the good die young,
That's why I think that you should have fun (when your young)
'Cause time won't wait for no one (uh huh)
When God calls, you gotta go home (go home)

They say the good die young, (die young)
That's why I know that we gon' have fun,
In this life 'cause you only get one
When God comes for me, don't cry till I'm home

[Kon Artis]
Its true that everybody heard, there mama say every days like this
When you see, one of your friends die in the mist
In the struggle, went through circumstances
Arrested every day just to prove a point to a friend
Even then, accidents are prone to happen to any man
A woman is dumb enough to pretend
That her, God won't hold them accountable for sins
If they commit, they try to repent to ??
But I guess (that's just the way things go)
I was blessed to see 24 (24)
To wake up to that how my name is video
Motivated me to write what I wrote
And I knew my little brother sold dope
An mom and daddy want to move our road
I did it, I still got a lot to prove and show
I just which we ain't have to lose Bugz to the struggle
'cause you know

[Bizzare]
I know you used to Bizzare on some silly shit
But Niggas in my cliq, is dying quick
In Detroit, niggas don't party
They pull a .44 out, snatch off bacardis
That's why I keep the pistol under the trunk
I'm 27 years old, too old to be getting jumped
And fuck rap, I miss Karnail Pitts, be	-you-g-z
Tattooed on my wrist
Me and you in the jeep, listen to ?? beats
Its a shame me and Fuzz don't even speak
I got married, my wife name is D
Peace to 31 and 51-50, miss you

[Kuniva]
I came back on that tragic, my phone rung
And Bizarres voice telling me, Bugz was gone home
It was like a knife piercing my chest and I couldn't breath
I didn't wanna accept it, didn't wanna believe it
I swear with this weight dog, I cried so hard
Literally, Denaun had to carry me to the car
While I stand in this booth now its tearin' me apart
But I had to let it out 'cause it was tearin' at my heart
'Cause he died over something so petty and so small
A human life is so very precious I hope y'all
Understand how I'm feeling 'cause I love you bugs
I wanna rhyme wit you, laugh wit you, hug you bugs
But I can't and you was so close to seeing dreams
A coward came along and took you away from the team
So don't mistake this track, its just another song
This goes out to everyone who lost a loved one
'Cause you know

[Proof]
They say its never too late, to have an early childhood
If I could, turn back the hands of time, God should
Forgive what I did as a kid to run blocks
Now my dreams are just dream cops and gun shots
The fun stops when your homies up in a box
My dudey bole, rest his soul, snuffed by the cops
I use to smoke shit a lot, if there's a guy by me say something
If you love her so much why didn't you gave nothing
When he took my homie, snuck was only in 11th grade
Now I hope to see your face at the heaven gates
It ain't never late in the game, this hating remains
With a grudge to see slugs straight through my frame
My heart aches with the pain, the life in his breath
We gotta have fun now, there's only minutes left
In the depth, distress youngn's is sucked in
To get task my fallen homies I got enough

[Chorus]

[Swifty]
When I was younger I knew four brothers that wasn't wise
That crash and the driver died,
My partner on the passenger side was paralyzed
And I'm surprised by the look of that ride that the other peeps survived
Nine months later another one died
Somebody shot him in the side when he was starting up his ride
3 years go by, I made a hell of a run
And that's when funky got done, a joey playing wit guns
And ?, karty was my man
And reggy, I wish that I was wit you in that van
And Bugs if it wasn't for you
You know I wouldn't be standing in this booth,
That's the truth, I miss y'all

You got a phone
Pick it up
Call me

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you

We were so young
So full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5'ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold, your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more

On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I would of killed a nigga first
'Fore  I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her
Stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas must of hurt your pride or something
'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your mans, lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player
The one that's changing is you

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all

It's gettin' lonely at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speakin' all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping
And poof it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance
Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intelligence
That's forever 'til the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(How come) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(And how come) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more

And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt.

I got plans for you, trick, I don't need a baby mother.
I got five of them motherfuckers tryin' to smother me already.
We can't go steady, but you can give me head.
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shit.
My chap lips will cut nipples when breast fed,
And on the way, leave the bread with achman.

With a fat chick that eat cake on play skates.

And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber.
He might as well have went and told the hoe that he love her.
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother,

Keep on poppin' off with them jaws because, we ain't stoppin'
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all so all y'all can lick the balls and keep walkin'
Keep on poppin' that shit you poppin'
Cause we ain't stoppin' cause you ain't stoppin' us
We ain't got to prove shit to y'all so all y'all can lick the balls and keep walkin'!",Keep Talkin [*],2004
D12,"[Chorus: Eminem]
Y'all better leave that boy alone
'cause if they don't
You know they going come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't dare get that boy going

I said leave that boy alone
'cause y'all don't know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To stirr some shit up when he in that zone

[Bridge: x2]

Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
'cause you don't want to get that boy goin

[Swift]
It's my attitude that's making me bust shit
I hate to be fucked with
So basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returning bows 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation I run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her mouth to gun resuscitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got you mad 'cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
We coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancing
Coming here is the worse mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle I'm pulling you in
I guarantee the world will never see you again

[Chorus]

[Kon]
Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain something to ya
A real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets
He's trying to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb hoe punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
This nigga dying over prizes to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play deep
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinking you can't really get sleep
'cause you laid a nigga down without any meat
Well my cops won't allow me to make decisions in vein
I'm a man I do my bidding and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever

[Chorus]

[Kon]
Now people I live trifling I express it through writing
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a knew knife
And I strike people so fast people think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few height men
Been harassed by two dikes who wanted (lou pikner)
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
'cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kunive son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, skinny or wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas get dropped once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stuck till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, I'm writing these five words
Fuck you dick riding niggas count it, it's five words.

You don't me, McVay and I doubt if you understand me
Why would I give a fuck about you if we ain't family?
I roll with a chosen few, and those of you that's behind me
Witness the most potest' ferocious niggas that rhyme
These bitches turn they back on you, actin' like they ain't did shit
When you rappin' never mix business up with your friendship
If you lackin' up in this jungle, then what you breathe for?
Niggas don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes
Far as static, I automaticly get medieval
When I'm after people, then I'll explode you bitches with see-4
These hoe's, have no insurance, bodies get repo'
Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close
Keepin' .44's where you're hoes are swallowing deep throat
If you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep, close
Niggas pupils that's what I do, I'm foolish will shoot you
'Cause I'm coo-coo, But I don't think niggas can take in heat tho'

See I'm a man, and a man gon' do what he gotta do
And he ain't really family if he ain't loyal to you
If they was really soldiers then they would do what we do
And be loyal to crew and crew was loyal to you


I don't give a fuck, I'm quick to blaze chronic
Smoke on so much green, use twelves and supersonic 
Bizarre pack guns and knives, put to dick to nuns and wife's
Now who the fuck want to fight?
Ain't nobody fucking with me, Ain't nobody fucking with the D'
They get beat like a M-P
You heard about Bizarre taking all them drugs
You heard about Proof wilding in the clubs
You heard about that nine that Eminem packs
You diss us, you get you're fucking face cracked
I'm from 7 Mile and stout, I'll shoot up you're house
Next day, I'll pee in you're mouth.

Aiyyo, loyalty's first, all the bullshit second
I showed you on the record, Cheers to who respect it
Most of these niggas neglect it
Even though it's a known method
From the hectic hood that you slept in
You want to' be an exeption
That's when the weapon is leaving you're half stepping
With that 'caine in you're left hand
Obie from a section that'll stain up you're flesh and
Have you on bare breast
Questionin' you're affection for streets

One of the best groups that done it
And Obie is their reflection

When I got a passion for clappin', with one hand

Never leave the crib without packing my black burner

Reach for me one more gain' and that's closed
For life as D12, no ice and spreewells

Knowing I can be killed
Leaving my group, pieces of proof with a reason to shoot
And a license to ill

D12,"Now out of all the women in the place,
you got me starin' at your pretty face.
And with that body I could truly say that
you are the one, you are the one, you are the one, ooh oooh.
Amazed by the way that you shake them hips,
shakin' your ass off in my dick.
I get aroused by them sexy lips cause
you are the one, you are the one, we are the one that can do.

And you wonder why I call you everyday of the week,
and have that operator breakin' on your line when you speak.
And I can say that I'ma make you mine in a blink.
You nominated just for your behind and I'm ?,
you a thug with your best of friend, mud-wrestlin'.
Sittin' in the corner with a mug and a cup of gin.
See me lookin' for you when you win in a pen,
see I hug you dirty. You confronting me for flirtin'?
You wanted me so suddenly, my company's a burden,
but I won't jump a balcony, and how can I be hurtin'.
I'm just playin' wit you and it's workin'.
Your friend's can't save you, they fakin' like they nurses.

First time I saw you, up in them guests,
you the only reason I use Federal Express.
Shit, I don't be havin' no packages. Naw,
I'm getting dressers, lamps, and big matresses.
I go crazy when I smell your odor.
I just want to pick you up, and take you to Pan-De-Rosa.
Steak and potatoes, whatever you want.
I'll write just the buffet, my publics check then come.
You don't care about D12, you don't know about Bizarre.

That's fine, I just want to make you mine.
niggas say you a 3, I think you a dime.

I love the way yo' body grindin', gettin' all in my face.
Only thing on your mind is which wallet to ?.
Your ass looks so perfect with your thong on your waist,
built like a stallion, you belong in a race.
Get money by the barrel, King Kong in the place.
Movie and a dinner, that's as long as I wait.
Hey, I ain't on your ear off, talkin' dates.
Got you dizzy of the crissy, you ain't walkin' straight.
Got a roomy, bring your booty, and lets cultivate.
You so pretty, love them titties, they soft and fake.
Bring your friends, ""Damn your skin smell like coffeecake.""
Yo meet me at the place when you get off at eight.

The way you move have got me buggin' out.
And you quick to take off your jacket and slug it out,
we thug it out. Pourin' 40's out and give each other ?. In fact,
we both hate goin' out, we both hate small gats.
You the truth I'm for real yo I love you to death.
And if we break up, I'ma stalk you and bug you to death.
Till you scared to leave the house because you know I'm in the bushes.
We went from hugs and kisses into shoves and pushes.

I don't get down like that, you know I'd never hit you.

D12,"I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (oh shit)
What now nigga, what now? What? Brewster Projects nigga

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

(Kuniva, you hurt?) These niggas is tripping
(Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!

I'm on 7 Mile, what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with they car?) With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with)
Man! (I swear) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way

I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
Fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops

It's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

I know you're thirsty(ma)
Go ahead and order whatchu want
Some call it trickin',go ahead and call it whatchu want

Her Attractiveness
Got me attackin' this
Oh so fabulous
Gluteus maximus
She wanna fly south for the winter
I might just go down south just to win her
Hell naw,she ain't gon' leave me alone 
Makin' plans for us to be at home 
Take your pants off you can leave your panties on 
But,first drop down and get your eagle on

Flap your wings
(Come on)
Flap your wings
To the girls with extensions to the girls with dreds
(Come on)
Flap your wings
(Come on)
Flap your wings
 From the girls got it good livin' in the suburbs
(Come on)
Flap your wings
(Come on)
Flap your wings
To the ones in the ghetto with their hands on their -- curves (Come on) 
Flap your wings (Come on)

We hold it down like we 'sposed to
Nigga you can front if you want, we be poppin them thangs

After the VMA's my baby momma cussed my ass out
I kicked her ass, we back friends like Puffy and Steve Stoute
Cut the grass around my crib so I could see these snakes
You see 'em back in the hood, it's cause I see they're fake
I preach a sermon ‘bout the paper like I'm Creflo Dollar
I pop you punk niggas like I pop my collar
I'm confused, I like Megan, Monica and Mya
Missy's freaky and Brandy's shy (uh)
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up
I'm on now, God damnit, I done came up (what?)
Now you can find me with the finest hoes
Choosin which whip to drive by what match my clothes
I got a fetish for the stones, I'm heavy on the ice man
If I ain't got a pistol on me, sure I got a knife fam
Get out of line and I'm lightin yo' ass up
Semi-automatic's spray I tighten yo' ass up - what?

Slow down punk nigga, don't exceed your speed
Cause I will put G's on your fitted like the Negro League
I got connects, I don't need no weed
I been in L.A. for a year now, so I don't see no seeds
After I'm done you: clappin the crew
Hell yeah I fuck fans, guess what, your favorite rapper does too
In a minute I'mma have the jeweler makin my rims spin
My crew run wild like the Jamaicans in Kingston
Nuttin but bling bling in your face boy, that's why my neck
Shine like one of the shirts that Puffy and Mase wore
I done found a nympho as soon as I pop a broad
She at my balls, head first like a soccer star
You can only stand next to the man if you proper
I take care of birds like an animal doctor
I been out and buzzin, niggas just slept on me
So I'm out for revenge like one of Bin Laden cousins

Read the paper, look at the news, we on the front page
Yeah we in the Bahamas with AK's on the stage
The ice in the Jacob watch'll make a broke nigga take somethin
So I gotta keep the fo'-fifth with no safety button
G-Unit get that money, I know some artists is starvin
But play the game like they rich, to me the shit funny
I know you see me comin; cause on the front of the Maybach
It say payback for those that hated on me
I hate when niggas claim they bangin a gang
You ain't a Crip like Snoop, you ain't no Blood like Game
See I been havin beef, I got my own bulletproof vest
Most of my enemies dead, I got about two left
Until my last breath, I'm sendin niggas bulletholes
Innocent bystanders get hit tryin to be heroes
You know how we roll, everywhere that we go
It's fo-fo's, calicos, and desert eagles

Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
So when you hear somethin' make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
Our music keeps you movin' what are you provin'?
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Hug me baby, I'm a make you love me baby
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nothin' but choked
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And B.I.G. you know you too hard for these cats
I'm a win cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uh) you rakin' up plaques

In The Commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of Satan, they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin' I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin' your fam' destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matos, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Crystal keep spillin' shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me

Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The girl-boy killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two Midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Luc'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, with just Mase and 'em
Placin' them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P.Diddy

Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men

You got a phone
Pick it up
Call me

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine
We even been beefin' now
After all the years we been down
Ain't no way no how
This bullshit can't be true
We family
Ain't a damn thing changed
Unless its you

We were so young
So full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succumb to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5'ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold, your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more

On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I would of killed a nigga first
'Fore  I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her
Stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas must of hurt your pride or something
'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your mans, lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player
The one that's changing is you

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more

Unless its you

It's gettin' lonely at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speakin' all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping
And poof it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance
Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intelligence
That's forever 'til the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(How come) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(And how come) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

How come, we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine

D12,"I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my God it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock""
""Please Marshall please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code

Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)

But PROOF is just actin out the party was stoned
Shady made it so my baby's ain't starvin' at home

See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends
Whenever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
And wastin' my times with these snakes in disguise

(How come) when you talk its with bitter is fight
And (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life
And everytime I go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.

D12,"Uh yo yo yo yo

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (AHH!)
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
I said come on, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (me!)
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb-ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out
Come on!

Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Heh, hey Von you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin' stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (EWW!)
Yeah I think I did too much, this substance equals cups
Red pills, blue pills, and green, big pills (that's ill), mescaline!

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, somethin', some'un, some'un, some'un

Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm, old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a (you're crazy!)

I pop fo' E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Yeah, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggaz think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
And if you like smack (uh-huh) then I might too
(Swift, chill) I just wanna get high like you! (ewww)
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (uh-huh)
Speed, 'shrooms, down the valiums (uh-huh)
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

I'm at rave lookin' like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope-headed guy
Heroin mescaline, pencilnecks, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin' ill
Drugs kill (yeah right) bitch, I'm for real!!!
Shut your mouth you dirty slut, you know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt, let Bizarre nut!

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

D12,"Balls, Balls, Balls
Balls, Balls, Balls
You'll never touch my

Catch me if you can but you ain't man enough
You're standin' tough
But you know that no matter what
You'll never get the chance to touch
My Balls, Balls, Balls
Balls, Balls, Balls
You'll never touch my balls

I see you ain't a playa, you ain't ballin'
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talkin'
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is ""get your man up off him""
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talkin'
And I ain't gotta prove you nothin'
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons

This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doin' this for years, my team can't lose
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me hard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this 'fore you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm foldin'
Damn it, call holton

[Chorus]

Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut hurry up
And reach up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus yikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disreguard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?
On 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball (ball)
To the sideline to Von, he steps outta bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god damn high, that he's trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put (blabbing)
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'ma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughin' now, no timeouts and its now fourth down
We're never gonna make it, wait I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'ma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you wit no pants on
Ass out with a floppin' schlong, touch down yeah I told ya
It's the longest yard

[Chorus]

The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball (balls)
I'ma run through all of ya'll, ya'll just soft
Even though my cleats is kickin' up mud
It's more tragic for me, I'm stiff armin' punks
High steppin' through the end zone
I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playin' ball with killas, my team's gorillas
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best runnin' backs there never was
Movin' like Barry Sanders, leavin' you in the dust

Yack is high, I got the highest yack
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snaps like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eyin' my eye, the back tryin to sack us
No matter how big they flyin' backwards
Wide receiver, recievin' wide
For every stride in my life, I breathe and die

Defense is playin' a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excel
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flyin' through the air like a superhero
I can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinerio
For bein' the best player on my team what
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone
Then I do the ninety shuffle so

See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

[Nas]
Let's go! Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music 
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Super kids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

[Olu Dara]
Greatest man alive (Yeah, turn it up!)
Greatest man alive!

[Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and oh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""

[Olu Dara]
Greatest man? The great-greatest man alive

[Nas]
Hey, hey, hey, my Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to

[Olu Dara]
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge

Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop

Ha ha, 50 Cent

(Here we go again, yeah)
Uh huh, ha ha ha
Does it make you mad, when I switch my flow
You can't understand, how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire, 'cause Shady said so
(Here we go!) I'm on fire

Everybody's in a rush, to try and get the throne
I just get on the track, and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody, as a stepping stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off, just left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there, with record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble, and respect myself
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean and stay away from, weapons, jail
And living reckless, but if you gon' check my belt
You may see something else, I use to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Ruger, and deflect its shells
And send 'em back at you, faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops, that'll legally pop you
And I den seen a lotta people, cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja, must have lost his mind
That ex, got him thinking he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you, X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Just keep singing the same song, recycled
We all much rather get along, than fight you
Me and Halie dance to ya songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
Come on now, you know the white boy will bite you
I hurt ya pride dog, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, wit syllable after
Syllable I'll just slap ya, killin' you faster
Then you popin' pill after, little pill of them tabs of
That shit you're on, but if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns, we could charge harder than Busta
We bump heads, wit any motherfucka' that wants ta
So what's the, deal, what's with all the tough talk
When I walked up to you, like ""Ja, what up dog?""
How come you didn't say, you had a problem then
When you were standing there with all ya men
We could have solved it then, I'm a grown man dog, come holla
All you did was laugh then, smile and swallow
Another one of those little ex pills, in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything, that you wanna be, come on

[Chorus: x2]
I, know, you don't want it wit me
You, know, you don't want it wit me
You, talk, but soon we goin' see
You, don't wanna bump heads with me

(Tony Yayo!) You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja you Stuard Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week, I'm buying a new pistol
I clap at yo ass, wit this chrome .38
And put six through ya hats, that's seven and 3-8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe, you bleed on the turnpike
You know and I know, who took ya chain
You got robbed two times, so ya ass a lame

Like I won't find ya whereabouts, by stomp-ing 'em out ya man
You killing New York, even in Comp-ton, they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate up out the van, and
They see me pop up on icy, cause I could
You den lost yo money, prolly forgot yo way around the hood (hood)
Cause when you paranoid, it's hard to make good songs
How you want it wit' us, when half your artists got makeup on
Every magazine I open, you on ya knees, taking prayer pictures
And you ain't even get shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothing about what pain is sucka
I put yo ass to the ground, like a train conductor, motherfucker

There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody

Fact that I can't get by with my nine to

Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot

I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my God it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock""
""Please Marshall please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey dude I love your band)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code

Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy)
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

These chicks don't even know the name of my band(ha ha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands(Fuck Marshall)
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man

Shooting the gym? I ain’t ballin' ho
What I look like, Iguodala you know? (Bane)
Yup, shots fired, callin' it kettle
Black shit turned the pot higher, eyes tired
Keep trying to sell me a smile, but I’m a hard buyer
Keep shit movin' like a car tire

If you threw the planet at me I’d headbutt it and crack it
On another tax bracket and I been cleanin' my house
But my old habits are in the attic, I’ll pull 'em out
And keep reminding y'all you ain’t got it all
Devil keep pulling me by the drawers
Not at all amazed at these haters, you’ve seen my catalog
Speaking and we keep flying over 'em like a cannonball
Think I’m this comical, swag follower just rhyming over beats
While these leakers suckin' all of us off (hell no)
Still got your mama covered in vomit in my cellphone
Y'all really got me fucked up
What you mixin' up in that cup?
What the hell you sprinkle in that blunt?
.44, make him sober up

I got an addiction to all these prescriptions
Need an intervention, someone to listen
Catholic or Christian, fuck your suspicions
(Bitch! Gimme my molly and stop bitchin'!)
Turn it up (turn it down)
I be blowing on half a pound
Pass it around and pass it around
Merry go-round, merry go-round
She say she love me, but this bitch is ugly

They say the devil is a liar
Nigga don't worry 'bout that loud mouth
Bumping his gums and babbling
Watch for them quiet niggas
On the real, you should come ride with us
Crew full of riders Optimus
My bad cause it seems like you got your facts all crossed up, no Swastikas
Fadin' in and out of my consciousness
Tryna fight this feeling I’m conjurin'
That's why I wear a hat so low with a mask
Really feelin' like the Loch Ness
No bullshit, these bitches are more grimy
Doing a nigga real slimey
Had my little homie stretched out, death untimely
Need not remind me, hold up
Yo, don’t get doped up
Heard rumors that niggas wanna clap at me
Well actually, I was just over there
Niggas ain’t really do jack to me
That’s why I keep this mask on, straight face
Only thing that’s missing is my sherlon, get my Runyon Ave on

And my mind and my heart and my soul

Check out now Mook-be, y'all know me grabbed tha mike since '93
Hatin' ass niggas wouldn't let me eat but I kept it real
Stayed true to tha streets, stayed down, sucked up tha frown
'cause I knew tha game was gonna bounce back around

Still in it till tha mothafuckin' finish, you can best believe
I'm gonna get me a ticket, the game owe me
Speak money, paid dues to be a five star G
Worked hard didn't get shit free

Made a lot of bitch niggaz in tha industry
Suckas weren't hearin' or feelin' me
I ain't rappin' on tha mothafuckin' booty shit beat
Now I got a hit bitch gimmie off E, hey, hey

Here we go, hit me now
Most of these boys be like hangin' around, [Incomprehensible]
Plotin' and planin', thievin' my trays for all my maynes
Used to be my gat man, my errand boy, my neophyte
After I see E be O triple X drop and heat all night

We made a pact when I was grindin', you was broke man
I'm sellin' weight and gettin' money in tha fat lane
We can pop that gat, we can pop that steel
We can pull that twelve front gauge

When you had blond hair hoops it is and actin' bitch made
My track got hot, my weight was up, bottom matchin' at clay court
Five deep, I'm getting no sleep and constantly mashin' on tha hoes
It's D4L, mack a therma real feel pimpin'

Red snapper fillet mignon and eatin' barbecue shrimpin'
Limos in tha drive way sittin' from tha night befo'
Meter runnin', it don't matter 'cause in getting mo' and mo'

The game been good to me, the game still owin' me, hear me now
I shed so much blood, so much sweat, so much tear
Tha game been good

The game owe me, game owe me

Get on one knee and raise yo hand

Wanna ride good, wanna look good too

D:A:D,"Ay, we just supported Nas
Whose world is this? Bruv, of course it's ours
Saying I ain't been the same since I caught the scars
They don't fade, I ain't ashamed
Watch us fall from Mars
Cos it's the fallen parts and all the dust settles
And we all call on ours fast as we pluck petals
We let the love pour into our brain
Another day doing more to maintain
Saying finally those tears in my mother's eyes
Tears from the other side
Tears of joy, her little boy's got his mother's pride
You don't know nothing 'bout the rain 'til you come inside
And watch it trickle past the pane as the summer rise
'Cause ain't no love inside
My heart
Except for my mother and my diehards
I stay firm
Little brother keeps my mind sharp
If I lost yours come and find ours

I've got pleasures
Becoming pressures
They make me want to drift away
They make me want to drift away

I wasn't running from the beast, I was running from myself
Running out of street, she was worried 'bout my health
Wasn't worried it was beef
Wasn't worried it was girls
She was worried it was me and my mother couldn't tell
Something bigger than the world
For me and Ryan
Now he could see that I've been crying
Tell a little lie and say there's something in my eye
And from the second he could see that I've been lying
He would think I wasn't trying
Telling him, look honestly I'm dying
To be the bigger man, the one that you're relying on
I keep it strong
So I tell another lie 'cause it's the only way to keep me from denying
So I tell him brother listen
Listen, when the sun don't glisten
All the days turn grey and the love goes missing
Hate won't fade and the front row hissing
You're the only one that keeps my heart wishing

I've got pleasures

Cos I'm the son of Jean

They make me want to drift away

But she said that it ain't me without ADHD
88 keys I was turning 18
She would stay and say please with a face that say cheese
Always try to make peace like a plate of baked beans
That was me and my bean
That was me and my Jean
That was me and my Jean

He was a scribble of boy
All hair and mischief
A two-foot tale of trouble
The bee's knees
A cartwheeling chatterbox of tricks
Completely fearless
I had to carry a first aid kit
My band-aid boy
I had my heart in my mouth wherever we went
He'd do backflips into the pool when he was tiny
And the lifeguards would get all stressed out
He was a proper Mowgli
He embraced everything
Took things apart to see what made them tick
Such busy fingers
He would empty sugar packets onto the tables at restaurants to draw pictures in
He used to draw on anything
Fantastical creatures with ferocious fangs
And now he draws with words and I find lyrics on my till receipts and bills
He was never still and barely slept so neither did I
I could never understand how he could watch TV upside down while kicking a ball
His eyes shone with wonder
Music flowed through him like a current
He'd upend a stool to use as a microphone
Singing away for his grandparents
He turned the world upside down and we're richer for it
He was and is a compete joy
The world is his
That scribble of a boy",Sun of Jean,
D:A:D,"On the first part of the journey 
I was looking at all the life 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There were sand and hills and rain 
The first thing I met was a fly with no buzz 
And a sky with no clouds 
The heat was hot and the ground was dry 
But the air was full of sound 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name 
It felt good to be out of the rain 
In the desert you can't remember your name 
Cause there ain't no one to a give you no pain 

After two days in the desert sun 
My skin began to turn red 
After three days in the desert fun 
I was looking at a river bed 
And the story it told 
Of a river that floated 
Made me sad to think it was dead 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
After nine days I let the horse run free 
Cause the desert had turned to sea 
There were plants and birds and rocks and things 
There were sand and hills and things 
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground 
And the perfectest sky is above 
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground 
But the humans will give no love 

You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name",A Horse with No Name,1987

Gravity... is all around 

Gravity... make we all get down, check it... 

Gravity is all around 

gravity get up, gravity get down 

Some heads want to escape but don't try

Just when you thought you strayed far away 

here comes gravity to save the day

Da,"Is there a world beyond these white walls?
Is there a life out there for me?
Will there ever be another sunrise
Other than the one inside my dreams?

[Chorus]
Can you hold on to me tightly?
Will you ever let me go?
There are just so many things
That I need to know
Can you hold on to me tightly?
Will you ever let me fall?
Sometimes I just wish that I was
Not like me at all

I haven't seen something different
Beyond this cage I call reality
Raindrops on my fingers, snowflakes on my tongue
Seem like something never meant for me

So take these walls and tear them down
Feel the sunlight shining all around
Take this body, make it whole again
Make this the beginning, not the end

[Chorus]

The world outside my window calls
Far away like some forgotten friend
I'll no longer have to close my eyes
And live a life that's only make-pretend

So take these walls and tear them down
Feel the sunlight shining all around
Take this body, make it whole again
Make this the beginning, not the end",Wish,2008
Da a Clan,"There`s someone in love with you, you know
Just don`t want to let that feeling show
Because they`re not sure that you could ever feel the same
But now he would like to take a chance
In hopes that you both will find romance
In case you are willing
There`s something I`d like you to know

Girl, if ever you call me
I`m there for you girl, right or wrong
I`m telling you now girl
If ever you need me
I promise you I`ll give you my all

Someone who will love and sacrifice
Who knows what it means to treat you right
Someone who won`t change his mind
But always feels the same
He wants you to open up your heart
In hopes that true love might one day start
Girl if you are willing
There`s something I`d like you to know

Darling here`s my heart
Please take care my darling dear
'cause I, I do, love you, it`s true
And I hope that you are willing girl to love me in return
And if you are
I want you to know",If Ever,1997

I'm comin down with the key to Decatur
East Atlanta slash writer
Heavy grinda for paper
City slicker heavy weight in the game
Froze wish they ear lobes heavy weight in my chain
Hittin the game where you niggaz be slackin'
Got the dro for the lo that what my niggaz be sackin'
My shell toes peddle chevys and boles
White leathers on the cutlass with mahogany flos
I'm riding through oakhurst coated like starburst
Candy paint glisten lookin greasy like bratwurst
The dude on my jersey is greatly deceased
You rested in peace for snitchin to Decatur police
Servin niggaz with a ghetto subpoena
Got that A-Town stompin' back in Phillips Arena
I'm passin hoes like collection plates
And keep a broad on my squad who on section 8 (Oh!)

[Sho'Nuff]
Yeah, ok, yeah, ok
They gon love me after this one
To all my trap niggaz and dro smokers
Keep the strippers stay focus
Pussy poppin and rollin
'cause all I wear is hats wit A's
Shoppin at malls
White tees, Cartiers
Jeans creased up straight out the cleaners
Plus my George Jefferson strut and my southern demeanor
When they see me when I speak my slang
Everybody wanna know my name (Sho 'nuff)
I was born in Atlanta, raised in Decatur
Where we pushin' LeSabres and blow like inhalers
Say he kinda skinny wit a full size jimmy
Ay man I got broads in different cities
Like gimme gimme
They used to treat me like Urkel the nerd
Now they flock when the see my LeBrons on the curb
See my upholstery it got women approachin me
Some look like they too old for me
TVs hangin' appropriately

[Milwaukee Black]
Its major way baby, see I told you was gon luv me

When you see me in the 6 tre drop
And I tell you that the price of the worth just dropped
I let the thing go pop
I caught buddy round there snitchin off to the cops
And the game don't stop (don't stop)
You tried to see my dough
You better see this 4 (get it)
I'm 31 and my rappin is done
I gotta million dollar company to run (bitch)

[Sho'Nuff]
'cause I smoke like you
A min and some blu
I find 'em lick 'em, split 'em, roll 'em just like you (yep!)
In XXL murder dawg ya Source,
I'm vice I'm rollin stones and lay be the wisest homie

[Big Marc]
I'm grand hustlin disturbin the peace
I'm so def puttin organized noise in the street
I'm smokin earth tones chong and cheech
You beat you meat at home
While I bone your freak (oh!)

Oh! I told ya, you gon love me!

Having the key of the bottomless pit
And a great chain in his hand
I laid whole on the dragon, That old serpent
Which is the Devil, and Satan, and ??? a thousand years

I'm the soldier type, keep grip on steel like Conan
Money bulgin' out my pockets, I peel with both hands
Inter-national dopeman, known as a D-Boy
If ya need me nigga, know you can call on the decoy
Me, All I do is move blow off tha corner
Paper chasin', cause I'm tryin to stack doe like colma, (Watch me)
I'm tryin' to keep my head on tight
Baller blockers make a nigga want to ride at night
Block watchers callin' coppers so my mind ain't right
The Devil with me but the young boy acknowledge Christ
I did a lot of ridin' in my time, and God blessed me still
I look out for tha one the knocks

[Chorus: Fredrick & Sarah]
So why the Devil keep on fuckin' with me, why
Why he knockin' at my door, my door
Why the Devil keep on fuckin' with me
Can you tell me why he huntin' me for
Tell me what he huntin' me for, tell me
Could you tell me
Could you tell me what he huntin' me for
Tell me what he huntin' me for
Could you tell me, tell me
Could you tell me what he huntin' me for

You thinkin' lifes a joke, I'll slice your throat
Oh you a thug, you about to get yo' rights revoked
I'm from the Dirty, we don't even know the price of soap
I'm a star, look in the sky, you need a microscope
I'm way ahead of the game, thuggin' runs in my veins
My pockets chubby, so I went and got a gun in my name
Its just me, him and my blunt in the Range
A young nigga with the filty slang
Ha ha, I hop out like a Jack In The Box
With three macks and a glock
I'm askin' for nothin', I'm snatchin' my props
I'm gettin' money while I'm laughin' at cops
It ain't ya lad, I ain't bad
It's the Devil, why don't you tell'em to stop

I'm from the dirty, but I stay so fresh, so clean
With all these throwbacks, you think I got a time machine

Alicia ain't, got, nothin' on me, I'm so shady
Tha benz is amazing, tha color is all gravy
Please believe, my squad be them DBE's
We ridin' in them drop tops, wit them DVD's
Spreewells on them alloys, daddy I'm so jiggy
I flow so sickly, I roll with P. Diddy

Always on point ain't no nigga gone put no steel to me
Feelin' me, every move I make

So what's the deal boy?
I got a little time, I really want a piece of you

[Dylan]
You know the deal girl
I'm down for whenever, whatever you want to do

[Verse 1]

[Babs]
Hot damn boy, what's the plan?
I got a whole day free, I done ducked my man
Wassup?  Got the truck rimmed up last weekend
The haze that I blow got my interior stinking
Yeah, so what's the deal boy?
I'm trying to chill with you, I like your style
Baby don't get it twisted, I don't want your child
And I don't make prank calls, you can press redial

[Chopper]
I guess you like my southern drawl
I stay down no matter the cause
My attitude's like fuck em all, feel me?
I'm on my game, I ain't got no flaws
I'm so jealous, so don't make me have to touch nobody
Or cut nobody, you like it when I tell you shit like that
And when I'm on my ass, I flip right back, like that
Real nigga that I am, so if you need me you can call on Slim
Fuckin' right girl

[Sara]
Baby how ya doing?
Off the scene for a minute, but right back into it
Tell me can you feel it?
All the looks that you giving me

Just to be alone and get next to you
I like your style, beautiful smile, you're kind of wild

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[Ness]
She pretty in pink, damn what they put in my drink?
It's either I'm color blind or too pissy to think
Straight, take it slow, wait for a minute, uh
Chill, fall back, we can date for a minute, uh
I'm renting out with an option to buy
She blow weed so her nosebleed top of the sky
Female with an attitude as cocky as mine
When I ride, she right there in the passenger side

[Fred]
Well this week I made plans that were set in advance
Lobster and shrimp in  Sevilla, then we jettin' to France
Under the stars, sippin' Cristy, laid back in the sand
Tellin' me ways how you act when you were back with your fam
How your mother was smoking crack and your father was dead
See that's the type of stuff that get in my head
And you're very emotional, you make a real thug want to get close to you
With the permission you give, your lotion, let's get ghost girl

[Sara]
Baby how ya doing?
Off the scene for a minute, but right back into it
Tell me can you feel it?

Yo, Blaze the fire and watch the enemies crumble

See the blood of a slave
The eyes of a Banta
Rise from the grave
When they listening to Dylan
Action and ways speak clearly like a veteran
Looking both ways
When concealing my weapon

(Babs)
I was raised in the gutter
Fifties for elevens
And a dirty box cutter
I'm standing my ground
Back and forth out of town
I'm getting that cash
And niggaz can't see Babs
If you ain't licking my ass
One tough chick
My flows is not to be fucked with
Send the word out
To them bitches that you run with
I'm here now
Bitches in trouble I spit fire
Quick to bust off
Like Weebay from the wire

(Ness)
Fucking with the grimiest nigga
Look in my eyes
My life was paralelled park
Until I put it in drive
D.U.I. smacked and broke both of my headlights
Chicks gunning me down
Running mad redlights
Had low mileage
It was either hugging the block or Hip Hop
I never will in college
I'm only being honest
Cadillac with the Mac
With the serial stratched up in the lining

(Fred)
Now pass me some diamonds
With some dudes who move
When I say them good
So the hood call me Simon
When I rob I ain't rhyming
I change climates
And break more records
Than Rice did for the Niners

Chorus: (Dylan)
Them silly one now (hey)
All gangstas get them bless (hey!!!!)
To be wake
To be among so many Living Legends
Nobody stop me
Don't ask me why
This a real tall guy saying Budda Bye Bye Bye

Them silly one now (hey)
All gangstas get them bless (hey!!!!)
To be wake
To be among so many Living Legends
Nobody stop me
Don't ask me why
I'm a real bad boy saying Budda Bye Bye Bye

(Chopper)
Man fuck them other niggaz
Cause I'm down with my niggaz
Yep, we Da Band
y'all niggaz ain't fucking with us
Don't make me have to spend that bend and do a pull up
Reach for that 10 that have you duckin' them bullets
Hit you where it hurt it be hard for you to push up
Half-way crook ass niggaz I got you shook up
You walk with your head faced down
You scared to look up
And I know Black and Blue
I got the hook up

(Babs)
I stay on my grind BK niggaz know
In your face everyday like a Bad Boy video
On the block for a couple of years
I done smoked a lot of blunts
Drunk a couple of beers
The streets know me
The hood hold me
I paid dues
I'm the chick in the click
Full of niggaz, I made moves
Stay on top of my game
I can't lose
Get down or lay down
Bitch niggaz better choose

(Chopper)
I ride in the biggest trucks
All day, call me, shit
I supply the biggest stuff
Hit the block
Like I'm Cartel blunts
Ready for something to dump
I feel as though I got the biggest nuts

(Ness)
Wait, move
I put blood in your socks, your shoes
Overflowing now you shaking your leg
Man I run with the gauge like bacon with eggs
It's white, when I bite
When I bake it, it's beige

Life is what you make it

[VERSE 1] {Ness}
Hit the bricks chicks like, 'Damn where you been Lloyd''
Locked up with a bad case of hemorrhoids
Writin' and fightin' triflin' rhymes about the
Life and the times of niggaz on the grind
White collar criminals climb the corporate ladder
While niggaz like me gotta sell coke and crack
It's riskin' my freedom, boxed up missin' the season
It's a setup'hypothetically speakin'
Even my pop was knocked over tickets for speedin'
Drinkin' and drivin' and I ain't forget, he think I forgot 'em
Mom got gray hairs from worryin' sick
And my sister got a house now, pushin' a stick
Just a little somethin' to get 'em from A to be	
I got nowhere to go come and stay wit me
Wit a niece and a nephew that love me to death
My little brother Nick, I guess he lovin' what's left

[VERSE 2] {Freddrick}
I remember one mornin' I was cookin' the O
And out the blue I heard a knock at the do'
I looked through the peephole and it's a fiend and he needed some coke
And at the time I really needed his dough, but I know the rules
You never sell crack where ya rest at
'cause haters send shells where ya chest at
But in my case them muthafuckas sent shells where my vest at
Found out I ain't dead, give them a place to rest at
I found out 'bout they spot, had to go and X that
My eyes redder than Cyclops, call me the X-Man
I thank God just for every blessin'
Though the roads got tough thanks for every lesson
I carry loads at times even though it gets stressin'
I remember stickin' the clip in, cockin' and second guessin'
I couldn't stand the rain I'm the 'New Edition'
The fast lane had me layin' in the coop wit pigeons in my life

[CHORUS] (Sara)

Goin' through some bad times
But be thankful for the good times, yeah (In my life)

[VERSE 3] {Babs} (Sara)
Hotheads and high school dropouts
Little girls wit they stomachs popped out, I seen it all
Niggaz stretched out by the corner store
Life no more, dough seem small--I'm gettin' focused
In the crib writin' rhymes while I'm smokin'
While niggaz on the block totin' I see 'em later
My moms make paper but cheap wit her cash
Ask for a pair of kicks she tell me ask my dad (Ask ya dad)
So I'd rather hit the Ave and knock off work
The 100 pack in the pocket of my Guess Jeans skirt
Meanwhile still tryna get a deal on the side
Battle bitches outside in front of Kennedy Drive
A lotta niggaz want to see me shine
But I still got the lames laggin' behind, hatin' on mine'it's nothin'
I'ma get to the top regardless
Got love for female rappers but think I'm the hardest
In my life

Drop a little paper, baby toss it up

And personally your raps is where the trouble at

Used to see hard times but now I see booty

Me beatin yo' ass in a mink and hat
Bounce off from the scene in a Lincoln Nav
So motherfuckin' plush you just sink in the back

And I told you heffers before, never before
Will you see a beatmaker ever this raw?
See me in the streets stunning in a yellow Valor

If you can figure that black, you will be
Overcome with a mild case of lunacy

The buds recruit, while all the guards, crackers was true
Good health and wealth, for cheddar cheese as green as dough melt
Some cried some died from the pain that's felt
Why fight? Why fuss? That's what the want from us
But if it's love that's lost, then there's no more trust
With that fake love, that cause to get your brain straight plugged

Yo, I remember when the summer was hot, I'm huggin' my block
The soldier, tryin' to get over with this hustle I got
Lookin' out for the cops, on my way to the top
Ain't no reason to even question if I'm rugged or not

See they out gettin' theirs, so now we tryin' to get ours
Through a neighborhood tours, goin' through neighborhood wars
Gettin' bigger doors, mixin' this neighborhood sport

Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

Amidst the dangerous days, and the dangerous nights
The lost wages and the salary heights
I stayed out of harms way, helped my family to fight
When I slipped into darkness, they brought me back to the light

Pray to the Lord above for added insight
A man confronted with these challenges in his life
To the ladies I might, be the compassionate type
Come see if it's real and feel what my action is like

Right, the man of your dreams, I'm handlin' fiends
Fabulous things, more than mansions and rings
A palace built for a king, is how rich'll be
You tryin' to win, get a piece of this victory

And don't ask about my past, that's history
Don't be afraid of the hustle girl, just get with me
You gotta love supreme, but as good as it seems
I'm in love with the cream, this is the hustler's theme, knah'mean?

Someone, somewhere, someway, somehow
Get mines, get yours, get up, get down
Sometime, someday, someplace, some town
It's starts, with us, right here, right now

Can you stay alive in this strugglin' thing?
Stay alive in this hustlin' thing?
The hustle's only as good, as what the customers bring
Some are no longer with us, others locked up in the bing

See I found a knew trade that I hustle with
It's called hip-hop and I got a love for it
Far from easy believe me y'all, I must admit
'cause y'all customers'll never get enough of this

Crash and when the cops come, you'll find me hurlin' the fifth

My fist could knock holes though nigga
Wittier shit, gritty as hell, pretty as fuck
Dirty as motherfuckers who actually fuck they mother's what
If you don't like it,  then don't listen, but don't talk

Soon as I drop some thunder shit, greedy niggas want more
Run the play-by-play, tackle cats like a fullback
It's a dangerous game, come strong or get your skull cracked
Blahti raise the thermostat, collapse, robber formats
Dodge traps like the clap, do it for all ghetto blacks
Stand firm like I'm cemented, Jean Grae my comrad
Enter the Dragon, we demented, sick, and highly complemented
Slick witted, star figures, acid-laced hallucigenics
We fire-spittin' bitches, disregard the bullshittings

Bottomed-out, permanent south, some bitter cats, so fuck why'all
We hot on wax, we hot on stage
My tongue's a twelve gauge, lips,  uzis, spray the page
why'all some click-n-drag niggas,  chatroom with fag niggas
Backpack and bag niggas,  play body and tag niggas
We raps best when we step in the ring
Get knocked 'fore the first bell, hell with the clock
We dirty be-atch (We drunk)
Apani tree'd up, chillin and speed Jean up

My shit is sicker latte
Backing out on niggas up at Jimmy's Cafe
Puerto Rican mamis lookin' like Sole
Take 'em to the crib then I fuck 'em that day (true)
Kick them bitches out, you know my gun play (play)
I'm gansgta, livin' street life everyday (day)
Just like Scarface, I still punk the J's
I gotta get mine, that's the America way, now

[Baby Sham]
Jump out the whip, I'm not the type of nigga that trip
Somethin' sick from the nozzle, wanted large when it spit
Hittin' you up, lettin' you bleed in the seat of your truck
And flee the scene when the smoke clear, quiet as fuck
Startin' to lose it, for me that is realer than music
Hold ya plaque up to ya chest and blow right through it
Eight bars on some next shit, probably don't fit
But that don't mean for me to keep quiet and zip up my lips

I told you once I'm grippin' the auto
I tap your jawbone, take your broad home, in a Volvo
 
It's good I can rap, so you don't catch bullets in your back
And for most that can't see me, I put my foot in they ass
Word, if I catch your ass sleepin' get clapped
Like some applause, I can't afford weak links
I'm too strong, niggas are meek

Love for my disciples, love for my lords
Pitchforks and five stars, street soldiers for sure
Got love for Latin kings, and love for Mexico !
S.A.'s and L.K.'s joint, coast to coast
Love the everyday hustling, bustling, muscling but what
When we war, we stay struggling

[Treach]
I got a plan, a pound, a payment; let's roll
I'm seeing red, the blue, the brown, black, and gold
Time to stand as one and snatch back the soul
Gangsters, we all can jack back control
Got the bitches coming with the booty and bubbly
Time to discuss streets 'cause shit got ugly
I thought they all facing enemy to enemy
Cause ain't a motherfucking thing here industry
Who in here banging over money, or a bitch that you ain't sure to get
Or soon as you get it, split it
Over a block that's hot, or a chain that he got
The nigga he popped, or over the dimes that HE dropped
Either way we got a bil' a day
Cause nowadays it's kids that spray, they feel that way
And if we chill and wait, and don't delibirate
You see they feel that way, and then they kill that way

[Chorus]

[Vinnie]
I love my niggas to the death of me
I think it's my motherfucking destiny
My homies bringing out the best in me
Shout to my people out on the streets who don't be stressing me
See what you fake niggas can't feel
Is that the real recognize real
 
Niggas who rob and steal,
could give a fuck about image and sex appeal
So when they see you on the streets (Nigga you know the deal)
hey yo these so-called gangsters, as so-called hard
I seen 'em rolling with a million man entourage
But then they still get touched on by the law
That makes me think, what the fuck they even hired 'em for
You see we all in the same gang
Because we've all hit the same thang
But now it's time niggas game changed
And while he's sleeping calling us 'lost souls'
We send a million O.G.'s straight to the pole

As our people with a purpose, see the shit surface
They get us, 'cause the feds is the nigga you do the dirt with
Sick of pleading 'Your Honor' fuck you, contempt on getting calmer
Sick of these warrants, and drinking and driving drama
Time to, get connected, and stop making them records
Bout slanging and banging, but they can't hold it when it get hectic
A lot of niggas live soft and act hard
A lot of rappers be claiming they be gangsters but trackstars
A lot of cops kick ass, for quick cash, and fast cars
The bottom of the beaten niggas with the last scars
I'ma do Diallo, I feel dog he was hollow
If we don't fight today, it's nothing to fight for tomorrow

Hypnotized by a motherfucker puttin it down
It's Da Brat watch your back when I'm in your town
Cause I gotta be funky I gotta be me

A woman of my clad
Commin up with the motherfucking funk so I know my track

Nothin but the funk bumpin up in your ear

So locced out that it's just so s-o crazy

Getting filled on full with that shit from the ghetto

And that's how I get ya
And when you bumpin up my shit nigga take the funk wit 'cha

Fall into the groove of the waxin

Ohh allll my love baby... 

Hey nigga ain't shit gonna ever change 
Between you and your boo. 
Put a hold on me ever since I held you 
What compelled you to be my nigga 
Besides passion and love 
You ran up on a real bitch with understanding and trust 
Fuck the others, none of them compare to us 
And under covers you my muthafucka nigga, 
When you stickin my stuff 
You laid pipe unlike any other plumber 
Took me shoppin all day and at night, you kept me cummin. 
Made dinner, collard greens, candied yams and steak. 
Taught me how to measure grams, cook rocks, and chop weights 
Caught a case, cuz you're boy ran his mouth too much. 
And it's a disgrace how the pain felt to miss your touch 
But as the days keep passin, keep it actin with stacks of letters 
Hit you so you don't forget us 
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella 
Hella muthafuckas want your occupation 
But they can keep pacin, cuz I'm gonna be waitin on my Baby...

That you was soft, braggin he collecting your cheese, 
And pissing me the fuck off. 
The first thought of committing a felony never left 
I missed the big breaths you took when we waz puffin an L, 
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones I 
Saw better SL 500s colorful Gucci sweaters and leathers 
Diamond letters girl you broke, I saved the sugar for you 
Keep the business runnin, droppin off keys in Cancun 
Cash rules, and you remain to be the King of my throne 
Position taken, flippin calender pages till you get home 
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin up my happiness 
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation 
If I'm incarcerated 
Too you can make it through, we bail on the Jealous 
Who tell us the opposite of that, 
Forever you and Brat 
I tried to take the blame, but you prefered to handle my fame 
So i'm waitin with open arms to rekindle the flame...

Da Brat,"[Featuring Jermaine Dupri] 

Uh oh o  uh uh o  ah ah ah ah ah 

Uh oh o  uh uh o  ah ah ah ah ah 

Verse One: 

Bringing more noise than pg we true and flew in life 

Leave us JD and rock a party all night tight nigga 

One two three four five six seven 

I can rap like hell but make it sound like heaven well 

Seven six five four three two one 

JD what the deal is? Lemme get some 

How many occasions you and your liasons 

Can't fuck with this phenomenon,division,separated from the norm 

Pop a lot of Shawn Don and celebrate the good times 

So get your groove on, pulling on the in-and let's all get high 

In the back of my-Black on Black,you come through in ninety 

Bumpin' you remind me with the cops right behind me 

I got head rest, Genesis played by the Brat-Hey 

Bulletproof windows, for negroes, that want to act 

Don't want to face the fact, That that's the way we live 

Lookin' everyday Jig, Buyin' everything big-You dig? Nigga 

You don't want to' go the distance-Surrender-Consistence 

Allows me the key clock contender 

And enter a new millennium,Cracking mutherfuckers craniums 

Droppin Bombs-Saddam Hussein and nigga's straining 

Hit a little,I'm feeling tickles from the nickels I smoked 

The sweat trickle,as I slid a little liquor down my throat 

It ain't no hope for these nigga's who broke and acting big willy 

They dream to see a milly and talk shit before it happen really 

Spark up another philly and eyewitness 

The Brat fulfilling champagne and caviar wishes 

The lifestyle of the bitch is famous,Make the payment to chante 

embarrass nigga's live a hobby-All day harris 

Fly me to the moon,soon and very soon stay tuned 

Prepare to meet you doom 'cause it ain't no room for you 

Chorus 

No matter what they keep on saying and what they thinking 

We be keepin' in live,Keepin' it live-Its' like straight to the scene 

It's like that it's Da Brat just 

Keepin' it live,Keepin' it we make you say 

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh 

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,ah-ahh,ah-ah-ahh 

Verse Two: 

And if you're feeling for masquerade,I can rock a party today 

Breaking parlay as we stack cakes of cheddar 

Butter like parkay,wanted in four plates-sex 

So-so definitely the best,Better watch your step 

It's pooky,Trap with hits I make 'em clap to this 

You knew we was coming back to kick some asses kid 

It's nigga's like me that have more fun 

Pop mo' bottles than the next one 

Supermodel sex and make a portion 

Now catch me if you can like the gingerbread man 

Fifty grand in my hand sit-tin' on top of the world 

Half drunk,high as fuck,shitting hard,legs swinging 

Bringing the ruckus to all motherfuckers-woooo 

Hey yo,Brat you Da funk bandit 

Act like you know,the baddest sweet habit having mommy to hit the door 

Flash it a little,living riddles can't buy the vittles 

Get cash,Life don't only come once-to let it pass 

To all my nigga's rockin' big jewels,brand new shoes and new kicks 

Nigga's from the old school that started all this shit 

Big time weightholders,Dope clocking for years 

Nigga's you watched as a shorty thinking that's the way to live 

Giving all I got to give,us bitches is pushing sixes 

With ten thousand dollar bracelets around they wrist 

Legistics,is strictly riches,the other fishes in the sea 

Can't be malicious as me,fucking with G's 

Chorus 

No matter what they keep on saying and what they thinking 

We be keepin' in live,Keepin' it live-Its' like straight to the scene 

It's like that it's Da Brat just 

Keepin' it live,Keepin' it we make you say

Don't give a fuck.
I'm denied nothing, gotta still get it.
Spoiled rotten, real with it,

Spoiled rotten, real with it,
Deal with it.
Don't you feel me living in you?
When muthafuckas make promises and can't come through.
Whatever obstacles that detour me from getting my way,
I gets revenge to the end, then begin the foreplay.
My forte is sipping Alize, and acting up.
Looked into your mirror at your face you started backing up,
What the fuck?
You slowly step away and started panic,
As you witness anuthatantrum, fantastic, mantic, keeping niggas frantic.
Your manner don't want to be told shit.
If I can't get it you might feel my spirit off on another mission,
Fishing for my next victim with no permission.
Switching bodies, had to get some new Gotti's put on the Benz.
Jumped in the minds of many mens with no patience.
The worst thing to do is wait and waste time.
It's constantly sipping away taking.
Manipulating all ages, bring the frustration.
Waiting for the lift of my karat, to face in your location.

We jackin' these niggas for they beats and shit.
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Put this shit in ya mothafuckin' mouth...

Lock doors and hold their breath.
For the black on black beamer drivin'.
Shitin' on niggas time after time,
And on da west side is confinement.
It ain't no gettin' outta line with me, I stays ready.
Split a mothafuckas shit fo' free, if necessary.

The next destination is to be the greatest heavyweight, and undisputed.
Due to dem other bitches, to the back of the bus, with nothing much to it.
My millions my main concern, fucka factions and hurting feelings.
Its niggas that'll care just to kick it, 
With a real bitch gettin' real rich, quick.
Live it up to the fullest, notch set up the plot.
Life expect to see levels drop, its on again and it don't stop.
Anotha tantrum for crematin' mothafuckas in random.
Leavin' none standin', keep da big willies hold'em for grants.
The money it cost, to be boss, is high, my all time condition;

Shooting off at the mouth without chap or blistics

I'm hooked on phonics packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious with malice and mayhem straight out of a p-funk dictionary
Give me the mic and watch me slay
Them those lame and illiterate poeticistics pisses me off ?
Be missing me with that shit putting your petty torched packaged
Pathetically in front of me I suppress 
I'll rest of the best of MCs regularly

In the beginning I was bout it slid in and we write it

Drop a rock over your head as you leaving up the ledge

Ay, when I step inside your party, yo, I turn dat bitch out.
Let 'em know what I'm about, this is my fuckin' house.
The uncompatible, capital be eyes stay chinky.
From da green inhaled into my body,
All spot lookers kill ya search 'cause this block on lock,
And plus dem little bitches you got don't want no work.
Not even to come in contact with.
It's ritual to da death that we don't tolerate no wack shit, and that's it.
All da way crunk, half drunk off da remi. 
Makin' niggas jump, speakers pump is all dats in me.
Spittin' shit like a semi-auto, don't never stop getting cheese,
Is da motto you's follow drinking straight from da bottle.

Test me, and watch me make something happen.

Das right. Umhmm, Brat make it happen.
Well. Umhmm, I like that, well make it happen, hey.

Uh, she was the one to make it happen, when dat bitch went platinum.
Ain't nothing average about the magic between me and da mic, and da actin'.
When asking a question, who put it to the test, check the record?
Hit top, hottest rap and R and B single, July second,
In ninety-four, you flew the funk in, ninety-six back again.
Committed some mo' sinnin', fuckin' up most men and women.
The bad seed with mad weed, follow no fuckin' leader.
True believer in da factor, can't no motherfucka beat her.
Keep ya feet up, Brat bout to sweep up, niggas can leap up,
And creep up, still stay beneath her. 
'Cause she bust and what to death discuss they between us. 
Take precaution, prepare to bite da dust, and just take dat shit as a loss. 
Collect billboard and soul train awards from my trouble 
Crappin' you motherfuckas out and coming back for double.
Nice on da dice sippin' on Hen and ice, da time is right.
Seven eleven on the first go round with funkdafied, I made it happen, bitch.

Da Brat,"Some motherfuckers believe 
That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit  huh 
That I should cuss and shit  huh 
That I shouldn't do the shit I want to do 

You know what I'm sayin'? 
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think 
That's they beliefs  here go mine 
I gets embedded in your cerebellum  deeper than the ocean 

Focusin' on fuckin' a nigga up  who got jokes? 
Provoke me  my vision of lust is money  trust is funny 
Too many sheisty motherfuckers comin' for me 
One in the chamber, ready for repetition if possible 

Hate to mention this, poppin' that nigga, bitch 

It be the intellectual, get sexual in a second heffer 

You could never be no competition to me 

You bit the poison apple, tryin' adapt to this shit 

Show you how it happened 

While we laughin', diggin' your ditch 

And you can get your boys 

I got Disciples and ViceLords 

Planted through every city ready, declare war 

If you feel I stepped on your toes 

It was intentionally 

Cause it was meant to be the shit since I found JD 

My lyrical thesis broke in pieces 

For you pussies who can't feed off it 

Everything'll be fine, just hit the weed often 

Chorus: repeat 2X 

I believe good things come to those that grind 

Never take a step back, leave the past behind 

Keep your mind on some money and don't ever stop tryin' 

And everything'll be fine, everything'll be fine 

It's time to let your lighter spark 

Crank up the weed session 

With one of the best in the Midwestern section 

Flexin' with no shame 

Cause a mi solo female MC's be back in the game 

Sun up to sun down I puff leaves 

Filled with imported trees from the West Indies 

Chi-town's finest in more ways than one 

Me follow in the path of another, days is done 

See I got mic checkin' down to a science 

Meanin' I perfected the ways 

To shit on you and your alliance 

I write the type of shit that'll hypnotize ya 

Fuck around and kill your whole click like Kaiser 

In the streets of Prazza, the Westside of niggas 

Ain't expects, smellin' like cannibus 

Can't nothin' handle this 

They want to dismantle this but it will never go down 

Shit, cause my beliefs is I'm the baddest around, bitch 

Chorus 

Now it's the shit, you want to contest me 

Never will you be the opponent left 

Leave'em swept off they feet 

So So Def got that chief shit, keep it brief 

Under the covers ain't another bitch bad as me 

So I must keep comin' 

Keep on runnin' but you can't escape me 

I'm in your brain 

Remember the bitch you love to hate 

She on the paper chase 

In any case, but not any rate 

Keep the currency's increase, shit ain't cheap 

And my belief is to get the money, nigga 

So what's the beef to this? 

Enough cheese for Brat, never endin' G's 

Hundred thousand dollar bills by the stack 

The weak supportin' my habits 

Enough karats for the whole salad 

Smokin' cabbage every five minutes 

Beginnin' my days rollin' swishes 

I never listen to penny pinchin' 

Pussy eatin' punks advice 

To catch'em slippin' is my theory 

Be weary what I bust, make niggas weak 

And pack a bleeder, top notch in my speeches

Put your blunts in the air, y'all nigga get fried to this
To the ??? to mother, tell me who the thuggest in this motherfucker
What you niggas really wanna do? Big ballers flossin'
Niggas wanna beat so they got to be talkin'
Oh let me give them what they say and run 'em in they face
What they say? ""Oh nothin'""
Buster, hit'em in they shit anyway (hey)
That's how we play, stil thuggin' ain't a thing change
Still the same name, love the face
Real, real niggas, that's all I gotta say
You fuckin' with the real, you ball to get gusted
Really, the real ain't shit to be fucked wit'
Protected by the niner, when you careful
The nigga the trigger finger itchy fixin' to make you duck the whloe flock
Make a nigga close shop, sho nuff
Showstopper, fuckin' 'em up with diesel
What's pumpin' the shotgun?
Real neccesary cause all we want is a little respect
That's all we want but nigga, you don't feel me
Krazyie crazy, maybe insane hangin' with JD
Little rip done slip the clip into the gat, rat-tat-tat
Just like that

I ain't fixin' to be the bitch to procastinatin'
Niggas wanna be shippin' me half a cake
Go through whatever drastic measures I hafta take
Make a motherfucker masterbate, the hotter I get the more hate
Some of you hoes is overrated with flows
The salvate'll take'em to the rehab and get'em re-instated
My lyrical content send other bitches to convents
Pray for me to be deleted but that's nonsense
Been the bomb since '74 Aries
I can see how ya nigga be lookin' at me
He want to get in between the sheets
Leave the wallet and the keys for me
I ain't persuaded easily but if he spend the cheese for me
Nigga, we can fuck free frequently
You study me, but another me could never be sold
Broke the most 6-0-6-4-4
When niggas'll haul off and hit ya with the sawed off
Seen plenty motherfuckers fall off with they jaws off
When I'm finished droppin' 'em al off on the west side of Chi, I'm ridin' high
Thinkin' of way to make it through the major of the paper chase
Slidin' by, keep a luger in the chamber ready for danger when it's time to die

Nigga, don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some? 

Nigga, don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?

Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some? 

Nigga, don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some?
Don't you hate on me, why don't you go and get you some? 

See everywhere I go, I feel like niggas be tryin' to get me stuffed
I'm flyin' on out of what? Iced up and all the hoes wanna fuck
Knockin' bitches and that nigga got cake stacked up, packed up
Everything I touch, gold and platinum, what?
Niggas can't fuck with us
Like Busta Bust, we dangerous
And you know that if I peel I got mo'
Y'all peel, it's gone, that's why the ice grill on
When the wheel on by y'all niggas in the corner
Back and forth, like ""fuck that little guy""
Don't worry bout me, you need to worry bout yo' goddamn self
How you shit on shelf and how you sit around
Wishin' that a nigga would sign to So So Def
I'm a A-T-L-A-N-T-Alien
Never been known to play with
Can't none of y'all see me, so y'all niggas don't really need to say shit
With all your paper-hatin', paper-hatin' and your bad looks
What y'all need to do is shut up
And take heed to what my nigga sayin' in the hook

Taking the shit, making it mine
Big niggas in the game that'll let us find

It's a turn off if my cash bigger
Don't blame me, blame my last nigga
Mother fucker kept me laced from the feet up
Started off wit a pair of V studs

Still ended up wit the SE what
Windows down, seats back

Ain't to many mother fuckers bad as me
Bust at a nigga wit' a rhyme
Or a nine wit' a tragedy

When it cause catastrophes, will actually 'cause you to bleed
Fuck up anything you breathe, pass the weed
If a nigga proceed to step outta line, I'm a gradually
Fill his anatomy wit' bullet holes in his behind

I happen to be the type of bitch
Get a grudge I don't budge and shit
And look at what I did in life as a kid
Wit' thugs and pents

Now I got the knowledge of a college mother fucker
Wit' a scholarship
At any degree my temperature get, boiling hot to freezing
When I release, you can see the reason, I'm so cold

Niggas continuously rolling me beats to choke on
Tryna get a smoke on
High, 'cause I have to get it
When you can never see me coming the Devil's Advocate

Material hoe, keeping niggas dropping they draws
And fiending for more
Surrounded wit', diamonds around the wrist
Cruise the town in my six, bruising them every time I hit

And I ain't tryna quit
If I do, you can never find another to fill my shoes
I prove you can't duplicate this
Attempt to and lose

This little nigga been rocking the basement since I was about two
Pick up the pace quick, why worry about a replacement?
When I stepped in came wit' my feet in the pavement
Leave niggas in amazement

And guess what the ingravement say?
Capital be are A T was here and got paid all year
In a major way, fuck what the haters, fuck the tabloids
I spit on niggas, who try to steal my joy

Night time pissy drunk off the Henny Rimmy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind
It felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
Used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep,I took the keys to the jeep
Tell him ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanel's, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' tha mike
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
the motherfucker never ate my pussy

[Chorus:
I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue you
Had a weedspot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't cap
I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he want to get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four stroke creep
I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin.""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double plat
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones
I give you ten G's nigga if you leave me alone, screamin'

The moral of the story is this
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

Da Brat,"How could you lie to me
After all we've been through
It's just so sad to see me in love with you
I gave you all of me
But still it wasn't enough for you
Is this how love supposed to be
Now I'm trying to get over you

You ain't missin' me
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't love me
Like you used to
Tell me what is going on
You got me standing here alone
You don't know me
Like you used to

Remember what you said
When you stepped up on the scene
You got into my head
Had me stressin' like a feen
No I just can't forget
How you put that thing on me
I wish we never me
This way I won't be lonely

You ain't missin' me at all
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't love me
Like you used to
Tell me what is going on
You got me standin' here alone
You don't know me
Like you used to

You don't know me
Know me like you used to
You don't know me

You ain't missin' me at all
You won't pick up the phone and call

The car note, the porsche, and the condo
We still smokin'
Dollar signs are all i see excuse me,
I got to cut the line leave you niggas behind
For the third time and shine on purpose
Blind'em every time i surface
If an aries hurt you you must deserve it
Every bit of a dime is worth it,
Keep on swerving not perfect
But striving for that working with diamonds,
And flirting with the finest cats,
Desert the broke niggas that still live
With their momma's at
Provoke most to want to wine a dine brat,
Cause i'm dope from coast to coast
Guarantee to fall in love with me
After just one toast,
Smoke weed that'll make you say,
I ain't never getting' high again
Niggas always want to see what i'm riding in
So i slide in the benz outfit match
From head to tims
Rims you ain't seen before fein for doe,
Screamin' cream for mo and mo,
Reap the benefits if it's free shit,
I take gifts in all shapes and sizes
And diamonds is my favorite wish,
Picture me rich a genious,
When it comes to me collecting these chips,
And this to...

Da Brat,"Uh, uh, uh
I know don't exactly what's wrong with your nigga's neck
It's ain't my fault if he looking
You 'spose to keep his ass in check cause
Every time I come near
All he do is stare
And I can see it in his eyes that he wants some
He know what's in the prize, it's Red Rum
To any of these hoes that come
Stand next to me and look like bums, they make pennies
And all I do is stack the paper
Just in case I run into some complications
I'm set for life, never in debt
And you frustrated when I get all the niggas' attention
You fall off
Guess you was born to make the coffee for us
Writing bitches with a higher position
Da Brat talk niggas listen
Go get a nine to five
Cause you can't keep up with the shit I cook up
I can't help it if you're nigga wanna hook up

Ya gotta man but he keep looking at me
Like he really wanna drop ya bad
Cause I'm the shit and I know you mad
But I don't give a fuck, you
Got some dough but your paper ain't as long as mine
And ya really wanna stop me bad
But fix your face bitch I'm here to stay
And I don't give a fuck, you

And I'mma make sure that my niggas lookin'
Tell you broads to calm down there ain't no competition
I'm flawless as the rocks on my left pinky
And I love it when y'all wanna get at me
And make me think my shit don't stink
Evidently you ain't satisfied at home
She ain't got no style of her own
No body of her own
Not roaming in the V12
You turned on because I bought it myself
What other bitch do you know like this?
That's tight as a hot curl
Known to rock worlds
Once I'm spotted you will probably drop your girl
My intimidation to niggas is challenging to 'em
He fiending to get in my Vicky's Secrets
And underneath my Girbaud and my boxer shorts
I rock ice burg sports and Da Brat prints of all sorts
Interesting to you cause I got some dough
You thinkin' if you and me get together
You'll never go broke

Ya gotta man but he keep looking at me
Like he really wanna drop ya bad
Cause I'm the shit and I know you mad
But I don't give a fuck, you
Got some dough but your paper ain't as long as mine
And ya really wanna stop me bad
But fix your face bitch I'm here to stay
And I don't give a fuck, you
Ya gotta man but he keep looking at me
Like he really wanna drop ya bad
Cause I'm the shit and I know you mad
But I don't give a fuck, you
Got some dough but your paper ain't as long as mine
And ya really wanna stop me bad

Niggas always watchin me (funky!)
But I want em to keep on watchin me
I'ma keep give em sumthin to see (smokin!)

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin me, watchin me
Could it be the way I'm still tight?
Niggas that didn't use to feel me jockin me, jockin me
The, whole world got too much money for me
To not get no dough, dough, can't no hoe
Rock harder than the one from So-So
I never go broke broke
I keep comin with the vocals that make most know
Why the fuck I boast, boast and brag
Why should I look sad that I got some loot now?
In fact, I knew how
watch when I back the Coupe out
Can niggas just troop out
The same way they do when I show you Brat
With a little bit of boobs out
And her big ass protrude out
Get the news out
Some of you bitches lose out
When the sexiness ooze out
Like orgasms, I'm the best at this
Throwin tantrums when I move into makin shit
If you thinkin of becomin one of my favorites
You gotta pay a bitch
Cause I be stayin rich
I ain't quittin, quittin
Way before ""Funkdafied"" I was spittin, spittin

(chorus)
Throw yo hands in the air like you dont care
This fo niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on em, get cash on em
And make em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever im high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired
To get that paper, baby

(Da Brat)
If y'all wanna see me, see me
Im give y'all somethin to look look at
Make a nigga neck turn turn for Brat
Burn burn these hoes cuz I'm back and my pants still sag
It's automatic, they wanna jump on my wagon, wagon
I ain't lackin lackin on shit
Open ya eyes when my body when I try on clothes that fit fit
I'm articulate and particulate on who I let hit hit
And get up in the middle of the center of my tootsie roll
Roll me something to smoke smoke and burn slow slow
Don't keep it a secret, tell all ya folks
See you when I shine, I glow, glow
From the C-H-I-C-A-GO, 6-0-6-4-4
And I trust no, nigga that make a mistake for me
Guns ready to blaze and to leave with you
Some of the ones run
I can't control my trigger finger when it pump pump
Stay out the way when I come come
It's guaranteed to bump bump the trunk, uh
And put a hump in ya back
If niggas is askin who's thumpin, it's Brat Brat

(chorus)

(Mystikal)
I keep my bad braids back when puttin the dick on the track
You can turn it down playa, we don't listen to that
The bass dont thump, we spit on crap
That beat ain't tight nigga, that shit ain't fat
Everytime that shit come out, I toss it back and I slap
I be breakin ya back to the rhythm of rap
(?)Test it loud for the low frequency, where it's at?(?)
Niggas say, ""I love that fuckin shit ya did wit Da Brat!""
Actin bad with the pad, with the pen, with the paper
Still smoke a nigga under the table
Put the lines in the words and the hooks and the phrases
Instead of puttin out sumthin thats blazin
Get ya hand out my pocket, get ya foot out ya mouth
And ya head out ya ass
And keep ya nose out my buisness
And I mean it, goddammit, cuz I'm fiddinta get MAD!
I put em in the trash bag
Twist tie, put em out Monday and Wednesday
I kick em in they raggely ass
Take money from em and you know I better get some
I know it ain't fair
but I smoke with alligators and I wrestle with bears
Throw ya hands in the air
As high as you can, and leave them bitches there!

In the spot like  I'm way past risqué

And you can't get next to me baby 
With a blunt in my hand shit is obsolete 
I don't want to be fucked with when I cheat 
It's my smoking lye, how it's supposed to be 
You bitches could never get close to me 
Hopefully you know not to blow my high 
Impose in my zone extinguish my fire 
It's my desire to blaze it up 
Mad cause I puff I don't give a fuck 
Don't come around me with no negative shit 
Step up, step up and I'mma bust your lip 
Cause… 

[Chorus] 
Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high 
(To the sky) 
First thing you can do is make my high come down 
(Down, down, down) 
Ooh when you make my high come down 
I don't want to be around you no more 

[Da Brat] 
Let's space it out, my faith is out 
When I get frustrated I take it out 
On the optimo so break it out 
Gun me vicariously till I choke me 
Make no mistake about Miss Harris stakin' out 
Good cabbage lay it out 
Gray for glycoma, rotten to Daytona 
How to survive? 
Get high all by your lonesome 
Unless you want some company 
I might pass the blunt but this bud's for me 
My concentration and know nothing else 
I take my problems lay 'em on the shelf 
Block all the calls then shut off the cell 
It's not absurd niggas get on my nerves 
With bullshit too much for this bitch 
Me and my spliff don't want to be fucked with

Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high 
(Too the sky) 
First thing you can do is make my high come down 
(Down, down, down) 
Ooh when you make my high come down 
I don't want to be around you no more 

Usually, when I split my gun down the middle 
Got good weed, so strong it takes just a minute 
For me to get to that place we love to go 
I made this shit so you would know 

[Da Brat] 
When the ashes burn off 
I get flashes on how you were turned off 
And a big distraction 
Don't nobody want to be agitated 
Upset or annoyed, and aggravated 
Masturbation ain't stimulating as this 
When it's twist, put it up to my lips and hit 
Don't forget to puff, puff and pass 
My blunt is stuffed up with chunks of hash 

[Chorus] 
Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high

First thing you can do is make my high come down 
(Down, down, down) 
Ooh when you make my high come down

Da Brat,"Buckwild outrageous do what you feel like doin'
'Til a motherfucker know when you don't feel like screwin'
I did it, you do it, break the ties that bound
Keep a motherfucker off you, keep your feet on the ground

Hey, fuck you if you can't go for that
And a double fuck you from Da Brat a tat tat
Let it all hang loose, never feelin' afflicted
Go for what you want and it's called, unrestricted

May the Lord be my witness
From the ""Funk"" to the ""Tantrum"" now ""Unrestricted""
The K Town bitch too weak
In Chi villain they be killin' every mark in the district

Can y'all skill match it?
Right I kill Patrick from the six oh six fo' fo'
Got hit 'cause ya clip so slow
Motherfuckers can't do shit with ""So, so""

Shine like a twenty inch mo, mo
For the Navi' on top of them dub's
Hit me in the mug, and deliver the bud
Now you talkin' 'bout my gul

Terror for the millenium, straight fuckin up anyone
(Hah, anyone, shit)
Steady bust like a semi gun
Murderin' over any drum, comin' out from the dark
Here to let you know here she come

Can't nobody do what I done
Niggaz and bitches think they run
Fin' ta throw another one of my ""Tantrums"" redrum
And the six oh six fo' fo' is where I'm from

Callin' on my nigga Twista to set this shit off
Two of the best motherfuckers on the West side
If I need to relieve stress I get high
This the introduction, unrestricted is how I bust in

Like a blow to the dome and a severe concussion, shock a hoe
And niggaz can talk about me, all they want
'Cause I'ma bad bitch
And I'ma continue to be that, 'til I'm gone

Shit, baby girl you ain't even gotta hurt 'em like that
Commit a murder like that
Let off like a ass kick and serve a hype track
Hit the world like volcano's

Earthquakes, bombs, thunder and lightnin'
No wonder it's frightening
Hoe's might as well not come out of hiding
Could you really be about to crush em'

Dustin 'em off like Hoffman and hush em'
Feel the repercussions of a girl
From a place where that gangsterin' and hustlin'
Ballin' and bustin' so lie low

Dodge low from my Chi flow
We smokin' up five oh
And work thirty calories off like Tae Bo
In the middle of the function flossin'

With a grip no script but ""Legit Ballin""
Better go on with the shit talkin'
I create corpses for caskets and coffins
Niggaz don't want Twista to spit
I kick that Mobtastic shit
Introduction for a raw and sometimes psychotic bitch

Oh, I'm the befo', but Da Brat is the after
We pimpslap lame bitches just for the laughter
All or nothin', never a fraction

And I like it when you keep your eyes on me
And I like it when you touch my privacy
And I like it sex and ecstasy

Just throw yo hands in the air motherfuckas
I came to make y'all freak one another
I, I keep bangin', I keep slangin'
We keep watching niggas die for simple things
So I keep swingin', fuckin' a nigga head up
Dead up, I'm fed up feel my lead bust

Now I don't stop, but I smoke weed
I ain't gotta pop rocks no more I got G's
Just wave you hands from side to side
Cause we gone show keep it live
We got greed in our eyes, I keep spittin', I keep rippin'
I keep women, I creep and keep hittin'
They impressed with my shoe size, deuce I'm with you tonight
Girl if you do it right, me and you can do it twice

When I'm called on to bust, wanna get yo brawl on with us
Can't ball with us, too hard to touch
22 Fuckin' up they callin' us

I'm the first one off the bus, got nuts to lust
They keep rushin' for status, some more than you got it
All for cabbage as far as we got it

So don't push me, I'm too close to the edge
Bout to go loco on these niggas, leave'em for dead, and

When it's time for us, bitch we diamond cut
I'm 22, We West-Chi

And I'm da motherfuckin' Brat right

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours

When I hit the door, nigga best move, guess who
We ain't got no dress shoes, just a couple scarves and a vest too
Test who why you trippin' we came to party
Run game and probably leave the party with somebody
Gotta be hard, women they love to touch it
And when I fuck 'em they hypnotized
Sprung cause I hit it right, tongue tied sometimes
Like Zinfandel wine, got they mind blown
In my zone, I'm a grown man, gone I ain't tryin' to keep her
She got nice features, but so do Mesha, Imma keep creepin'
Keep getting deeper they playa hate me all of a sudden
A new kid bussin', you hear it hush and she
Scared to cut fuckin' too many hoes, me I got
Twenty hoes, I'ma hoe, be a hoe, spend the dough, see a show
Let it be known playa west to east
Cause I'm the dog that fell in love with the Georgia Peach

I heard you wanna hit this twat, nigga I thought not
Fell up in the party with a phat knot, glock cocked
Got too much of my own shit to stop
And look for niggas, when I make any dick rock
Shook them niggas, took all they cheese, still they say
They body's callin' for me, wanna go half on a seed and shit
Fuck that, I got half on the weed and shit and I'm Brat
One of a kind of my breed and shit and you can find me
On the West Side of Chi with my thieving click, believe a bitch
Cause ain't no nigga hated on the pussy yet
Squeeze the dick, got grip, they can't forget
Ain't a hoe tight like me, flow tight like me
Quote, write and recite, fuck all night like me
They say is she is or is she ain't a dyke
You curious cause you wanna fuck me tonight

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours
",Breeve on Em,2000
Da Brat,"Uh, any chance I get I'm on a plane
I book advance tickets and pay the fees with no complaints
In the summer its off the hook no time to waste
Just lie at the lake and I'm shoulder dry to the taste

Even though some niggas I grew up with hate
I keep a few good homies that try to stay outta jail
Tonio tell me what the bail is it'll be there
And when you get out my coke tail here

The crack head deals in my daddy
And all he seem to dream about is bad ass habits
The gun shots scream loud 
So I soak the radio from upstairs to outside the house

With the extended cord no night is boring
On the front porch even if its pouring
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring 
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

[Chorus]
Chi town chi town the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show 'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime

The liquor store on every corner packed
The bus run twenty-fo and my stop Jackson
Fire hydrant busted time for action
Niggas come out like its the beach in Miami

The cops chase thiefs all through the alley and don't stop
These niggas kill for rocks 
If you can't stand up for your spot don't squat
Shop for a vacant lot or get shot

'Cause Chicago niggas don't play them games
When it comes to slanging them thangs for the money mane
Fuck around and get short for the playas ball
And call don Juan to flash green on why'all

The pimps got the hoes pinned up on the wall
Just pass me the blunt and I puff it all 
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

[Chorus]

Don't worry about what I do for my city
Some of y'all run your mouth too much and what a pity
If you outside looking in, shit seem pretty
But it's a lot of shit to do with bitch...I did it

I'm cold in the winter my mink track the flow
With the hat to match cadillacs in the snow
If its a block party the whole hood know
Niggas from 3 and 1st streets overcome the smoke

It's K Town times 22 next shine
Who label he on mine Westside nigga right
To my Southside niggas and my Eastside niggas
And my Northside niggas get high

We really don't give a fuck what side you from
Just keep on hollering out Chi!!!
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

Da Brat,"Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

If ya thirsty I could possibly slide down your throat
If you work may let's say we skip the foreplay
Picture me kicking in the doorway to set off the storey
Negligee hot tip of the knockers stay brick like rocks

Figure if you drop ice here I don't stop
'cause it's twice as nice when it's frosted up
Sweetness like this could never cost enough
With a so, so twist, try this stuff

Mouth watering love succulent to all taste buds
Must of been us you was dreaming of the crush
I breeve on 'em and make 'em feel the lust
Then jiggle the lemons a little so they feel to touch

Cream to us say nothing to us scared
Premium pink stuff and swing with us sweetened it up
To it make you wanna say, ""Ooh its cool""

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby

I'm weighed in at one tree five a big gulp size
Seven eleven can't satisfy your appetite all night
JD and I planned it to be dickable so it's alright
You can come and escapade in my escalade

Lay me flat on my back and slurp away
I get action in a Bentley with no brains
Just pure satisfaction cracking with no cain
I came for the thrill of it I ain't looking for real love
Just the feel of it

After just one taste you still bugging
Da black cat make you wanna handle business
Until the pleasure principle kick it

If you hit this I'll make you tell your wife and your mistress
To leave town 'cause they been evicted
Hit up a record store pick up Brat and get addicted

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

Cool, refreshing cool
(Ooh, ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar, baby
In my pink lemonade

A thirst quenching mouth watering concoction
Your only option drink to ya pink why stop it
One think its refreshing isn't it the best when you sipping it
Heaven sake honey buns built for dipping in

Money come quicker than a two minute brother
That concentrate on stiffin' when he love it
Stick when too dry so keep stirring
It still be the sweet even if it turn syrup

Hurry up and get a cup full cop fills and get' cha cap peeled back
Rash a little rat first smash went classic
Even with my homies help on the west you wack
Sincerely Brat where my girls at

We stick together in the rain
Batches of pink lemonade bringing da pain
Any day and every minute make you wanna get up in it
'cause it's just that cool

Da Brat,"Wonderin' where you been, baby, baby?

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

Really though how much time you think I got?
The clock is ticking, it's ticking away
You're slippin' away fucking the honeys on the block stop
'Cause if I gotta drop kick a ho, I'll kill her fa'sure
Let's stick around till the murder occurs
How you gonna creep with me and sleep with her?

At the moment of time when I heard the news
My vision must have been blurred
'Cause I ain't think you deserve to lose the nerve for fools
Shit people were saying was absurd to me
But I certainly never thought you would take it to the degree
Of hurtin' me, purposely

We were supposed to be husband and wife
So I dedicated my life to you
Why? So you could keep a chick on the side
'Cause if I sneak a dick on the side you lookin' to die
And booking me a ticket to Chi cause you choose to lie
I need a nigga with an attitude, maturative mind

Give me gratitude when I'm giving him shine
No matter who the bastard was, I was past his love
But he never ran fast enough
I'm a master at the craft 'cause I roll with some master thugs
Laughin' as I pass you up
Should've told me that you wanted to get ass and fuck
I would've set it up so we all had some fun

You assist to get around, I'll be the aid and assist you to get out
Thank them hoes cause you're shit out of luck
And I don't regret what I spit out and bust
I'm sick and tired of you us, I had enough for this sittin' at home
Cryin' 'n' stuff 'n' being alone
Nigga if you want to roam the streets then just let me be
There's a whole gang of niggas that wanna hit my sheets

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

Shit, all I ever did was wait and look out the window
And smoke me some endo
It drove me to drinkin' and getting bent mo'
Gave myself 100% more time to think, was love designed to stink?
Repeatedly you lied to me, told you to confide in me
Ain't nothin' them other hoes could do 'cause I molded you
To fit properly was inside of me

When you're strokin' them, you're thinkin' of riding me
And most of them hopin' to slide with me 'cause I'm a ferocious hoe
When it comes to freaky shit the dopest, you had to blow this
It's all out of proportion and lost your focus
Wasting my time cause I'm just getting older
You're the reason I keep a chip on my shoulder
44 in the holster bulletproof vest under my clothes

I'm supposed to trust you
Every time I leave town I bust you, fuck you, the moanin' and groanin'
Led me to the pillow where you laid your head
Felt like I'd rather be dead instead
Went ahead followed the sound through the hallway
You said you'd always be true
But the neighbors say the bitch was there all day with you
That's why you ain't answered when I was pagin' you

I hit the door, you duck and dove, she tried to find her clothes
Y'all was dodging bullets holes together
You gonna stay with that broke hefer
You know who the So So Defest is
I ain't gotta show a motherfucker breastesses to keep 'em interested in
You better recognize the good investment
From the West Side of Chi nigga

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
We've been runnin' out of time 'cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night, I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time, tired of your lying

So loud that he headlights blink on and off 

I laugh when people watch I don't stop I shine 

It's attractive to motherfuckers that love to grind 

I sparkle from the rims to the chain to the watch 

To the rings to the ears to the wrists to the glocks 

To the parts in the braids 

Shorties that stop to watch throw on the shades 

Cause Da Brat got gleam for days 

Sunroof open let the sun shine in 

Baking the fuck out of me and all my friends 

In the backseat, stay in the front

And act like I don't see 'em 

I've done had one or too many shots of Tequila 

But when it's set to crunk I need my liquor 

Loud and rowdy naturally 

Pull up to my truck and smile 

But you ain't proud of me 

I left you in the rearview with a look of disgust 

And a mad mug cause your windows almost bust 

I can't fathom the thought of my seats not rumbling 

And people catching whiplash when I past in front of 'em 

I'm flashy and I don't care if you know 

From the see to the H-I-see-A-G-O 

I'm fresh to death no matter how I'm dressed

Can't wait to get to the club to see my face just to
smoke and drink with me

Make the whole table go crazy the first second
Third I'm ready and able to hit the middle
Under that disco ball so I could shake a little
This s*** for why'all who dance with me
Touchin' my a** and titties so frantically
Don't get carried away with it
I'll let you have a little fun if you play with it
Insatiably, when I cum I do it patiently

And we danced till the crack of dawn came

handed to her

Leave it alone when the sweat trinkle down my
cleavage you can't stand it
And you ain't even believing you dancing with Brat
And making eye contact
Homie put your hands on my waist and occasionally
Run your fingers through my fresh a** braids and say
to me
That you feel horny 'cause I want to know
If you want some of this I wish you tell me so
'cause if I let you touch me I must want you to go
Home with me be alond with me to get some mo'
'cause we smoke we drink we bump and grind
And even though I'm tipsy I want to know what's on
ya mind

No chick can neglect this
Just listen when I stress this

Big lips so thick make me want to drop draws
Star had me rock hard shaking like a pornstar
Uh huh wa**up shorty
Won't you be my sweet lover friend what homie
Thug love homie Brat put you up on pink lemonade
That's why I don't attract rats with my serinades
Stack off plubicades
Lack when it comes to brains

Rack'em they love my name 22
'cause they figure amongst themselves can I really
enject 2

Well I'm kind of innocent
A vision of love
You adore me
Even though my image is thug

What I see in you
Is for my eyes only to see
I bring out the freak in you
Up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl

Me your loverboy
But when we roam alone
We come touch toys
Making noise we can't avoid

The way I throw that
Can't pop, backdrop, stopwatch, Brat-tat
Get ya more rock
Hard up
All of the things that you wanna do to me
If you wanna, we can get obscene
My cream and you're ding-a-ling mingle
Bother me not
When the sensation come out

I'll make you scream
Uh huh uh huh baby
Feel me
When I pump the pump lady
Behind me we can be close like family
You're so sweet you taste like all types of candy
Starburst to jellybeans

Banana split my dairy queen
Butterfinger my tangerines
Chickens only taste my
Loverboy in they dreams
All my ladies
Let me hear you scream
Hate on me
As much as you want to
You can't do

Bitches be emulating me daily (daily)

Shut cho' ass up girl, ha ha
Ya know, I bought me some diamonds
Show em' what cha' bought me
Ya know, I'll show myself off, ya dig ha ha ha
They hate me, ya know they gon' hate me, ha ha oh Lord
[Hook x2]
Take me out to the ballgame
Spend no small change
Now show me off to the people in the crowd man
I like big thangs
[Verse 1]
This chick here gets thicker each year
And I have no fear, what I spit in yo ear
Mommie dearest keepin' it clean and clear
My home base, stick it to ya face and to ya rear
We veer to the left, why
Cause that's how So So Def ride
We run the streets from A-T-L to Chi
We leaves no traces, we just glide
Lay back and switch side to side
We choke on hay all day in the middle of the barn
It seems you want me to be the lady under ya arm
Well I'll consider it, maybe
Show me ya tongue baby
And i'm sure that I could make it all gravy
All bases gotta be loaded
So I can slide on in, in a Bentley, Benz, or my Rover
Take me out and be my Casanova
Like Levert, and I might convert just to hold ya
[Hook x2]
[Verse 2]
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks
I don't care if I never get back
I'ma root, root, root for my home team
Cause we always win and it's a shame
That it's one, two, three strikes for you
At the old ballgame
Come on, bet against So So Def, forget it
Your chances of winning
Is lookin' itty bitty so stop grinnin'
You just diggin' a deeper ditch
You hidin' in the dugout from the feature chick
I'll put cha' lights out, pitch fast or slow
Collabo, So So, whatever I spit on
Is goin' goin gone
I'm Sammy Sosa on the vocals
And white socks and afros are my accessories, worth a fortune
Please believe if ya checkin' for me
I got wants and needs that consist of big thangs baby
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3]
Let me tell ya bout So So
You should thank me, I'm no joke
Like the Yankees
I'm so funky, that it's stankie
My wrist so chunky
That people stare at it and be like naw, it can't be
But it is and it shall be forever more
J.D. made me wealthy, now I chase the dough
You can't help me if ya paper low
If you broke it's unhealthy, we can't grow
I'ma be on my own these days
If you don't like it you can go away
Relocate, it's OK, hit the pavement
I'm Chicago Cub'n it and Atlanta Brave'n it
This is my covenant, you can not invade it
And I cannot be faded
So try to just eradicate it from ya brain
Go get a job at the hot dog stand
I need big thangs boo, you don't like that
I don't give a fuck, fuck you
[Hook x6]
[Da Brat talking]
Game right, hit cha' a home run
Strike out a few times, it's all good

The roof about to blow, so so, let's go

Uh haha, remix
All I see over here ain't nothin' but a lot of honies lookin' for man
And niggas with a lot of money, bottles in they hand
And short shirts, honies tryin' to show that slow (show that)
Lined up tryin' to get through the velvet ropes
'Cause over here when the jam drops everybody bug
Standin' on the couches like this our club
Got the Bacardi and Cristal mixed in too (yeah)
Knowin' in the morning I'm a feel the blues (uh huh)
But the jam keeps droppin' and the drinks keep comin'
And the girls keep talkin' to me (talkin' to you)
I mean shit straight poppin' everybody jumpin'
Makin' it hard for me to leave (oh)

All you gotta do is call me and I'll come runnin' to where the party at
I keep a fat sack in the backpack
Know what's happenin'
In every city I'm rappin' in
If it's a after splash I'm the last cat in
Kitty purrin' tight like virgin
Like snow, flurrin'
The party begins when the slurpin' ends (oh)
You do me, I do you
Spend a night with boo-boo
Let's have a private party for two
But it's gotta be pumpin' in order for me to get cream
Run to the border for Colombian's green
Studyin' horticulture
My green thumb keeps them water vapors twistin'
I freak until I cum
I keeps it number one

But the hustlers, gangsters, thugs is over here!
Get wit' us (why?)
We true ballers like the Sixers
We all hoppin' out of sixes
Mines is black, Jermaine's is champagne
Jagged Edge in the blue, platinum, and pearl white and gray
What a sight to be seen (uh)
So So Def's the crew I thought you knew
It's a beautiful thing (so beautiful)
I mean there's nothin' like us it's true
The sun could retire if the rocks we got get any brighter
WHOA!!
Once the man and the game that I kick begins
My nickname is ESPN
Now if ya jewels is blue and ya goose is gray
Mix in the O.J. and let's party away

Yo, this lil' cat got girls
Cat got flows, roll up in the party, snuck in the back door
I don't mean no harm, I just heard it was rockin'
Let me party witcha 'til the cops come knockin'
I'm tryin' to see what all the fuss about
Bounce a little bit before they put me out

And we always know where the party at, bling (bling bling)

Ay, where the party at? (Tell 'em)
Girls is on the way, where the Bacardi at? (J.E. y'all)

Man I rip flows, get dough everytime I rip shows
Rip hoes, when we mash out in Chevy's and fours

On e'rything

You make me TALK nasty nasty to ya 
Dream about how I want to do ya 
Think things to think about you bring it out 
You show me how to use my tongue 
You just some yum yum tasty tasy 
And when you take me and take me you bring the freak out in me

I'm freaky freaky 
Gimme head head 
I want to see how you get down, go down, go down and get fed 
Come 'n get some tasty tasty 
Lick each 'n every individual part and make me, make me 
Come come a chameleon 
See a different position to do something different to the yum yum 
Jump jump on top of the kitchen cabinet 
So you can stick it 'n pump pump 
Miss Harris waiting for whatever I feel like having 
Save you some embarrassment 
I'm an Aries 'n I ain't scared of shit 
Dare to flinch then 'n there I'll make your chest hairs lift

Only you do ah, ah 
Think about this n try try 
To kiss all the places 
Missed by the basic loving up your guy-ah 
Ride in the park in the broad daylight 
Real hard like we the only ones around 
Back of the car, tearing you apart 
And this how shit be going down 
When I pump you say harder harder 
Love it when I bring my camcorder 
Whipped cream, take everything 
Even when we first got started started 
From the bedroom to the dance floor 
To a slow tune up against the door 
To the up 'n down, to the in 'n out 
To the way you sound

And I'm capable to disable you

Turn out your lights and leave your wife 
Lie me down on my back but don't let my Timberland's clap 
Hit it up like its Wimbledon 
Don't spare a racket cause Brat freaky like that 
Just once taste of the nipple 
And two kisses will leave you crippled 
You done fell in love with shantizzle

Carmen a hip hopera watch the drama unfold
The tragic tale of a girl
Tryin' to capture the gold
With a free spirit, brothers steady tryin' to hold

Climbed up the rough side and got tough at times
But I remain, if I got the stuff to shine
And pull out the pump, protect mine
Survive in the game, hate on me 'cause you lame
They don't ever see your face or say your name
No more pain for me, no more misery, 'cause you history
I'm a hold on to what I got
Strap on to my perfection, strap on protection
My own direction, born to be the best at what I do
I'ma make it through, stompin' like a soldier in my big black boots
I keep 'em ""Jumpin', Jumpin',"" stayin' funky, funky for you
No matter who's that man that walk out of your life
You don't need 'em, don't be no heater
Long as I'm still breathin', not leavin' for no reason
Seen them come and go, one switch, they not gold
No house no mo', not even a condo
As long as I know how to love, I'm a stay alive
No need your game or style
They can't tame me 'cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin' down
Can the rain sit, and 'em things chromed out, spit
And in my game, no doubt, I'm a get paid in a big way, survivor!

Da Brat,"You want to dance?
Ha, I'm a make you dance
You want to move?
Ha, I'm a make you move
Dru Hill come on

I got this feeling
I can't turn it loose
That somebody else is getting next to you
Can't walk around

Like I was your fool
'Cause being who I am I can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me bout things going on
But deep in my heart babe
I hope that I'm wrong

Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
Takin' my place

I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something's wrong cause it's written on your face
(Written on your face)
'Cause it hurts so bad when I walk through the door

But you know one thing
I ain't comin' back no more
Don't try to tell me things are still the same
'Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name

[Chorus]

What else did you want?
What else did you need?
Giving you everything plus my heart
I gave you the world (Yes I did)
'Cause you were my girl (Oh yes I)
But you still ran out on me

Uh, fly shit, differnt colors whips
I got plenty big hits, all kinda dips
Got too many

My life ain't complete if I ain't got no buzz
And can't nobody do it like we does
It's a must brat bust and the mike you hand to me
And represent for the rest of the family

Well I'm known for makin' moves on my own big songs
And now I keep it commin' stong till the early morn

Let me interrupt
Your regular schedule
Twistin' off high levels of bubonic
Chokin' amateurs till they vomit

I make em sick cause I'm the williest

Too much for you to deal with
My niggas that ride quick
Survive or die bitch

Why switch this remix hurts everyday
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill
Something you can feel
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill
What the deal?

Funkier than parliment
Stay bent behind tent
And keep a nigga payin' my rent
My goldier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers

We make believers out of dreamers

Thought you were doing right
But violence and flames
And torches and chains
Are fueling
These new northern lights
Like prisoners working
On infertile land

To find out the score
If you're sick then you're lonely
Out of work then you're hungry

Who says poverty and race
Can be kept in their place
By keeping it
All underground
And ruling the country
Are unfaithful husbands
Who spank little boys
Gagged and bound
There's got to be a better way
For you and for me
To turn this hypocrisy round
The growth of a nation
Cannot be achieved
By keeping
The downtrodden down

Turn it up, turn it so loud

They don't ever see your face or say your name
No more pain for me, no more misery, 'cause you history
I'm a hold on to what I got
Strap on to my perfection, strap on protection
My own direction, born to be the best at what I do
I'ma make it through, stompin' like a soldier in my big black boots
I keep 'em ""Jumpin', Jumpin',"" stayin' funky, funky for you
No matter who's that man that walk out of your life
You don't need 'em, don't be no heater
Long as I'm still breathin', not leavin' for no reason
Seen them come and go, one switch, they not gold
No house no mo', not even a condo
As long as I know how to love, I'm a stay alive
No need your game or style
They can't tame me 'cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin' down
Can the rain sit, and 'em things chromed out, spit

Hey shorty

Can you see me
You know yeah
As the clock keep ticking tick, tick gotta keep my vision bleary,
I'm in a hurry to get this paper don't worry I'm a dough chaser I'm
Still living my dreams wheather its hustling, shaking 
And shuffling niggas around I'm getting more greater 
And its the gang shit that I ain't seen yet
And its the gang niggas I ain't meet yet
Even though I been to Paris and London and rome, 
Japan, Africa, Baghdad Amsterdam brought back a phat sack
And I'm rolling dem joints chrome flashing sparkling like gucci colins 
When I throw on that boostey
You niggas can't stop slobbing 
I'm a pretty young thug and its hotter than ever
Fucking it up so I get paid to do stuff never 
When this cheddar at stake
I'm a chain billionaire blow a couple of millon 
Some cars so my family and homies can ride like stars

I'm all about the money I don't know about you 
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do 
Gotta whole lotta living to do be4 I die 
And I ain't got time to waste
Honey yeah yeah

Now understand me cause its not complex 
I'm young and restless with one life to
Live so I cash checks
I'm individually wrapped liked a fresh twinkie 
So if I cream in the middle
Nigga licky, licky, licky, licky 
Become sponge bob absorb me up
Can't just polish this I demolish the flow 
Niggaz astonished when I spit 
When I'm pissed I let it flow 
I can afford me a Bentley 
Without having to forge a signature 
Or getting a nigga to co sign with me
I get bored quickly so I 
Sour on the g4 to Cali for more sticky gravy life
Come hop on this tour with me lets get faded for life
I used to save up cookies they are brown even
But I got rid of the whole box 
And I didn't even turn the loot in' 
I'm shootin' its all cause of you lame ass butlers 
When I smirk if devils could talk mine would say fuck ya!

Its so so def
How could the cans get dropped
From the mansion to the high rise to the block we hot
I rock the white people the Latinos and foreigners
Niggas can't see me when they cry I scratch out there corniers
I'm warning ya I was born a winner 
I scare crowed off like that Anna Lotono
Did right after she sang 'home in the weares
After the blizzard that's 
When I came through with them frosted pieces was dripping like icicles
Keep a few of dem precious V-V-S's next to my skin 
So with the best investment jems ain't no second guessing its here
Ain't not question who the best is 
Take a lesson from a bitch who is the goodie in years
Never skooted in here got dem all in here
Cause dirty money spin like clean money from da A-T-M dummy 
So when you done bumping your gums there's a lot of dough to be made
You should get you sum before its too late
And you left wiv none
Now its all bout the cash where ever it come from

[Verse 1]
When I first saw your man we was really fine
And you was getting a little irritated that I was looking
Like you knew what was on my mind (fuck you)
You're not secure
It's written all over your face
You thought it wouldn't last (not tomorrow)
Top kitty in place
You see me as an obstacle
Staying away much as possible
It's mandatory that I command the attention of your man eye
Not to mention he can't help it because I'm fly
The plan is
I stroll by
Big bubble Chanel shades with diamond tips
Get up close and personal
Seduce with my lips
I ain't gotta say shit
He felling me and you all bent outta shape
'cause I'm about to take who you with
Keep crunk
The run in my blood make a nigga jump jump
His body was banging
His teeth was pearly white
He had those strong keen features like Mario Van Peebles
His check bones was chiseled
His smile made me sizzle
His cologne had me sniffen' him from all the way home
I want to smell this nigga and I this nigga to smell me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So the night went on
We keep it in each other sides
He kept coming around me just to see my behind
I was being so flirtatious with the body language
I was so anxious to make those arrangements
Tangle him up in the sheets
Transaction about to happen anytime that we meet
I put one foot in front of the other
Stopped to look in back of my nameplate in the mirror
Gotta make sure my lipstick is straight and not smeared
Its clear he wants me severely
So I slide over up to his ear and whispered it gently
Fuck Me! Fuck Me! Fuck Me!
You on the other hand nowhere to be found
Told you he was going to pee
But he came to find me
He felt you standing around
I'm a fuck him

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You came to the bathroom
And guess what you saw
You saw my big brown titties popping outta my bra
With his mouth on my nipple like a suction cup
I was wrapped around him like an octopus
He was rubbing me down so I couldn't get up
I know you hate me now but I don't give a fuck
If he was yours like you said he was

In tha beginning when I met you I didn't mean to be	 rude but i had to sweat you 
'cause you had me wet boo. 
I couldn't let you get away 'cause then when would i see you again, another day?

Your face was all I needed to see on a daily basis my heart in you're hands would make it all gravy
But i was  mistaken highly, you slid shit right by me bein decietful n hidin keeping secrets but still
keepin me smilin ivitin hoes to you're party Lord knows I don want to get started I might hurt somebody
Regardless ima love you for what we been through but keepin you is somethin I can't do

If you get somebody not jus anybody get somebody thaz gonna be like nobody 
Get somebody don tell everybody 'cause somebody gon' try to crash you're party


As much as I miss you I can't get wit you
We painted a perfect picture
But I can see clearly now, the rain is gone 
But tha pain still come on strong

Every so often I get discombobulated
Callin' Miss Cleo to see wat the Tarot Cards are sayin
Hopin' that she kno how to help a bitch out or somethin
Give me you're lucky number then come up those

Mothafuckas I'm not frontin you only get one strike here, you blew it
so i won't be	 right here
The best friend that you claim you eva had is gone and it happened because you played me wrong
Sing tha song for me:

(repeat chorus)

An' now that its over that predicament taught me to be	 a soldier n stay at attention
Fold my colla up an' pop it 
An' keep hollarin at tha rich niggaz wit tha deep pockets that keep me goin shoppin
I'm better now than ever now, you've never found somebody quite like me to stay down
Whateva is meant to be, Ill be	 that n whoeva is sent to me will be	 crashed

Da Brat,"Yo, (ok) kids I was sittin on the block the other day man
Some fine ass girl walked by
And she was lookin, I'm lookin back
She said uh ""JD I love those 20's on your car""
I said I beg your motherfuckin pardon
Them is Michael Jordan's baby
She gotta understand the type of nigga you dealin with
A young, fly, flashy So So Def representer
The biggest thing in the city since Martin Luther the King

Uh, holla at 'em
Brooklyn is what I'm reppin
Disrespect and bullets fly in your direction
Ridin shotgun with JD I got so so connections
Locos and the chrome blows, homie not to mention
I got four homes that I own, I'm certified pimpin
Cross my path, shots blast instant
Extort your ass the kid got henchmens
The whole Brooklyn for instance
Red dot, ruthless, head shots stop you from thinkin
A best seller's what I'm inkin
Another Brooklyn classic, straight acid, keep listenin
Twin Desert Eagles, duck when I'm twistin 'em
Rims spin on sick vehicles, look we killin 'em
Manson and gas my adrenaline, racin fast
Switchin four lanes with weight up in the stash
I'm livin so so better now, the so so dash
is what I'm sittin on, blowin up so so fast

Yeah, uh huh
Yo, You really don't want to get hit
Hot lid when I empty the clip
Drop kid if you droppin your lip
Never know enough about but I talk shit
You must want to eat up my clit
Everything we ever did on is sick
We don't have a party, we rich
We cut it up with anybody we with
And I'm the main one, havin to fit
Can't nobody do it like this
I got a gat by the side like my man Big
Stand out on that song he did with me
You feelin the presence of So So Def
Rest assure we gettin the money
crush your label there's no more left
Just fables fictional characters I
Stay away from those who 
embellish the truth and LIE
I'm kickin the same shit you been 
used to since ""Funkdafied""
Let your mind escape, you laid 
away back and enjoy the RIDE
Yeah, I'm rollin on deuce trays
Shoot all my Tequila straight
Catch me at the bar of the bay
I might even buy you a little drank
We been choppin paper for years
Ain't scared of you niggaz out here
Some of ya'll might think we disappear
But everytime the resurgence is clear

Yo, yo
Brooklyn has to be two of the illest
Felons to be diluted I do whatever, to foot it
Like I want to do it, like I do it

And to the tick-tock ya don't stop
Would ya believe I ain't never left the scene

I could of stayed in your face but I waited in the wings
Patiently 'til the coast was clear, some hoes ain't goin' have no hope this year
When I kill it I murder it dead, sippin' on some remi uh!
As for my competition find them in the hospital bed nigga

Wishin' they ain't had no confrontation with Brat

I got the strength to make it through the rainy weather and storms
But I don't got the patience waitin' on the doe to come
I chase it until the job is done
Ain't nothin' basic about me I'm the livest one

I'm on fire, now I see why ya, bitches want to bite me like a vampire
It's just the way that I am, really don't give a damn
From the fat on your back it's a fact that you wack
And you want to be Da Brat

That'll never happen come on! That's suicide
You might as well put your neck in a noose
Take ten vicaden and chase it wit grey goose
Or start your car in the garage with the door down

Representer who rocks your musicbox
And break down your structure you
Fantasize as you visualize me as your dreamlover {Whoa
With your emotions unplugging your daydream face
Reality reason through mc's
Inflicting fatalities
Ain't no cap on my salary
I'm gettin' g's if you heard of me's
Then you know that we's makin' g's
Let's xscape with Mariah Carey and me
To tha back steady stacking papers smokin' on fat
Stacks of danks see to some
I'm a hero of this feel on file
But that's my style
And they don't pay me nor can they fade me
So what I do is keep it true and real
For my peeps in that street cause to them
I'ma always be their baby

May we always be together
In the sands of time

Yo, uh, uh
You know what? Y'all ain't ready for this
Still scrambling from the damage of the last remix
Most of your stories bore me, I love to lie
To my royalties be the glory
Mariah, my honey, be fly
Ah, me and B-R-B-R
Usually seen in hot spots jumpin' outta two seaters
We got money to make
And many records to break
We not (sometimes) to any so make no mistake
Listen

Oh, honey (So So Def)
You can have me, when you want me
You simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one, who makes me come running
Cause what you got, is far beyond compare, ooh

And it's just (just)
Like (like)
Honey (honey)
When your love (uh huh) comes over me 
Oh baby I've got a dependency, always strung out
For another taste of your honey (yeah, yeah)
It's like when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you
I adore you, one hit your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling don't you see
Every night and day, I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe, how good it feels inside
Honey I can't describe, how good it feels inside

MC c'mon
Yeah, ooh
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey
Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you (say what)
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cuss you're the only thing I wanna do

Y'all be saying this and that
But y'all don't wanna see this new phenomenon
This Don Chi Chi
It's somethin' nasty

And she go by the unforgettable name 
Of the B 
To the R

I like colloso size pieces of rocks
And getting pushed in the Bentley drop top
Undefeated indefinitely
And don't stop
We rock in all kinds of spots
Calling all the shots
And y'all knows how we get down
My beliefs is being dolla bill seeker
And a Benjamin keeper
Don't mind popping if y'all
Or slow wind with some clown with
Seven digit accounts

Where is the sunshine we once knew?
Everybody knows when little children play
They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
When will those black skies turn to blue?
Everybody knows when boys grow into men
They start to wonder when their country will call
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
What is the whole world coming to?
Everybody knows when men can not be friends
Their quarrel often ends where some have to die
Let the sun shine through

The windows of the world are covered with rain
There must be something we can do
Everybody knows whenever rain appears
It's really angel tears
How long must they cry?

Da Bulldogs,"But when it comes to
Protecting the lives of twenty-two million Afro-Americans
Then all of a sudden, Uncle Sam becomes very conscious, of legality

Here's the reason that, I've been upset for a while
'Cause if you're black you get life, but if you're white you're on trial
Ain't nothing to it, just like that chump Charles Stewart
They're always claiming, that the devil made me do it
For insurance, he killed his wife and his child
And blamed it on a brother, and racists got buck wild
He had the media, believing the, aesop fable
And all the whites were like, ""I can't wait 'til
They catch the bastard - I hope they fry him""
They were sure that he did it, there was no need to try him
And Willy Bennett, who was in it to win it
Got bassed and harassed cause they was sure that he did it
And the thing that really pissed me off and truly offended me
Is the suckers wanted to reinstate the death penalty
For a brother man, but not the other man
And when they found out, he killer her himself, hmm on the other hand
Now it's inhumane, bring it back they wouldn't dare
But his brother confessed he was with it, so give HIM the chair
But that won't happen with that punk Dukakis
Flynn and Mickey Roach, you better just watch for us
I don't want to hear that you're sorry to me
After you tore up, and started a war up in the black community
It's out of the news, but it's still in my head
Charles Stewart still lives even though the sucker's dead
I'ma speak upon it

He is trying to wipe, you, out
Trying to eliminate your total existence
With falsehood and lies
And he's succeeding in doing it!

Now here's a verse about a relative, that coulda lived
But killed by a cop that thought negative
Shot in the back like a victim of Jesse James
Tell them his motherf***ing name!
Phillip Pernell, murdered by a devil
That never saw a cell, so I'm here to raise hell and tell
About a child that was left to decay
And the next couple of days the pig was suspended with pay
Receiving support from cops and superior courts
And all we receive is a bullet inside a corpse
Now tell me, what type of justice has been done
What woulda happened if I shot his son?
I woulda been killed, taken to a chamber and filled up with gas
But yet nothing has happened to ?
So I had to take two extra steps
And put it on wax, cause I couldn't let it rest (why?)
'Cause I can't stand to see Satan smile
And get away with taking the life of a child
You meant to do it, so now your motto is (tell 'em)
The more bullets, the less blacks live (you better)
Watch your back you murderer because you're wanted
But for now, yo, I guess I gotta speak upon it

We've got to come together
Pool our efforts, our strength, our finance
And build our own nation
The Chinese did it, it's called Chinatown!

Let me speak upon this with a radical take as I take
Time to talk about the systematical break-down
And deliberate destruction through mis-education
Of the Nubian Nation
Starting in kindergarten, continuing through college
They continue to kick you trick knowledge
And call it education but I call it training
Washing your brain into gaining and maintaining
The American dream, but to me it's a nightmare
Because they keeps ya right where
They want you to be, mentally, physically, and monetarily
As you go merrily merrily merrily
Down the stream but it's more like up s***'s creek
Without a paddle and the boat's got a leak
We start drowning in all that s***, getting deeper
Mind's in a choke hold or should I say a sleeper
But I ain't going out like Rip Van Winkle
So you can't gas me up anymore, and I think you know
That I can see clearly now the rain is gone
It's bright outside, I see the light, and I'ma speak upon it

You know what I'm saying?
'Cause all that s*** they taught me in school amounted up to ZERO
(Word is bond!)
Abraham Lincoln ain't my motherf***ing hero, why know what I'm saying?
(That Devil ain't my hero neither)
Word up, yo this is Def Jef the poet with soul
Cooling with my man Eddie O.G.
On a funky funky funky funky funky funky track
(Yeah, Bulldogs is out there, why'knahmsayin?
ShaQuan, peace to you and Ace, why'knahmsayin?
Peace to Teddy Ted, Special K, DJ Doc, Ramos
Yeah boys, the soul brothers, why'knahmsayin?)
Oh yeah yeah, Craig B. ? Love and the Legend
And DJ Eric Vaughn, hah
(Word up)
Yeah

Notice this!
They put ""In God We Trust"" on a dollar bill
They don't even have it on a church
And don't even open the verses of their bible
But on the dollar bill is a big sign ""In God We Trust,"" correct?
Then they have, on the back of the dollar bill
The key, the scales, the pyramids
All of the symbols of bondage, slavery
How they took the country, who they took it from
Who you are, the builders of the pyramids
Without your eyes
You are the builders of the pyramids without your eyes
Because you don't know you did it
Why don't he know?
Because a traitor, taught him to eat wrong foods, since he was a baby
Put pork in him, has you eating pigs feet and ribs
Has you living in his image
And took away your divinity
And replacing it, with his low animalization",Speak Upon It,1991

I think about my last dollar while you hollar for these rap songs 
I'm in my Eden when I rap about what I believe in 
No deceivin' Illuminati got that ass thinkin' 
Yo should I even rap or will I ever blow 
Or should I take the loot I got and call a cab and go 
'Cause now-a-days you can't smile up in your video 
I'm livin' off sour milk and cold cereal 
My moms stated that life is what you make it 
Hold everyday sacred I'm filled with such hatred 
'Cause a lot of niggas in the east don't represent 
And out west I saw a few that was fraudulent 
Hesitant to give a man a pound and step 
'Cause when your songs don't bump 
They look through that ass like fish net 
With no respect how could you look up in the mirror 
The world is lookin' shady and the futures no clearer

Who can make it happen right so make it happen for yourself 
Instead of stressin' everything the next man got 
And trying to blow up the next mans' spot 
And always actin' like you got a whole lot 
When the fact is you're trying to be something you're not 
Yo if you don't cut it out you're gone be forgot 
'Cause the madness got to stop 
See life is kinda stressful, especially when you tryna be sucessful
So many twist and turns it's like you walkin' on a pretzel 
Yet and still I swear to build by any means

Living their whole entire lives in 3D. 
You are who you are 
so be what you've got to be. (that's right) 
Stop the pretending like money is never ending. 
It's mind bending 
the way these kids keep spending. 
Yet have no cash to flash, no ends to spend. 
And when you do have loot 
it's probably barrowed from your friends. (tell 'em) 
You know the type because you've seen them in the past. 
Livin' life fast but it's really just gas. 
Yo 
This goes out (no money no love)

Say that your heart will go on
Without breaking

You open your eyes
And you see life waiting for you
To reach out your hand
Just give love a chance
And prove that you know 
You shouldn't waste the time you have

You'll find everything worthwhile
You just gotta say what's on your mind
You'll see wonders happen before you're out the door

[Chorus]

C'mon, tell me
There's no time for thinking
Gotta show me what you're feeling
That's the way to do it
Love will come around; love just comes around
You gotta show me what you're feeling
That's the way to do it

You'll find everything worthwhile
You just gotta say what's on your mind
You'll see wonders happen before you're out the door

Don't wanna be somewhere where I just don't belong

He watched the light shine down on the broken glass and thought
I don't got no reasons, yet
There it is and there it was

We kept this hat of broken dreams
And we pulled them out, when we needed them around

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now
And please give me direction, I think the hurt set in
I just caved in
And I don't feel nothing

There's a squeak hinge down on the back gate
It lets us know if he comes around
I don't sleep that good anyway
If you've never heard the silence, it's a God awful sound

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now
And please give me direction, I think the hurt set in
And I don't feel nothing

I don't feel nothing, no I don't feel nothing
There's nothing to feel good about here

Don't much get down to the avenue
I could drive, but it takes so much to get there
Don't get off on all the broken glass,
The Cadillac scene, well

In an over emotional way

And she only sleeps when it's raining 
And she screams and her voice is straining 

She says baby 
It's 3 am I must be lonely 
When she says baby 
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes 
Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to 
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days 
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway 
But outside it's stopped raining 

She says baby 
It's 3 am I must be lonely 
When she says baby 
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes 
Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

Da Duo Di Flippo de Santo,"You were my adored one
Then you became the bored one
I was like a toy
That brought you joy one day
A broken toy
That you preferred to throw away

If I expected love
When we first kissed
Blame it on my youth
If only just for you I did exist
Blame it on my youth
I believed in everything
Like a child of three
You meant more than anything
All the world to me

If you were on my mind
All night and day
Blame it on my youth
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray
Blame it on my youth
If I cried a little bit
When first I learned the truth
Don't blame it on the stars
Don't blame it on your smile
Don't blame it on my eyes

Da Duo Di Flippo de Santo,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Show a nigga some love nigga 
On the eastside 
Show me love 
And all my niggas on the westside 
[Mr. Serv-On] 
It's four in the morning, mamma got tears in her face 
Love from my tombstone try to relocate 
But in my tank lord I got faith 
Five hundred dollars or so for my block 
Lord knows I couldn't stop 
That's a long way from bad credit cards and selling rocks 
For the love I've got and in return I'm putting it down 
Chi town, on my gd's, on six and thirty hos 
And my vl's on the westside 
I ride with jack time ballers 
Drink alazay (?) and hennessee with Jakeville shot callers 
I'm gettin love from niggas on Breakstreet 
And Watts, and Cappanella park and LA 
The thirties in the Bay, brown love for my esses 
That's a long damn way from the parkway 
So when I'm home, see a nigga drop a nigga from above 
(Cmon, cmon) Show me love 
To all my niggas on the westside 
To all my niggas on the eastside 
To all my niggas on the northside 
To all my niggas on the southside 
To all my bangers on the westside 
To all my bangers on the eastside 
To all my bangers on the northside",Show Me Luv,2013
