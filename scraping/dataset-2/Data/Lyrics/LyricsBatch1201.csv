Tina Turner,"I think that you don´t care, 
And it´s more than I can bear, 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind, all in my mind.

I know that I´ve been true, 
But honey sweetie baby what about you? 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind.

We´ve been going steady so long, 
I´d never dream you would ever do me wrong, 
I knew I was yours and I thought you were mine, 
And that every little thing was so fine.

Whoa darling, I´d hate to see, 
Someone else with you other than me, 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind, all in my mind
Oh yes, it´s all in my mind.",All in My Mind [Take 4],2012
Tina Turner,"Why' know, every now and then 
I think you might like to hear something from us 
Nice and easy 
But there's just one thing 
You see we never ever do nothing 
Nice and easy 
We always do it nice and rough 
So we're gonna take the beginning of this song 
And do it easy 
Then we're gonna do the finish rough 
This is the way we do ""Proud Mary"" 

And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river 
Listen to the story 

I left a good job in the city 
Working for the man every night and day 
And I never lost one minute of sleeping 
Worrying 'bout the way things might have been 

Big wheel keep on turning 
Proud Mary keep on burning 
And we're rolling, rolling 
Rolling on the river 

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis 
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans 
But I never saw the good side of the city 
Till I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen 

Big wheel keep on turning 
Proud Mary keep on burning 
And we're rolling, rolling 
Rolling on the river 

If you come down to the river 
I bet you gonna find some people who live 
You don't have to worry if you got no money 
People on the river are happy to give",Proud Mary [Encore],2012

Tina Turner,"I tossed and turned all last night
I thought you weren't treating me right
I love you much too much
It's jealousy I guess

I tossed and turned all last night
I rolled and tumbled all last night
I dreamed someone was holding you tight
There ain't no use to lie, I?ll love you till I die
I tossed and turned all last night

I guess I'm jealous and can't help it
But I love you much too much
I asked the Lord to please help me
So I don't dream of such

I guess you think silly of me
But I'm living down in misery
There ain't no use to lie, I'm tore up in my lie
I tossed and turned all last night

I guess I'm jealous and can't help it
But I love you much too much
I ask the Lord to please help me
So I don't dream of such

But I guess you think silly of me
But I'm living down in misery
There ain't no use to lie, I'm tore up in my lie
I tossed and turned all last night

Oh baby, now you know, you know I'm jealous of you
So why don't you, why don't you come on and treat me right
You know I love you daddy, show me that you love me too",I'm Jealous,2013

A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain

It's all in the game of?

Love is
Whatever you make it to be
Sunshine
Instead of this cold lonely sea
So please baby
Try and use me for what I'm good for

I can't sleep at night. I cat nap through the day, can't go on much longer babe, I can't live this way.

Chorus: You know I'm crazy bout you baby and I wonder do you ever think of me. You know I'm wild about you baby, and you don't care, nothin in the world for me.

You know it ain't but one thing baby, sittin next to your favorite drink, but to hear you say you don't love me, then I begin to think, cause now you know I'm so crazy bout you baby...repeat chorus.

Tinchy Stryder,"Excuse me, girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing
But I just noticed some tan lines on your shirt

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked onto my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

(Whoa! Leave it out)
Are you smoking crack or something?
Mike, just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me, look, I'm alright, don't touch me

For a while there I was thinking, yeah, but, what if?
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you, too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I'll continue
I didn't want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in good, I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not want to give the satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

And just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smiling hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oh, what do I give a fuck? I've got a girlfriend anyway
We're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play
I got this Stella I bummed from that last cafe
This night's not even begun, yes, yes, oh yay
I did fancy you a bit, though, yeah, I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

You're fit but you know it
But you know it

Tinchy Stryder,"Yo, you gotta feel this, 
Yeah, you gotta feel this.

Hey yo it's that mad,
Lifestyle emotional it's that sad,
I missed my mum's birthday, had a show, that bad.
Ups and downs, mis-haps, problems mount, that large,
Street clowns and hood rats are speaking out that they're loud,
I'm focused, music,
In and out I'm breathing it,
Close ones they miss me, 
They're really not feeling it,
I ain't seen my girl for days,
Ain't seen my bed for days,
Something keeps me going I'm enjoying every bit of it,
Every little bit of it.
You gotta feel this, Wiley said Tinch you gotta kill this, 
And that was '03 and now I've got this,
Straight up original, I ain't dealing with no remix,
Had it all planned out and the man dem was a part of it,
Music game's fucked up; it's nutin'like we thought of it, 
Messed up it's all a bit, mad I'm trying to work with it.

[Chorus: x2]
Here I come I'm Landing, I'm landing,
But there's no one around me where I'm standing,
I'm nearly there I'm counting, counting,
Step by step we climb mountains,

And they're telling me I'm better off,
Telling me I'm doing well,
Look into the eyes and I clearly see I've pissed them off (snakes).
Talk about me so hard, like have you seen Stryder's new car, 
No keys, pushes one button then he's off star, 
Off guard, not me I'll be walking on the moon tonight,
Not scarred but who's to know how deep I really bleed inside,
Yeah, but I'm a Virgo not a Gemini,
I can see the future and I'm done with these silly guys,
No time for many games, 
Lava mouth, spitting flames,
Now things have fully changed - I'm trying to get the plagues in frames,
But they won't let me do my thing,
Stop trying to block up my road up, I can switch my lanes,
In my face they're smiling up,
Behind my back they're lining up,
The day I dig myself a hole, push me down deep enough,
My head's telling me mad things, like pick it up, let it off,
I go with my heart and my bag's packed,
I'm jetting off.

[Chorus: x2]

So I ask, why?
I ain't gettin' no answers,
Again I ask why,
Still ain't gettin' the answer, 
I'm taking my chances,

Trading the world for money, stars, and power, living my life at 100 miles an hour.

Tired of being in the back now we're center
We're chosen but they're telling us we're selling out
All we wanna do is open doors man hear me out
Were frozen cause they left us in the cold
Only right I took my chance now I'm bringing it home

Today is a brand new day,
Clock my wrist, check the time,

They left me here but still I keep on chasing
That's why I let em' know its a warning.",Warning,2009
Tinchy Stryder,"Cloud nine, 'Munk, 
We're wishing them the best,
We're wishing them the best,

This is catch two-two, I'm age two-two, 
Spent like two-two on a black out coupe, 
Wanna know how I'm looking lately, 
Don't stare through limousine tints that's rude, 
I break necks I'm a real head turner, 
And back then I was a first time learner, 
I skipped classes, straight to the masters, 
Now look I'm a skyline earner, 
Cash in hand no finance

When we cash in grands it's violent, 
Chipmunk co-pilots the airlines, 
So flee we land on next islands, 
I topped the bill, we can't relate 
'cause you earn the bill, $100, 
There's chrome on the grills, 
No less than 19's on the wheels, 
Back to the music wheel this, 
I flow crazy, mental illness, brainless, 
But I'm amazing grace so thy shall feel this, 
I'm raising the bar, your waistline, 
I liaise with stars on cloud nine, 
Wings on my back, skydive, 
It's over, wrap, night time.

Trust, no stress we're calm, 
We're shooting far, we got dem trust, 
We glow in the dark, 
We're some superstars, 
We got dem, Trust, no stress we're calm, 
We're shooting far, we got dem trust, 
We glow in the dark, 
We're some superstars

They wanna know, How we sounding lately, 
Tell me how we're sounding lately, 
We're down, we're moving, 
So we keep it moving, 
How we sounding lately, 
Tell me how we're sounding lately, 
The grams, we're moving, 
Flee, keep it moving,

I'm the cream of the crop, 
Flee but I ain't all over the dog, 
My collar I pop, I'm heavy I pop, 
I'm heavy on grime, I'm heavy on rock, (anything) 
And the garments speak for themselves, 
Your outfit cost the same as my belt

Five bills, 
So don't question me about wealth, 
You get a pair I get the shelf, 
And that was before the deal, 
Assassinate versus born to kill, 
Colder tham Neptune's, so Pharall, 
I mean for real, you know the deal, 
You know the drill

Yeah G, I nail it, I talk money, more so, I make it, 
And Tinchy don't boast too much, 
But his stack is not what his name is, 
'Munk, it's not what my name is, 
I've got money coming out of my anus, 
I set trends, don't follow what the craze is, 
If they're hood rich we're Vegas, 
Lifestyles for the rich and famous, 
Face on the front page papers, 
A-list, they trail by acres, 
Trust, no stress we're calm

We're shooting far, we got dem trust, 
We glow in the dark, 
We're some superstars, we got dem, trust, 
No stress we're calm,

Wont see me wanna roll like I ain't famous
Yeah my chain got popped outside Faces
Pricks must of seen that bling in the pendant
Next day I got it back cause I know majors
Back to my music, back to my papers
Back to the paparazzi stuffing our faces
Back to my boy whose discussing my wages
One by one I'm wrapping mine like razors

Won't rest till all my nigga's rocket ballin',
I don't even think I stopped this morning,
I'm that nigga that usually gets them 'what's them called's in,
I'm called when it's time to get the shopping sorted,
Oh this Armani blazer, which I got imported,
Yeah I like that whip, 
'Cause I'm on them grams only reason why I ain't dropped that forty,
All chicks see my on the street stop and call me,
Want me to get my willy out so they can toss it for me,
Got them going topless for me,
When she groped it for me,
Really got me horny,
Record label, contract my lawyers got them it me,
Dotted all the I's and the T's can you cross them for me?
You can try and put your crosses on me,
I watch hate, I got shooters that are watching for me.

I'm heavy, I'm colder,
Better me know, sir,
I can tear apart mc's 
But I'd rather read a book on childcare by Keri Katona,
No nice, 'cause I've run out of it,
Dumb it down a bit,
Ain't something I'm prepared to do,
Well I ain't never gonna run out of lip,
So here's something I prepared for you.
I tried to relax, but being spaced it inspires me back,
When will I be nice, to Katie Price,
The day I see a cage fighter in drag, ah,
I don't wanna tell my rhyme without friction,
Jump in to beat, both feet first,
Make pros eat their words,
And sit and watch 'em swallow their own dick-tion

Uh, Ishi distort that bass,
Man grew up on a raw estate,
Now, every time I draw my dates,
They're like 'how the fuck d'you afford this place?',
First place, first place, first place,
Try and act up and I'ma address that, call it, 
But I fuck up the man in the place,
Champagne, for goodness sake,
I ain't got a queue 'cause they know my face,
Glance at my watch tryin' to wind up on me,
I was like I ain't got time to waste,
Get it,
I ain't got time to waste
Get it,
Try and get hype in my face,
Regret it,
Got a big clipboard 
And I don't remember the last ?

Let me grieve for the beat before I murder it,
Don't know my name by now? 
You shoulda heard of it,
Why? 'cause I'm murdering,
Anybody lurking in, close proximity, circling,
Don't make an example of men when I stride in,
Dev's has got a tiny temper,
I'm observing this, learning,
But know I'm just yearning to burn it,
I'll fight your agenda,
Lock me up, might high risk offender
Make a man turn on his own team, like an Irish defender,
I'm a rhyming inventor 
That's climbing to heights ya' not meant ta',
The game's over, so roll over,
I'm sober, but I'll still kidnap a so called soldier,
In a boat I'll row into dover, 
Yeah it's over, the game's over.

Put up ya' lighters, I clash the Titans,
Fight the fighters, might fight the biters,
Spit on my flow, got tonsillitis,
That's on a Monday mornin', ha
Takin' over, run straight past ya'
No warning that I rule disaster,

This is my side of the story, here me out.
It's like my pen has emotions, 
I wanna pull my anger to motion.
Tears start coming out, ? this paper 
When I cry me a river ?
There's a whole lifetime ahead of us,
Patience, keyword, trust, we ain't got a rush.
Happy I'm ?, but for I'm in ?
Don't lose your lost, try me it's forever love.
Know what it feels like, when your friends so light
Thought you were ?, you're in the same blood type.
Told it, tomorrow ain't far, hold tight.
Then it told me feels like a lifetime.

Please don't let go, don't let go, you're in ? now.
It's moments away, it's that close, it's that close.
Just hold on till tomorrow, price is high, 
I don't got time to borrow.
But it feels like I'll make it through the sorrow.
But I ? 'bout tomorrow, tomorrow.

Don't be afraid, 
Wipe the sleep from your eyes, gotta stay awake.
It's, only a day away, 
At the same time it's like a year ? away.
It's another maze, would they have it anyway, it's another case.
Face it, another page, price you gotta pay, pay. 
Done the first few, now it's another stage.

This is my side of the story, 
This is my blood, sweat, tears and glory.
? them blood and it really gets ? no lie ?.
Deal with the pressure, comes with the pain, 
So cruel, friends won't look at me the same.
It's a clown with a smile like it doesn't mean a thing, 
But my heart burns with pain.
Tomorrow is the day, so I'm counting
Down the hours until the plain's landing.
I'll follow that lane,

We go for pain and try to shine in the perfect the moment
We let it burn inside knowing the path is golden
See the strain in our eyes, we're gonna do our best
You and me will give it all until nothing is left
We're gonna catch the light and stay alive and feel the love coming from the flame

Standing so strong
Chase my path with all the clues gone,
Success and I is like a true one
Dropping it out
Or pulling this offload

Swinging the arrow
We push it forth
Winning's the key

Fighting till it's over, yeah

Will be all equal

Look into these eyes now
Look into these eyes

It still makes you cry
You can't kill this love no,
You can't kill this love

You feel the rush in your arm
You see shadows form
You move forward slowly
To find nothing at all

In a hall of mirrors
You get sick of yourself
Think you can just leave the blade there
Sit and wait...

Climbs on out of the ground
Back into our bed

In that dress growing ever tighter
It was saddening the lengths she had gone to
To appear more attractive
In the process losing something
We never knew but still missed
You knew you were lost as soon as you saw her
You saw your life as a series of complicated dance steps
Impossible to learn, they had to come naturally
Together you squirmed and wriggled
And I could only jerk along behind

[Chorus]
They're going to hurt you
They always will

She is now with me, inside of you
And I could only stare wide-eyed
As everything closed in around the three of us
Things you never saw, talking of the power and rescue
That were rushing through our body
And it's good

Before he knew, pushed, falling down curved stairs

Moving in, kicking, stamping
Bland expressionless faces
A handful of marbles thrown in a dustbin
Memories, memories

[Chorus]

In a northern town there were amazing rows of standing stones arranged on the southern slope
They got out in the last few seconds of consciousness
Look for their inscriptions one day, the most distant ocean plains, those who make the desert island
I saw you in a tin bath in red water
Were the ones who went to Washington to do their laundry
They wanted to see the mysterious hurricane
I never believed in New York, or where you intended to stand
But we don't actually want to see the shipwrecked
I just had to go
They came",Marbles,1993
Tindersticks,"Was there once something so pure
That left me whole and precious?

Why this new ingredient?
Everything I crave I become
Everything I left forgotten
Everything I love I become
'Cause that's what happens when you reach the bottom

Where does the blood go?
It runs away from broken lives
Where does the blood go?
It runs away from broken lives

There's an ugly crowd here beside me
They specialize in violations
Once they numbered only a handful
Grew out of the ashes of what we had good
There'll be another awkward scene tonight
As we choose to ignore the obvious
Quickly averting our eyes
When we see what there is left of

[Chorus]

Our love hangs here beside us
From its feet, twitching, desperate
The juice that splashes our white boots
Now they're matted and confused
There'll be another ugly scene tonight
As we refuse to accept the obvious
We panic and jump up and down
Trying to suck those last breaths

There's no finding
You hide these things so well
There's no finding, no finding

And the pink runs into the blue
There are no edges
How do I know where you are tonight?
Need these paper cuts

Need those gravel grinds
Need those pinches to wake me
Give up the drugs
Take the power I offer

Oh the deeper I go
The further I fall
The more I know
The tighter your grip around me

So easily broken
Running down your skin
And the pink runs into the blue
If there's ever anyone else, I'll understand

And kill them
And I'll overflow your every inlet
You will not cough and spit
You'll welcome me in

And I tell you with my tongue between your toes
If there's ever anyone else
Don't let them do this
And I'll laugh and revel

As you scratch and crawl

So endearing

What we got here is a lazy love
It mooches around the house
Can't wait to go out
What it needs it just grabs
It never asks

We sit and listen to our hearts crumble

--------------------------------------------

She sang for me, her heart on her tongue
She sang so pretty
She danced for me, her heart on her hips
She danced so fine
She said ""oh, a sweet sweet man like you,
What can I do for you? ""
I said ""a sweet sweet man like me
I can only bring you misery""
I lay awake that night, listening to her breathing
Thinking how strange it would be
If I awoke and she wasn't there
I could feel myself, feel myself changing
No longer me, I was only a part of her
I said ""a sweet sweet man like me
I can only bring you misery""

So they put me down, back where I started from
But where I started seems so high
I start to climb

Climb in beside you (A part of a hole)
Watch the clock for half an hour (An orange and its peel)

There's steam on the windows (A star in a night sky)
And I put myself there all the time (A gentle beauty)

Fall over on my words

To see the rain still coming down)
That peace when the door slams

Soon shattered ?

Tindersticks,"Do you remember my sister? 
How many mistakes did she make with those never blinking eyes? 
I couldn't work it out. 
I swear she could read your mind, 
Your life, the depths of your soul at one glance. 
Maybe she was stripping herself 
Away, saying 

Here I am, this is me 
I am yours and everything about me, everything you see,
If only you look hard enough 
I never could. 

Our life was a pillow-fight. 
We'd stand there on the quilt, 
Our hands clenched ready. 
Her with her milky teeth, 
So late for her age, 
And a Stanley knife in her hand. 
She sliced the tires on my bike and I couldn't forgive her.

She went blind at the age of five. 
We'd stand at the bedroom window and she'd 
Get me to tell her what I saw. 
I'd describe the houses opposite, the little 
Patch of grass next to the path, 
The gate with its rotten hinges forever wedged 
Open that Dad was always going to fix. 
She'd stand there quiet for a moment. 
I thought she was trying to develop the images in her own head. 
Then she'd say

I can see little twinkly stars, 
Like Christmas tree lights in faraway windows. 
Rings of brightly colored rocks 
Floating around orange and mustard planets. 
I can see huge tiger striped fishes 
Chasing tiny blue and yellow dashes, 
All tails and fins and bubbles. 
I'd look at the gray house opposite, and close the curtains. 
She burned down the house when she was ten. 
I was away camping with the scouts. 
The fireman said she'd been smoking in bed
The old story, I thought. 
The cat and our mum died in the flames, 
So Dad took us to stay with our Aunt in the country. 
He went back to London to find us a new house. 
We never saw him again. 

On her thirteenth birthday she fell down the well in our 
Aunt's garden and broke her head. 
She'd been drinking heavily. 
On her recovery her sight 
Returned, a fluke of nature everyone said. 
That's when she said she'd never blink again. 
I would tell her when she started at me, 
With her eyes wide and watery, 
That they reminded me of the well she fell into. 
She liked this, it made her laugh. 

She moved in with a gym teacher when she was fifteen, 
All muscles he was. 
He lost his job when it all came out, 
And couldn't get another one. 
Not in that kind of small town. 
Everybody knew everyone else's business. 
My sister would hold her head high, though. 
She said she was in love. 
They were together for five years until one day he lost his temper. 
He hit over the back of the neck with his bullworker. 
She lost the use of the right side of her body. 
He got three years and was out in fifteen months. 
We saw him a while later, 
He was coaching a non-league football team in a Cornwall seaside town. 
I don't think he recognized her. 
My sister had put on a lot of weight from being in a chair all the time. 
She'd get me to stick pins 
And stub out cigarettes in her right 
Hand. She'd laugh like mad 
Because it didn't hurt. 
Her left hand was pretty 
Good though. We'd have arm wrestling matches, 
I'd have to use both arms and 
She'd still beat me. 

We buried her when she was 32. 
Me and my Aunt, the vicar, and the man who dug the hole. 
She said she didn't want to be cremated 
And wanted a cheap coffin so the worms could get to her quickly. 
She said she liked the idea of it, 
Though I thought it was because of what happened to the cat, and our mum.",My Sister,1995

Tindersticks,"The first time we flew it
It was ? and cramped

The vodka running out half-way across the Atlantic
Even the steward screamed and joined in it

We didn't think we were going to make it
Now we're stretched out in wide, furry seats
Flicking through menus

A walk to the bar and there's as much screw-top champagne as we can drink
We're so easy

Taking turns having our photos taken
Sitting in front of smoked windows

Decanters of cheap whiskey in our hands
Drive into Manhattan on a date with a starlet who's just talent
That's what people pay the money to see

Who are we to argue? 

Five hours now it's been going on
And still we're watching all of it

Can you really believe all this? 
Can he really lie in bed at night and marvel at his own genius? 

When do you lose the ability to step back
And get a sense of your own ridiculousness? 
They're only songs
Midnight, and it's all over

Now it can really make us laugh
We're standing on our heads drinking sours of crystal schnapps
Now we're unable to step back or step forward

Swallowing a swallow
Tasting it again, it's not so unpleasant

Perhaps it's an acquired taste
The first time, it makes you sick
Then, bit by bit, it becomes delicious

Showbiz people
Always there to be interested in what you say

We are artists; we are sensitive and important
We nod our heads earnestly

Already half-way down the champagne
On our way to leaving the place dry
A $2,000 bar bill

Showbiz picks up the tab
And we're on our way laughing
Laughing at what? 
Los Angeles, eight days in
And our sense of irony's running pretty thin

All the friends we've made
Piano interlude not transcribed this time, sorry, just improvise
It's 2 am, it's closing time at the dresden

Marty and Layton play one last sleepy strangers in the night

And the last of the martinis dribble down our chins

We're sitting, chasing the conservation around the table

Jesus, how long have I been in this state? 

The limousine's still waiting outside

Anything you want to do? 

Anywhere you want to go? 

We're on our way to the airport and a plane to Vegas
So many nights lying in bed shaking
Dreaming of pushing my daughter around the supermarket
The joy of seeing all those colors and shapes reflect in her wide eyes
My head leaning on the window
And we're driving through the empty l.a. streets
And everything seems silent and beautiful

A guy's face hits the floor
Police revolvers glistening in the streetlight
Onto Melrose and lurching through a sea of Halloween transvestites
The flight's canceled, but it doesn't matter
We turn this corner to a way that takes us wherever
Up to sunset
We creep up the drive to the shattuck
The suite belushi died in

Or the one Morrison hung out the window
Oh, I'll go for jim's
I would fancy a hotel window-hanging, myself, tonight, man

Straight over to the mini-bar
Open the champagne -- one sip and it's left to wake up to

Anyone hungry? 
A team of uniformed waiters lay out an elaborate table for all us to ignore
Oh, the irony

How we're used to living
Back in london on a cold Friday night
Do you want another drink? 

Well, I could try
Perhaps we could make it to the atlantic
600 yeards, twenty minutes later
We're pushing through the waiting crowd, all fish eyes

An exclusive door policy

Exclusively for arseholes
And tonight? well, a nod of our heads, and we're inside
Falling down the red, velvety stairs
Limbs flaying, hands searching for something to steady
Pick ourselves up, nothing broken
Just aches in the morning

No one seems to notice
I find a table, champagne arrives

I've been so drunk, I sit and look at you
We try and talk for the first time in a long time

Drunken confession
You shiver, it made you feel sick
We use the rent money to pay the bill
Bumping shoulders, we stumble out into Soho
Slipping over the sleeping bags
Shouting for taxis",Ballad of Tindersticks,1997
Tindersticks,"There's a city filth that lingers 

All over my naked hands
Deep into the weave of the clothes I wear

Till I'm on the other side leaning on your door
Are the taps running, darling?
Is the air thick with steam?
Can I find some place to cry these tears of shame?

Every step brings another

Till I'm on the other side leaning on your door

Could always find my way home

Tindersticks,"Harry was a contented dog. but he awoke this morning and something was very wrong. he couldn't be bothered to beg for mid-morning biscuits. he couldn't be bothered to roll over and rub his back
E rough floor. he couldn't be bothered to scratch at anything that might be nibbling away at him. he just lay on top of his kennel feeling thoroughly depressed. even his tail wouldn't wag.
Four months earlier, his owner (an elderly gentlemen whom harry had been devoted to ever since he was a puppy) had been temporarily forced to leave the country, leaving harry with a trustworthy, caring couple who lived around the corner. things hadn't been so bad at first: long walks, hearty dinners; even his kennel was in the same spot in their yard -- just to the right of the back door.

This is the same kennel that harry had now been moping on top of for three days. despite the best efforts of the young, caring couple to cheer him up -- offers of chicken and an endless stream of un-fetched balls sent rolling down the yard -- nothing could coax harry from his gloom. so, it was decided to send him to the vet.

Harry was a large dog and heavy-withered, and he was in no mood to climb down from his kennel and trot to the waiting car to travel two miles to the surgery. eventually, he was lifted, with the aid of a neighbor, onto a blanket and hobbled from kennel to car; from the car to the vet's. when, once, harry would have put up a fight before going within 500 yards of this place, during the whole journey, he never raised an eyebrow. of course, the vet could find nothing wrong with harry; mentioned depression; suggested chicken and balls; sent harry home to rest, still wrapped in the blanket. took seven days for the notification to come through. the owner had died in his sleep, leaving specific instructions for harry to be put down. harry was a dead dog.

You cast away and rain upon your forehead
Where the mist's for hire
If it's just too clear
Let's spend our last
Quarter stance randomly
Go down to the outlet once again
Painted portrait of minions and slaves
Crotch mavens and one night plays
Are they the only ones who laugh
At the jokes when they are so bad?
And the jokes are always bad
But they're not as bad as this

Have gone away to this

Tindersticks,"She fell in love with my singing
She knew the bells started ringing
She thought there was only her there
But, me, I just live for the clapping
A hand delivery of an invite to my premiere
When he fell in love, I was acting
I sent her flowers, asked her to marry me
But all I heard was their clapping
Now she cries with a cigarrette at the window
He croons and moans like he's hurting
She cries so well
He croons and moans, just croons and moans
Now, I never thought [i had no idea] she needed direction
And he was at the mercy of his writers
For the songs I needed [for me] to touch her
Those sad, sad songs to make me happy
Now she cries with a cigarrette at the window
He croons and moans like he's hurting
She cries so well
He croons and moans, just croons and moans
We re-enact the love scenes from her/my movies
But I never thought, but she uses a stand-in
His voice is croakier every day now
And she cries so well

Cobbled together
In odd shape and size

Try to call you, but I don't call too loud, no
Try to love, and never look that hard

Tindersticks,"A man can walk proudly,
Down in the street.
A man's not ashamed of what he believes.

He knows how to laugh,
He knows when to cry.
He knows how to live.
He's not afraid to die.

What is a man,
What is a man?

A man searches,
For the key to success.
He'd rather be sure,
Than take a wild guess.

He knows how to love,
He knows how to hate.
He knows when to move.
He knows just when to wait.

What is a man,
What is a man?

A man can be angry,
And still hold his tongue
A man don't give up
Till the battle is won.

He knows how to win,
He's not ashamed to lose.
He knows it's best to leave,
And he doesn't take long to choose.

What is a man,
What is a man?
Just what is a man?",What Is a Man,2000
Tindersticks,"Finding love
Now seems like the easy part
Just turn round the corner
You standing there

I felt the wind
Was pushing behind us there
It's taking us someplace
That, darling, we've never been

Don't you feel the wind?
It's pushing us further now
Are we just gonna let it blow?
And hold on, don't you fall
'Cause there's such a way to go
We've touched it now, don't let it go

Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?
Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?

Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?
Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?

Don't you feel the wind
It's pushing us further now
Are we just gonna let it blow?
And you stand, don't you fall
'Cause there's such a way to go
We've touched it now we've touched it, don't let it go

But you see my love
When everything's pushing now
Everything's moving now
And I don't know where to go
We've touched it now, let it show, let it show

Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?
Can our love, can our love
Grow any further?

Can our love, can our love?
I feel in my heart I can't wait any longer
Can our love, can our love
Can our love, can our love grow any further?

Sometimes we see that our love can change
And I don't know why
But it's not enough to change our hearts

But I can still remember those feelings
Of being left alone with myself
Sitting in the garden
Watching our house burn
Knowing I couldn't help it
It always had to end in a big statement like that
We were always so intense
Out of control
We never understood what we had
Never knew how to deal with it
Always tearing at each other
The violence and the shame
Banging my head against the wall
Wanting to explode

And it was my idea
And I put you there
I lied and said I didn't want you
You were running to someone else
Breaking the spell
Being able to see me for what I really was
And then the flames

Wanted you
Make me feel like no man in the world wanted you
Still feel the flame
Still feel the cold
Still feel the flame
Gets so cold around the stove
They still reach for me
Where you gonna go now
They still reach for me
Where you gonna go now

Made you feel like no man in the world wanted you
Made me feel like no woman in the world wanted me

Some days it seems I've left those feelings so far behind
Still feel the cold
But they're always there, waiting

Still feel the flame
Tempting, trying to release you
It's so cold around the stove
Don't believe, don't cherish your pretence
They still reach for me
You strike a match
Where you gonna go now

I may pour a little just to see the light shining through

You're the only one
That could ever tease me

Diffuse me still
Getting closer to you

Only sure
Sing your love
To the stars
They're the guiding
Me back to you

All the love inside me
Feels your breath
Upon my back hand

Here's your song
Would cause me home
If I could tell you
Of all the things I've seen

All the love
All the love inside them
At lack to wait
For its own protection
For so long
Became just a memory

And all the love
All the love inside them
Twisted into hate
They have no choice to
Pass on the fear
Pass on the pain

Pouring down into the child
Into the man
Into the world
Glued to love
The gun that's in his hand

All the love inside me
Fell like the drought
In a petty ocean

Had to stop
Looked at my hands
And my fingertips
Trembling at the thought
Of touching you

Their lungs have come feel the sun

Their lips they twitch with the chills in their dreams

Why don't you come out
And exact your revenge?
And the liars and wasters
That call themselves friends

So come feel the sun, touch your fears

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold

I'm fucking crazy with the kicks, call me Jean Claude

I am about to be a bigger star than my mum thought
'Cause every day I got a groupie at my front door
Now I drive past the bus I used to run for
Where's my fucking clap, wheres my encore?

I walk alone 'cause I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I never ever call her phone
I leave her in the club, I never ever walk her home
Dee you're the fuckin' foundation, I'm the cornerstone

I'm born famous, I'm sorta known
And if your son doesn't I bet your daughter know

Ah, love suicide is killing me,
You’re getting into my head like a guillotine,
You’ve got me grasping for air in your
And now you’re saying some things
That you don’t really mean, that’s really mean,
How the hell I’m cut up between?
I forgot, trying not to intervene,
Putting up a fight like it ain’t a thing to me!
I swear it’s gotta be the worst position to be in, be in,
I guess you thought like you’ve been ignored,
And the ? turning to a jigsaw,
Cause when you’re down you gotta let
And we just can’t seem to find time to sit and talk,
I know she is in shock!
Ah, what happens when the hourglass of love runs out?
Under one roof and one house,
And everything becomes so cold,
Baby, that’s the only thing I wanna know!

Tell me the reason why
You commit a love suicide
I think you want our love to die
You did it on purpose
I'm all out of tears
Tell me get outta here
You made it very clear

You did it on purpose

Our love suicide

I feel like I’m about to break down,
Why you’re acting like kid up on the playground?
If you gonna sat on your mind, why don’t you let it out?
So the end of us is coming any day now, any day!
I thought we’d never separate,
I could be the.. but no defeated on the…
You know is probably for the best, anyway,
Cause my suspicions now…

Does it make your day to see me drown?

But soon you will see!

I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)
Til I'm gone (gone)

I buy time in switzerland
I drive round in monaco
I shook hands with royalty
I make songs that monarchs know

Mi mi mi ra do?
Call me aloe blacc 'cause I need that dollar yo

Blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up
Now I'm ballin' like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of nip tuck
And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up

Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum
Every time that I climb a stalk
Yeah, yeah, I'm honest I landed in a rocket
With a crown inside my watch and silver peace sign on my bonnet
You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest
Ip dip do muthafucker you are not it

Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow

OK I'm in it, I'm in it to the finish
I keep them bottles coming like my card ain't got no limit

And some friends that playing cricket

I said I'm in it, I'm in it til the finish

Money in the jeans, car key in the cardigan

No my friends they don't like it, they don't like it
Somebody remind me
When's the right time, when's the right time to let go

Uh, dear who ever the fuck is listening,
Tell me of the pleasures of being a normal citizen
'Cause all these fittins' and Vivians keeping me from fittin' in
Why do I feel safer on stage than in my own living room
My grandma say that if I leave my drink I shouldn't sip again
Ooh this tour has got me feeling tired like I'm itchin'
And uh even though it's physical differences and my siblings
That's why I feel so down even at the top of the Wimbledon

[Chorus]

Uh, dear whoever the fuck is witnessing
Disturbing London independent black businessmen
Based on the work and the effort I'm gonna give this year
Everybody's getting the presents they want for Christmas, yeah
Life is only ninety nine winters
So I'm tryna bond with daddy even though I don't like dinners
Don't be confused by my image, I'm no fuckin' public pin-up
But my heart won't let me say no to a picture

[Chorus]

Uh, dear whoever the fuck is, fuck it, 
This is discovery hate it or love it
I'm now officially the property of the public since licensing my album
And signing a deal to be published
But none of these songs are written for me, nor am I a puppet
Journalists come for interviews but don't stay on the subject

Yeah, no, yeah, are we done yet?
Questions you've asked me hundreds, now can you grant me some rest
Because I'm tired of it, I'm living out my dream, and I'm tired from it
If music needed saving, I'd die for it
Music's where my heart is, I'm alive for it
I promise

I'm never liked my heart might break
Here in the dark, yeah, we'll be saved
I don't care, no looking back
I've never been, never been, this far from home

I think my reflection is relatively jealous of me
That's all, twittering on my apple hoping I don't get hassled
Before I reach my goal lots of people had to be tackled
I don't jump on anybody's band wagon or saddle
I'm X-rated I'm adult-rate, this ain't the Disney channel
I'm hotter than a candle wick, I'm fire

Closer to everything I desire
'Cause I don't listen to doubt, doubt is a liar
Stop acting like a bitch, don't be Mrs. Doubtfire

Higher, higher, higher

I can hear your voice, I can feel your presence
You keep me confused, you keep me guessin'

It's an obsession, It's an obsession
This is like a curse this is like a blessin'

P.O.M me, her mill bringin' the medley
Hot MC over any, I'm cold, cold as February
Repress my oldest memories, I hoovered them with a Henry
Now they're gone, the no longer exist, you get me?
I'm standin' with a Remy and a bag full of twenties
Talkin' to somethin' sexy, I'ma hit it if she lets me

My daddy was present, but sometimes forgot my presents
Like when I was seven, uh

Helicopters revvin', posh wedding's
One well expensive watch, lots
Everyday, I'm on leggy blonds who put on wedding rings
But after one heavy drink I on anything
So while they make me feel so used for that sued for
Doors racin' through my mind like a new Porsche with the roof off
Every single time I rhyme, it's science 
I turn quiet into riot, listen to my silence

This is like a curse, this is like a blessin'
I can hear your voice, I can feel your presence
You keep me confused, you keep me guessin'

I said no to like six or seven labels
I used to sit next to Rachel in St. Pauls

The ones we love
The ones we've lost
There's some we frame
And there's the ones we crop

When all my favorite ones were trimmed by my ugly dog
But mum and daddy's wedding days are most lovely shot
I had a 1000 free minutes till they cut me off
Talking to this chick that used to love me, ah
She used to send me naughty pictures of her lovely
Now they are even bigger and they're bustier

Ha wow, I used to wonder at the stars a lot
Sitting in my dad's old barber shop
I used to pull faces when he passed the mop
Then he gave me his plate and his glass to wash
He made me wanna be the man in charge, the boss
That's how he got his first gray, but he laughed it off
The moments and memories we keep
will be forever stored in my micro SD

Back in the day when I was young
Those were the days
Wish that I could go back
I wanna take you back
To the very moment when you take a snap

Back in the day to little me
Reminiscing all, all the memories that
Make me happy and they make me sad
All the very moments when you take a snap

Second year of college on the fourth day
That's when I see you standing in the hallway
ah, Leonardo Da Vinci portrait
She had a face I could be looking at all day
Do your shades, small ways
God put a lot of body in a tall frame
I got all fazed, she was pure
I took up literature just to get to know her more

She said she lacked mature when she was immature
Shy girl, she could of worked on her image more
ah, she made me laugh till my ribs were sore
We were for better for worse, we were for rich for poor
I was tidying my room when my sister saw
And said T why've you still got her pictures for
These moments and memories we keep
Will be forever stored in my micro SD
Woo

Back in the day when I was young
Those were the days
Wish that I could go back

My uncle used to drink a can of kestrel when life got stressful, uh
What kinda person should you be when wanna make people accept you, uh
What does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful
When you were born to be special,

Uh yeah and I went from the kid in class
Text some radio DJs so they could bring me up
To the young rapper everybody's ringing up
Got em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust

Mad thoughts in my head when its blowin' up
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans, cement for sand
Raise your hand the Wonderman

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one they're calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, the Wonderman

Bored of being nameless
Bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall
And cant afford a pair of trainers
Imagine when it changes
Imagine satisfaction when you make it

Its more than being famous
More then the applause and more than any form of status
More than the performances in 20 foreign places
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises
Amen hallelujah 'Tinie look what's happened to ya?
Yeah they love that attitude brand new and improved, yeah

And when the fans start grabbing you
Show gratitude with a little brag or two
Amen, hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya

I saw the chosen one they're calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, the Wonderman

Come on come on follow your heart is gonna take you home
Come on come on the stars are where you belong

That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child

Man I'm like a young gun fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat

So down to earth

When we ate we never took because we needed a change
I needed a break

I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray

But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam'
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to turn a tenner to a hundred grand

I guess that she was tired of the same spiel
Now I’m in the meat packing dialling 911
Try’na tell ‘em how this pain feels
So run away, run along
Thought we were fate but we were wrong
We were wrong
‘cos when men lie their women cry but she won't
I can’t breathe, I won’t cope
I need a drink, I wanna smoke
‘cos I’m the cigarette butt of my own jokes
Hands held high and my back against the ropes
If blood is thicker than water, we were thicker than blood
Now I’m feeling for something I can’t touch
Feeling guilty whilst you be up in the club
Shit I been caught so who am I to judge
Try’na regain my composure
I guess this is the end of the road huh
And after 25 times of hearing
Please leave a message after the tone
I know

Girl I’ve been unfaithful baby don’t you say
It’s ok (Let it all out let the tears fall down)
Did some things behind you baby don’t you say
It’s ok(Any minute expecting for you to walk now)
Why don’t you cry now, why don’t you cry now?
'Cause then I know you still feel something for me
But I truly know its over when I hear you say
It’s ok

You put your nail on the coffin had a finger on the trigger
Said she ever going down she taking everything with her
Took something so good and made it redder than the colour
On the bottom of her slippers
And not a word from your mother yet
Even though I made you suffer like a suffragette
Fucking busy I was busy fucking round another woman
Undercover like a Brian Ferry album
So run away, run along
From the people and places where you belong
Just imagine the gossip in the salon
Make me feel dumb for fooling round with them blondes
But love heals all things gradually
This is something out a Shakespeare tragedy
And even though we ain’t happily ever after
I just hope you’re living after happily

Hello?

Somebody fill in the gaps, somebody fill in the dots
I feel like Cruella de Vil the way I be stealing the spot
When all the shutters is down, bitch we be still in the shop
I shop for clothes when it's closed, that's why I feel like the boss
In my vintage eBay watch, that's why I feel like the Hoff
Weren't gonna wait for no institute not to gimme a job
These critics giving me bollocks, that's why I give 'em my crotch
These paps are getting too nosey, that's why I give 'em my snot
'Cause I just tripled my cost of living: steak, salmon, lobster, chicken
That's made in my Boffi kitchen by Rosa Dacosta women
Come from disturbing London, the city of foster children
Grateful what God has given save us from constant sin
In the city of God, I'm from the city of God
Bitch, I've been up in the shard, I really been at the top
Separate the man from the man dem, find out who's real and who's not
Can't take the heat? Then get out the kitchen and gimme the pot
You know what?

Well I'm a lover not a fighter
So I kiss that girl and say goodbye now
'Cause I came for kicks not for arguments
No whoa oh oh
'Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Hello?

I used to sit on the settee eating a tin of spaghetti
Now women think that I'm sexy because I been on the telly
Car like double-oh-seven, them alloys spin in Pirellis
I'm with a gold digging heffa, I call her Miss Moneypenny
Well is it real? Is it fake? Somebody gimme a break
I grew up on minimum wage and I grew up in an estate
These rappers calling me bruv and they can't even relate
Are they even ready and willing do anything that it takes?
I saw my teacher from college, she says she thinks that I'm great
I'm gonna give her the D 'cause she never gimme an A
She's tryna get in my jeans, I'm tryna kick off my Js
Take off my D&Gs and give her my DNA, 'cause
All these bitches be loving me, sipping my bubbly
Watching Hangover hungover, be the quickest recovery
Couple bad grades, I did shit in my study leave
And now she wants my name and a kiss on them double D's
And I love it

I've got too much love to burn babe
Ain't got no time to exchange words babe
Things to do people to see
Yeah I guess we all gotta play the game

Well I'm a lover not a fighter
So I kiss that girl and say goodbye now

Acting like your biggest fan

Of all the things that they said
Saying never I will never be like that
But then you showed up
Like you have been there before
Was like you knew me
Had me with every word
You saw right through me
Melted me down to the core
I was done when you walked through that door

Well I don’t know how you do it to me
You make my brain just stop
Sink my heart to my feet

I kinda need you around

If it all falls down
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down

If I fell on my knees, lost everything that I own
Could I rely on you to come through when I called your phone
See plenty people left when they told me they'd stayed forever
That's why I'm not convinced when you tell me that we're together
You could be in my life 'cause I'm famous and on my feet
Would you like me if I was working at CVS up the street
With a nine to five every night and two baby's one month apart
Would I still have your support if I never sold on these charts
That's hypothetical, I love you like my edibles
You hate when I get high, but I'm just feelin' low inside
I've been paranoid, it's colder than North Dakota
Would they still think I'm hot if I drove in this blue Toyota?
I guess you're bottled up so I'm sipping slow while I'm steering
Can't fuck nobody new 'til I fuck with 'em for they spirit
I need someone who can hold me up until the end
If shit gets real heavy just help me through thick and thin

Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down
Would you love me, baby, if it all falls down?
If it all falls down

Plane ride, thinkin' 'bout the places I've been
I need a week away from life to fix the mess that I'm in
Pour up a shot and toss it out for all the people I've lost
I had some energies around me that I had to shake off
Good vibes mean everything to a boss
I went from Nike to Chanel and you don't know what that cost
I had to sacrifice a lot
It's real lonely at the top
How deep is our connection?
You good with imperfections
Would you speak if you blew up and you saw me in your section?
Are you here for the fame?
Are you here for the night?
I wanna buy in but you change every time
I know nothing is guaranteed
I contemplate when you tell me you'll never leave
It's just way outta control
I wanna settle down, but first I gotta know

To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

She could spit in the eyes of fools

It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman

Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

I'd be with him
The pain too intense to see any sense in living
God please forgive me for all of the outbreaks
But my ? is up at the pearly white gates
I weep and mourn his death
Every single day
Ain't gon' celebrate this life
Until I pass away
We had big plans and shared the same dreams
I blowin up in the game and staring up the main stream
I'm miss building with you
Just being around you

At least no evil surround you

Und die Erinnerung an dich

Bricht mein Herz
Und raubt mir die kraft
Es schlägt mich zu Boden
Ich fühle mich ohne macht
Muss realisieren
Du bist nicht mehr hier
Doch es fällt mir schwer
Das zu kapieren
Wir waren wie Brüder füreinander da
Wir waren wie eine Einheit
Bis zum letzten Tag
Du bist vorgegangen
Doch ich komm nach
Dann werden wir uns wiedersehen
Eines Tages
Eines Tages führen wir die Gespräche fort
Gehen gemeinsam neue Wege an 'nem anderen Ort

Solang ich lebe

Glaub mir bis ich gehe
Gehe und dich voller Hoffnung wiedersehe

Du sort joyeux, il faut comprendre l'appel charmeur

Chante...la lune rit dans la nuit brune,
Et le vent siffle sur la dune, l'ardent refrain des amoureux...

Ecoute ma voix,
écoute la nuit :

Le vent l'emporte
Près de la porte
Où sur le banc tu viens t'asseoir
La lune blanche
(V.F. Dans la nuit claire)
Vers toi se penche
(La lune éclaire)
Et met du ciel dans tes cheveux
(Chaque sentier d'un rayon blanc)
Mon coeur soupire
Et semble dire
C'est toi que j'aime et que je veux !
Dans la douceur du soir
Entends ma ritournelle !
J'irai bientôt te voir.
Eho ! Eho ! Entends mon chant d'espoir.

Mais nous descendrons
(V.F. Mais je descendrai)
un soir au village
Et d'autres bergers
te feront la cour
(V.F. te font les yeux doux)
Malgré leurs chansons
tu resteras sage
Il n'est qu'un refrain
pour parler d'amour

Mais, dès que tu me souris,
Je suis repris.

Fuir cet envoûtement ?

Enfin, tes lèvres m’appartiennent,
Tes yeux si doux me disent ton émoi.

Léna, ma sérénade
S’élève dans le soir.

Tino Rossi,"1.
Chéri vois-tu je t'aime,
Et dans tes bras je vis un rêve enchanté
Pourtant j'ai peur quand même
A la pensée que tu pourrais me quitter.
Sans savoir ce que sera demain,
Ma vie est entre tes mains.


R.
Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour,
Après toi mon cœur sera fermé pour toujours.
Ici bas rien ne m'attire
Que ton sourire
Ici bas rien ne m'émeut
Que tes grands yeux si bleus
Tout en moi t'appartient sans retour
Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour,

Offrir de la tendresse
Et des baisers qui sans amour ne sont rien
Goûter d'autres ivresses
Entre des bras qui ne seraient pas les tiens,
Dire encor des mots tendres tout bas,
Non je ne le pourrai pas.

Après toi je n'aurai plus d'amour,
Après toi mon cœur sera fermé pour toujours.

1.
Je suis né dans la cité
Qui enfante les usines,
Là ou les hommes turbinent
Toute un' vie sans s'arrêter,
Avec leurs haut's cheminées
Qui s'élancent vers le ciel
Comm'pour cracher leur fumée,
En des nuages artificiels.
Et dans le bruit des sirènes
Des hommes vont, des hommes viennent,
C'est la grand'ville qui surgit,
C'est la grand'ville qui surgit.

REFRAIN

Comm' c'est drôle
Ces gens qui marchent dans la rue,
Comm' c'est drôle
La vie perdue dans la cohue,
La sérénade des fauchés
Monte comme une mélopée
La sérénade des gens biens,
Et puis des ceuss' qui n'sont pas bien,
Et moi je les regarde viivre
Et j'trouv' ça drôle.
J'trouv' plus ça drôle.

2. Juste au bout de la cité
On ne voit plus les usines,
On ne voit que la fumée
Des bateaux et leurs machines
Il y a la gru' géante
Qui des quais jusqu'aux bateaux
Avec sa marche obsédante
S'amuse à cracher dans l'eau
On dirait un' drôl' de fête
Où se promène la tempête
Et le Bon Dieu qui est là-haut
Doit trouver ça rigolo.


Refrain

3. Mais il y' a dans la cité
Une fille à la peau douce,
A la va comm' je te pousse
Un' fill' toujours mal peignée,
Elle a sa rob' déchirée,
Mais j'ai trouvé dans ses yeux
Un bout de ciel égaré
Et qui n'appartient qu'à nous deux,
Je ne vois plus les usines,
Et je n'entends plus les machines
Qui donc se dress' sur la cité ?
C'est l'amour et sa liberté.

Refrain

Comm' c'est drôle
L'amour qui marche dans la rue,
Comm' c'est drôle
Deux coeurs perdus dans la cohue,

Où tous les gens cour'nt sans trève
A la recherch'd'un peu d'rêve
Pour oublier d'où l'on vient et où l'on va
Et pour ne pas trébucher à chaque pas
Il faut se dir' que la vie
Oui! ce n'est qu'un' plaisant'rie

Des chameaux chargés de présents.

Sur les gros rochers de papier.

Semble jouer pour moi ;
Tout le chagrin du monde
Est dans ses doigts.

Avec tes mots d’amour
Simples comme le jour
Heureusement, tu es venu(e) toi
Aimant ce que j’aimais
Riant quand je riais
Et ma vie, soudain, s’est éclairée
D’un éclatant soleil

Tu as mis dans mon âme angoissée
Une immense clarté
Un éternel été

Que j'aime ta verdure
Quand par l'hiver, bois et guérets
Sont dépouillés, de leurs attraits
Mon beau sapin, roi des forêts
Tu gardes ta parure

Toi que Noël, planta chez nous
Au saint anniversaire
Joli sapin, comme ils sont doux
Et tes bonbons, et tes joujoux
Toi que Noël, planta chez nous
Tout brillant de lumière

Tino Rossi,"Le jour qui s'allonge
Nous empêche de nous revoir
Et en attendant le soir
Je t'évoque dans mes songes,
Je rêve à tes yeux
A tes bras dorés qui m'accueillent,
Au parfum de tes cheveux
Au chant que diront les feuilles.

Refrain :
Ce soir tu viendras 
Sous les amandiers du jardin
Et dans l'ombre parfumée
Des longues allées
Nous resterons seuls
Et lorsque viendra le matin
L'aube claire d'un jour nouveau
Glissant sur les eaux
Le jour viendra séparer nos coeurs
Notre amour craintif
Nous retrouverons l'âpre douleur
Des adieux furtifs
Mais le soir enivrant
Reviendra pour nous éveillant
Notre amour abandonnée
Sous les amandiers.

Bien seuls sur la rive
Du lac immobile et sans fond
Ensemble nous écouterons
Sur les pierres rouler l'eau vive.
La terre nous oublie
sans frayeur donne-moi la main
Il ne faut craindre plus rien
Nul au monde ne nous épie

Tinoco,"Toda vez que eu viajava
Pela estrada de ouro fino
De longe eu avistava
A figura de um menino
Que corria abri a porteira
Depois vinha me pedindo
Toque o berrante seu moço
Que é pra mim ficá ouvindo

Quando a boiada passava
Que a porteira ia fechando
Eu jogava uma moeda,
Ele saia pulando
Obrigado, boiadeiro
Que Deus vai lhe acompanhando
Pra aquele sertão afora
Meu berrante ia tocando

No caminho desta vida
Muito espinho encontrei
Mais nenhum calou mais fundo
Do que isso que eu passei
Na minha viage de volta
Quarqué coisa eu cismei,
Vendo a porteira fechada
E o menino não avistei

A piei do meu cavalo
Num ranchinho beira chão,
Vi uma muié chorando
Quis sabê qual a razão

Boiadeiro veio tarde,
Veja a cruz no estradão
Quem matou o meu filhinho
Foi um boi sem coração

Lá pra banda de ouro fino
Levando o gado servage
Quando eu passo na porteira
Até vejo sua imagem
O seu rangido tão triste
Mai parece uma mensagem
Daquele rosto trigueiro
Desejando me boa viagem

A cruzinha do estradão
Do pensamento não sai
Eu já fiz um juramento
Que eu não esqueço jamais
Nem que o meu gado estore
Que eu preciso ir atrás
Nesse pedaço de chão
Berrante eu não toco mais",O Menino da Porteira,

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,1996

And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

When Mrs. Jennings took a bath
And left the window open for the neighbors
But had we looked, we might have seen
That she was really very clean
And given her the credit of her labors

And Mr. James, where was he?
The man that we had to see
And who are we to think that it was funny?
When as she raised her glass
She said she wasn't sure, he might be dead
Or somewhere making love to all his money

She held her breath expectantly
While everybody stared at me
As I approached to greet Miss Mary blooming, ""Hello""
I tweaked her nose and kissed the tip
I wiped the powder from my lip
And just because I did, it left her fuming

I almost gave myself away
When Captain Graves came up to say
Glad to see me home and he was tickled
And now I'm sure I had excused
The way I used to be abused
It was worth it all to see him tickled

The atmosphere was getting thick
The guy beside me looking sick
I would've helped, at least I thought I ought to
He flashed me an appearing grin
I stopped and took the feeling in
I wasn't sure but something told me not to

I knew I couldn't take much more
I started making for the door
And as I passed my date, I let her kiss me
I grabbed my coat and stepped outside
I stuck my thumb out for a ride
Departing knowing they would never miss me

Nighty night little angels, nighty night

I’d like to dedicate this song to all of you out there
Wherever you may be
North, south, east or west, to everyone all over the world
This song is for you

Fill your heart with love today, don’t play the game of time
Things that happened in the past, happened in your mind
In your mind, only in your mind, in your mind
Forget your mind and you’ll be free

Happiness is happening, the dragons have been bled
Loveliness is everywhere, fear’s just in your head
In your head, only in your head, in your head
Forget your head and you’ll be free

The writing's on the wall, free, and you can know it all
Know it all if you choose remember lovers never lose
They are free of thoughts unpure, and of thoughts unkind
Gentleness can clear the head, love can clean the mind
And make it free

The writing's on the wall, and you can know it all
Know it all if you choose, remember lovers never lose
They are free

Free, free, free, free

Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

How everything still turns to gold

The tune will come to you at last

Tiny Tim,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996
Tiny Tim,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1996
Tiny Tim,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1996

And then I understand. mm

Tiny Tim,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,2006
Tiny Tim,"So I took my guitar
And I threw down some chords
And some words I could sing without shame

And I soon had a song
I played it around
For some friends but they all said the same

They said music's for fools
You should go back to school
The future is prisms and math
So I did what they said
Now my children are fed
'Cause they pay me to do what I'm asked

I forgot all my songs
The words now are wrong
And I burned my guitar in a rage

But the fire came to rest
In your white velvet breast
So somehow I just know that it's safe",Death of a Salesman,2006
Tiny Tim,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2007

That no one could seem to solve them 
But you had the answer 
You told me to take a chance 
And learn the ways of love, my baby 
And all that it has to offer.. 
You told me your secret love won't let you down 
Ohh allll my love baby... 

Hey nigga ain't shit gonna ever change 
Between you and your boo. 
Put a hold on me ever since I held you 
What compelled you to be my nigga 
Besides passion and love 
You ran up on a real bitch with understanding and trust 
Fuck the others, none of them compare to us 
And under covers you my muthafucka nigga, 
When you stickin my stuff 
You laid pipe unlike any other plumber 
Took me shoppin all day and at night, you kept me cummin. 
Made dinner, collard greens, candied yams and steak. 
Taught me how to measure grams, cook rocks, and chop weights 
Caught a case, cuz you're boy ran his mouth too much. 
And it's a disgrace how the pain felt to miss your touch 
But as the days keep passin, keep it actin with stacks of letters 
Hit you so you don't forget us 
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella 
Hella muthafuckas want your occupation 
But they can keep pacin, cuz I'm gonna be waitin on my Baby... 

And all this love, is waiting for you 
My baby... Sweet Darling... 
And all this love is waiting for you 

Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down 
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around 

Ran into your boy, had heard he'd spread the word 
That you was soft, braggin he collecting your cheese, 
And pissing me the fuck off. 
The first thought of committing a felony never left 
I missed the big breaths you took when we waz puffin an L, 
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones I 
Saw better SL 500s colorful Gucci sweaters and leathers 
Diamond letters girl you broke, I saved the sugar for you 
Keep the business runnin, droppin off keys in Cancun 
Cash rules, and you remain to be the King of my throne 
Position taken, flippin calender pages till you get home 
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin up my happiness 
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation 
If I'm incarcerated 
Too you can make it through, we bail on the Jealous 
Who tell us the opposite of that, 
Forever you and Brat 
I tried to take the blame, but you prefered to handle my fame 
So i'm waitin with open arms to rekindle the flame... 

And all this love, is waiting for you 
My baby... Sweet Darling... 
And all this love is waiting for you 

Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down 
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around 

And all this love, is waiting for you

And all this love is waiting for you

Tionne Watkins,"I been in some hard times, I seen a lot of good times
But everyday I count my blessings this way 'cause I know that everyday's a different day. 
My friends can change but his will never change.
And I knew there would be some time, when I would second guess my mind.

So I kept on walking, kept on striving,
Kept on singing and guess who showed up.

As I walked down the street one day, I thought I heard a brother say
'Living in bad conditions can make you feel like no one, 
As long as I, that's why I always try and do my best to search inside.
But I knew there would be a day, when I had to look the other way.

So I close my eyes and kept on pushin'
I just kept looking and guess who showed up.

I told myself one day to falll on my knees and pray
And never listen to noone if they can't be true to you
No one should spend precious time living for material love
His money, no money no money, can make me happy.
Now it looks a lot clearer outside, 'cause I'm using my eyes.

I close my eyes and
Kept on pushing,
I just stopped looking and guess who showed up.


My friend won't let you down, He's always been around.
That's one thing I know for sure. Even when I'm wrong, he's right at my door.
He'll never ignore.

Yes, I got a lotta things to say, I can't say them in all one day.
I'll take no credit for the blessings that He's given to me
Without Him I know that Saadiq could never, ever, ever be.
When I thought it couldn't get no better, 
Just when I thought it was almost over.

Oh no
I close my eyes and kept on pushin'
I just kept looking and guess who showed up.

Oh, oh

I close my eyes and kept on pushin'
I just kept looking and guess who showed up.

And these were not the lies I told you once before
This is not the end it's still an outside bet
I'm not taking off my wedding ring just yet

And it's years since I took stock of it
Seems that it's not come to much
This is everything I ever wrote
Collapsed into the core

I've been terrified for far to fucking long
What is that thing I lack that makes you so damn strong
Your letter in my hands is rolled into a ball
With drunken comedy it's thrown hard at the wall

And it's years since I took stock of it
Seems it's not come too much
This is everything I ever wrote
Collapsed into the core

And the stitches are unraveling
And the seams have all but burst
Maybe all my years of traveling
Have quenched what I've thirst

These years have flown by
These hands have shaken
I have no notion
Of what happens next

There's a kind of freedom
And I think of it
Then the panic quickens

A kiss like a fight that neither wins
One tender payment for our sins
You are the drug that I can't quit
Your perfect chaos is a perfect fit

So I, get on the road and ride to you
I get on the road and ride to you

I was saved by the half full glass,
So come on take a good look,
'Cause this party will be our last.

And they've closed down the old bar,
This town's like an empty box,
Well they can't have gone that far,
'Cause I can still see some swing in the box.

There's a dangerous hope,
'Cause the ground comes at you faster than you'd think,
Lurking in the shadows,
With the bears and wolves,
'Cause that's where you feel the most upon these days.

When you called I was screening,
It confused me that hear your voice,
It was like I was dreaming,
And the ten years became a life,
I could barely remember,
Just enough to open the wounds,
In the darkest December,
I can howl at the early moon.

When even the highways seem still
The map in my hands folded shut
There isn't one magical word
But a carnival of them instead
Like an old, silent cinema screen

Just a painting that hangs in my head
That I know like the back of my hand
And with the sun set, the neon awakes
And the cold colours dance on your skin

And every mistake that we've made
Is at peace coz it led us both here

J'roule un sdeh pour me percher, rejoindre l'étoile du berger
C'est plus des couilles que j'ai, eh non, c'est des gros œufs de Fabergé
J'suis overbooké, OK zoogataga
J'ai appris une chose chez Ruquier

Bah le rap français c'est pas vraiment l'truc tah Audrey Pulvar
Mon point commun avec Natacha c'est mes chicos d'devant
Que moi-même sans mes 32 dents, j'leur faisais du rentre-dedans

Ayer, al amanecer, un aborigen de origen que lo rigen
Culpado por la Virgen fue golpeado why arrastrado por el lote de soldados
Un sacerdote a su lado aclama: ""el es un desalmado...""
El indio en llanto, el santo en pleno canto
Con la cruz del espanto eleva la voz why hostia
Testigo es el castigo de publico euforico
En el templo del tiempo cierran puertas para dejar todo tipo de venas
Abiertas
Why fue octubre 12, muchedumbre en goce / why la muerte soplo, la vida apago
Hoy voy a sentenciar el derecho a matar / frente al juzgado que en mi
Mente ha desatado
Furia por la lujuria de la injuria del estado
Que ha censurado penuria pues ha reemplazado educacion por paginas de
Traicion
En un libro manoseado de pasado censurado / en el antiguo descubrimiento
Ambiguo
Acompañada por una cruz, bañada por una luz que ilumina hipocresia why
Regia al mesias
Vestia traje de culpable why hoy es honorable / como el professor en el
Silencio esconde horror
El error de dejar matar el pensar / why en America Latina que camina entre
Ruinas
Del olvido que crucifica la memoria / resureccion impedida por opinion
Dando gloria a España, en la entraña el conquistador regaña
Why no conoce la nacion tanta aberracion / donde Colon fue peon de la
Discriminacion
Se borra gente por todo este continente
Son millones de vidas perdidas vencidas / son millones de vidas perdidas
Vencidas
Esto no es una leyenda negra
El cinismo why la Virgen siempre rigen / en el abismo de cinismo why
Oportunismo
1 4 9 2 , colonialismo why cristianismo fusionados para el imperialismo
Nacieron criollos bajo el sub-desarrollo / germinando odio, cada indio
Cava su hollo
Frente al crecimiento del monumento / atento al evento del
Ensangramiento
Why viaja en cada pensamiento a paso lento / por un triste, muy triste
Acontecimiento
Yo no miento frente al capital criminal sacado por esclavos / golpeados
Como clavos
Why tras el antifaz, profesa la paz
Es Europa la que toma oro en copa why la mente del inocente dopa
Criminalidad por la humanidad / trabajando en la mina en rios sudando
Se elemina en Potosi 6.000.000 / la verdad va vagando sin credibilidad
Que cuando cava en tu cara, la inconciencia dispara al cadaver dejado
Por el pasado
Que ha pasado a ser un ser con el deber de educar a adoptar posicion
Realista
Donde esta el conformista en la negra lista
Mientras hubo el suicidio de un indio se corto la vena de acumulada pena
Pero otro capitalista encabeza la lista / la historia continua, actua
Otro invasor
Yankee interviene, influencia se apodera / contrabando legal, siempre al
Mando fatal
Un salvador redentor anuncia el horror / ayudando dictadura, borrando
Cultura
El nuevo orden en marcha por todo este planeta
Con la meta de sumar mas estrellas en sus banderas
En la era de guerra, la perra prolifera / creando paz, tras montañas de
Cadaveres
El veneno infiltrado por venas de latinoamericanos / unos cegados, otros
Sanados
Esto no es una leyenda negra / son millones de vidas perdidas vencidas
Why la rima determina ser aceptada o no
No pido castigo, solo digo que el que no reconoce esto es enemigo
Why espero que se borre dependencia en la esencia
Del ser gobernado por creencia en la censura / que inaugura la sepultura
A verdad pura
Dejando la escultura de la aberracion / pues no tiene derecho a aceptar
Este hecho
Why el juez desde su vejez espera el veredicto del adicto testigo viciado
Enemigo
Este posee codigo de justicia why milicia / pero otro es el rostro, plata
Salva la rata
Queda inocente el crimen al continente / se eleva la bandera de la
Criminal era
El terror abrazado por un cura emocionado en sudor
Alabado por el pueblo que se hare a un lado / afuera se ilumina una
Limusina
Sube al auto llovido de autografos
Termina el acto leyendo un parrafo del nuevo testamento vendido a cambio
De sufrimiento
Un impotente presidente lo condecora why ora frente a la aurora
Esto seguira como leyenda
Solo en la sala estoy, me levanto why me voy / pero el silbido de una bala
Pasa por toda la sala
Para entrar en mi corazon, apagando mi desilucion
Quien es el culpable, la persona que creiste honorable
Esto no es una leyenda negra
Yo quiero a mi bandera...

Tiromancino,"Che giorno sia non sai mentre vai 
Dove adesso non mi vedi 
Ovunque sei sarai 
Dentro i miei sogni ormai 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Riprovando a non cadere da solo nel vuoto 
Per cominciare a diventare così com'è che avrei dovuto 
Solo se avessi comunque davvero voluto 
Tutte le cose che vedo 
Così nuove che a volte nemmeno ci credo 
Ed ho paura che il calore di un raggio di sole che ho sopra la testa 
Sciolga le ali di cera o mi abbagli la vista 
E ora non starmi a sentire 
Tanto guarda ho anche paura di farti capire 
Sono bene o male solo soltanto parole 
Come gocce che non cambiano il livello del mare 
Non scende e non sale 
Ma sotto qualcosa si muove 
E sono tutte quelle voci che tornano nuove 
E tornano più forti in un giorno come gli altri 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Verso un posto nuovo 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Perché cerco un posto nuovo 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Verso un posto nuovo diverso 
Dentro ai miei sogni ormai cosa c'è e cosa resta 
Soltanto i mostri che ho dentro alla testa 
Non era oro quello che brillava 
Non era eterno quello che restava 
Non era amore neanche quello che mi amava 
Eppure mi sembrava 
La sola cosa sicura che avevo 
Ma mi sveglio lentamente 
Non può piovere per sempre 
Nessuno ti dice mai niente 
Infatti a me nessuno mi ha detto mai niente 
E qual'è veramente il problema 
Rimanere da soli o cambiare sistema 
E se una cosa importante vale meno di zero 
E una cazzata qualunque diventa un delirio 
Io spingo e vado avanti in questo giorno come tanti 
E allora tiro due righe sul conto 
E sono stanco di scappare da quello che ho intorno 
Perché ho bisogno di provare di nuovo da solo a capire se cado 
Come se avessi comunque davvero vissuto 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Verso un posto nuovo diverso",Muovo le Ali Di Nuovo [*],2001

Ti sei toccata i capelli

Non scende e non sale 
Sotto qualcosa si muove 
Sono tutte quelle voci che tornano nuove 

E tornano più forti in un giorno come gli altri 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Verso un posto nuovo 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Perché cerco un posto nuovo 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Verso un posto nuovo 
Diverso
 
Dentro ai miei sogni ormai cosa c'è e cosa resta 
Soltanto i mostri che ho dentro alla testa 
Non era oro quello che brillava 
Non era eterno quello che restava 
Non era amore neanche quello che mi amava 
Eppure mi sembrava 
La sola cosa sicura che avevo ma 
Mi sveglio lentamente 
Non può piovere per sempre 
Nessuno ti dice mai niente 
Infatti a me nessuno m'ha detto mai niente 
E qual'è veramente il problema 
Rimanere da soli o cambiare sistema 
E se una cosa importante vale meno di zero 
E una cazzata qualunque diventa un delirio 
Io spingo e vado avanti in questo giorno come tanti 

Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Verso un posto nuovo 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Perché cerco un posto nuovo 
Muovo le ali di nuovo 
Verso un posto nuovo 
Diverso (vai Fibra)

Ah, sono convinto che se avessi dato retta a te 
A quest'ora di sicuro non facevo il rap 
A quest'ora di sicuro non avevo niente 
Stavo fermo ad aspettare come tanta gente 
Non avrei avuto modo di arrivare primo 
E nemmeno di cantare con Tiromancino 
Sognavo di passare in radio, ero un ragazzino 
Oggi invece sto al telefono con Albertino 
Guarda frate quant'è bella la vita da qui
Non mi giudicare se non la vedi così 
E tocca dire sempre sì, ma falla finita 
Non odiare il lunedì 
Odia la tua vita 
Dovresti andare più in TV, no non sono il tipo 
Ancora gente che mi dice io non ti ho capito 
Muovo le ali verso un posto nuovo e te lo dico 
Non lascio nulla, amico 
Resta la musica che gira all'infinito 
Ma io non ho finito 
Tornavo dallo studio tardi ero sfinito 
Questo malessere che scrivo non è mai finto 
Ho fatto sempre il tifo per chi non ha mai vinto
Persone sole che aspettano il sole 
Finisci i soldi, finisce l'amore 
Ricordo lavoravo nove ore 
Per guadagnare tempo e volare altrove 
E adesso che son qui, lei mi vuole 
Telefoni raccontano storie 
In testa immagini distorte 
Ci son passato mille volte 
Vogliamo tutti altro, non dire altro 
Andare in alto o mani in alto 
Dammi tutto ciò che hai e poi via in un lampo 
Ci pensavo ogni tanto 
La strada ora va dritta e non c'è più nessuno 
La macchina che lascia nuvole di fumo 
Sinceramente pensavo d'essere più furbo
Penso troppo al passato 
E mica vengo dal futuro",Muovo le ali 2018,2018

Sarebbe meglio evitarle sempre
Per non rischiare di aver ragione

Guarderò il paesaggio
Sono lontano e mi torni in mente

Per raggiungere le immagini
Scolpite ormai nella coscienza
Come indelebili emozioni

Dividendo tutto sempre

In questa notte taglio col coltello il buio tutto intorno
Tanto so che quando torna il giorno
Sarà solo ricordo di qualcosa che avrei avuto ed ho perso

Perché il mio cervello non sopporta più il rumore

Mi passavano leggere e mi riperdo

Heading north to Texas where he grew into a man
He fixed cars and worked the wars and raised a family
San Antonio was home on the west side of town

Young Maria dreamed of singing in a concert hall
Past the plaza and the village church adobe wall
Hard times stole her innocence but drove the woman's heart
San Antonio bound to the west side of town

She was proud and lived on faith
He was strong in his own way
They were pilgrims that made
A good life the hard way

Felipe lost his first wife in 1943
7 growing children and desperately in need
Maria came to look for work and found her destiny
With one child of her own to the west side of town

They were married, years went by and now we were 13
Days were good and days were bad but mostly they were lean
School and shoes and food and books, believin' in a prayer

They were pilgrims that made

Climbing up when you're down from the west side of town

Mama bought her own damn house with self determination

Is it love or is it me
That makes me change so suddenly
From looking out to feeling free?

Wondering what it was I said
That made me think I lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

So won't you please read my signs?
Be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

And of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd

And because you can find my mind

all the vegetables gave a spree
they put up a sign said the dance is at 9
and all the admissions were free
there were peas and greens
cabbage and beans
it was the biggest sight you ever did see
When old man cucumber
struck up that number
you should've heard the vegetables scream
Well little turnip top did the backwards flop
the cabbage shook the shimmy

Little tomata agitata

Tish Hinojosa,"Every river searches for the sea
Every life runs it's own destiny
Canyons white and wild stretches calm and mild
Cutting through the stones of history

Rio Grande runs south to Mexico
From the highway I have touched its shores
Reynosa to Sante Fe and back the other way
I've had my life planned by the Rio Grande

An unbroken chain snow and tears and rain
Cutting through my soul and to my veins
Then the waters rise paint the Rocky Mountain skies
One more circle around the world again

One more year rolls down the Rio Grande
Our forefathers crossed the muddy line
Pilgrims passing leaving tracks in time
One more takes a stand by the water by the land

Shifting like the sand by the Rio Grande
An unbroken chain snow and tears and rain
Cutting through my soul and to my veins
Then the waters rise paint the Rocky Mountain skies

One more year rolls down the Rio Grande

Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

Roll a ""L"" and burn a incent
It's like magic when I invent
This shit that I present
Yo turn my levels up a izinch
And drop the trebble down the pizinch
And let the bass commence
To relax your nerves
It's like a paintin with no color it's-why I attach the words
My mind the brush, my life the canvas, the world, the easel
Combines a perfect picture for people
My words is colorful like autumn
The way they fall on the track like leaves when I record em'
There's nothin like it when I write
And I don't print, I invent it and predict it like a psychic
Pull down the shades on the windows of your soul
And gaze into your mind and watch the wisdom unfold
I was taught when your vision's impaired
The wisdom is there
A message from Big Homey couldn't-have sent it no clear
I know the flow is like hypnotic
And tightest tip when I drop it with no particular topic
Type shit that can't be bitten so stop it
Type shit that can't be re-written on copy
By kinko, kodak, fuji films
Kin-folk know that groovy hymns
Spit by him'll put the gospel to you
Catch some little higher learning from a sermon once I drop it to you
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My flow is like hypnotic...
The flow is like hypnotic...

So roll a ""L"" and light a incent

This shit that I present
It's not a secret when I speak it
I know that hatin' isn't physical but dawg I could peep it
It's like a preacher preachin' his scripts or psychic readin' a palm
Lines give me what I write in-this song
The book is now open so let the story be told
I enter through your mind and exit the back of your soul
That could push you to some insight
A shine like a headlight
Pickeny diamond watch me get right
I'm that nice
Words is a cure that help me heal up a heart
Words can become that evil game that help me get what I want..uh
You start where you end, you end where you start
I am the light of the situation I overshine dark
Give you the pen, the book, the word, the truth, the sight, the mind
I put it down, you call it a rhyme, I call it a sign
I predict the unpredictable
Heaven is invisible, but hell isn't physical
Let me stop with the spiritual.. whoa
Let me spit at you, show you how to move with no vehicle
Come through your speakers
Into/enter your ear, end up in paragraphs
Tellin' your man of what you hear
'cause, spit it I often roll it tighter than chronic
Styles versatile meanwhile it's hypnotic
Hypnotic...hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...
My style is just hypnotic...

Pass the dutchie if you was ill
Take one to the grizzill
Tell me what you fizzill
It's like a complicated puzzle unravelin', mind travelin', with no particular flight patterin
Speak the language of the lizand
Desert feeds worm, worm feeds falcon, falcon feeds man ..uh
Only the strong survive, so if you along for the ride strap your boots and leave your thongs inside..uh
We experience turbulence in urban environments daily, rarely it's aqcuired
We riot like Israelis
Why am I here that question overwhelms me
I am a gangsta, Dr. Melfi couldn't help me
I am a thinker, my mind fixes all that L's/ills me the perfect elixir
I trust mines will never fail me
I let my speech unfold, I reach deep inside the seed of my soul and I got it

Nem é só por culpa minha
Violência gera violência
Violência doméstica violência cotidiana
São gemidos de dor todo mundo se engana
Você não tem o que fazer saia pra rua
Pra quebrar minha cabeça ou pra que quebrem a sua
Violência gera violência
Com os amigos que tenho não preciso inimigos
Aí fora ninguém fala comigo
Será que tudo está podre será que todos estão vazios?
Não existe razão nem existem motivos
Não adianta suplicar porque ninguém responde
Não adianta implorar todo mundo se esconde
É difícil acreditar que somos nós os culpados
É mais fácil culpar deus ou então o diabo
O crime é venerado e posto em uso por toda a terra
De um polo a outro se imolam vidas humanas.
No reino de Zópito os pais degolam os próprios filhos
Seja qual for o sexo desde que sua cara não lhes agrade.

Era um grande coração
Ganhava a vida
Com muito suor
E mesmo assim
Não podia ser pior

E despesas do lar

Mas Deus quis
Vê-lo no chão
Com as mãos
Levantadas pro céu

Só via carne

Segui a mesma trilha
E toda noite minha mãe orava

Era em nome da fome

Cresceram meus irmãos

Titãs,"Há uma questão que há muito tempo me incomoda
Qual será a vantagem de se ter uma ou duas corcovas?
O que iremos formular é somente um questionário
Qual diferença haverá entre o dromedário e o camelo?
E entre o camelo e o dromedário?
Postos frente a frente causam a mesma impressão
Mas quando postos de lado faz-se logo a correção
O camelo difere do dromedário que só tem uma corcova
O dromedário já difere do camelo por ter lá suas duas corcovas
Há muitas coincidências entre os nossos dois ruminantes
Mas quando chamados em ordem alfabética é o camelo que vem sempre
Antes
O camelo está na letra ""see"" de quase todo abecedário
A letra ""D"", por sua vez, traz sempre a figura do dromedário
Haverá mesmo uma rusga entre os dois mamíferos quadrúpedes?
Ou desavenças são propriedades apenas de nós, humanos bípedes?
Só se anda de camelo no deserto do Saara
Mas quem já viu aonde dorme o camelo lá na Guanabara?
O camelo é o Pão de açúcar com a Urca vistos em relevo
Mas o dromedário é o corcovado, só o Cristo é que não pode vê-lo
Será que, por ter duas corcovas, o camelo passa mais tempo sem beber
Água?
Ou pelo contrário, com um peso maior, beba mais água que o dromedário?
Será que o bom dromedário com sua única corcova tem por cima mais
Espaço?
E ficaria assim nosso amigo camelo exposto a um maior cansaço?
Aquele que acertar a primeira resposta
Receberá duas corcovas em suas costas
Por outro lado,
Aquele que só acertar a segunda
Não tardará a ficar com uma enorme corcunda",O Camelo E O Dromedario,1989
