David Foster,"I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side

I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes I'll never break your heart

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the skies
I'll be there
I swear like a shadow that's by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear oouh

I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
And when (And when)
Just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as the time turns the page my love won't age at all

And I swear (I swear)
By the moon and the stars in the skies
I'll be there (I'll be there)

I swear (And I swear)
Like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there (I'll be there)

For better or worse till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart (Beat of my heart)
And I swear (Oh yeah)

I swear (I swear)
By the moon and stars in the sky
I'll be there (I'll be there)

(I swear) I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there (I'll be there)
For better or worse (Better or worse)
Till death do us part (Oh no)
(I'll love you with every) Every single beat of my heart
(I swear) I swear (I swear)
Oh, I swear",I Swear,2003
David Foster,"I pray you'll be our eyes
And watch us where we go
And help us to be wise
In times when we don't know

Let this be our prayer
As we go our way
Lead us to a place
Guide us with your Grace
To a place where we'll be safe

La luce che to dai
I pray we'll find your light
Nel cuore restero
And hold it in our hearts
A ricordarchi che
When stars go out each night
L'eterna stella sei
Nella mia preghiera
Let this be our prayer
Quanta fede see'e
When shadows fill our day
Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace

Give us faith so we'll be safe.
Sognamo un mondo senza piu violenza

Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza
Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino
Simbolo di pace e di fraternita

La forza che ci dai
We ask that life be kind
E'il desiderio che
And watch us from above
Ognuno trovi amore
We hope each soul will find
Intorno e dentro a se
Another soul to love

David Foster,"I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun

When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire
To the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know you're afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
And I can help if you'll only let me try
You touch me and something in me knew
What I could have with you
Well I'm not ready to kiss that dream goodbye

When it's this sweet, there's no saying no
I need you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire
To the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all

David Foster,"Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart

Take back that sad word goodbye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart

Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

And walked out of my life

David Foster,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me

That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too

David Foster,"You think that I can't live without your love
You'll see,
You think I can't go on another day.
You think I have nothing
Without you by my side,
You'll see
Somehow, some way

You think that I can never laugh again
You'll see,
You think that you destroyed my faith in love.
You think after all you've done
I'll never find my way back home,
You'll see
Somehow, someday

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive,
All on my own
I don't need anyone this time
It will be mine
No one can take it from me
You'll see

You think that you are strong, but you are weak
You'll see,
It takes more strength to cry, admit defeat.
I have truth on my side,
You only have deceit
You'll see, somehow, someday

All by myself
I don't need anyone at all
I know I'll survive
I know I'll stay alive,
I'll stand on my own

David Foster,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,2005

David Foster,"For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through through it all

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me

You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am

A light in the dark shining your love into my life

David Foster,"When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart

Is when I fall in love with you.

David Foster,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For a good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

When a man loves a woman
I give you everything I've got (yeah)
Trying to hold on
To your precious love
Baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I now exactly how he feels
'Cause baby, baby, baby
I am a man
When a man loves a woman",Caruso,2011

That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door

But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little crazy

And yet together they were friends at school

Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe

I needed to be by your side
If only to hold you

Forever in my heart
Forever we will be
And even when I'm gone
You'll be here in me

Once, I dreamed that you were gone
I cried out trying to find you
I begged the dream to fade away
And please awaken me
But night took a hold of my heart
And left me with no one to follow
the love that I lost to the dark
I'll always remember

And know that when I'm gone
You'll be here in me

I'd be yours

The only thing that I want to hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself 
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio
Whoa, oh, oh

Well tune right in you made find the love you lost

Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

David Foster,"This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

You can never give up,
Never compromise on,
And that's the real thing you need in love.

And nothing I can say can change your mind.
How can anybody be so selfish,
And treat you all so cruel,

And a candidate for examination

And a voice rapped ""knuckle under!""

David Freiberg,"What would it gain me
If I was to go?
Like Jacob of old
To the well of the world

To wax halls where candles
Burn on through the day
To light you a path
So you'd never lose your way

I was down in the valley
Where the shadows are long
The birds in the harp tree
Were singing this song

There is time to deliver
Time to receive
All that you're lacking
Of whatever you need

Turn around, by the by
You'll still see the sea
As it was in the dawning
As it always will be

Raise up your bottles
And drink down the blood
You planted the vine here
In spite of the flood

Turn an ear to the harp tree
An eye to the wall
The songs in the singing
Or nowhere at all

No where to come from
No place to retire
No shelter nowhere
Except in the fire

The birds in the harp tree
Can finish their song
Then rest in its branches
Which is where they belong

But where can a man go
That's sweet to his soul
When his time is not ready
But he's still turning old

Here's a dream for the piper
And a tune for his lady
Outside the thin wall
The waves are still raging

Here's one for the harp tree
And one for his song
One for the morning
When the night was too long

Here's one for the candle
That lights you to bed
And one for the sword
That hangs over your head

Give it to the man who'll have them back

David Fridlund,"There's a yellow arrow painted on the ground 
I give up and I decide to follow 
There's a thick white blanket covering the town
And right now it's more then I can swallow

There's a ship sailing gently on the waves
There's a tear drop rollin'
There's a small hand pressed against a glass
And there's and engine pullin' 

And you'll be far away
And you'll be deep inside
And you know that time is all we have 

There's a big black nothing in your heart
There's me in a white van
And there's a million holes dug in the pavement
There's a good chance to avoid them

So if you decide to leave
Or if you decide to stop breathing 
Don't leave me hanging
‘Cause time is all we have

And what about the love in your hands 
And the cold in your palm
And the sweat on your forehead 
I can never ever be calm 
I can never sit still
Because I'm like an alarm-clock
See me 
Hear me
Do this 
Do that 
Take my words, eat them and swallow
Don't measure my steps and actions 
Just hold me close and I will follow

And there's a big knife pressed against my throat 
There's a word carved into my back 
And there's a sea of questions everywhere you go
And there's really no way out

And if you decide to leave 
Then you'll leave without me 
And you know that time is all we have",White Van,2005

It seems like this world ain't getting any better
The more we try to get closer to You
The farther we run from Your throne

I've spent so many nights wonderin' when will it end
When will the day come when happiness begins
I'm running the race but it seems too hard to win
I'm sick of mourning my stomach is throwing up in the morning

I'm calling for help and watching it melt away
My heart's been put on display and put away
In many ways, many times I told myself it was ok
And anger was the price that was paid

I can taste my spirit hunger

Going back to the way I was before Christ in my life
I couldn't do it I would lose it there's no point to the fight
And I'm writing this song, for the people who don't belong

Inside a life that's filled with anger and disappointment
'Cause daddy treated you weaker than all of the other kids
It's annoying and I feel for all of you who wanna give up
You feel stuck I feel the same way Lord help us stay up
You couldn't pay me to abandon the idea of true hope
That I could make it through this life into a place where there's no crying
I'm dying to find You with open arms when I go
Knowing You love me and You waiting to give rest to my soul

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

Rode the Greydog to New York
My guitar and fifty dollars
Between bein all alone

Found a job that pays okay
But it costs twice as much to stay
So I'll just buy myself a beer and dream of home

When things ain't going good 
That's when everything goes bad
But this old bar's my home away from home

I won't worry about tomorrow 
Cause tonight I'll drown my sorrow

'Til I drink the night away
'Til I find my name in neon lights 
I guess I'm gonna have to stay 
But I'm tired of sleepin' all alone 
My arms can reach to San Antoine

That's when honkin' tonkin' helps to ease the pain
And you know that I get lonesome too
But these cowboys know I belong to you

David Frizzell,"I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
And I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay

I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
She was the daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me, ""That son of a Saginaw fisherman""
And not good enough to ever claim his daughter's hand

That's why I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm a digging in the frozen ground, so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said, ""Honey, I'm a coming home, please wait for me
And you can tell your dad that I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history""

Her dad met the bus in Saginaw, Michigan
And he gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said, ""Son, you're wise, young ambitious man
Why don't you sell your father-in-law your Klondyke claim?""

Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold, cold ground
That greedy fool is a looking for the gold I never found
But it serves him right and nobody here is missing him
Least of all the newly-weds of Saginaw, Michigan

To which I hatched a plan
I drink myself to death

Gave me many choices

So hard to feel the pain

In your one block world
Too scared to make the change

While you're playing with your gun
Is your finger shaking on the trigger
Are you really having fun

Try listening

You're breathing
Maybe you can make a change

To which I hatched a plan
I drink myself to death

Sitting up there on your throne
I've only just begun

Noble engineer but he's dead and gone (note 2)

Mrs Casey when she heard the news
Sitting on her bedside, she was lacing up her shoes
Children, children now hold your breath (note 3)
You will draw a pension at your Papa's death

Children, children now get your hat
Tell me Mama what do you mean by that?
Get your hat, put it on your head
Go down town, see your daddy is dead (note 4)

Casey said before he died
Fix the blinds so that the bums can't ride (note 5)
If they ride, let them ride the rods
Put their trust in the hand of God

Two more roads that I want to ride
People said, what roads can they be?

David Garrick,"A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around

cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

all that's left is an unhappy ending.

David Gates,"By the sand and fire light
While watching the fallin' star
Came a lady from the night
Who started playin' on my guitar

She was like a melody 
That no one had ever heard
When she sang her magic song
I had to listen to every word

But she made me see 
Like I never had before
Don't you know she set me free
Like I never been before
Don't you know the girl could sing
And I thought of what the future would bring

By the stars and fire light
The music was sweet and clear
Though I had her to myself
I was afraid someone else would hear

Soon the other heard her playin'
Started to gather round
One by one they started stayin' 
'Cause they couldn't believe the sound

And she made them see
Like they never had before
Don't you know she set them free
Like they'd never been before
Don't you know the girl could sing
And I thought of what the future would bring

I see her every now and then
In movies and on T.V.
Wonder as I sit there watchin'
If she ever thinks of me

By the sand and fire light 
(oooooooooooooo)
Before she became a star
(ooooo just a melody)
She was just a melody

David Gates,"Love me
Forget about tomorrow now and love me
There's time enough to borrow from another day
So just for now
Let's touch and do the things that drive my cares away

Hold me
Forget the world outside tonight and hold me
And by the flickering candle light
Our love will glow
And then we'll share the words and feelings no one else will ever know

We should never end
Hand in hand we'll walk the night forever
But if it can't be so
There's one more thing I need before I go

Just kiss me
And tell me when I'm gone how much you miss me
Forget the lonely in between
And then someday
We'll open up our eyes and see the world we thought so far away

You can tell they've lost the twinkle in their eye

They can hardly even make it through 'till dawn

Hoping ev'rything will turn out right
There's danger! Danger in the night!
You've got to move in closer to the light.

See the father and his son
From a distance don't it seem they're having fun
But just a little closer look reveals that they're having none

Neither tries to understand
Both ashamed to give or get a helping hand
And so concerned the other thinks that he's a man

Strangers! Strangers! Strangers in the night!
They're hoping ev'rything will turn out right
There's danger! Danger in the night!
You've got to move in closer to the light
Oh please help all the strangers in the night.

Though the answer may seem clear
It's still a ways to go to get from there to here
Just remember we're all strangers now to someone who's near

That open doors that stand between the you's and me's
Today is not too late to start so if you please

Were you on a beam of guiding light

I cannot hold the dawn

Causin' riots everywhere she goes
Your eyes are shoppin'... oh but will she

",California Lady,1978
David Gates,"See the clouds adrift so far below
Everchanging as they come and go
Makes me wonder why I'm up so high
When really I am down so low

Of all the wonders I was one allowed
I think that I would always choose a cloud
Always brings my feelings right out loud
Whether I'm ashamed or proud

On this airplane comin' home to you
Sometimes I think I've flown my whole
Life through
My whole life... through
As I wing my way to you

See the clouds they're giving life below
In colors that the canvas cannot show
Keeping secrets no one else could know
For I'm the one who told them so

Now and then I get up close to you
I'd like to stay but I'm just passing through
So I'll have to say goodbye...
Until next time I fly.


(interlude)

Make my bed-light the light
Comin' in on the midnight flight
Touch the ground and soon you will be
Safe inside reality

Change your mind-change your name
Still the music it sounds the same

Rainfall don't bother me at all
You see the world reflected on the highway
Come on rainbow-I can't let you go
Before I reach the end of you someway

So the next time raindrops fall
If it makes you climb the walls just think
Of green.

If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't
Be long away

Will bring me back to you.

I know you've been taken, afraid to hurt
Again
You fight the love you feel for me instead
Of givin' in
But I can wait forever, a-helpin' you to see
That I was meant for you and you for me so remember

I came from

You made it, you made it

door to door

were looking for
A letter comes, she still writes to you from
time to time
You'd like to call, but she's too happy and
besides you need the dime

Then at lost, someone's calling with a role
to play
It concerns a man who's lost his lover when
she went away
A star is born, no one's ever seen it played
so well
It almost seems the tears are real but it's

Here with me is where you belong

And as I go through my life, I will give to her my wife
All the sweet things that I can find.

To show you the things that he never could say;

He's a good lad
A little bit wild but his style is really gentle and kind
He ain't so bad
Right to the end he's a friend, about the best you can find
And as you come to know him, and his needs are comin' through
You'll flash on the day I was talkin' to you.

David Gates,"If a picture paints a thousand words,
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show the you I've come to know.
If a face could launch a thousand ships,
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you,
You're all that's left me too.
And when my love for life is running dry,
You come and pour yourself on me.

If a man could be two places at one time,
I'd be with you.
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way.
If the world should stop revolving spinning slowly down to die,
I'd spend the end with you.
And when the world was through,
Then one by one the stars would all go out,
Then you and I would simply fly away",If,1997

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

David Geddes,"He's just the blind man in the bleachers
To the local home town fans
And he sits beneath the speakers
Way back in the stands
And he listens to the play by play
He's just waiting for one name
He wants to hear his son get in the game

But the boy's not just a hero
He's strictly second team
Tho he runs each night for touchdowns
In his father's sweetest dreams
He's gonna be a star some day
Tho you might never tell
But the blind man in the bleachers knows he will

And the last game of the season is a Friday night at home
And no one knows the reason but the blind man didn't come
And his boy looks kinda nervous
Sometimes turns around and stares
Just as tho' he sees the old man sittin' there

The local boys are tryin' but they slowly lose their will
Another player's down and now
He's carried from the field
At halftime in the locker room
The kid goes off alone
And no one sees him talkin' on the phone

The game's already started
When he gets back to the team
And half the crowd can hear his coach yell
""Where the hell you been?""
""Just gettin' ready for the second half,""
Is all he'll say
""Cause now you're gonna let me in to play.""

Without another word, he turns and runs into the game
And through the silence on the field
Loudspeakers call his name
It'll make the local papers
How the team came from behind
When they saw him playin' his heart to win

And when the game was over
The coach asked him to tell
What was it he was thinkin' of
That made him play so well
""You knew my dad was blind,"" he said
""Tonight he passed away""
""It's the first time that my father's seen me play",The Last Game of the Season (A Blind Man in the Bleachers),1976
David Geist,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.

As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.

You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,

But the end is there for all to see
And if the end weren't so real
Coming 'round and 'round again on me

David Gilmour,"There's no way I'm going to let go
There's no way, because it's my show
I'm hanging on for a little while
I won't go down easy, that's not my style

And I can't decide just what it is I've got
Did I get out of touch? Did I lose my way?
I've not forgot, no, not a single day

David Gilmour,"You ask what is the quality of life?
Seeking to justify the part you play
And hide, fearing it incomplete, to try
To make it any more or less than short and sweet

But short, short is from you to me, as close
As we are wont to try to make it be
We're caught watching the dark in the sky, who knows?
Helpless as time itself to hold the time of day

And you, you are a fantasy, a view
From where you'd like to think the world should see
Be true and you will likely find a few
Building a vision new and justice to our time

And we, we, the immoral men, we dare
Naked and fearless in the elements
And free, carefree of tempting fate, aware
And holding off the moral nightmare at the gates

And sweet, sweet as a mountain stream, we'll look
Toward a new day breaking in the east
We'll meet as every future dream unfolds
And surely quality that is the very least",Short and Sweet,1978

Turn around and you're looking at a stranger
She steals your savings from under your bed
And leads you into places even angels fear to tread

No one will hurt me again
No one will cause me to lie
No one will control me by pain
No one will cause me to cry
I was looking for love
In wandering eyes

I learned how to sigh
On the ribbon and wires
It's a habit that's so hard to weaken

No one will ever manipulate
Make me promise to do or die
No one can make me hesitate
What can I lose if they try
I was looking for love
Like the very first time
Didn't realise love never left me
Contradicted - conspired
I connived and designed
Nothing on earth could arrest me.

David Gilmour,"Some of them standing, some were waiting in the line
As if there was something that they thought they might find
Taking some strength from the feelings that always were shared
And in the background, the eyes that just stared

What was it brought you out here in the dark?
Was it your only way of making your mark
Did you get rid of all the voices in your head?
Do you now miss them and the things that they said?

On your own admission you raised up the knife
And you brought it down ending another man's life
When it was done you just threw down the blade
While the red blood spread wider like the anger you made

I don't want this anger that's burning in me
It's something from which it's so hard to be free
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page",Murder,1984

Will you just turn it over and start again?
Is there a stirring in your heart
As the time comes when we will have to part?

And when you feel you're near the end
And there's a stranger where once was a friend
And you are left without a word
Only the whispers that you've overheard

Standing in silence, holding my breath
Disconnected and dry
And though I'm certain that there's nothing left
To hold on to, to give or to try
Some things never change, no don't ever change
And I'm feeling the cold
Thinking that we're getting older and wiser
When we're just getting old

And what once burned so bright is growing dim?
And when you see what's been achieved
Is there a feeling that you've been deceived?",Near the End,1984

To be safe from the storm

Out of the blue, with wings on his heels
A messenger comes, bearing regrets
For the time that he steals

But steal it he will, my children's and mine
Against our desires, against all our needs
Our blood spilled like wine
	
Over and over we call, no one hears
And further and further and further we fall
And though we pray that we soon will awake
It is clear, that it's no dream at all

I cannot believe, nor even pretend
That the thunder I hear, will just disappear

Do they still meet there by the cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The night of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many time

White steps in the moonlight
They walked here too
Through empty playground, this ghosts' town
Children again, on rusting swings getting higher
Sharing a dream, on an island, it felt right

We lay side by side
Between the moon and the tide
Mapping the stars for a while

Let the night surround you
We're halfway to the stars
Ebb and flow 
Let it go
Feel her warmth beside you

Remember that night
The warmth and the laughter
Candles burned
Though the church was deserted
At dawn we went down through empty streets to the harbor

Circles spinning out his time
Though the earth is dying his head is in the stars
Chances are this spark's a lifetime

Out of touch he'll live in wonder
Won't lose sleep he'll just pretend
In his world he won't go under
Turns without him until the end

Rivers run dry but there's no line on his brow
Says he doesn't care who's saved
It's just the dice you roll, the here and now
And he's not guilty or afraid

One day he'll slip away
Cool water flowing all around
In the river and on the ground
Leave a pocketful of stones and not believe in other lives

Shine on you crazy diamond.

Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.

You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze.

Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.

Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.

Rode on the steel breeze.

Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!",Shine on You Crazy Diamond,2008
David Gilmour,"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain

You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's
Sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time

Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a leading role in a cage?

That doesn't care about summer and less about youth
Now in this silence, what more is there to do?
Something has broken in me and in you

In watchful dependence, a satellite spins
Cautiously circling the space that I'm in
It's bouncing me signals distorted by time
And I'm stuck here waiting for the stars to align

Dancing right in front of me, all the lives I once could see
Slipping to and slipping fro, disappearing

Into the shadows of my night
Who started out as stars in my eyes

But the years had turned dry as the leaves

Your lover was gone, his replacement to hand
And just what the difference was, you could not understand
In darkening grey we walked back through the streets
Then you talked all night long of your childhood home by the sea

And I, my disguise a mask chosen by you
Believed every word I heard
At least I think that's what I tried to do

The children cry in the rubble of their lives

Isn't she lovely? And so deadly.

And you see her venom is highly neurotoxic 
Which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system 
Causing intense pain
Profuse sweating
Difficulty in breathing
Loss of consciousness
Violent convulsions 
And finally death.

Is her inborn need to dominate and possess. 
Such power and dignity, unhampered by sentiment.

When you up and take your love away

You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me I will be around
And darling you'll always be the only one for me

A change in this place 
'cause I'm tearing off the fancy wrapping
Find an empty package 

Take for a while your trumpet from your lip 
Loosen your hold, loosen your grip 
On your old ways that have fallen out of step
In a changing time 
Hoist a new flag 
Hoist a new flag 

Angry sun burn down 
Judging us all
Guilty of neglect and disrespect
And thinking small 
And death by boredom 
And death by greed

More than we need

I see the same things 
Tired ideas 
Birds without wings

In excuses you can find 

Like you've had a hard day

Now you're too tired to care 
You've had a hard day 

Well across the fractured landscape 
I see the same things 
Tired ideas, broken values 
Many with the notion 
That to share is to lose 
A hollow people bound by a lack 
Of imagination and too much looking back

To give a new thing a chance

Swayin' on your sea
If I turn on the gas fire
By the rain rattled window
Won't you sail over to me

The hail storm tumbles
The rail line rumbles
You move in the porch with me
On an overcast day
The pale winter city
An afternoon's debauchery

Your blouse your skirt
I'll undo them so gentle
With beautiful care
I'm a lonely man
With five bottles of wine
I'd like you to share

The hail storm tumbles
The rail line rumbles
You move through the doors with me
On an overcast day
The pale winter city
An afternoon's debauchery

Afternoon becomes night
You drink your wine from a mug
There's cats at the backdoor
The snow is two inches

Then I've got no cares 
I'll lead you upstairs

About how dark she was inside

Like a feather
But who knows what's waiting
In the wings of time
Dry your eyes
We gotta go where we can shine

Don't be hiding in sorrow
Or clinging to the past
With your beauty so precious
And the season so fast
No matter how cold the horizon appear
Or how far the first night
When I held you near
You gotta rise from these ashes
Like a bird of flame
Step out of the shadow
We've gotta go where we can shine

For all that we struggle
For all we pretend
It don't come down to nothing
Except love in the end
And ours is a road
That is strewn with goodbyes
But as it unfolds
As it all unwinds

David Gray,"Cast your eyes into the distance
Try to focus on it all
Find a spirit of resistance
Instead of pride before the fall
Forge some opposition
From disparate strands
It ain't the prettiest position
As a century ends

Unstable situation
Faces made of wax
Streams of melting glass
Sheets of butchered facts
The roar of the machine
Hooded hearts and jeweled hands
And anger spilling out like gasoline
As a century ends

Everything I seen, 
Everything that I heard,
Ain't even the tip of the iceberg
Fire down memory lane
So pass me my rose tinted glasses again

Through a fog of contradiction
Out to the lake of tears
See society admiring its own reflection
Chase a light that shines and disappears
Careful what you say 'cause reality offends
Just sit back and let your soul decay
As a century ends

And it's easy to get weary
As you fight to get it done
'Gainst a popular theory
That it's over

Strain the limit of compassion
Tend a wound that never mends
And honesty's still out of fashion

David Gray,"The hour is out of joint
Black sun has risen
And the river of words
Is flowing on through 
The cages of tradition
And they're handing out emptiness
We'll take it 'cause it's given 
Free with this plastic innocence 
And these standards of living

Questions lighted questions
Burnin' holes into my head
Hanging like shadows o'er the sun
Staring out like the eyes of the dead
And sometimes my soul flickers
When the wind of change blows cold
Over the mire of repetition
Down the corridors of rigmarole

What I say, what I think
What I put down in ink
I'm only trying to find a way to understand
And I mean no harm
I'm just searching for calm
In the storm of mankind

Do you find it there 
In the sea of faces
That drowns you everyday
Or in the silence and rubble and empty spaces
Where children and rottweilers play
Is it buried in the praise
Given so cheap
With a meaningless movement of the jaws
In the looking glass 
That flatters you
Or in the rattle of hollow applause

Blind circle, moon and sun body willing, mind undone
One pain ending while another begins
Lies, ruin disease
Into wounds like these
Let the truth sting

From the hub to the limit
Through the urban hollows
Out into the poles of the extreme 
To echo through the numbness
Of these godless minutes
In the shadow of delusion's regime

And here watching the night
As it opens like a flower
And the day starts to rust
Feeling time pound
Like a silent hammer
On this empire of dust
And I'm thinking bout the bullet
And the TV screen, the dollar, and the clenched fist
And if we're searching for peace
How come we still believe 
In hatred as the catalyst

Oh through the borderline
In front and behind
One pain ending
While another begin
Lies, ruin disease
Into wounds like these
Let the truth sing
Yeah 
Let the truth

And I feel it from the pit of my stomach
Into the ditch of my mind
Inside the chambers of my heart
As I stare half blind
At these walls of cardboard
At this space that I've rented
At your beauty that is crumbling
Though you try so hard to prevent it

On and on
Body willing, mind undone
One pain ending while another begins
Lies, ruin, disease
Into wounds like these

David Gray,"A gutter full of rain
An empty picture frame
A house out at the edges of the city
Never noticing the war
'Till it's right there at your door
And suddenly your hands are bloody

I was seeking to possess
Now another girl's caress
Is on your flesh
The bitterness is tasted
There's nobody in your chair
No hand to touch my hair
The sun even the air seems wasted

Let it go now, let it all slip away
And we'll start it all over again
Me, like a million others before
Trying to make sense of the rain

Were these twenty years a dream
Was it ever as it seemed
Get to wonder if it really existed
'Cause the thief who stole my life
Has taken, too, my faith
I can see now how the world gets twisted

Let it go now, let it all slip away
And we'll start it all over again
Me, like a million others before
Trying to make sense of the rain

In spite of all the shame
Some times I hear your name
I think of us when we were younger
Then I'm shutting out the noise
Ans I'm trying to hear the voice
That used to tell me love was stronger

Light another cigarette
But the one I got's still lit
I can't seem to keep my fingers steady
Never noticing the war
'Till it's right there at your door
Ans suddenly your hands are bloody",Gutters Full of Rain,1996
David Gray,"Hold on to nothing
Hold on to coldest steel
It chills you down inside

Move it on along the rushing road

Write it down

Step down the alley
Walking against the stony crowd
Trying not to listen
Oh but they shout so loud
Chew you up and spit you out
Crush you 'tween its finger and its thumb
This world in all its anger
Oh and there's always more to come

There's nowhere to write it

David Gray,"Oh Mary Jane
She step on a train
Head for the city lights
Yearning inside
To swim with the tide
And taste it, alright
Bag on her shoulder
Breathing the cold
There by the metal tracks
She saw it all shine
And swore in her mind
She'd never go back

And she don't mind the late night late night radio
She don't mind the late night radio
She don't mind the late night late night radio 
Na na

Couldn't have dreamed
The things that she seen
There on the avenue
She stared right into a million eyes
That looked her right through
Telling Red Joe
The places she'd go
And wiping the table clean
She got no idea
The demon of fear
Or what a broken heart mean

And she don't mind the late night late night radio
She don't mind the late night radio
She don't mind the late night late night radio

Dirty and stark
Burning with yellow wings
Everyday come
With fever and hum
Who knows what it brings
Walking a wall
Without a thought
To fall and hit the ground

With eyes like the rain
Alive to the sound

Evening, watching the shadow come

Meet me with your arms of snow and
Meet me with your mouth undone

David Gray,"I'm raising up my voice
To the walls and to the sky
It seeks no explanation
It waits for no reply
Really it is nothing
Just a cry to the wilds

I'm delirious with chaos
I'm wonder struck with awe
In my soul I'm dreaming only
Of your velvet shore
When I'm walking there my face
Untangles like a child

And only the lonely
Only the lonely
Lonely could know me

I've been talking all night long
There's nothing more to say
So I'm searching every mirror
For a trace of yesterday
But the air it holds no traces
Where the eagles were flying

I'm haunted by the skyline
The concrete and the rain
The window speaks of winter
So I'll set my heart again
Somewhere in the dust 
A curlew is crying

And only the lonely
Only the lonely
Lonely could know me
I'm talking all night long
Talking all night

There's a copper moon that's buried
Where solitude expands
And distant planets moving
They're weighing on my hands
They're darkening my pages

And there's daylight in my fingers
But it's snowing in my bones
Been sucking on the echo
Of a thousand telephones
And when we meet again
We will be strangers

And only the lonely
Only the lonely
Lonely could know me
And only the lonely
Only the lonely
Lonely could know me",Only the Lonely,1996

Staring down the broken lines

You were right up there beside me
Tugging at my sleeve
And putting up your lipstick

I'm urging for the road
To speed these wheels

Since you opened up the door

See how the sky is made of sapphire
The colors flowing through our hands
The moon is fire in your hair
A million miles beyond what science understands
Smell that mountain heather
Although I don't remember ever
Feeling like this before
Mercy me, I'm falling free
Since you opened up the door

And if every window pane should shatter
If every wall should fall apart
Well it might hurt a bit
But wouldn't it matter
With this diamond in my heart
There's no need to nail it to the ground
There's no need to smother it with sense
Just listen to the rhythm of your heart
That pounds and trust it all to chance
'Cause we're standing face to face
With the Angel of Grace
And don't it just taste so pure

Seems to go nowhere

I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you'll think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way

Two ice cubes melting in a glass of white rum
Head for the places that I've never gone
(I can't get through to myself)
(Just can't get through to myself) 
Eight beggers choking on a slice of red pie
Two rivers freezing in a broken goodbye
No hesitation, just a kick in the eye
(I can't get through to myself)
(Just can't get through to myself) 
And we do a lot of learning everyday 
Or so it seems but the road it keeps turning 
And I'm right back here again
Blue leather jacket and a helium voice

If you do this for me then I will promise

There are lessons but I don't care

Yeah, but no one just a stranger I did find
I never noticed, hadn't seen it as it grew
The void between us where the flame turns blue

Different places, yeah, but they all look the same
Dreams of faces in the streets devoured by names
I'm in collision with every stone I ever threw
And blind ambition where the flame turns blue

Words dismantled, hey, and all the books unbound
Conversations though we utter not a sound
I heard a rumor, I don't know if it's true
That you'd meet me where the flame turns blue

So I venture underneath the leaden sky
See the freight train with it's one fierce eye
And then I listen as it tears the night in two
With a whistle and the flame turns blue

In the morning I will sing
In the morning I will sing

Through the lemon trees, the diamonds of light
Break in splinters on the pages where I write
That if I lost you I don't know what I'd do
Burn forever where the flame turns blue

With frozen smiles to chase love away

And I think it's going to rain today

Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street

To help the needy and show them the way

Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

David Gray,"From the very first moment I saw you
That's when I knew 
All the dreams I held in my heart
Had suddenly come true
Knock me over stone cold sober
Not a thing I could say I did
'Cause baby when I'm walking with you now
My eyes are so wide
Like you reached right into my head
And turned on the light inside
Turning on the light
Inside my mind hey

Come on baby it's alright
Sunday, Monday, day or night
Written blue on white it's plain to see
Be mine, be mine
That rainy shiny night or day
What's the difference anyway
Honey till your heart belongs to me

If I had some influence girl
With the powers that be
I'd have them fire that arrow at you
Like they fired it right at me
And maybe when your heart and soul are burning you might see 
That every time I'm talking with you
It's always over too soon
That everyday feels so incomplete
Till you walk into the room?
Say the word now girl
I'll jump that moon hey

Come on baby it's okay
Rainy shiny night or day
There's nothing in the way now
Don't you see
Be mine, be mine
Winter summer day or night
Centigrade or Fahrenheit
Baby till your heart belongs to me
Be mine, be mine

How can it be wrong now mercy me

David Grisman,"Many, many years ago when I was twenty-three
I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be.
This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red.
My father fell in love with her and soon they, too, were wed.

 This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life
For my daughter was my mother, 'cause she was my father's wife.
To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.

My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad
For if he was my uncle, then that also made him brother
To the widow's grown-up daughter, who, of course, was my step-mother.

My father's wife then had a son who kept them on the run
And he became my grand-child, 'cause he was my daughter's son.
My wife is now my mother's mother, and it makes me blue
Because, although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too.

If my wife is my grandmother, then I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it, it nearly drives me wild
For now I have become the strangest case you ever saw
(This has got to be the strangest thing I ever saw)
As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpaw.

In polished white mansion of stone, Maggie
Have each found a place of rest
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie

David Grisman,"Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens

And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Sayin', ""Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain""

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin

""Would you please not stare at me like that,"" he said
It's just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide

Well, Judas, he just winked and said
""All right, I'll leave you here
But you'd better hurry up and choose
Which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear""

I'm gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where you'll be
Judas pointed down the road
And said, ""Eternity""

""Eternity,"" said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
""That's right,"" said Judas Priest, ""Eternity
Though you might call it Paradise""

""I don't call it anything""
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
""All right,"" said Judas Priest
I'll see you after a while

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feelin' low and mean
When just then a passing stranger
Burst upon the scene

Saying, ""Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father is deceased?
Well, if you are
There's a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest""

""Oh, yes, he is my friend""
Said Frankie Lee in fright
I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight

""Yes, that's the one,"" said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
Well, my message is, he's down the road
Stranded in a house

Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand

""What kind of house is this,"" he said
Where I have come to roam?
""It's not a house,"" said Judas Priest
It's not a house, it's a home

Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over everything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll

He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman's face in every one

Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep

For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst

No one tried to say a thing
When they carried him out in jest,
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest

And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
Nothing is revealed

Well, the moral of the story
The moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong

So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin'
Help him with his load
And don't go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2017

Sings me of sweet things
My life there has its own wings
Fly over the mountain
Though I'm standing still

They come in between
The cities of tiring life
The trains come and go,
But inside you know
The struggle will soon be a fight

But soon the sun came through the trees
Around the next bend

Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf who has brought me to my knees

'Cause I'm falling to pieces

I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

Did she lie and wait
Was I bait, to pull you in
The thrill of the kill
You feel, is a sin
I lay with the wolves
Alone, it seems
I thought I was part of you

David Guetta,"Don't say nothing 
Love in the fall 
God saint child 
Don't you miss of it all 

The Joan of Arc 
Kiss in the dark; she's a Firestone 
Catching all; watch her burn 
So so pretty; cutting her hair 
Dark star spirit now she's up in the gutter 
Kills her feeling; keep us in here 
Come out saint, but she called a healing 
Don't say nothing; love in the fall 
God saint child; don't you miss of it all 

[Chorus]
The Joan of Arc 
Kiss in the dark; she's a Firestone 
Catching all; watch her burn 
The Joan of Arc 
It's such a shock 
Watching her getting out 
Let it out 
Lips are burning (The Joan of Arc) 

White heart city, jungle in here 
Hang low spinning, now she's lost in the mirror 
Heart spits ripping, 
Strikes up busy bodies suffer the fever 
All saints come one you loving the fall 
Go my child, look away from it all

Is it truth or a lie
To work in safe till you die
Or this too, all insane

David Guetta,"This is the point of no return
'Cause this is where we crash and burn
And now every time i face this pain
I can hear it coming back again
It's the sound of letting go.

It's the sound of letting go.
It's the sound of letting go.
It's the sound of letting go.
It's the sound of letting go.

Breaking up and breaking down
This is what we've come to now
What's the use we can't deny
Can't you hear it?
It's the sound of letting go.

We could go around all day
Fine excuses we can say
In the silence i can hear
Can't you feel it?
It's the sound of letting go.

It's getting louder and louder
What we gonna do?
It's getting louder and louder
Fillin' up the room.
I can hear it hear it
Comin' over us.

I can hear it tellin' me that we had enough

It's getting louder and louder
What we gonna do?

David Guetta,"It's complicated
It always is
That's just the way it goes
Feels like I've waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows

Head under water
Now I can't breathe
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could

When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
'Cause something's here tonight

Give me a reason
I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload
And this time I blame you
Looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right, like I know you can
We could lose it all

When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
'Cause something's here tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I-I-I'll be loving you all the time, it's true
Cause I-I-I'll want to make it right, with you

David Guetta,"After tonight, there'll be no coming home soon
No tears of regret, no smell of her perfume
No more dancing feet, to the beats that go boom
While I watch the sunrise all alone in my room

Tonight there'll be no pouring rain
No eyes wide shut to your never ending game
After tonight there'll be no me and you
No distant memories past for me to hold on to

See everybody's working to hold on to what they know
So I guess I kept believe in my tonight will never go
Some spend a lifetime searchin' trying to figure out
When hell stops and heaven begins

How soon is now?",How Soon Is Now,2009
