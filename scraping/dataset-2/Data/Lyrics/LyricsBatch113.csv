Dave Simonett,"Well we blew past the army motorcade-and 
It's abnormal load haulage the gravity of the situation 
Came on us like a bit of new knowledge the bubbliest bubble bath 
Broke down on the bank the gravity of the situation 
Is why our old thought bubbles sank humble 
And gracious the gravity of the situation 

Well, a fat hungry english crow is picking at a badger carcass 
The gravity of the situation is hard to focus and harness well, 
We met Bill Lowery at the Queen's Hal lthe gravity of the situation 
Became apparent to us all

Humble and gracious the gravity of the situation",Gravity of the Situation,
Dave Smith,"So tired, tired of these drama
No more, no more
I want to be free
I'm so tired, so tired

Broken heart again
Another lesson learn
Better know your friends
Or else you will get burn
Gotta count on me
Cause I can guarantee
That I'll be fine

No more pain (no more pain)
No more pain (no more pain)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
no one's gonna make me hurt again

Why'd I play the fool
Go through ups and downs
Knowing all the time
You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress
Cause I was young and restless
But that was long ago
I don't want to cry no more

No more pain (no more pain)
No more game (no more game messin with my mind)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
Nooone's gonna make me hurt again
No more tears (no more tears, I'm tired of cryin everynight)
No more fears (no more fears, I really don't want to cry)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
I don't ever want to hurt again
want to speak my mind, want to speak my mind

Uh, it feel so good
When you let go
Avoid these drama in your life
Now you're free from all the pain
Free from all the game
Free from all the stress
So find your happiness
I don't know
Only God knows where the story ends for me
But I know where the story begins
It's up to us to choose
Whether we win or loose
And I choose to win

No more pain (no more pain)
No more game (tired of your playin' game with my mind)
No drama (no more drama in my life)
No more, no more, No more, no more
No more tears (no more tears, no more cryin every night)
No more fears (no more waking be up in the morning)
No drama, no more in my life 

No more drama, no more drama
No more drama, no more drama
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
NO MORE DRAMA
No more drama in my life
So tired, tired of these drama",Love at First Sight,2005

Dave Stahl Band,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Dave Stamey,"Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle on
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
To many words, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

Dave Stein,"Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
Until I first met you, I was lonesome
And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
And this old world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

So much time but not enough
Self-inflicted pain can come

Trying to find a means to some kind of peace

Dave Stewart,"In this world of ups and downs my dreams all fall through
Things just don't work out, no matter what I do
Disappointment haunts me, through each lonely day
The world around I see, in only shades of gray

But when the love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world I never knew, I'm in a different world
A world so sweet and true, I'm in a different world

I'm no longer just another face in a crowd
Hey, look into my eyes, you'll see I'm strong and I'm proud
You are all the sweetness of my life, you see
You have brought heaven right here on earth to me
No man of wealth, I know I'll ever be
But I'll be satisfied just knowing you love me

On the stage of life I've played a loser's part
It seems like I've been down right from the very start
Every time I lift myself up off the ground
Something always happens to bring the curtain down

But when your love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world so warm and sweet, I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me, I'm in a different world

Each time you speak my name or put your hand in mine
The empty life I knew, I leave it far behind
'Cause you gave me the love that I truly felt
Most of all you made me believe in myself
You're more than a love to me, you're my way of life
I'll forever cherish you, more each day and night

Oh,
I'm in a different world

A world that's warm, a world that's sweet
A world that's every bit complete
A world that's real, you've made me see
All the beauty surrounding me
Oh, look what you've done for me
Oh, look what you've done for me
I'm in a different world, now that you've been loving me

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.

Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around

I can't stand this pain much longer.

cold and alone, no comfort in sight.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

And mail it right away

My mother was a tailor

Is a suitcase and a trunk

Is when he's on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim
And hell pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin' from town to town

Not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans

She laughed at everything she saw 'til she nearly broke her jaw
Nearby I saw a big balloon which proved to be my friend

Dave Van Ronk,"And so weve had another night
Of poetry and poses,
And each man knows hell be alone
When the sacred ginmill closes.

And so well drink the final glass
Each to his joy and sorrow
And hope the numbing drink will last
Til opening tomorrow.

And when we stumble back again
Like paralytic dancers
Each knows the question he must ask
And each man knows the answer.

And so well drink the final drink

that cuts the brain in sections
Where answers do not signify
And there arent any questions.

I broke my heart the other day.
It will mend again tomorrow.
If Id been drunk when I was born
Id be ignorant of sorrow.

And so well drink the final toast
That never can be spoken:
Heres to the heart that is wise enough
To know when its better off broken.",Last Call,1994
Dave Van Ronk,"[Chorus]
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high,
All these things that won't change, come what may.
Well our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on.
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

Think I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall.
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for.
Yet I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more.

[Chorus]

If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good.
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare,
But by then it would be winter, not much for you to do.
And the winds can sure blow cold way up there.

So sweet, cool and so fair

She may search this whole wide world over

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Walkin' a road other men have gone down.
I'm seein' your world of people and things,
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.

Hey, hey Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
'Bout a funny ol' world that's a-comin' along.
Seems sick an' it's hungry, it's tired an' it's torn,
It looks like it's a-dyin' an' it's hardly been born.

Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that I'm a-sayin' an' a-many times more.
I'm a-singin' you the song, but I can't sing enough,
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.

Here's to Cisco an' Sonny an' Leadbelly too,
An' to all the good people that traveled with you.
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.

I'm a-leaving' tomorrow, but I could leave today,
Somewhere down the road someday.
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Is to say I've been hittin' some hard travelin' too.

Dave Venn,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Dave Wakeling,"It's too late now, it's twenty past two
I spent the night just watchin' you
I watched you dance
I watched you move
Can't breath and still I watched you move away

Now I think quite a lot 
As I stare at my shoes
About all these things 
That I put myself through
There's nothing to say and there's nothing to do
You're just too nice to talk to
Too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to

The right lines wouldn't come out for you
I glance but you just stared me through
Felt such a fool I felt you knew
But you might tell me to go away

Now I think quite a lot 
Of my own point of view
Is that all I have that's in common with you
Your emotions so guarded
My heart is retarded 
You're too nice to talk to
Too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to

This evening hasn't gone like I planned
Should I take the situation in hand
Can't go on but I can't seem to dance
You chain my feet, I stamp and stamp and stamp
Because nothing I do ever seems to be right
The same line to mind every Saturday night
Out the window you might say I'm out of of my mind
But you're too nice to talk to
Too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to
Too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to

Combed my hair in a thousand ways, but I came out lookin' just the same

I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave
But remember one thing, don't lose your head to a woman that'll spend your bread
So I got out
 
Paris was a place you could hide away, if you felt you didn't fit in
French police wouldn't give me no peace, they claimed I was a nasty person
Down along the left bank, minding my own
Was knocked down by a human stampede
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot, when all I wanted was a cup of tea
I was accused
 
I moved on
Down in rome I wasn't getting enough 
Of the things that keep a young man alive
My body stunk, but I kept my funk at a time when I was right out of luck
Getting desperate, indeed I was looking like a tourist attraction
Oh, my dear, I better get out of here for the vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no, no
 
I moved right out east, yeah
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry, sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slant-eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon
Shanghai lil never used the pill, she claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh, people, I was glad I found her
Oh, yeah, I was glad I found here
 
I firmly believed that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete  
Look how wrong you can be
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe 
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slant-eyed lady knocked me off my feet

That sin could ever leave

Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

Anyone can whistle any old day, easy
It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why can't I

I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me

It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why, why can't I
I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me

Dave Young,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,2000
Dave Young,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000

Well I got the notion girl that you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours

Standing in the back looking around?
Are you going to waste your time thinking
How you've grown up
Or how you missed out?

Where's it going to get you acting serious?
Things are never going to be quite what you want
Even at twenty five you got to start sometime

I'm on my feet
I'm on the floor
I'm good to go
All I need is just to hear a song I know
I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight

Are you gonna to live your life standing in the back looking around?
Are you going to waste your time?
Gotta make a move or you'll miss out

Someone's gonna to ask you what it's all about
Stick around nostalgia won't let you down
Someone's gonna to ask you what's it's all about
What are you gonna have to say for yourself?

I'm on my feet

I wanna always feel like part of this was mine
I wanna fall in love tonight

Our house in the middle of the street
(Crimson and clover, over and over)
Why did we ever meet
Start in my rock and roll fantasy
(Crimson and clover, over and over)
Don't don't don't let's start
(Crimson and clover, over and over)
Why did we ever part
Kick start my rock and roll heart

I'm on my feet

Día why noche esperando a que vinieras por mi
Why ahora estas aquí

Why todas esas cosas que piensas hablar
Me pones sexy, sexy

I'm feelin' love in the deepest fall
Give you the keys and all

Dime si quizás este amor es de verdad

""Girl, I want you, girl, I need you""

Esta historia llena de amor nunca tendrá fin
Why puedo jurar que nadie más hará
Los juegos que inventamos a la mar
Comernos los labios hasta sangrar, ah

Don't you see me with my girl, what you thinkin' it was?
I know you're used to seein' me in the clubs
Different chicks, sippin' Cris', just a million in dubs

But I've changed, only got eyes for her
Believe me, ain't no girl dividin' us
We could maybe elope, have a baby and all

May well be simple but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do

Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No-one can offer you more
You know what I mean
Have your eyes really seen?

You say you find it hard
To lead the life that we once knew
But there's no other way
So now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must learn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

Wait by the door and no letter come
Today I walk in a dream
Through the streets, out to the stream
Where we lay, I know when I'm gone you'll cry for me

Just how they want I know in my heart

I might do, and oh when I'm gone you'll cry for me

Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day

I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now

We were young and wild and free.

Now nothing can take you away from me. We been down that road before
But that's over now. You keep me coming back for more.

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms.
I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven.
And love is all that I need.
And I found it there in your heart.
It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven.

David,"This story is about love
The woman I loved is dead

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy

They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea

A little child and sailed about
But very wise, was he

And then one day, one magic day he passed my way 
While we spoke of many things fools and kings, this he said to me

The greatest thing, you'll ever learn
Is just to love, and be loved in return",Nature Boy,2007
David,"High, high flames and boiling water
Still nobody knew
Stare at the ceiling, make way for something
Still nobody moves
Oh my goodness, oh my god I fear
Oh my goodness, oh my god I fear
I fear I'm cracking up

One million feelings is this for real I ask
Nobody knows
Somebody's daughter made me walk on water
Don't let me sink
I think I'm stupid, luxury problems still
I think I'm stupid, luxury problems still
It's more than I can take

Crying in the basement, what can I say
But I am so very sorry
Who would've thought that it would ever dry

The moment is here;
I'm not gonna waste no time.
I am set; have no regrets

It's such a heavy load.
A big chance with no circumstance.
I said, fame and glory were my domain.
The lights went out and it wasn't the same.
I was neclected; I was denied.
How I wish you knew how I felt inside.
Mind was tired, my body was weak,
But you weren't a friend 'cause you didn't speak.

No regrets for the times I was denied.
I got no regrets for the times you pushed me aside.
No regrets 'cause you got it going.

By anyone, anything, in this world.

Never believe I'm not a person.
In my heart, in mind, and soul;
Gonna tell you one more time, girl.

On a losing streak
And a lot of bodies unburied
And there comes a time
When you cannot turn the other cheek
You have got to ride the ferry
Past the battered old bodies
Of dead dead dreamers
Past the tethered and fettered and
Desk bound schemers
The punks and the drunks and the
Bad guitar players and the dewy eyed
Teenage dragon slayers

Where you can say I
Just want to work with you

We have to do

Do the things that we know we have to do

That someday this will all fall apart
For right now let's just be heroes

Took a break today he
Pulled out all the wires
He looked out the window at the
Rainy rainy day and he
Wondered about the future of fire
As he leaned back in his chair
With a long cold fishy eyed stare
He looked like December until he
Remembered
The day he'd said I
Just want to work with you
As we do the tings that we
Know we have to do ever
Hopeful and ever

Have to do

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

She swore that I would be special

And the record's broken
And as I walk through every room of my life,

Thinking I can never take the edge of anything
And shape it to a perfect ball
And let it roll down the hall

It's going to be a beautiful day 

By the way 
Can you see that I'm slipping away 
Just pass my shirt darling 
I can't be late today 

Ladahoo 
Being alone together 
Making talk about the weather 
Ladahoo

Being alone together 
No this can't go on forever 
There's so much work to do 
Cleaning up this place 

All those souvenirs
Taking up closet space 
She stands in the doorway 
Hot tears rolling down her face 

It don' feel right for her 
To be alone around the place 
Ladahoo being alone together 
Making talk about the weather 

Ladahoo being alone together 
No this can't go on forever forever forever 
And my little sister told me 
She said I'm better off this way

She said my future's all that matters 
And if I'm just a little bit tattered 
Still I'm better off
I'm better of this way 

She thought I was a hero tee hee hee 
I thought she was a godness

David + David,"Fifteen long years
On a losing streak
And a lot of bodies unburied
And there comes a time
When you cannot turn the other cheek
You have got to ride the ferry
Past the battered old bodies
Of dead dead dreamers
Past the tethered and fettered and
Desk bound schemers
The punks and the drunks and the
Bad guitar players and the dewy eyed
Teenage dragon slayers
You come to this place
Where you can say I
Just want to work with you
As we do the things that we know
We have to do
Ever hopeful and ever blue we
Do the things that we know we have to do
And though we all know deep down in our hearts
That someday this will all fall apart
For right now let's just be heroes

The telegraph man
Took a break today he
Pulled out all the wires
He looked out the window at the
Rainy rainy day and he
Wondered about the future of fire
As he leaned back in his chair
With a long cold fishy eyed stare
He looked like December until he
Remembered
The day he'd said I
Just want to work with you
As we do the tings that we
Know we have to do ever
Hopeful and ever
Blue we do the things the things that we know we
Have to do
Yeah we both know deep down in our hearts
Someday this will all fall apart
For right now let's just be heroes",Heroes,1986

But it's getting on midnight 
And the river's gonna rise 
It's gonna rise 
There'll be dancing in the street
When the river done rise 
Cold wind is blowing 
Flags flapping much too slow 
The monkey men sell paradise 
To the girls from Tupelo
Black shirted boys in the badlands 
Play machine gun rodeo

With folks that got nowhere to go 
But the river's gonna rise

Washed his hands

Seems like a dream 
While he washes away his sorrow 
But either way I can tell that he prays 
There will never be another tomorrow

To see the doubt and choose it over knowing how or when;
Love's enough to know if she'd refuse it,

That's the one and only time.

She's taken to sleeping all night in his chair
Together they both had a reason for living
Back when the felling of loving was there

Then she took to dreaming when he wasn't looking
And he took to looking for moments alone
Together they drifted apart from each other
Together they both knew the felling was gone

Gone like the sparrow south for the winter
Gone like the river out to the sea
Gone like the leaves from the trees when its snowing
Gone like the love that they once gave so free

Till he took to starring at his lonesome shadow
And she took to humming the words to some song
They both felt it slipping that feeling of giving
Leaving the feeling of being alone

Each of them reach out for the other

David Allan Coe,"She's just a tear I used to cry long before we said good bye
Now she's just a lady that I used to know
When the bottle took her place she was a mirror I had to face
And a dream I dared to dream some time ago

I lost her eyes to a whole bunch of Pena Coladas
After a few margaritas I took all the blame
For drinking Manhattans at tree in the morning I lost her
Between the vodka and gin and the beer and champagne

I lost her lips late one night on a strawberry daiquiri
Jack Daniels, whiskey and rum couldn't help me that time
I lost her arms and her hands to a glass of tequila
I lost her heart and her soul to a bottle of wine

I lost a bet that our love would last forever
Sloe gin and tonic was making my heart hard to find
With two bloody Mary's I ran out of vodka this morning
Losing my chances of drinking her off of my mind",Lost,1979
David Allan Coe,"Back in 1953, we stole a car old Merle and me
Never thinking wed be put in jail
You might say that we were green, I was barely seventeen
When they put those bars between old Merle and me

Late one night we hit the wall, twenty feet we had to fall
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds
Waiting for that shotgun blast, never thinking we could last
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle and me

We were young and crazy then, it was easy to pretend
Acting like wed never been in reform school
Looking danger in the eye, walking with our heads held high
We were not afraid to die, old Merle and me

We were living by the gun, never caring what wed done
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know
We would die and go to hell before we broke our vow to tell
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle and me

How was Merle or me to know, we would end up on death row
Waiting for our turn in the electric chair
Shot down in a grocery store, we got busted at the door
Praying wasn't easy for old Merle and me",Merle and Me,1979

It wasn't nothing she had done or nothing she could say
To change this old familiar feeling that makes chills run through my skin
Less she read my mind and saw the sings that point around the bend
My toothbrush never leaves my pocket there's no anchor on my feet
If my sleepin' bag gets dusty and there's not enough to eat
I may stay an extra day till I find another town
You can bet there's not a lady that can show this freight train down
And I'll be moving in the morning leaving you behind

Somebody walking down the highway with a guitar in his hand
And I'll always be remembered as a free born rambling man

Thrown without no caution to the wind
I left her like the empty bottle lyin' on the ground

She was greener than the grass we laid on underneath that Alabama sun
I guess she should have known that ol' highway was my home

I said she was prettier than Paris in the rain
Lord I filled her full of gypsy lies
Swearin' I'd be coming back to fetch her in the spring

She looked about as simple as the cotton dress I've torn
Sneakin' in her house at 3 a.m.
Her mama liked to question me the day after and I was sure

David Allan Coe,"It was too cold to stay in the north 
And LA seemed the most likely place I could be
Those Malibu nights and those Hollywood lights
Were blinding me
I longed for a lover to help me discover 
The key that would unlock love's door
While diving the reefs 
Lord, she changed my beliefs
As we made love on the ocean's floor
And she whispered

Divers do it deeper 
Jockeys do it shorter
Bricklayers always make it just a little bit stronger (stronger)
Sailors do it wetter 
Soldiers do it better
But cowboys stay in the saddle just a little bit longer

I moved from LA for a good job with pay 
Riding range for the Double Bar Jay
Till the rodeo came and I put in my name 
For the bull riding contest that day
The judges were watching 
But they never noticed
The girl standing close to my chute
She'd picked me to win 
I could tell by her grin 
As she reached out and platted my boot
And she said

Divers do it deeper 
Pilots do it higher
Bricklayers always make it just a little bit stronger (stronger)
Doctors do it cleaner
Bikers do it meaner
Cowboys stay in the saddle just a little bit longer

Why she worships the ground that he walks on
She waits up for him at night and worries
Until he's safely home
And she always believes his stories about working overtime
And in twenty years beside him, cheating's never crossed her mind

Aw but it crossed his
Early last summer
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall 
He gave in
And now he wishes he could stop himself
But theres no easy way
So he lays down with his lover
And silently he prays

Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know

In his heart and soul
He knew that he was playing a game he could never win
But you know, forbidden fruit is sweet
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again
And now he's giving up on looking for a way to fight the feeling
So he prays this simple pray
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling

And fought with my back to the wall
Sometimes down to nothin'

They can take what they want to

David Allan Coe,"You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall

He only had a dollar to live on ?till next Monday
But he spent it all on comfort for his mind
Did you say you think he's blind?

Someone should call his parents or a sister or a brother
And they'll come and take him back home on a bus
But he?ll always be a problem to his poor and puzzled mother
And he?ll always be another one of us

He said he wanted heaven but prayin? was too slow
So he bought a one-way ticket on an airline made of snow
Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low

You say it was this mornin? when you last saw your good friend
Lyin? on the sidewalk with the misery on his brain
Stoned on some new potion he found upon the wall
Of some unholy bathroom in some ungodly hall

Did you say you saw your good friend flyin? low
Dyin? slow, blinded by snow

David Allan Coe,"Love Is A Never Ending War (D. Blackwell)

Well I dozed off in the back of the bus
To the groan of the Greyhounds throttle
And I woke to crack of a paper sack
And a cork poppin' from a bottle
I tell you son the old man said
It was hell in world war two
As he rolled up his pant leg
I saw the wood that filled his shoe
The younger man who followed him in opened up his vest
Showed the older soldier where he caught one in the chest
Both of them had purple hearts for the hell that they've been through
Well I don't have no purple heart mine's just black and blue

Chorus:
Oh love is a never ending war
March me into action
And we'll train for what's in store
You win some and you lose some
But I believe in what I'm fightin' for
Oh love is a never ending war

They where half-way through that bottle
And they where gettin' high
I never fought in those two wars
But Lord my throat was dry
So I showed them scars and stitches
Inflicted by Maria
But I didn't think that would give me a drink
So I blamed it on Korea
I parted my hair and I showed them where
I got shrapnel from a grenade
I just couldn't tell it was where Annabelle
Put a glas of lemonade
How that I've been tortured by the blade of a bajonet
And I never forget that hot August night
And the fingernails of Jeanet

Chorus

As I neared my destination I saw tears well in their eyes
Partly from the drinkin' but mostly from my lies
And they stood up to salute me
As I stepped down from the bus
And out of the open window they yelled
Give her hell for us

Chorus

But you know, forbidden fruit is sweet
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again
And now he's giving up on looking for a way to fight the feeling
So he prays this simple pray
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling

Where little kids can follow after

Old man, can you show me the way

He shakes his head from time to time 
And rambles somewhere in his mind
Mumbling 'bout the Civil War 
And how we should have won

Settin' up his battle plans 
On checkerboards at his command
Watchin' all his gallant kings 
Go falling one by one

And son he'd say there's not much time 
For you to straighten out your mind
But you never listen to

River you keep flowing 
Like you know just where you're going
But river will you ever take me home

That you're still running free

We sure got lost there dad and mom and me
He'd let me steer on the straitways as we drove from town to town
We knew that daddy's Gypsy blood wouldn't let him settle down
There were times he'd sit right down just plain hung his head
But he'd always lift it up and smile whenever mama said
Shine it on my man. 

Papa's gone but Lord his blood is running through my veins

As if it was painted that way
The waves how they rush from the shore or the island
It carries my vision away

The sun seems to blind that part of my mind
That's searching for yesterday's rhymes
It's the first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love

She lays there and tosses her head on the pillow
She peeks from the blanket to see
She looks like a child but acts like a woman
Whenever she reaches for me

Her touch burns my skin and that makes me frightened
She looks like a photograph there
Its the first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love

Yes, it's hard to believe I spent all this time here alone
Trying to forget the heartaches that broke up our home
Now they're gone

Why, she's seen it all, from the start to the fall
She knew I'd need some place to hide
My wife, she had taking the baby and left me
With all of this hatred inside

She's been my friend, she helped me get over
And now that I'm better I see
The first day of something
And I wonder if it could be love

David Allan Coe,"If I ever needed love, I need it now
Honey, why can't you see me through me
When I pretend that I'm to strong to bend?
This heart can mend a lover or a friend
Stop acting like you never knew me

How you fantasize, telling little lies
Fairy tales are all you ever see
Don't you realize how you hypnotize
Anyone who's fool enough to look back into your eyes?
And fall in love with you

If I ever wanted someone babe I need you now
Please don't place your self above me
Just out of reach when you could learn to teach
Me to begin loving you again
Why are you doing this to me?
",Fall in Love With You,1995
David Allan Coe,"Hey, California you don't know me, New York City you can't show me
Anything I haven't seen at least a hundred times before
I still love you, New Orleans, Mississippi River Queen
?Cause when it comes to lovin' you beat all I've ever seen

And I've seen a lot of ladies in my time
I've had me a few women that were fine
Ah, but I don't need no city woman messin' with my mind
So goodbye San Francisco girl, I'm leavin' you behind

And I've had some senoritas down in Mexico
I met a few potatoes up in Idaho
I've had a few peaches in Georgia and that San Antoine rose
If the good Lord made any better that you
He's the only one who knows

I SPENT A LIFETIME IN PRISON BELIEVING ID NEVER GET OVER THE FALL

BUSTED FOR FIRST DEGREE I WAS TO BLIND TO SEE WHO WAS TO BLAME FOR IT ALL

SOME SAID THE DEVIL, BUT GOD ONLY KNOWS IF I PUT MY FUTURE IN HIM

OTHER FOLKS BET THAT ID NEVER GET ON MY FEET AGAIN



RUNNING AND JUMPING FREE AS A BIRD JUST LIKE A CHILD LEFT TO PLAY

FREEDOM WAS ONE MORE THING I TOOK FOR GRANTED UNTIL THEY TOOK IT AWAY



MARRIAGES BREAKUP AND SOME PEOPLE TAKE UP DRINKING TO MAKE THEM FORGET

BOTH OF THEM SWEARING, NEITHER ONE CARING WISHING THAT THEY NEVER MET

TAKING THE CHILD AWAY, WHO CARES WHAT CHILDREN SAY UNTIL THEY TURN INTO MEN

SOMEDAY YOU'LL SEE I'm GONNA BE ON MY FEET AGAIN



AND I LEFT MY STOMACH IN HOUSTON ON SOME SURGEONS KNIFE BUT I SLEEP THOUGH IT ALL

IN THE RECOVERY ROOM FATE DEALT THE CARDS TO SOON TAKING MY LEGS IN THE FALL

WHEEL CHAIRS TURN INTO CANES TILL I LEARNED TO WALK PLACES THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN

NOW THAT I'm FREE ITS GOOD TO BE ON MY FEET AGAIN




",On My Feet Again,1995
David Allan Coe,"You know as a child, he heard tell of the seven mile bridge
That connected on marathon shore
Yes and it was the gateway key west his grandpa
Had told him ten times or more

The stories of some sailors curse on the bridge
Where it opens to let the boats through
But the natives all laugh at grandpas old stories
And swear that it just isn't true

Now most of them sail across to Miami
From the edge of the blue water line
With craw fish and snappers to sell at the market
For money to spend on some wine

They always cross through at the seven mile bridge
Except when the moon comes out full
They're not superstitious they tell you as they are
Repeating that old seaman's rule

Watch out for those outlaws and pirates
Lord knows that they'll steal you blind
Don't mess around with those cutthroats and thieves
They're robbers and killers of time

And there's nothing worse than an old sailors curse
On the seven mile bridge where you find
They're stealing the future and making believe
The past is still somewhere behind

The seven mile bridge, the seven mile bridge
And he found a woman who'd come here from Cuba
She gave him a son and a dream
They lived in a conch house somewhere on stock island

With the seven mile bridge in between
She'd spent her nights on the window walk wondering
If he'd safely pull through the storm
While he spent his money on painted up women

And whiskey to keep his blood warm
Then he'd gamble on crab races till he was broke
While she sat up waiting all night
Then felling too guilty to face her and tell her

He'd look for some bully to fight
At the end of the rainbow where the sun always shines
Just south of the seven mile bridge
She waits at the window for signs of his sailboat

And tries not to worried the kids
She sneaks a few drinks from the bottle she hides
From a husband that's to tired to think
With feelings of guilt she picks up the bottle

And pours the remains in the sink
Now she thinks of the men that stare at her boldly
They know she's a woman alone

With fingers that tremble she touches her body
And wishes her man would come home
Now the years pass so quickly for time is a thief
His skin looks like leather by now

His woman's got fat and lost all he
But, Lord, she's lived up to her vow
She looks at her son that's going on twenty
He's ready to live his own life

She hopes he can find a sea worthy woman
A sailor sure needs a good wife
Why he's just like his daddy
She thinks as she watches
Him weaving those fish nets all day

Knowing that some time the seven mile bridge
Will take him and lead him astray
He might return his woman would learn
Broke like his daddy and drunk

She wrote down some words on an old piece of sail cloth
Nailed it over his bunk
Why then, she packed his sea bag and filled up his trunk
His new wife would want it that way

Just before the old man shook the younger lads hand
These are the words he did say
",Seven Mile Bridge,1995
David Allan Coe,"Sudden death, that's what you are
Loving you is like riding in a speeding car
They're fun to drive until you drive 'em to far
Sudden death, that's what you are

The way you love me, my heart starts to pumping
Just like a rabbit, hon, you really got me jumping
You must be out for blood the way that you've been humping
I'm just like putty in your hands

Your kiss of love still lingers here on my lips
You've got electric, honey, in your fingertips
I like the way your hair hangs down to your hips
I'm just like putty in your hands
",Sudden Death,1995
David Allan Coe,"Standing in the bathroom with a gun in my hand
Pulling on the trigger just as fast as I can
I can hear her scream as she reaches for the lover beside her
Married by the Bible, she was only sixteen

I was fresh from prison trying to follow my dream
Who'd ever thought I'd be the judge and the jury that tried her?
Blood splattered all over the wall
The gun still smoking as I watch it fall

I run through the door while the sirens blow out on the highway
Maybe they'll catch me and maybe they won't
It really doesn't matter I just had to do things my way
Yeah, yeah, I might just commit suicide, yeah, yeah

He's the only man that I trusted with my life
I can't understand why he ran off with my wife
Now that they're dead what's gonna happen to the baby?
The state will have to raise her just the way they did me

Her mother wanted freedom and I just set her free
She should have never let me see that she was no longer a lady
She called out my name just before she died
She swore she loved me and I almost cried

With trembling hands I reached out and tried to save her
Cheating is something I can understand
But not when it's cheating with my best friend
She betrayed the love and the baby I gave her",Suicide,1995
David Allan Coe,"Yes, the roof leaks and the bed she squeak
And the rent is due in just two more weeks
Now I just want to go back to sleep
Tomorrow is another day

Oh, the palm trees sway to and fro
I think I'll just sit and watch the coconuts grow
It's hard to get high when your feeling so low
And tomorrow is another day

Well, the mainsail broke on my fishing boat
And it's almost time for my rum and Coke
I'll fix it as soon as I have a smoke
Tomorrow is another day, yeah

So you go at night with your lantern bright
And you sit on the bridge and you get half tight
Ah, tonight you can't get the fish to bite
But tomorrow's another day, yeah, yeah

Tomorrow is another day
You know what I mean, son?
I want to go fishing and swimming
Looking at the pretty girls on the beaches, son
I don't want to do no work",Tomorrow Is Another Day,1995
David Allan Coe,"I never made it back to Boston
I've always been a rambling man
But by the time I got to Phoenix
She didn't quite fit in my plans

I lost my heart in San Francisco
And found it in the streets of Baltimore

There must be someone wanting true love
Could it be you?
Hey vie got so much inside me to give
What can I do?

It seemed that Rachel's wings got colder
She finally crossed loves cheating line
She fell for some young Dallas cowboy
Hey, I never saw the danger signs

Whiskey and women was my weakness
Jack Daniels let me down again

And you think that she's mine but you don't realize
I'm just someplace to come when it rains
Someplace to hide when she's tired of the ride just someone to soften my pain
Lord knows where she plays on her warm sunny days
I'm just someplace to come when she can't find the sun
Just someplace to come when it rains

The lady she dances so close in your arms you swear she can float you away
And gives you the feeling you're safe from all harm
Just as long as she holds you that way
And I can't say it's wrong cause I've known all along
That her lovin' is worth all the pain
So whenever she leads I'll be there when she needs someplace to come when it rains
Someplace to hide when she's tired...

Bought a motorcycle in his younger days
Rode into Kentucky to join the outlaw band
Fuzzy taught me how to make a livin' off the land
Fuzzy ran a tractor in the early mornin' dew
Taught me how to plant the crops, and showed me what to do
Stitch and Stew sat on the porch while Debbie fixed a meal
Turpentine my old brown horse was grazin' in the field

Dirty blond and curly wearing pants of faded blue

David Allan Coe,"Maria has a music box she winds up most every day
Once a week is all it takes to make the music play
Melody is just some childhood lullaby her mother used to sing to her
And the road down to the city goes right by Maria's door
I often walk right by her house on my way to the store
Up there where those Italian mothers dress their shivering bambinos for the rain
She tells me about Jesus and all his gallant men I tell her about fantasy
Maria she's this lady on my way down to the river Maria she's a mystery
Maria she's a mystery

Yeah passing by this morning I drew a picture in my hand
Our bodies in some candlelight that glowed upon our skin
Maybe if I touched her she would disappear like angels in a dream
She tells me about Jesus

I don't think I can go on

David Allan Coe,"My daddy was an honest man, just a redneck Georgia farm boy
My momma spent her short life, raisin' kids and bailin' hay
And I was just fifteen when I ached inside to wonder
So I hoped a freight in Waycross and I rode it to L.A.

Well, I met a girl known on the strip as San Francisco's Maybel Joy
Destitution's child, born on a L.A. street called Shane
And sleep came and left this little Waycross Georgia country boy
Maybel Joy was gone, Lord, I'd never see her again

Growin' up came quietly in the arms of Maybel Joy
Laughter found our morning's, brought new meaning to my life
I woke up one day, Lord to find that I was by myself
With dreams of Georgia cotton and California wine

Sunday mornin' found me standin' 'neath the red-light of her door
Right 'cross sent me reelin', laid me face down on the floor
In place of Maybel Joy I found a merchant mad marine
Who said, ""Your Georgia neck is red but son you're still green""

Well, I turned twenty one in gray rock federal prison
The judge, he had no mercy on this Waycross, Georgia boy
Sometimes at night in silence, Lord, I'd listen
That same old freight to take me back to Maybel Joy

Cold nights had no pity on this Waycross, Georgia farm boy
Springtime turned to summer and then the winter came
Starin' at those four gray walls in silence, Lord, I'd listen
Somewhere in the distance to the whistle of the train

Sunday morning found me lying 'neath the red light of her door
With a bullet in my side I cried, ""Have you seen Maybel Joy?""
Stunned and shaken someone said, ""Son, she don't live here no more""
She left this town ten years ago, I heard she's looking for
Some Georgia farm boy""",San Francisco Mabel Joy,1995

Sewed my new blue jeans.

Is when he's all drunk.

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely down the stream;
Where the graceful white swan
Goes gliding along
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.

Then I would not exchange
My home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play.
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word,
And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song,
and he told me it was the perfect country and western song.
I wrote him back a letter and I told him it was not the 
perfect country and western song because he hadn't said
anything at all about momma, or trains, or trucks, 
or prison or gettin' drunk. Well, he sat down and 
wrote another verse to this song and he sent it to me and
after reading it I realized that my friend had written the 
perfect country and western song. And I felt obliged to include
it on this album. The last verse goes like this here:

I had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dressed like 1950
Half drunk and hollow eyed
He said it's a long walk to Nashville 
Would you like a ride? Son

Well, I sat down in the front seat
He turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale 
When I asked him for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

He said, ""Mister, can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues? Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?""
He said, ""Boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
'Cause if you're big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride""

Then he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said, ""This is where you get off, boy
'Cause I'm goin' back to Alabam""
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac
I said, ""Mister, many thanks""
He said, ""You don't have to call me mister, mister
The whole world calls me Hank""

Something happened for the first time deep inside
It was a rush, what a rush

'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
It's just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I've just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying and trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy
Goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl, are we just friends?
Is there more, is there more?

See it's a chance we've gotta take
'Cause I believe that we can make this into something that will last
Last forever, forever

The doors they finally shut and I was there, somewhere
Alone in my reality inside an empty box

I'm gonna take this moment that I'm in right now
Stop the craziness somehow
Leave it all behind me
I know it's gonna find me
I've got nothing to win, I've got nothing to lose
Just trying to walk in my own two shoes
Gotta take some time now
It's time for me to find out who I am
Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh

Sometimes
You just know
When to hold on
When to let go

I'm gonna take this moment that I'm in right now
Stop the craziness somehow
Leave it all behind me
I know it's gonna find me
I've got nothing to win, I've got nothing to lose
Just trying to walk in my own two shoes
Gotta take some time now
It's time for me to find out who I am

I've got nothing to win, I've got nothing to lose
Just trying to walk in my own two shoes
Gotta take some time now
It's time for me to find out who I am
Oh oh oh, (Time for me, Time for me)
Oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh (Time for me, Time for me)
Who I am

David Archuleta,"I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for the first time deep inside
It was a rush, what a rush

'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
It's just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I've just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way you do?
'Cause I'm trying and trying to walk away
But I know this crush ain't goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy
Goin' away-ay-ay-ay-ayy

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl, are we just friends?
Is there more, is there more?

See it's a chance we've gotta take

Last forever, forever

Tear apart the weakest of hearts, up here you'll be safe in my arms.

I know that you're feeling like we're only dreaming

There's no turning back from this point.
Reaching heights like never before.
Nothing can touch us, we're everything, we're everything and more.

Up here gives you wings to stay strong, ooh.
The air is pure that we're breathing.

David Archuleta,"Tell me what you did to me
Just there beneath my feet
Didn't even notice we were miles above the ground

I'm not afraid of heights
We crashed into the sky
Didn't know that I could feel the way that I do now

I'm not asking for an explanation
All I know is that you take me away
And you show me how to fly

Nothing brings me down when you're around
It's like zero gravity
The world just disappears when you're here
It's zero gravity

When things get messed up
You lift my head up
And I get lost in the clouds
There's no sense of time with you and I
It's zero gravity

The edges fade away
'Til there's no more shades of gray
You only have to whisper anything at all

You opened up my eyes
You turned my lows to highs
And that's the only way that I know how to fall

Not gonna analyze or try to fight it
Don't even care if it makes no sense at all
'Cause with you I can fly

Nothing brings me down when you're around
It's like zero gravity
The world just disappears when you're here
It's zero gravity

When things get messed up, you lift my head up
And I get lost in the clouds
There's no sense of time with you and I
It's zero gravity

You make it so easy to just drift away
I can't imagine being without you

Don't think about it, don't think about
Don't think about, don't think about
(Don't think about it)
Don't think about it

To guide the future, as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.

His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.

When we shall be forever with the Lord.

want to do, just so long as you don't hurt anybody. And remember kids,

I would just like to say that it is my conviction 
That longer hair and other flamboyant affectations 
Of appearance are nothing more 
Than the male's emergence from his drab camoflage 
Into the gaudy plumage

And fine feathers are not proper for the male

I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever
",Diamonds Are Forever,1997
David Arnold,"From Russia with love, I fly to you
Much wiser since my goodbye to you
I've travelled the world to learn
I must return
From Russia with love

I've seen places, faces
And smile for a moment
But, oh, you haunted me so
Still, my tongue tied young bride
Would not let my love for you show
In case you'd say ""No""

To Russia I flew but there and then
I suddenly knew you'd care again
My running around is through
I'd fly to you
From Russia with love",From Russia With Love,1997
David Arnold,"Now let it lift you, oh!
One love will
One love will
One love can take you make you feel alive and whole
Why give it up why tear it up
One love will
My love will
My love will make you feel alive enough to let go
Oh
The death row
Once again you feel like the brothers know
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The unforgetable
Public enemy number one
Five-oh said ""freeze"" and I got numb
Can't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun
But the wax that the terminator x spun
Now
So soft
So alive
My dear
So good
So close
So real
This love
Whoa love!
Want to give it up
Lets turn it loose",The James Bond Theme,1997
David Arnold,"When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die

David Arnold,"Where are you? Why do you hide?
Where is that moonlight trail that leads to your side?
Just like the Moonraker goes in search of his dream of gold
I search for love, for someone to have and hold

I've seen your smile in a thousand dreams
Felt your touch and it always seems
You love me
You love me

Where are you? When will we meet?
Take my unfinished life and make it complete
Just like the Moonraker knows his dream will come true someday
I know that you are only a kiss away

I've seen your smile in a thousand dreams
Felt your touch and it always seems
You love me
You love me
",Moonraker,1997
David Arnold,"Nobody does it better makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me the spy who loved me 
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
 
Nobody does it better sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin' but just keep it comin'  
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
 
And nobody does it better 
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you",Nobody Does It Better,1997
David Arnold,"He always runs while others walk
He acts while other men just talk
He looks at this world, and wants it all
So he strikes, like thunderball

He knows the meaning of success
His needs are more, so he gives less
They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes, like thunderball

Any woman he wants, he'll get
He will break any heart without regret

His days of asking are all gone
His fight goes on and on and on
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all
So he strikes like thunderball",Thunderball,1997
David Arnold,"We have all, the time in the world
Time enough for life
To unfold
All the prescious things
Love has in store

We have all the love in the world
If that's all we have
You will find
We need nothing more

Every step of the way
Will find us
With the cares of the world
Far behind us

We have all the time in the world
Just for love
Nothing more
Nothing less
Only love

Only love

Only love",We Have All the Time in the World,1997
David Arnold,"You only live twice, or so it seems
One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You drift through the years and life seems tame
Till one dream appears and love is its name

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice

And love is a stranger who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you, so pay the price
Make one dream come true, you only live twice",You Only Live Twice,2011

David Atkinson,"What a thrill you are,
What a sight to see,
Something the eyes of mortals have no right to see.
Am I on the earth or in the sky?
Lost in loveliness am I.
When I look at you,
I forget myself,
I could go mad about you if I let myself.
Should I let myself, or pass you by?
Lost in loveliness am I.
I know I'm reaching for a star,
What's more, I know how dangerous you are.
If I were wise
I'd close my eyes
Or walk away and worship from afar.
In the lonely night,
You would haunt my heart,
And I would pray that someday you might want my heart.
And I'd have to live my whole life through
Lost in loveliness, the loveliness of you.",Lost in Loveliness,1954
David Axelrod,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance

everybody's on parade
hot dog music fills the air
the bongo players play
a man with a megaphone
says we are all slaves
what else is new?
I just keep on walking
roller skating girls twirl
in the dying sun
waves crash on the shoreline
the day's about done
I turn the corner 
blind my eyes in the sun
I just keep on walking

nothing's gonna bring me down
I feel so fine

all the knick knack vendors 
fold their tents up in the shade
gangsters stand around them
drinking beer and lemonade
throw away my cigarette
thinking maybe I'll quit today
give a cough and 
I keep on walking
love is eternal as long as it lasts
good times come
then they pass
a brother staggers into me
eyes like bloody glass
I give him change
and I keep on walking

nothing's gonna bring me down
I feel so fine

sometimes it gets so ugly
all you can do is crack sick jokes
a little cyanide humor
about lamp shades and soap
me I'm pretty sick of that
how bout faith or even hope
it's time to tease the dogs a bit
it's time to pull the rope
it's cleanup time!

nothing's gonna bring me down
I feel so fine

David Bailey,"Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He was strumming my pain, yeah, he was singing my life

David Baker,"Somewhere in the night
There must be someone for me
Somewhere in the night
Who knows, where somewhere may be

Across the way
Or maybe, way beyond the distant star
How I wish, I knew
Just where and who you are

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

My lonely heart keeps saying to me
""No, this doesn't seem right
There must be someone
Somewhere in the night""

Somewhere in a dream
I find her here by my side
Then when I awake
My dream drifts out with the tide

David Baker,"Shy shy girl 
Standing with the wallflowers 
Wishing you had stayed at home 
You kick yourself for coming 
When you're standing there all alone 
The centers of attention 
Are busy making all their moves 

While all the guys are looking at them 
I've got my eye on you 
Only you 
You might think you're nothing special 
You might be losing heart 
But baby don't you realize 

How beautiful you really are 
Shy girl 
It?s written on your face 
A mermaid out of water 
Feeling out of place 
Shy girl 

Trying to hide a blush 
Caught you looking for a second 
Felt my heart rush

So beautiful 

Shy shy girl 
I'm moving in closer 
Slowly trying to break the ice

On your downward glancing eyes 
You might think you're nothing special 
But I'm about to lose heart 
But baby don't you realize 

How beautiful you really are 
Chorus 
Now I'm standing right in front of you 
I confess I'm nervous too 
Girl you know there something going on 
And not to give a chance 
Would be so wrong 

Shy girl 
It?s written on your face 
A mermaid out of water 
Feeling out of place 
Shy girl 
Trying to hide a blush 

Pretending that there's nothing 
Between the two of us 
don't run away 
don't be afraid 
don't be shy girl

I'll be there soon I'll bring the moon
On a string of stars just for you

Two days more on this lonesome ride
Then she'll be riding by my side
Under the open sky deep in the heart of Texas

Ten o'clock at night
Funny how you can remember 
Certain moments in your life
I wish I could go back
To take back the words i said
Thought it's been years since that night
They still echo in my head

Time is a teacher
Time has taught me well
What brings a man to his knees
Is often brought on by himself
If a second chance were offered
And she could love me like before
I'd go back to the end and start over again
On 12-12-84 (Twelve twelve eighty-four)

A cold wind was blowing
It whistled through the pines
I told her I don't need her
And she told me goodbye
I remember embers dying
In the ashes and the coals
And like smoke up the chimney
I watched a true love go

In the darkness here I hide a tear
Hoping it won't show
I can say I've burned her memory, but I know
I'm just blowin' smoke

I don't want to face the truth that I'm still in love with her

This old house is anything, but home sweet home
I wonder, if you're happy now or sad like me
Living in the shadows of what used to be

Kickin' up the fallen leaves

Through golden leaves and better times
To a place where my heart longs to be

I read your name written on the stone
In my dreams there's a river wide
Where we walk side by side
We leave foot prints in the sand

At the waters edge you turn and smile
Say I'll see you in a little while

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make the season bright, yeah
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you",The Christmas Song,2003

While you yap bout yo gold

And I'm bustin' my steel

Yo mo' (more)
I went to see a friend of mine the other day
Ya know what I'm talkin' bout? (huh, I'm drunk)
She said, ""Banner, you need to harmonize (harmonize) and hide""
Yeah, okay
But I asked her I was like, ""How can a nigga be a fucking snitch?!""
Fucking snitch, bitch-ass
You don't even snitch on yo' fucking enemies, you coward-ass nigga
Kill those niggaz (I'm really, really high)
Ain't no respect to the game no mo' (more)
Niggaz is bitches (niggaz is bitches)

[Chorus: David Banner] - (Repeat 2X)
I done lost my love for the game
Shit'll never be the same
I'll never lose my love for the streets (the streets)
The streets got love for me
Might of lost my love for the game (game)
Niggaz don't even act the same
I'll never lose my love for the streets
Cause the streets got love for me (me)


[Verse 1: David Banner]
I hit the block before it's sunrise
I want to know where you bitch niggaz went and hide (yeh)
Went to sleep, open my eyes then I realize (yeh!)
Time to serve em weak, clock her ass and mash out
Get ya cash out, why ya motherfuckers sleep and ya passed out?
I'm in the hood tryin' to make a G before nine (9:00)
Five thirty (5:30) took a break, and I'm back on the grind
Four ten (4:10)
Put some dro in the wind then
Let it go cause ya know that a nigga gone
Tell she if a nigga get busted
Niggaz can't be trusted in the game cause shit ain't the same
Motherfuckers want me to blow out they brain (I done lost)
Shit cocked and blast
Put some lead in a motherfucker fast
Never play wit a gun, if ya can't stop that (stop that)
Or get that in ya motherfucking ass

[Chorus: David Banner] - (Repeat 2X)

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Took a chance when I came in
Did my time if I got caught
If I lost, it was my fault
Took the blame for the whole thing
And it was the work, it was my walk
To do or double wit the plot then
Let a nigga fellin' boxed in
I was slangin' in my socks then
On the corner flippin' 20's
Tryin' to turn em into 50's
On the ten speed right in front of walk in
It's no hood where I came from
Where a nigga got his game from
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm the same one
To pull a strap out my backpack
Cock the hammer back (clack!)
Duck and get ya brains hung
And shake the cop up when the block clear
Cause the drama doesn't stop here
Gotta watch for ya own peers
Nigga damn near ain't knowin' who the fuck I am
And you ain't knowin' how I got here
See we don't speak and we don't do nothin'
It's on you if you slang things
Get your money, homie, maintain
Keep yo' motherfucking mouth shut, dawg
Or you'll get offset and this a cold game
And snitch-niggaz never last long
So snitch-niggaz get yo' ass on
A snitch-nigga get yo' mask on
Took the pledge on my own hand
Then killed a rose motherfucker in my last song

Ain't no tellin' where I might be

Ain't no tellin' where I'll end up
I got shows to rock and hoes to fuck
Ain't no tellin' where I might go
Coast to Coast or just next do' (door)
But, I gots to go, I gots to go
Eh, eh, (I gots to go) eh (go), eh, eh, eh (gotta go)

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Roll up on that tour bus, smokin' a blunt
Then heard a (dunn dunn dunn dunn dunn!) what yo' baby momma want?
Nothin' but good fuckin' dick suckin' train runnin'
She lickin' on my nuts, talk to her if she hear me comin'
Watchin' me go
She swallowed cum, you kissed a hoe
Tongue and lip, all
Man you really lickin' my balls
Heard you for my baby momma last night nigga, nah
But she did bring weed, no seeds, sticks all
I'm lyin' when she come over, cock lyin' in her jaw
Niggaz all up in her drawers
And that's yo' baby mother
If it makes you feel better, she's a good dick sucker (sucker)

My Job takes me out of town on all-expense paid
Wakin' up with a hangover 2,000 miles away
It seems easy: weed, women, and wine
Four hours of sleep is all you get - now it's time
To tally hoe to the show, a yo, yo let it go
Bust through the do' (door), rag & flow and grab my hoe
And get back in the van with some titties in hand
Let her meet ya new friend, who's willing to spend
The whole night? Another flight another gig another city
Touchin' on somebody's baby momma's titties
Niggaz in the lobby wonderin' where their women are
Third floor havin' a ""Let's Become a Bitch Seminar""
Can't get attached, I got a plane to catch
I wish I could a hit that but I'll be back

My money ain't a game so I ain't worried bout winnin' it
I'm worried bout makin' it, stackin' it and spendin' it (and spendin' it)
Ain't no pretendin' it don't make the world move
Same way you can't pretend my shit don't make yo' girl groove
See, God work in myterious ways but I don't (don't)
And the devil will make a deal wit yo' ass but I won't (won't)
Now you can have the cleanest paint job on ya trucks
Six T.V.s, wood wit leather seats, stitched and tucked
The biggest chrome rims, playa, I don't give a fuck
If I holla at yo' bitch, guarantee she gettin' buck
You can yell and you can scream and you can fuss and you can fight
Like it's the worst night in yo' life, to me it's just another night
I ain't carin' bout ya drama (uh uh), or breakin' up ya home

I remember those days I was broke and a bitch barely up
House smelling like some piss you was there for me
Rubbing my head saying its gone be alright
The hardest nigga I was crying late at night it was fucking with me
In a bucket we would mash out
When I did that bullshit and got caught you got my ass out
You was that girl that would set that nigga up
I was the man that would wet that nigga up now fuck with me
And you did when they came to the crib
You grabbed the tech and started bussin' at a bitch aww shit, baby
You was my lady when the laughed at my clothes
In the front row when them hoes boo'd at my shows
And its cool cause you helped me through school
'95 selling weed in baton rough
And you stayed strong with a pimp trick
Whipped it out and sucked a niggaz dirty dick, aww shit
Baby I'm sorry lets start brand new
The world against us all along us two
All the shit I done took you through
I'm a grown man now

The second verse is for my momma you could truly serve a bowl
You were strong when daddy was gone

When I was dying as a baby, momma boo you stay true
I heard you whisper to the lord, let my child make it through
And I did I walked up in this bitch first born kid
Tell 'em fuck it billy went and hit a lick (Ha ha ha)
You were there when the times were hard
You're a blessing from the heavens not a breed by god
And if I die momma swallow the pain
I leave this earth with your blood up in my veins
Let it flow free, let it kill me
But its on, and the way we ridding caddies

So daddy went to my mama and started pimpin' that hoe
Man it's hard times, niggas ain't got shit
Nothin' but billy clubs to they head and they ass kicked
Heroin in they vein, cocaine up in they brain
Man what you expect, America gave us pain
So fuck it, now we thugs, ? mean drugs
And takin mean mugs, and fill 'em with those slugs
I gave up fake gods, and Jesus don't look like us
Why y'all think we gon' kill and just don't give a hot fuck
Devil that's how you made us, ? us up in the pen
Man we came out blind, that's why we goin back in
But God, I'mma teach 'em, reach 'em up in these streets
Bush, I'm runnin' up in this shit like a track meet
You murdered, up in Texas where killin' is such a sin
The first month you in office you started killin' again
But shit, we just some niggas and that's how the game go

Y'all took us up out the state moved us straight out to Death Row
Y'all may of, made us slaves but never make us your hoe
God, you my pimp so let's start exposin' these hoes
y'all judges some weak pussies, y'all preaches some rapin' fags
These people that made us slaves, these niggas wavin' they flags
America ain't shit but home of the hot lick
They hang us all by rope, then laugh and cut off our dick

Pray to the Lord for these Mississippi streets, hey!

[Verse]
God I know that we pimp
God I know that we wrong
God I know why she talk about Moet all of my songs
I know these kids are listening
I know I'm here for a mission
But it's so hard to get 'em wit 22 rims all glisten
I know these balls are talking
Lord I want to do right
I tried to fight but these demons they comp at me at night
Like my momma, my daddy, my girl and all my boys
I lost Rachelle but I guess I still got the whining Roy
My couzins sweet, momma lay that Jason
Lord I'm praying for swacking my heart is still impatient
Keep 'em off them drugs, far away from thugs
He's still my hero but just a shell bed or what it was
Yeah smoking get a buzz, but God I hear ya calling
And shit wrong wit balling
But my soul is just stelly [steadily] balling
And the sex and the dead, and the other jail
God I'm stacking my mail but will I end up in hell?

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Lord they hum Andre Jones
Lord they hum Reynold Johnson
Lord I want to fight back but I'm just so sick of bouncing
Lord I'm sick of jumping, Lord just please tell me something
My folks still dumping my music, bumping but I feel nothing
My heart is stelly pumping
My heart is stelly breaking
Sometimes I feel like I'm faking, man
I'm so sick of taking
Maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
Maybe Earth is telling just a place for us to learn
Bout yo love, yo will and grace
Sometimes I wish I wasn't born in the first place
Maybe this first base, God knocked the ball up out the park
So we can come home this world right here is feeling so dark
Feeling so cold, Lord I'm feeling so old
I dunno if I can take this world right here no more

Hey baby girl what's your name who you with?
Do you do wanna get down with this pimpin' lil' trick

Choose me big banner the back beater
The dubz can't fit on the truck they caught fevers
25 inches I can clear the benches
Or we can go up and down like them rug bitches
Let them hatin' witches they gonna wish for hate
But they all scream damn while you masturbate

The worm on the hook, I can whip and cook
Hit the block with chunky socks while you hit the books
I make that sacrifice like Jesus preachers on them lames
I'm true with how I feel, no fingers crossed this ain't no game
But you a pimp mayn, I promise you'll that I can change
Like a chameleon the colors on your rings n' thangs

You can have what you want
(You can have what you want)
If you give me what I need
(If you give me what I need)
I know you have a lot of options
(So many other ways)
But baby you belong with me

Tricking all they dough

I ain't paying for no sex
Man I'd rather buy a car
Or a new Rolex
Cause I got street fame
So hoes flock like birds
I got one ho in the range
And one ho in the burbs
When I hit the club
I'mma be with David Banner
A thug ass nigga
With bad table manners
We act bad; my nigga what is y'all saying?
Like when we walk inside clubs
Niggas hold they gal's hand
Cause they know we run trains (choo! choo!) all night
How could your gal leave me
And be with you all night?
But it's all right
Cause you know we don't kiss

That most girls really freaks
And this is how they got to
Make their money every week

Step into club looking just like a pimp
We got cash, so we screaming out ""shake something bitch!""

Sisqo made you show your thong

And girl, get it how you live
And since you so hot
Fuck it, show your pussy lips
You go to Tougaloo, but I know you still flip
Bitch, don't trip! Ain't a damn thing changed
I still love my queen
But bitches keep me to the game

Lying ass hoes?
Smiling in your face
Wearing her best friend's clothes
I suppose they like the way me and Banner pimp
You can catch us at Pappadeaux
Eating steak and shrimp

Or you can catch us at E&J's pouring it up
Flip whipping Cali trucks
Girls licking my nuts
We some Southside pimps
And we ain't giving a fuck
Poke your girl up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut

We make em swallow the nut, so
Follow the truck: Lil Flip and David Banner
We got all of the bucks, and
All of they sluts and all of the hoes
So drop it like it's hot, girl
Touch your fucking toes

Song: So Trill
Album: Mississippi:The Album

Bread and water..This what it comes down to

[Verse 1]
I remember when these kids got killed up in Pearl
Is it the end of the world? Grown men acting like bitches
Bitches actin' like men, and it's all good
As long as all these records keep sellin'
Niggaz time cut so these snitches keep tellin'
Y'all know it ain't right..
And I ain't bending for these hoes
Is this the part when my God comes back and starts throwin' elbows?
Man these children gone astray, and no daddies in the home
So they turn to gun play, or they just turn gay
Half-bit like they rich broke, niggaz swisha sweet
So I sit, in a lac and just smoke,stayin' down in the street
Vernon Dixon? Georgetown in the hills
The subs and the boys in Hattiesburg so trill
The delta and coast, the queens is what I boast
But these kids in the south is what a nigga love the most

{Bridge}
Damn, the kids is what a nigga loves most
Fuck, so trill..

[Hook 2x]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)

[Verse 2]
I remember when the twin towers fell
Did the boys in the G know, or just didn't tell?
I ain't forgot about Gore, and them trick ass ballots
Numbers tossed around in the mix like a salad
Or a bird in the Bush
Or a brother up in office tryna give a big push
Y'all don't try to praise God now
He been watchin from the jump, I'ma crunk
Quick to pull the sawed pump, skull and bones y'all can kill me
I'ma G, and the world is gon' feel me
Bet you neva thought the truth would come straight from the middle of Mississippi
So P-Boy keep pushin'..
We some big ones,life would street, man we all on a mission

[Hook 2x]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)

[Verse 3]
This for my boys in the pen and my thugs on the county farms
If it's war then I swear I'm gonna raise them arms
And come and getcha, send me a kite...
And I promise that I'll write ya back or smoke a fat sack in ya name
I ain't no bitch or no hoe or no trick
Tryna ride a nigga dick just to make a quick hit
I ain't writin' love songs for prissy bitches
I make songs for the queens who lost sight in the hood
Mayne I made some bullshit but it's good
And if ya see me then you see this shit across my chest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest

[Hook until fade]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)

Somebody gotta pay, I been on this block all day
Tryin' to get off all this yay

[Verse 1]
I'm the boardman bitch but let me tell ya how I came up
Cooked a lot of that raw, never sold that fake stuff
Cutthroat cha' if ya try to bring me some harm
Don't look at me wrong cause I'll be bustin' ya long
Blunbt smoke with the rocks in my mouth, see all dirty
Gotta see my P.O. tomorrow on a hot Thursday
But today I'ma make it bump around the way
I lay K off in the grass so ya better not play
If ya just jumped off the porch I'ma slam ya
If ya talkin' crazy nigga I'ma have to handle ya
If it's real I can serve ya, we can do a little business
Keep it on the low when we straight I'ma hit chu' with that issue
As long as I got narcotics make me richer
Before I stop I'ma blow up the block this year

[Verse 2]
Do I have to speak any further
Fuckin' with me and my loot then it's gonna be a murder
I creep in ya house like a burglar
Do you really think it's a game, you lame
When bullets flame you gon' be the next nigga unnamed
What cha' heard, my click can't be flamed, crazy in the brain
Yes we do get into this hustle so don't fuck with out brains
On the block is where I hang
In the same fit for three weeks
For this goof that steal my money race like a track meet
On a Friday ain't no heat, only if you got beef
It's about to be a X for nigga tryin' to hit a ho with that bare meat
In the streets it's known that we got em' anything can happen
I'ma make it so the crack and rap and hustlin' is happenin'

[Hook x5]

[Verse 3]
I jumped off in tha game back in 96
Nigga hit me three bricks, nigga post that list
Servin' Boxcar Ramone, that nigga was kissed
I used to give him two stones just to test my shit
Got my first piece of pussy in a project hallway
Pussy to the gun play, we can play all day
Smokin' big weed, keep my conscience clear
P.O. bitch touched me now I'm back on a tear
I can't wait to see them niggas when they see my face
Give my lawyers six figures now they droppin' the case
When I was small big niggas on the block would ball
I had to look up to em' like they was 20 feet tall
Fuck y'all I'm stack my tips, take these hits
Fuck a thick bitch in a brand new six
Now it's Friday, like a ho to do it my way
Only do the speed limit and a third on the highway

I know you here em
Please who in your room would trade places with me
If I ain't what ya trying to be than why you hustling see
To be young black and rich
If that ain't the combination
Tell me when it switched
I need to know (listen)
Maybe the problem is your thinking to small
You niggas only wanna rap and that's all
Your only goal is to buy out the mall
I go and buy me a mall
You want the stuff for the summer
I'm goin' buy me the fall
And get a Myspace lick (yeah)
You know how many hits Myspace gets (yeah)
Man it's like I'm hurting feelings just by telling the truth
I'm hurting feelings in and out of this booth
Now listen

[Chorus]
You see me sitting in the turning lane (whooo)
Yours big but mine bigger man
You wanna brag about a lil change
You need to step up your game lil boy
You better Hold up [Repeat: x6]
You better sit your ass down
You better Hold up [Repeat: x6]
You better sit your ass down

Well pac I see these haters watching me
But I ain't tripping ya'll see there ain't no stopping me
Weigh in the middle
And I'm steady buying property
I got land to catch me you hit the lottery
Niggas so stop playing
Boy I ride what I want to and ye ain't know
See me buying what I want to
Walk out the store 100 thousand in my pocket
You can tell how I want

Horsing at the red light
On chrome drop top candy red type
Four fifty four nigga want better bring it home
(fresh off vacation all this hate got me paranoid)
Yeah better know it
Wanna bring it you ain't ready for it
No right now what's ya tell em go get boy
And lights out

Come any day I'll hit ya
Don't let me pull up on ya in that turning lane nigga

[Chorus:]

My bread stack high like mike in NBA highlights
Man just means jacuzzi bubbling with sky lights
Smoke cool L jueal kill a niggas eye sight
Wal mart stops in eight seven like damn right
My wrist stay glistening
Two birds kissing
I'm sick of all this money somebody call a physician in
The American dream I'm with niggas is visioning
You clowns ain't making it rain it's just drizzling
Acting like I ain't paid what you talking bout
I throw a party at the bank walk a million out
Got over thirty movies what you think you doing to me
You sold a couple records how you think you gon' do me
You know I'm in shape I slap you you gon' try and sue me
I buy you off slide off with your lil cutie
All the money is a god damn new sense
Look at my career yeah I'm the blueprint

Holla ""Boosie bad-ass, let me hit ya cup of lean""
Told her no way, look like you be-fo'play
I hit you with this dick and I'm gon' make you run like O.J.
Now they got redbones, blackbones, horses, and stallions
But if you got that fire cat {?} Boosie he ain't gone
You want your bread fire really you can get it
But we linin like we dope and all my niggaz want to hit it
I'm a fool in Mississippi, I'm lovin the hype
Everything I drop it they gon' cop it like I'm Tina & Ike
I got a clique of real niggaz and we ready to fight
And we fo' sho' to hittin somethin at the telly tonight
I'm at the suites with two freaks, I'm slappin 'em on they cheeks
I'm hittin 'em from the back off a David Banner beat
Now I'm skeetin on the sheets, headed to another city
Where we go and get some cat and we ain't gotta pay a penny nigga

[Chorus]",Ain't Got Nothing,2005
David Banner,"(David Banner talking)
I wish I had my pistol.
Miggas, think the south is a fad nigga.
I went back and picked up my nigga B.G.
We gon crank this mug.
Soutside motherfucker!!!!

Chorus
Bloody War! Bloody, bloody war!
What you think these bullets and all these guns made for? (made for)
Bloody War! Bloody, bloody war! (war)
What you think these bullets and all these guns made for?
(B.G.)
They made to bust with em (bust wit em,) they made to bang with em (bang with em,)
If you trippin, they made to knock out your brains with em.
They made to bust with em (bust wit em,) they made to bang with em (bang with em,)
If you trippin, they made to knock out your brains with em.

Verse 1
(David Banner)
I'm hittin you bitches,
With choppas, running from helicopters and duckin the feds,
Thirsting for blood, ready for war, I'm wanting you dead.
I want that nigga to come that shit, so I can get it back and go beat that bitch.
Teach that snitch, about that south; the place where we woulda putta bullet in your mouth.
Take your doe, take your cash, and let the grim reaper come and take your ass,
Imma slow it down cause I'm goin to fast, Imma slow it down to fast.
This the last time that I'm gonna remind you niggas, Imma cock back and put a hot dime in you niggas.
That's ten shots, ten pops from a fucking glock, I wanted peace, but now my piece is clearing out the block.
Knock, Knock. Who is it? Bitch, call me David Ban.
The man with a plan to put your ass in some land.
Bitch!!!

Chorus

Verse 2
(B.G.)
Nigga, where I'm from,
All we do is kill and hustle,
If you come slippin without that pistol, you in trouble.
I'd insult niggas, on a block that got they're stash took,
The niggas who took it turned around and got his ass busted.
I'm out here, half the time I don't sleep.
How Imma sleep when I'm in the streets and I got beef.
On my block it's war; we live like we in Pakistan,
I got the mac in my pants, and I got crack in my hands.
I give it how you want it; I take it how it come.
They say you live by the gun, and you die by the gun
I been a little soldier; I been a little beast.
I'm even wilder, I got Soldier Slim livin through me.

Chorus

Verse 3
(David Banner)
When I pray, I don't know what to say.
Just beg to the Lord to let me see another day.
A AK totter, 1st quarter, 50 through *****
Sweat on my palms, bomb ass weedwill keep me calm.
Strap on my arm, the streets is feeling like Vietnam,
Murdering Uncle Toms, I'm crunk like I'm Lil' John
Imma wizard waving a wand, your bodies up in my palm
If you kill me flex, hit the block and go take care of my moms nigga.
(B.G.)
My mom ashamed of me, I'm in the game now.
I tell her momma don't trip, it's too late to change now.
I'm on the block with it, I'm in the club with it.
Wherever you catch me at I'm ready to bust with it.

Can't reproduce 'cause our folks got aids
The black folks is killin' black folks, not gays

My mind's less than clear
Do I turn in shame
From what could save
Do I find my knees and pray?

I'm sorry for my sins
I prepare for the end
You just let me know when
Its hard like a boulder
This world's gettin colder
But ima stand strong

Make you boys take them paper pep poppers of your hip
