Max Roach,"Darn that dream I dream each night
You say you love me and you hold me tight
But when I awake, I find you're out of sight
Oh, darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlight skies
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that one-track mind of mine
I can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
Lord, I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Darn that dream and bless it too
Without that dream, I never would have you
But it haunts me 'cause it won't come true
Oh, darn that dream
Oh, darn that dream",Darn That Dream,2005
Max Roach,"All my life I've waited for an angel
But no angel ever came along
Then one happy afternoon I met you
And my heart began to sing a song
Somehow, I mistook you for an angel
But now I'm glad that I was wrong

You may not be an angel
'Cause angels are so few
But until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

I'm looking for an angel
To sing my love song to
And until the day that one comes along
I'll sing my song to you

For every little fault that you have
Say, I've got three or four

The human little faults that you do have
Just make me love you more

You may not be an angel
But still I'm sure you'll do

So until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

For every little fault that you have
Say, I've got three or four

The human little faults you do have,
Just make me love you more

Because you're such an angel
That's why I'm sure you'll do
So until the day that one comes along
I know just what I'll do

I'll string along with you",I'll String Along with You,2005
Max Roach,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
",When Lights Are Low,2005
Max Roach,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies

Smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,2006
Max Roach,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura (With Strings),2007
Max Roach,"First you say you do
And then you don't
And then you say you will
And then you won't
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
Now you want to play
And then it's no
And when you say you'll stay

That's when you go
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
I've been sitting on a fence
And it doesn't make much sense
'Cause you keep me in suspense
And you know it
Then you promise to return
When you don't
I really burn
Well, I guess I'll never learn

And I show it
If you've got a heart
And if you're kind
Then don't keep us apart
Make up your mind
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?",Undecided,2009
Max Roach,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2010
Max Roach,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you

You and you alone

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Max Roach,"Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Max Roach,"Tea For Two
Tony Bennett
(Irving Caesar/Vincent Youmans) 

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

Max Roach,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,2012
Max Roach,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin The Beguine,2012
Max Roach,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

But don't blame me.",Don’t Blame Me,2012
Max Roach,"We were more than lovers,
We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

Max Roach,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,

And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2012
Max Roach,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,2012
Max Roach,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Brought such a flame to me

And let it die

Killing God's children one by one
Casting affliction on the innocent man

Max Romeo,"I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day
And stopped just for a moment just to watch the children play
A lonely boy was standing and when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry

I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower I'm growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child

People come for children and take them for their own
But they all seem to pass me and I am left here all alone
I know they'd like to take me but when they see I'm blind
They always take some other kids and I am left behind

I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower I'm growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child

No mommy's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry
Sometimes it gets so lonely, I wish that I could die
I'd walk the streets of heaven where all the blind can see
And just like all the other kids, there'd be a home for me

I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower I'm growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child

I know you see it, you run with me
And I can cut you free out of the treachery and walls you keep in
So trade your typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do, or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Yo, damn, suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

Okay, my friend, you wanna cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no, I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really, it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't wanna take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do, I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn, can't you see I'm doing fine?
I don't need to see the other side

Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream
And it'll wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime?
Fifteen
I'd do eight
Twelve
Maybe nine
Ten

Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
So we can do like I do, so if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn, suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side

Ché and his Caballero chucked it in when I said I liked them
Now I'll never catch them in a smoky room on Highbury Corner
I shall weep for them another day because I'm at the fulcrum
Of the Voodoo graveyard see-saw and I'm not the only mourner

What do we do when our friends split up?
Five little sevens then belly up
There's no more ash, no more soda pop
Why did those five have to make it stop?

At least we have Storm And Stress to show for the DC Implosion
Mushrooms grown on an upstairs Smalley wall
Are chopped down and moved away from
Five icemen melt without hint of a reforming notion
And the clan I saw perform the most give a bow and leave my kingdom
Talented friends and 25 eclipse the work of certain strummers
Steel-string chords and a railway or a globe, or Mr. Bickle's nonsense
Who can rescue us from the Embrace of these Monsoonless summers?

Dropping bits of speaker on a textured runway
Teeth and death and bower feathers

On a flag of your face unfurled
I collide with you in this heat
Under blanket of borrowed blue
Splitting silence with every smile

And a rail on an outside road
Rusting over with us in here
We shall settle a stack of woes

I never learnt how to fill my songs with allegory
While my peers paid attention in English, I thought about how
I could undress the girl who appeared in my life with a 'pow'
Never mind that she slipped from my hand, because look at me now

Stir that dish with a spoon I found on the street

Sometimes I would faint in the days when I didn't eat meat

The city can be paradise for those who have the cash
The class and the connections, what you need to make a splash
The likes of you get swept up in the morning with the trash
If you were rich or middle class ...

[Eva:]
Screw the middle classes! I will never accept them!
My father's other family were middle class
And we were kept out of sight, hidden from view at his funeral.

[Eva's brother:]
Do all your one night stands give you this trouble?

[Magaldi:]
Eva beware of the city
It's hungry and cold, can't be controlled, it is mad
Those who are fools are swallowed up whole
And those who are not become what they should not become
Changed, in short, they go bad.

[Eva:]
Bad is good for me
I'm bored, so clean, and so ignored
I've only been predictable, respectable
Birds fly out of here, so why oh why oh why the hell can't I?
I only want variety, of society

[chorus]

[Magaldi:]
Five years from now I shall come back
And finally say, ""You have your way, come to town.""
But you'll look at me with a foreigner's eyes
The magical city, a younger girl's city
A fantasy long since put down

[Eva:]
All you've done to me, was that a young girl's fantasy?
I played your city games alright, didn't I?
I already know what cooks, how the dirty city feels and looks
I tasted it last night, didn't I?

[Eva and family:]
She's gonna be a part of B.A.

Eva beware your ambition
It's hungry and cold, can't be controlled, will run wild

And whatever you say, I'll not steal you away","Eva, Beware of the City",2012

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

I'll have trouble tying my shoes
Forget that fear of gravity
I'll laugh when it rains and dampens my hair

Never waiting at the bend / never two-faced at a crossroads
Never wanting the edge of my cloud / tender is the night--see

This party is higher / than the eiffel tower

we're all here to be reckless / we're all sleazy and easy to please
Dreamers and schemers on the loose

we're all here for a celebration / the madcap scene and the max machine
And the friends you see go up in smoke
And this heel toe dance song tour de force

climbing a cloud climbing a cloud / put a little life on the line

here's Lucy she's choosey / of who calls her on the phone
She's from a very rich foreign family / but displaced cause of rivalry at home

now Daphne is the orphan / still searching for her roots
She likes concert blisters and leather boots
And knows one fact her act is to get loose

now we're just musicians / here to thin the thickness of your skin

show us your body / show us your curls / show us your tour de force
Show us your thrills / keep that smile on your face
This is the best offer you've had so far

we're innocent we're naive / in the cabarets we get our veins wet
In the saloons we hassle the richest guests
In the climb we're breathless above the rest

climbing a cloud climbing a cloud

But it's always the one bitch I mean one woman
If you got nineteen hoes, it's always that one
You'll die for

I'm on my knees screamin' ""Baby I apologize""
'Cause I don' hurt you so much, I know you tire of cryin'
You was there every Sunday when I was doin' time
And sent a letter every Monday just to ease my mind
To let a nigga know that pussy cat was still mine
And bought you two fat dildos just to kill time
The fact that I'm... on the other side of this glass
I realize... just exactly what a nigga had
You stayed wit' me... even though I used to spank that ass
Didn't hesitated wit' me... any time I needed cash
A many days I was stressed out and feelin' bad
You laid me down on my chest and massaged my back
And plenty days you don' cooked, and I never came home
Collard greens, macaroni & cheese, and neckbone
Po'kchop, sweet potato pie up out the stove so hot
I know I'm pimpin' right now, but baby one day this pimp gon' stop
I know I was crazy baby I had you out there slangin' rocks
But I'm out now so face it baby I gotta hit the block
What you talkin' 'bout? Hell yeah I love you and it ain't gon' stop
I always said I wan'nt gon' do it again but I never stop
But I did you so wrong - that's the purpose for this song
I didn't mean to break your heart but now our love is on the run
Run-run-run-run, fuss-n-fightin'
What's done is what's done, let bygones be bygones
And you was there - to console when I lost my homey
And you was there - to give me head anytime I was ho'ny/horny
And you was there - when my eyes was on the verge of cryin'
And you was there - when I was on the verge of dyin'
So how the fuck I fixed my mouth to call you a bitch
If you was bitchin', it's probably 'cause I got you pissed

Shawty, I know it's been hard on ya the past couple of years
You shed so many tears, wonderin' if my love is real
To show you how I feel, hell I mostly pay the bills
Hustle up on drug deals, so we can get a hot meal
I'm from the streets, so the streets don' made me how I is
I know I'm in them day and night, but that's just how I live
So ain't no need to fuss and fight, wit' you all in my grill
'Cause if I ain't want you, best believe that I wouldn't be here
Got some issues, best believe that we gon' get clear
'Cause you been down wit' me too long to up and disappear
Just give me time, enough time for me to stack a mil'
Then we can hit the hill and build us a tight crib
Some tight cars, candy paint wit' the big wheels
Bulletproof windshields, strapped with the blue steele
I know your love is trill, 'cause you don' stuck wit' me
So if I up and leave this city here, you goin' wit' me
If I come stuntin' in the hood, shit you stuntin' wit' me
And if I'm chiefin' me some wood, shit you chiefin' wit' me
I'll never get through thuggin', but'll be a good husband
The only one you lovin' plus the only one you fuckin'
The situation get ugly, then your head I'm bustin'

Maxamillion,"I looked to the North, and I turned to the West,
For a sign, a light in the sky,
Oh the message is clear, that the time is near,
For a leader to come again;

A circle of stones on the head of a hill,
Tonight is where it will be,
In this desolate place, we all stand and wait,
For a leader to come again, yes a leader will come again;

For it is written, that a leader will be here,
And then a vision, left me blinded by the light,
And it started right in front of my eyes",Leader (The Jesus Peace),2009

My place is with you

I've had my promises forsaken
Into many empty words
And I'm amazed and so astounded
That I won't get what I deserve

I know my place, my place is with you

You are my treasure forever
The one dream I've searched for

I've not been given my tomorrow
I'm only certain of today

I know we will be together

'Till I stand upon that mountain 
'Till I sit beside the thrown 
'Till the waters of loves fountain carry me home

Give me signs that I can follow

But why the hell did you come
All this way

With no money in the bank

Maxi Jazz,"I'm on lonely street age nearly three
Recently Mama's crying all the time 
Is it because of me or my younger sister, 
Even Dad was weeping when he kissed her.
Face all puffy like a blister, 
Crying like he missed her. 
Since we moved away from the house,
Where we used to play.
They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it, 
Mama never say nothing about it. 
How'd it get to be so crowded.
I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.
And I can't escape the feeling, 
Maybe I'm to blame. 
So I strain to listen, 
Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.
This feels like extradition or exile, 
Mama finds it hard to smile
So I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.
She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.
But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.

I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.
Took offense, took the kids,
I wish that was the end.
But before she took her leave 
She took care of my best friend.
Working all the hours. 
God send was not the tactic
You see, because after ten years I'm
? Wanted to make the cash
Quick so I had to work real late. 
Bad sex, my woman's vex, even if I stay awake.
And if I'm honest, I had a little cake at the office.
I was eating. We'd do our cheating over coffees,
Making tea for the bosses. 
Making free with me,
And I agree I got sleazy too easily.
But I'm forty three, 
This doesn't usually happen to me.
Now I'm lonely, 
I wonder what my son's doing today.
Suddenly I'm blinking like the screen 
On my computer display. 
And I'm drinking.
Concerned about what's down the track 
If I don't get my family back.

I want my family back

I'm on Lonely Street, number fifty three.
Boarded up property, 
I'll probably get pulled down.
Litter all around inside there's 
No sound and no light.
But yo it gets busy at night, People creeping.
Derelicts sneaking to fix. Speaking.
On the way my timbers creaking,
Roof leaking. And bricks coming loose, 
Knee high in refuse.
But even though I'm a slum,
I'm still of some use.
There was a time when my walls where decorated.
And under my roof children where educated.
But now paint's faded, windows are all smashed,
A crash in the economy robbed me of my family.
And no strategy, combats negative equity,
So that's it. Like violence it's drastic.

More than just a house for crack.

Maxi Jazz,"You know that I'm foolish, playing king for a day
I hang with my people whenever I can.
You say that I'm scruffy, misguided and blue, 
like a fly on a string. 
There's a web that surrounds you, but I will 
find a way in. 
Yeah, in your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will.
Yeah, in your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will.

You lay a place at your table, let me sleep in your bed
Yeah you hurt and confused me, but your my queen for a
day

I know I'm foolish, harsh and unfair
'Cause in my hour of need, I know you've always been
there

And in your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will
In your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will
I'll be there, yes I will
In your hour of need I'll be there, yes I will (3x)",Hour of Need,1998
Maxi Jazz,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home,
Conceding defeat with a low moan

Hangin' in A sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

I bought him coffee and a snack,
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes,
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach 'll burst,
Feel like I've been cursed.
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock
You got eternity for takin' stock,
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked.
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust,
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys
Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near,
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sittin' with dread pickin' my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
An' I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest from just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found,
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges at the thought
Of syringes

J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows,
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest
You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near-human pitch
Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears to find the key to this
Cage
And write another stage into a new age,
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone

Jerome took me home under steel skies
Knowing I'm prone to dramatize but unknown for telling lies
And what I verbalize he can see behind my eyes
The why oh why's that identify killer lullabies
And he surmised
No surprise couldn't hear that
Closed my eyes as he steered that old black BM home again
Not knowing how and not knowing when.",Killer's Lullaby,1998
Maxi Jazz,"Oh, darling, I miss you``
An boy has it hard
The thought of you leavin'
Is breakin' my heart

New York, New York, temperature's droppin'
The band's out shoppin', not stoppin' 'til ears pop
Cops protect shops, lots of yellow cabs and bellhops
And it never stops
I'm waitin' to do an interview, so much to tell you
Today I feel close enough to smell you
Additional dates they were plannin' just fell through
Florida's out
We fly September 22 to Heathrow, but there's not really long to go
Tonight will be a brilliant show
Lettin' you know I miss you
More than four hits the floor at a party
Send my love to everybody

Oh, darling, I miss you
An boy has it hard
The thought of you leavin'
Is breakin' my heart

Honey, I'm writin' from D.C., feelin' queasy
Stayin' healthy on the road isn't easy
The tm. recommends an antigen
One of them could resist taking a piss
I miss you like a lock in the door
What's more, I go to sleep with my walkman 'cause half the crew snored
Don't mean to be a bore, everybody's been great
But there's fifteen of us in a bus state-to-state
So I stay up late with a tape, or meditate
My bed is travellin' at fifty-five m.p.h.
When we make it to la, I'll still be miles away
It's not my best day

Oh, darling, I miss you

God bless

An boy has it hard
The thought of you leavin'
Is breakin' my heart
If these walls can hold you
My house will be down
If these walls can hold you
My house will be down
Oh, darling, I miss you
My house will be down
Oh, darling, we urge you

Maxi Jazz,"I see you workin' through the bead curtain 
In you kitchen, switchin', leavin' me twitchin' 
I'm itchin' to be kissin' you, but disciplne is the rule 
So I sip my orange juice and act cool 
She irresistible 
We fool around twice a week, makes me weak 
Nice, when she put her tongeu in my cheek 
Not petite, baby got a large physique 
She take charge, take me were I dare not repeat 
I got T-T-T-T-like a high hat 
Planting kisses on your back 
You like that 
Mrs X. reputation intact, nobody on my block 
Know we lock down like that in the next flat 
But one from whre I live with my mum and uncle John 
He ain't my uncle an' it's been far too long 
But me 'n' she been goin' strong almost a year 
Wait til the coast is clear, I don't boast for fear 
Of being caught. Maybe w ought to stop, maybe not 
For now baby gets all I got. Boom! 
How come we always trash the room? Grab ya clothes 
'cause ya know someone'll be home soon 
An' I assume there'll be a need to explain gently 
Why this mother of three is playin' games with me 
She's my baby 

I'm a slave to your outrage 
Rocket box stiff shocks an' a roll cage 
Colour coded alloys, much noise, spoilers an' poise 
Exhaust notes an antidote for old age 
Yes! Yes! 
Who got the keys to my R.S. we goin' on a road test 
Hit the M4 and head west, forever impressed 
With the sound of my two litre, we cover ground 
Engine singin' like Anita Baker 
An' iff I take a corner too quick why' get sick 
When I do my hand-bake trick, watch me ride 
Mi broadside slide like a battleship 

Side-slip puch out mi hip 
Stick it in gear an' give the gas a blip. It 
Never fail to bring a grin to the lip, Baby's equipped 
Me an' she gone clear I got quik rack reduction 
On the under steer, I been 
Fairly and squarely described as hairy 
People say my baby is scary 
Look you takes your money and you takes your schoice 
I just love to hear my baby's voice 
She's my baby 

I roll up for the session, ev'rything in position 
My friends demonstratin' erudition 
I listen for a minute before takin' sides 
Sleepy eyes on the limit sit down an' spin it 
Like we do every Friday down my way 
Why play the fool with demon alcohol 
As a rule my baby gets passed around 
I don't frown, I love to see my friends gettin' down 
When it's just me an' she you know it's never precarious 
But sharin' with ya buddies is hilarious 
Variously we argua an' disagree an' get heated 
Hafta tell my people to be seated 
An' restart the anti-stress process 
'Til there's a big mess of twigs an' seeds to meetcha needs 
An' with that first inhaled hello...

I got it learning to share my peoples pain
I got it making flowers grow in hearts of stone

As fresher full of vigour life becomes my mirror
The further I go the more I know

Turned up in places that I never intended to go
And so ended my youth I once deepended on proof

Guiding me through this hall of fears

Circling momentum round and round
Quenching my thirst

Second to fill my silent mouth

I gave up the fight.

There's a million reasons why
We were once so good together
Now we're living separate lives

Don't hurt the way I do crying over you
And you don't need me anymore

Then I realize the score

And tonight I feel the blues
So afraid to think about tomorrow

For so many years
Been through stormy weather
Shared our joys and tears

Has got me so confused
Feeling so rejected
Feeling like I'm used

What more can I say

Seems I'm wasting my time
Trying to show you

You've got the best of me

Only just to please you

Yes I've made my mistakes
With no intent to hurt you
Tried so very hard
Just to make you understand

Peace throughout the world ooh
Oh peace mmm
 
In a world where peoples' feelings don't matter
In a world where people just don't care
I search the high and low to find myself an answer
Nothing seems to matter, no one seems to care
Take a look to the future
What do you see
Twentieth century going down on it's knees
If we ever get there what would we do
'Cause there won't be nothing there for me and you

Maxi Priest,"Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
Alone in a crowd on a bus after working, I'm dreaming
The guy next to me has a girl in his arms, my arms are empty
How does it feel when the girl next to you says she loves you?
Seems so unfair when there's love everywhere but there's none for me
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
Woo woo woo 
Woo woo woo
 
Someone to take on a walk by the lake Lord, let it be me
Someone who's shy, someone who'd cry at sad movies
I know I would die if I ever found out she was foolin' me
You're just a dream, and as real as it seems, I ain't that lucky
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
All of my friends have a ring on their finger, they have someone
Someone to care for them, it ain't fair, I got no one
The car overheated, I called up and pleaded, there's help on the way
I called you collect, you didn't accept, you had nothing to say
 
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys get all the breaks
Some guys do nothing but complain
 
But if you were here with me
I'd feel so happy, I could cry
You are so dear to me
I just can't let you say goodbye

I carry their DNA 
We are representatives of a long line of people 
And we carried them around either with 
This long line of people 
That goes back to the beginning of time 
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people 
And we say bring together the lines of me 

When I look back over the years 
At the things that brought tears to my eyes 
Papa said we have to be wise 
To live long lives 
Now I recognize 
What my father said before he dies 
Vocalize things I've left unsaid 
Left my spirit unfed for too long 
I'm coming home to my family 
Where I can be strong 
Be who I planned to be 
Within me my ancestry 
Givin' me continuity 

Would it be remiss to continue in this way 
Would you rather I quit 
Come with that other shit
Making people's hips sway 
Lip service I pay, but I'm nervous 
I pray for all the mothers who get no sleep 
Like a lifeline, I light lines 
'Cause my compassion is deep 
For the people who fashioned me, my soul to keep
And this is who I happen to be 
And if I don't see that I'm strong, then I won't be

This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
Than he did 
But he taught me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never want to shame

Remember me? 
I'm the man you thought I'd never be. 
I'm the boy who you 
Reduced to tears 
Dad, I'd been lonely for 27 years 
Yeah, that's right 
My name Rob 
I'm the one 
Who landed the popstar's job 
I'm the one who 
You told look, don't touch 
I'm the kid 
Who wouldn't amount too much. 

I believe in the senses that I sound 
I have always been too loud 
Won't you help me drown it out? 
And When I feel 
What I'm feeling is so real 
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel
Always digging in my heels 
Now I got the faith to 

Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
Water to air 
You're on your feet again 
Your feet again. 

Ha, lace up your booty 
Going back to the roots, continue my interlude 
Feed freakin' for loot 
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now 
And your forefathers further know how 
But now, what happened to the world without the hatred 
Use your head, if the needle is wise, be the thread 
And weave ancestral wisdom, yours by best 
Spreading the Lord's word over this broad Earth

This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
than he did 
But he told me my culture

Wollt’ nie auf Partys sein, die Fans machen Musiker zu Stars
Im Nachhinein betrachtet war die Jugendzeit für’n Arsch
In der Schule nie am Start, keine Klausuren, kein Diktat
Wer selber sucht und hinterfragt, braucht kein gutes Resultat
Denn was gut ist für den Staat, muss nicht gut sein für uns
Sie verletzen mich, so texte ich mit Blut meine Kunst
Hab’ genug meiner Jungs scheitern sehen, wir bleiben stehen
Doch sollten weitergehen und Hürden einfach nehmen so wie ein Leichtathlet
Du findest deine Wege zum Glück
Als ich nur stehenblieb und nach vorne schaute, ließ mich dieses Leben zurück
Ich mein’, ich sterb’ nicht dran, doch lernte manchmal gibt es nichts zu Ernte Dank
Ich schalt’ die Birne aus, schalt den Fernseher an und denke mir nur

Hoffentlich denk’ ich nur zu viel nach
Alles ist gut und mir fehlt nur ein bisschen Schlaf
Hoffentlich fühlt es sich nur so an
Als wär’ die Krone auf meinem Kopf in Wirklichkeit ein Dornenkranz

Denn der Radius unseres Lebens beträgt 50 Kilometer
Und soweit können unsere Augen sehen, Augen sehen
Und unsere Arme reichen gerade, um die Glühbirne zu wechseln
Unsere Probleme dafür einmal um den Planet, einmal um den Planet

Hoffentlich denk’ ich nur zu viel nach
Alles ist gut und mir fehlt nur ein bisschen Schlaf
Hoffentlich fühlt es sich nur so an
Als wär’ die Krone auf meinem Kopf in Wirklichkeit ein Dornenkranz",Ernte Dank,

My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim

Hier, wo wir unsere Generation begraben, 
In einer schlichten Kiste, aus einem schwarzen Wagen, 
Auf den Schultern unserer Kinder vor uns hergetragen. 
Unsere Mäntel wehen stumm im Regen, 
Niemand faltet die Hände, um für uns zu beten, 
Keine letzten Worte, keine Trauerreden, 
Keine Nasen triefen, keine Augen tränen.

Keine Lieder, keine Fahnen, 
Kein Weihrauch und kein Amen, 
Wir kriegen nicht mal einen Namen 
Und alles, was auf unserem Grabstein steht, 
Ist 1980 bis 2010.

Ein Sonnenstrahl fällt auf den Stein daneben, 
Wo unsere Eltern stehen und ihre Blumen niederlegen. 
Dort liegt ein Traum begraben und er wird weiterleben, 
Während hier Unkraut wächst und Spinnen ihre Netze weben. 
Ich schau zu den Krähen, die in den Ästen sitzen 
Während sie Erde über unsere Überreste kippen. 
Keine Taschentücher, keinen letzten Segen 
Und es ist jetzt schon so, als wären wir immer weggewesen.

War seitdem keinmal verliebt
Ich hab geschworen ich heirate nie
Doch heute besieg ich diesen Fluch
Reiß den Schmerz aus der Seele
Und hoff' er kommt nie wieder zu Besuch
Du warst das längste Kapitel in meim' Buch
Doch um das Schlusswort zu erreichen war die Liebe nicht genug
Gute Männer lieben schlechte Frauen, ist was ich heute weiß
Und gute Frauen lieben schlechte Männer, ein Teufelskreis
Ich könnte dich nicht mehr berühren sogar wenn ich will
Für mich und meine Seele bist du eine Brennessel
Ich wünschte das wär alles nicht passiert, meine
Erinnerungen, ich begrabe sie mit dir
Doch muss noch oft dran denken, nachts in meim' Bett
Über diese eine Frage, was wäre wenn?
Und die Antwort darauf wieso es nie mehr wird wie's war
Ist ganz einfach

Wir waren Porzellan
Ich hab' uns bloß in die Ecke gestellt
Und übersehen wie perfekt es war
Bis es zu tausend Teilen zerbrach
Wir waren Porzellan
Und alles was danach kam
Waren billig Imitate
Denn sowas wie wir ist rar

Wir waren Porzellan
Wir waren Porzellan
Wir waren, wir waren

I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine

I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so

And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained

I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim

Being observed by the onlooker
Kill the lamb inside that exists
And taken the kiss away from my lips

Boiled down to a broth, but never consumed

Reload the elements, bring forth the ingredients

As the fire continues to burn
So does the food upon my dish
Lost souls swirl around the ceiling
The stench is high like fish
I bring forth all the ingredients, the elements
Bake a cake and feed the multitude
I play the prostitute in the house of ill repute

Elements in Hell's kitchen, elements
Elements in Hell's kitchen, elements

The utensils I use in my kitchen
Belong to me and nobody else
I feed you complex styles of my spoon
'cause a normal spoon, that would melt
Glamorise with my dressing
Nouns, pronouns, verbs are my herbs
Succulent and edible, digestible
Each and every single verse

Come sip my melodic substance
Wet your plate, drink every drop from the glass
Everything is pulverised, double-fried
And contains everything that's phat
This ain't no fast lyric joint
Unlike fast food everything has a point
Nutritional characteristics, your brain I anoint

Maxim,"Distort your mind, corrupt children of all kinds
Your intellect, I deform and warp, in my storm is where you're caught
Reinstate your faith, your only faith is me they love to hate
I'm the true dealer, with me they're familiar

Caught up in my web, you got me caught up in your head
I'm the shadow dark, that hides behind your heart
Dr. Jekyll inside, if you'll be Mr. Hyde
Try to control me, try to control me

Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head

Systems I pollute, come bite my forbidden fruit
Stain your environment, chalk up my bad influence
Saturate reality, go to battle with your sanity
The human race I exploit, and I leave you no choice

Flood and overflow your cranium, what's the millennium?
Personality not present, overturn your only innocence
Suffocate your desire, set your vivid force on fire
Into my world which you brought, prepare for second onslaught

Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head

I'll stunt your growth, degrade your self-esteem, leave you no hope
Bleach your eyes with turpentine, tamper with the cord in the spine
Subside your love life, separate the yolk from the white
I'm the true creator, mind decapitator

I'm the evil that lurks, the pain inside that hurts
Spike your dreams, plant my thoughts obscene, unclean
Impregnate your ears, when you hear me, it's me you fear
Me they hate the most, oh fuck, here comes the third dose

Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head

Dissect you, detect my style like Ceausescu
Sell your soul, libido, jeopardize, pulverize your ego
Dice and slice your skills, your pride inside, I kill
Show no remorse, you shouldn't play with the true force

Terminate and scandalize, damage, expose, rectify
You best fake your death, after me there'll be nothing left
Abuse and torture, lyrically bring the lamb to the slaughter
Increase my pace, style for direct in your face

Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web
You got me caught up in your head
Caught up in my web

Y no te voy a negar que a su vez mucha falta me hiciste, (pero piche, piche mas),
Pero el tiempo ayudo a superar el daño que hiciste
Y ahora vine hasta aquí pa' decirte
“Jersey el de la mente dañada”

Y ahora no me importa con quien tu estés
Me tiene sin cuidado me importa 5 y 3
Yo tengo una gata que tiene una amiga
Y ahora estoy mejor porque somos 3

Y ahora no me importa con quien tu estés
Me tiene sin cuidado me tiene 5 y 3
Yo tengo una gata que tiene una amiga
Y ahora estoy mejor porque somos 3

Y a no me importa lo que tú quieras hacer con tu vida,
Me tiene 5-3 porque ya yo hice la mía
Tengo dos gatas que se van conmigo a plena luz del día,
Que se tocan y se besan mientras yo las hago mías
Quiero decirte que ya tú vida no me importa
Que estoy mejor sin ti que ahora me sobran las tortas
Tengo muchas amiguitas que conmigo se comportan en la cama como que yo soy el que las transporta


Solo espero que te vaya muy bien,
Mami que sea feliz
Al fin  ahora  que me importa a mí,
A mí me va bien, me siento muy bien, te juro que me va mejor sin ti

No tengas esa presión de que me joda tocona, de que te pases peleando y me des cabrona en la nota, de que si estoy con aquella, de que si estoy con la otra, mami me siento tranquilo de no escucharte la boca,

Tranquila vive tu vida
Que sigo en la mía vacilando con mía gata y con su amiga
Somos tres y ellas dos me tienen al día, y en tu cara se ve que estas ardida

Y ahora no me importa con quien tu estés
Me tiene sin cuidado me importa 5 y 3
Yo tengo una gata que tiene una amiga
Y ahora estoy mejor porque somos 3

Y ahora no me importa con quien tu estés
Me tiene sin cuidado me tiene 5 y 3

Y ahora estoy mejor porque somos 3

Y tuqui tuqui y tú fuiste te perdiste te jodiste
Por más que te lo dije, mi corazón tú partiste
Aquí sin gajo detuvo mi soledad, 
y por proyectar tu odio ahora es doble mi maldad

Y mira mami, mira lo que tengo ahora
Tengo dos gatitas y usted anda sola
Y se te calentó y a mí se me dio
juanki te gano, cagate en la O

Y mira mami, mira lo que tengo ahora
Tengo dos gatitas y usted anda sola
Y se te calentó y a mí se me dio

Maxime le Forestier,"Je vivais à l'écart de la place publique,
Serein, contemplatif, ténébreux, bucolique
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloire,
Sur mon brin de laurier je dormais comme un loir.
Les gens de bon conseil ont su me faire comprendre
Qu'à l'homme de la rue j'avais des comptes à rendre
Et que, sous peine de choir dans un oubli complet,
Je devais mettre au grand jour tous mes petits secrets.

Trompettes
De la Renommée,
Vous êtes
Bien mal embouchées!

Manquant à la pudeur la plus élémentaire,
Dois-je, pour les besoins d' la cause publicitaire,
Divulguer avec qui, et dans quelle position
Je plonge dans le stupre et la fornication?
Si je publie des noms, combien de Pénélopes
Passeront illico pour de fieffées salopes,
Combien de bons amis me regarderont de travers,
Combien je recevrai de coups de revolver!

A toute exhibition, ma nature est rétive,
Souffrant d'un' modestie quasiment maladive,
Je ne fais voir mes organes procréateurs
A personne, excepté mes femmes et mes docteurs.
Dois-je, pour défrayer la chronique des scandales,
Battre l' tambour avec mes parties génitales,
Dois-je les arborer plus ostensiblement,
Comme un enfant de chœur porte un saint sacrement?

Une femme du monde, et qui souvent me laisse
Faire mes quat' voluptés dans ses quartiers d' noblesse,
M'a sournoisement passé, sur son divan de soie,
Des parasites du plus bas étage qui soit
Sous prétexte de bruit, sous couleur de réclame,
Ai-j' le droit de ternir l'honneur de cette dame
En criant sur les toits, et sur l'air des lampions
""Madame la marquis' m'a foutu des morpions!""?

Le ciel en soit loué, je vis en bonne entente
Avec le Père Duval, la calotte chantante,
Lui, le catéchumène, et moi, l'énergumène,
Il me laisse dire merde, je lui laisse dire amen,
En accord avec lui, dois-je écrire dans la presse
Qu'un soir je l'ai surpris aux genoux d' ma maîtresse,
Chantant la mélopée d'une voix qui susurre,
Tandis qu'elle lui cherchait des poux dans la tonsure?

Avec qui, ventrebleu! faut-il que je couche
Pour faire parler un peu la déesse aux cent bouches?
Faut-il qu'un' femme célèbre, une étoile, une star,
Vienne prendre entre mes bras la place de ma guitare?
Pour exciter le peuple et les folliculaires,
Qui est-ce qui veut me prêter sa croupe populaire,
Qui est-ce qui veut m' laisser faire, in naturalibus,
Un petit peu d'alpinisme sur son mont de Vénus?

Sonneraient-elles plus fort, ces divines trompettes,
Si, comme tout un chacun, j'étais un peu tapette,
Si je me déhanchais comme une demoiselle
Et prenais tout à coup des allumes de gazelle?
Mais je ne sache pas que ça profite à ces drôles
De jouer le jeu d' l'amour en inversant les rôles,
Que ça confère à ma gloire un' once de plus-valu',
Le crime pédérastique, aujourd'hui, ne paie plus.

Après ce tour d'horizon des mille et un' recettes
Qui vous valent à coup sûr les honneurs des gazettes,
J'aime mieux m'en tenir à ma première façon
Et me gratter le ventre en chantant des chansons.
Si le public en veut, je les sors dare-dare,
S'il n'en veut pas je les remets dans ma guitare.
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloire,
Sur mon brin de laurier je m'endors comme un loir.",Les Trompettes de La Renommée,1991

un brin d'admiration, soit dit sans ironie,
car ce n'est sûrement pas une sinécure,
non, que de se laisser cracher à la figure
par la canaille et la racaille réunies.
bien sûr, il est normal que la foule révère
ce héros qui jadis partit pour aller faire
l'alpiniste avant l'heure en haut du golgotha,
en portant sur l'épaule une croix accablante,
en méprisant l'insulte et le remonte-pente,
et sans aucun bravo qui le réconfortât !
bien sûr, autour du front, la couronne d'épines,
l'éponge trempée dans dieu sait quelle bibine,
et les clous enfoncés dans les pieds et les mains,
c'est très inconfortable et ça vous tarabuste,
même si l'on est brave et si l'on est robuste,
et si le paradis est au bout du chemin.
bien sûr, mais il devait défendre son prestige,
car il était le fils du ciel, l'enfant prodige,
il était le messie et ne l'ignorait pas.
entre son père et lui, c'était l'accord tacite :
tu montes sur la croix et je te ressuscite !
on meurt de confiance avec un tel papa.
il a donné sa vie sans doute mais son zèle
avait une portée quasi universelle
qui rendait le supplice un peu moins douloureux.
il savait que, dans chaque église, il serait tête
d'affiche et qu'il aurait son portrait en vedette,
entouré des élus, des saints, des bienheureux.
en se sacrifiant, il sauvait tous les hommes.
du moins le croyait-il ! au point où nous en sommes,
on peut considérer qu'il s'est fichu dedans.
le jeu, si j'ose dire, en valait la chandelle.

pour un but aussi noble, en feraient tout autant.

Pour commettre force rapines
Et même enlever nos Sabines

Et la défaite bien amère

Qu'on battit à plate couture
Qui partit en déconfitur

Vague sans amplitude aucune

Que les femelles du canton
Contemplaient un puissant gorille
Sans souci du qu'en-dira-t-on

Avec impudeur, ces commères
Lorgnaient même un endroit précis
Que, rigoureusement ma mère
M'a défendu dénommer ici gare au gorille

Tout à coup, la prise bien close
Où vivait le bel animal
S'ouvre on ne sait pourquoi
(Je suppose qu'on avait du la fermer mal)

Le singe, en sortant de sa cage
Dit ""c'est aujourd'hui que je le perds""
Il parlait de son pucelage
Vous avez deviné, j'espère gare au gorille

Criait, éperdu, ""Nom de nom
C'est assommant car le gorille
N'a jamais connu de guenon""

Sut que le singe était puceau
Au lieu de profiter de la chance
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux gare au gorille

Celles là même qui, naguère
Le couvaient d'un œil décidé
Fuirent, prouvant qu'elles n'avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées

D'autant plus vaine était leur crainte
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l'homme dans l'étreinte
Bien des femmes vous le diront gare au gorille

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d'atteinte du singe en rut
Sauf une vielle décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut

Voyant que toutes se dérobent
Le quadrumane accéléra
Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vielle et du magistrat gare au gorille

""Bah, soupirait la centiare
Qu'on puisse encore me désirer
Ce serait extraordinaire
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré""

Le juge pensait, impassible
""Qu'on me prenne pour une guenon
C'est complètement impossible""
La suite lui prouva que non gare au gorille

Supposez que l'un de vous puisse être
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre
Lequel choisirait-il des deux?

Qu'une alternative pareille
Un de ces quatres jours, m'échoie
C'est, j'en suis convaincu, la vielle
Qui sera l'objet de mon choix gare au gorille

Mais, par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l'amour vaut son prix
On sait qu'en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût, ni par l'esprit

Lors, au lieu d'opter pour la vielle
Comme aurait fait n'importe qui
Il saisit le juge à l'oreille
Et l'entraîna dans un maquis gare au gorille

La suite serait délectable
Malheureusement, je ne peux
Pas la dire, et c'est regrettable
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu

Car le juge, au moment suprême
Criait, ""Maman"" pleurait beaucoup

Il avait fait trancher le cou gare au gorille

Au grand soupir des gens du lieu

On avait droit d'épouser Dieu
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent

Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent

Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent

Au brigand par l'enfer conduit
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or quand, dans la nef descendue
La nonne appela le bandit
Au lieu de la voix attendue
C'est la foudre qui répondit
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent

Maxime le Forestier,"La Camarde qui ne m'a jamais pardonné
D´avoir semé des fleurs dans les trous de son nez
Me poursuit d'un zèle imbécile
Alors cerné de près par les enterrements
J´ai cru bon de remettre à jour mon testament
De me payer un codicille

Trempe dans l'encre bleue du Golfe du Lion
Trempe, trempe ta plume, à mon vieux tabellion
Et de ta plus belle écriture
Note ce qu'il faudra qu'il advint de mon corps
Lorsque mon âme et lui ne seront plus d'accord
Que sur un seul point, la rupture

Quand mon âme aura pris son vol à l'horizon
Vers celle de Gavroche et de Mimi Pinson
Celles des titis, des grisettes
Que vers le sol natal mon corps soit ramené
Dans un sleeping du Paris-Méditerranée
Terminus en gare de Sète

Mon caveau de famille, hélas! n'est pas tout neuf
Vulgairement parlant, il est plein comme un œuf
Et d'ici que quelqu'un n'en sorte
Il risque de se faire tard et je ne peux
Dire à ces braves gens, poussez-vous donc un peu
Place aux jeunes en quelque sorte

Juste au bord de la mer à deux pas des flots bleus
Creusez si c'est possible un petit trou moelleux
Une bonne petite niche
Auprès de mes amis d'enfance, les dauphins
Le long de cette grève où le sable est si fin
Sur la plage de la corniche

C'est une plage où même à ses moments furieux
Neptune ne se prend jamais trop au sérieux
Où quand un bateau fait naufrage
Le capitaine crie ""Je suis le maître à bord!
Sauve qui peut, le vin et le pastis d'abord
Chacun sa bonbonne et courage""

Oh, et c'est là que jadis à quinze ans révolus
A l'âge où s'amuser tout seul ne suffit plus
Je connu la prime amourette
Auprès d'une sirène, une femme-poisson
J'ai reçu de l'amour la première leçon
Avalait la première arête

Déférence gardée envers Paul Valéry
Moi l'humble troubadour sur lui je renchéris
Le bon maître me le pardonne
Et qu'au moins si ses vers valent mieux que les miens
Mon cimetière soit plus marin que le sien
N'en déplaise aux autochtones

Cette tombe en sandwich entre le ciel et l'eau
Ne donnera pas une ombre triste au tableau
Mais un charme indéfinissable
Les baigneuses s'en serviront de paravent
Pour changer de tenue et les petits enfants
Diront, chouette, un château de sable!

Est-ce trop demander, sur mon petit lopin
Planter, je vous en prie une espèce de pin
Pin parasol de préférence
Qui saura prémunir contre l´insolation
Les bons amis venus faire sur ma concession
D'affectueuses révérences

Tantôt venant d'Espagne, tantôt d'Italie
Tous chargés de parfums, de musiques jolies
Le Mistral, la Tramontane
Sur mon dernier sommeil verseront les échos
De villanelle, un jour, un jour de fandango
De tarentelle, de sardane

Et quand prenant ma butte en guise d'oreiller
Une ondine viendra gentiment sommeiller
Avec moins que rien de costume
J'en demande pardon par avance à Jésus
Si l'ombre de sa croix s'y couche un peu dessus
Pour un petit bonheur posthume

Pauvres rois pharaons, pauvre Napoléon
Pauvres grands disparus gisant au Panthéon
Pauvres cendres de conséquence

Maxime le Forestier,"Notre voisin l'ancêtre était un fier galant
Qui n'emmerdait personne avec sa barbe blanche
Et quand le bruit courut qu'ses jours étaient comptés
On s'en fut à l'hospice afin de l'assister

On avait apporté les guitars avec nous
Car, devant la musique, il tombait à genoux
Excepté toutefois les marches militaires

Et les soirs de nouba, paroles de tavernier

De ces eaux minérales
Bénites ou lustrales
Mais du bon vin, crénom de nom!

Car l'ancêtre courait la gueuse volontiers
De sa main toujours leste et digne cependant
Il troussait les jupons par n'importe quel temps

Depuis Manon Lescaut jusques à Dalila

Maxime le Forestier,"Ayant avecques lui toujours fait bon ménage
J'eusse aimé célébrer sans être inconvenant
Tendre corps féminin ton plus bel apanage
Que tous ceux qui l'ont vu disent hallucinant.

Ceût été mon ultime chant mon chant du cygne
Mon dernier billet doux mon message d'adieu
Or malheureusement les mots qui le désignent
Le disputent à l'exécrable à l'odieux.

C'est la grande pitié de la langue française
C'est son talon d'Achille et c'est son déshonneur
De n'offrir que des mots entachés de bassesse
A cette incomparable instrument de bonheur.

Alors que tant de fleurs ont des noms poétiques
Tendre corps féminin' c'est fort malencontreux
Que la fleur la plus douce la plus érotique
Et la plus enivrante en ait de plus scabreux.

Mais le pire de tous est un petit vocable
De trois lettres pas plus familier coutumier
Il est inexplicable il est irrévocable

Honte à celui-là qui par dépit par gageure
Dota de même terme en son fiel venimeux

Misogyne à coup sûr asexué sans doute
Au charmes de Vénus absolument rétif

Fit ce rapprochement d'ailleurs intempestif.

La malpeste soit de cette homonymie
C'est injuste madame et c'est désobligeant
Que ce morceau de roi de votre anatomie
Porte le même nom qu'une foule de gens.

Un poète inspiré que Pégase soutient
Donne en effaçant d'un coup des siècles d'avanie
A cette vraie merveille un joli nom chrétien

Maxime le Forestier,"Du temps que régnait le Grand Pan,
Les dieux protégaient les ivrognes
Des tas de génies titubants
Au nez rouge, à la rouge trogne.
Dès qu'un homme vidait les cruchons,
Qu'un sac à vin faisait carousse
Ils venaient en bande à ses trousses
Compter les bouchons.
La plus humble piquette était alors bénie,
Distillée par Noé, Silène, et compagnie.
Le vin donnait un lustre au pire des minus,
Et le moindre pochard avait tout de Bacchus.

{Refrain:}
Mais en se touchant le crâne, en criant "" J'ai trouvé ""
La bande au professeur Nimbus est arrivée
Qui s'est mise à frapper les cieux d'alignement,
Chasser les Dieux du Firmament.

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les gens boivent encore,
Et le feu du nectar fait toujours luire les trognes.
Mais les dieux ne répondent plus pour les ivrognes.
Bacchus est alcoolique, et le grand Pan est mort.

Quand deux imbéciles heureux
S'amusaient à des bagatelles,
Un tas de génies amoureux

Venaient leur tenir la chandelle.
Du fin fond du champs élysées
Dès qu'ils entendaient un "" Je t'aime "",
Ils accouraient à l'instant même
Compter les baisers.
La plus humble amourette
Etait alors bénie
Sacrée par Aphrodite, Eros, et compagnie.
L'amour donnait un lustre au pire des minus,
Et la moindre amoureuse avait tout de Vénus.

{Refrain}

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les c?urs battent encore,
Et la règle du jeu de l'amour est la même.
Mais les dieux ne répondent plus de ceux qui s'aiment.
Vénus s'est faite femme, et le grand Pan est mort.

Et quand fatale sonnait l'heure
De prendre un linceul pour costume
Un tas de génies l'?il en pleurs
Vous offraient des honneurs posthumes.
Et pour aller au céleste empire,
Dans leur barque ils venaient vous prendre.
C'était presque un plaisir de rendre
Le dernier soupir.
La plus humble dépouille était alors bénie,
Embarquée par Caron, Pluton et compagnie.
Au pire des minus, l'âme était accordée,
Et le moindre mortel avait l'éternité.

{Refrain}

Aujourd'hui ça et là, les gens passent encore,
Mais la tombe est hélas la dernière demeure
Les dieux ne répondent plus de ceux qui meurent.
La mort est naturelle, et le grand Pan est mort.

Et l'un des dernier dieux, l'un des derniers suprêmes,
Ne doit plus se sentir tellement bien lui-même
Un beau jour on va voir le Christ
Descendre du calvaire en disant dans sa lippe
"" Merde je ne joue plus pour tous ces pauvres types.
J'ai bien peur que la fin du monde soit bien triste. """,Le Grand Pan,1998
Maxime le Forestier,"Mariage d'amour, mariage d'argent

Je garderais toujours le souvenir content
Du jour de pauvre noce où mon père et ma mère
S'allèrent épouser devant Monsieur le Maire

C'est dans un char à bœufs, s'il faut parler bien franc
Tiré par les amis, poussé par les parents
Que les vieux amoureux firent leurs épousailles
Après long temps d'amour, long temps de fiançailles
Cortège nuptial hors de l'ordre courant
La foule nous couvait d'un œil protubérant
Nous étions contemplés par le monde futile
Qui n'avait jamais vu de noces de ce style

Voici le vent qui souffle emportant, crève-cœur
Le chapeau de mon père et les enfants de chœur
Voilà la pluie qui tombe en pesant bien ses gouttes
Comme pour empêcher la noc', coûte que coûte

Je n'oublierai jamais la mariée en pleurs
Berçant comme un' poupée son gros bouquet de fleurs
Moi, pour la consoler, moi, de toute ma morgue
Sur mon harmonica jouant les grandes orgues

Ancienne enfant d'Marie-salope

Dedans ses trompes de Fallope,
S'introduit des cierges sacrés.
Des cierges de cire d'abeille
Plus onéreux, mais bien meilleurs, {2x}
Dame! la qualité se paye
A Saint-Sulpice, comme ailleurs. {2x}

Quand son bon maître lui dit : ""Est-ce
Trop vous demander Mélanie,
De n'user, par délicatesse,
Que de cierges non encore bénits ?""
Du tac au tac, elle réplique
Moi, je préfère qu'ils le soient, {2x}
Car je suis bonne catholique
Elle a raison, ça va de soi. {2x}

Elle vous emprunte un cierge à Pâques
Vous le rend à la Trinité.
Non, non, non, ne me dites pas que
C'est normal de tant le garder.

De vouer, c'était pas si bête,
Un cierge au patron des marins.

Alors le saint, cet imbécile,
Laissa le marin se noyer. {2x}

Les bons fidèles qui désirent
Garder pour eux, sur le chemin
Des processions, leur bout de cire
Doiv'nt le tenir à quatre mains,
Car quand elle s'en mêl', sainte vierge,
Elle cause un désastre, un malheur. {2x}

C'est le jour de la Chandeleur. {2x}

Comme ell' remue, comme elle se cabre,
Comme elle fait des soubresauts, {2x}
En retournant au candélabre,
Ils sont souvent en p'tits morceaux. {2x}

Et comme elle n'est pas de glace,
Parfois quand elle les restitue
Et qu'on veut les remettre en place,
Ils sont complètement fondus.
Et comme en outre elle n'est pas franche,
Il arrive neuf fois sur dix {2x}
Qu'sur un chandelier à sept branches
Elle n'en rapporte que six. {2x}

C'est notre devoir, il est temps, {2x}
De nous employer à soustraire
Cette âme aux griffes de Satan. {2x}

Un cierge abondamment béni
Qu'on fera brûler en cachette
En cachette de Mélanie.

En ce qui me concerne, ayant un jour compris
Qu'une femme adultère est plus qu'une autre exquise,
Je cherche mon bonheur à l'ombre des maris.

A l'ombre des maris mais, cela va sans dire,
Pas n'importe lesquels, je les tri', les choisis.

Ils sont loins mes débuts ou, manquant de pratique,
Sur des femmes de flics je mis mon dévolu.
Je n'étais pas encore ouvert à l'esthétique.
Cette faute de gout je ne la commets plus.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Oui, je suis tatillon, pointilleux, mais j'estime
Que le mari doit être un gentleman complet,
Car on finit tous deux par devenir intimes
A force, à force de se passer le relais

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Mais si l'on tombe, hélas! sur des maris infames,
Certains sont si courtois, si bons si chaleureux,
Que, même apres avoir cessé d'aimer leur femme,
On fait encore semblant uniquement pour eux.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

C'est mon cas ces temps-ci, je suis triste, malade,
Quand je dois faire honneur à certaine pecore.
Mais, son mari et moi, c'est Oreste et Pylade,
Et, pour garder l'ami, je la cajole encore.

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,
Je suis derrière...

Non contente de me dé plaire, elle me trompe,
Et les jours ou, furieux, voulant tout mettre à bas
Je cri:""La coupe est pleine, il est temps que je rompe!""
Le mari me suppli':""Non ne me quittez pas!""

Ne jetez pas la pierre à la femme adultère,

Et je reste, et, tous deux, ensemble on se flagorne.

Il paraît que, dessous sa cornette fatale
Qu'elle arbore à la messe avec tant de rigueur,
Cette petite sœur cache, c'est un scandale!
Une queue de cheval et des accroche-cœurs.
Et les enfants de chœur s'agitent dans les stalles

Il paraît que, dessous son gros habit de bure,
Elle porte coquettement des bas de soi',
Festons, frivolités, fanfreluches, guipures,
Enfin tout ce qu'il faut pour que le diable y soit.
Et les enfants de chœur ont des pensées impures

Il paraît que le soir, en voici bien d'une autre!
A l'heure où ses consœurs sont sagement couchés
Ou débitent pieusement des patenôtres,
Elle se déshabille devant sa psyché.
Et les enfants de chœur ont la fièvre, les pauvres

Il paraît qu'à loisir elle se mire nue,
De face, de profil, et même, hélas! de dos,
Après avoir, sans gêne, accroché sa tenue
Aux branches de la croix comme au portemanteau.
Chez les enfants de chœur le malin s'insinue

Il paraît que, levant au ciel un œil complice,
Elle dit ""Bravo, Seigneur, c'est du joli travail!""
Puis qu'elle ajoute avec encore plus de malice
""La cambrure des reins, ça, c'est une trouvaille!""
Et les enfants de chœur souffrent un vrai supplice

Il paraît qu'à minuit, bonne mère, c'est pire
On entend se mêler, dans d'étranges accords,
La voix énamouré' des anges qui soupirent
Et celle de la sœur criant "" Encore! Encore!""
Et les enfants de chœur, les malheureux, transpirent

Et monsieur le curé, que ces bruits turlupinent,
Se dit avec raison que le brave Jésus
Avec sa tête, hélas! déjà chargé' d'épines,
N'a certes pas besoin d'autre chose dessus.
Et les enfants de chœur, branlant du chef, opinent

Tout ça, c'est des faux bruits, des ragots, des sornettes,
De basses calomnies par Satan répandues.
Pas plus d'accroche-cœurs sous la blanche cornette
Que de queue de cheval, mais un crâne tondu.
Et les enfants de chœur en font, une binette

Pas de troubles penchants dans ce cœur rigoriste,
Sous cet austère habit pas de rubans suspects.

Le veinard sur sa croix peut s'endormir en paix,
Et les enfants de chœur se masturber, tout tristes",La Religieuse,1998

Ça vous pend au nez tôt ou tard

Quand se drapant dans un linceul
Ses parents le laissent tout seul
Le petit orphelin, ma foi
Est bien à plaindre toutefois

Sans aller jusqu'à décréter
Qu'il devient un enfant gâté
Disons que dans son affliction
Il trouve des compensations

D'abord au dessert aussitôt
La meilleure part du gâteau
Et puis plus d'école pardi
La semaine aux quatre-jeudis

On le traite comme un pacha
A sa place on fouette le chat
Et le trouvant très chic en deuil
Les filles lui font des clins d'œil

Il serait par trop saugrenu
D'énumérer par le menu
Les faveurs et les passe-droits
Qu'en l'occurrence on lui octroie

Tirant même un tel bénéfice
En perdant leurs parents, des fils
Dénaturés regrettent de
N'en avoir à perdre que deux

Hier j'ai dit à un animal
De flic qui me voulait du mal
Je suis orphelin, savez-vous?
Il me répondit Je m'en fous

J'aurais eu quarante ans de moins
Je suis sûr que par les témoins
La brute aurait été mouchée
Mais ces lâches n'ont pas bougé

Aussi mon enfant si tu dois
Être orphelin, dépêche-toi
Tant qu'à perdre tes chers parents
Petit, n'attends pas d'être grand

L'orphelin d'âge canonique
Personne ne le plaint bernique
Et pour tout le monde il demeure
Orphelin de la onzième heure

Celui qui a fait cette chanson
A voulu dire à sa façon
Que la perte des vieux est par fois
Perte sèche, blague à part

Avec l'âge c'est bien normal
Les plaies du cœur guérissent mal
Souventes fois même, salut
Elles ne se referment plus

",L' Orphelin,1998

En route pour la vie de château
En route pour la vie de château
La belle vie dorée sur tranche
Il te l'offrit sur un plateau

Il a mis les mains sur tes hanches

Tous les camées, tous les émaux
Tous les camées, tous les émaux
Il les fit pendre à tes rameaux
Il les fit pendre à tes rameaux
Il fit rouler en avalanches
Perle et rubis dans tes sabots

Il a mis de l'or à ta branche
Il a mis les mains sur tes hanches

Tire la belle, tire le rideau
Tire la belle, tire le rideau

Il n'y avait jamais de printemps

A travers la pluie noire des champs

Sa belle petite queue sauvage

Les bonheurs d'ici-bas m'étaient tous défendus
Je semais des violettes et chantais pour des prunes
Et tendais la patte aux chats perdus

Ah ah, ah ah, putain de toi
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah pauvre de moi

Un soir de pluie voilà qu'on gratte à ma porte
Je m'empresse d'ouvrir, sans doute un nouveau chat
Nom de dieu le beau félin que l'orage m'apporte
C'était toi, c'était toi, c'était toi

Les yeux fendus et couleur pistache
T'as posé sur mon cœur ta patte de velours
Fort heureusement pour moi t'avais pas de moustache
Et ta vertu ne pesait pas trop lourd

Au quatre coins de ma vie de bohème
T'as promené, t'as promené le feu de tes vingt ans
Et pour moi, pour mes chats, pour mes fleurs, mes poèmes
C'était toi la pluie et le beau temps

Mais le temps passe et fauche à l'aveuglette
Notre amour mûrissait à peine que déjà
Tu brûlais mes chansons, crachais sur mes violettes
Et faisais des misaires à mes chats

Le comble enfin, misérable salope
Comme il ne restait plus rien dans le garde-manger
T'as couru sans vergogne, et pour une escalope
Te jeter dans le lit du boucher

C'était fini, t'avais passé les bornes
Et, renonçant aux amours frivoles d'ici-bas
Je suis remonté dans la lune en emportant mes cornes
Mes chansons, et mes fleurs, et mes chats

Nous allions à l'école de danse
À la barre de chêne se pliaient les roseaux
De nos corps amoureux de cadences
La danse est une cage où l'on apprend l'oiseau
Nous allions à l'école de danse

Face à la grande glace, petits canards patauds
Nous vivions pour le bonheur insigne
De voir nos blancs tutus reflétés par les eaux
Du lac noir où meurt la "" Mort du Cygne ""
La danse est une étoile, qu'elle est loin, qu'elle est haut
Sur les pointes on lui faisait des signes

Dans un coin du studio, le piano convolait
Hardiment vers des prouesses russes
Et le plancher des vaches de son mieux décollait
Sous nos pieds ivres de sauts de puces
La danse est une bête, la sueur est son lait
Le désir, sa coutume et ses us

Alors, chacun les bras en chœur, corps à couteaux tirés,
Se tendait vers la ligne suprême,
Vers les extrémités d'un ciel, d'un soleil délivré
De la nuit et de ses théorèmes
La danse est un espace où les ronds sont carrés
Où le temps, ô miracle, nous aime...

Sur des rythmes d'Astaire, des tambours brésiliens
Elle danse, la Danse, elle danse
Pas par pas, bond par bond, elle brise les liens
De nos poids épris de transcendance
Paysanne est la danse, le cosmos est son grain
En sabots de satin, le balance !

Testimony in trials that never got heard

My lovers teeth are white geese flying above me
My lovers muscles are rope ladders under my hands

We were driving home slow
My lover and I, across the long Bay Bridge,
One February midnight, when midway
Over in the far left lane, I saw a strange scene:

One small young man standing by the rail,
And in the lane itself, parked straight across
As if it could stop anything, a large young
Man upon a stalled motorcycle, perfectly

Relaxed as if he'd stopped at a hamburger stand;
He was wearing a peacoat and levis, and
He had his head back, roaring, you
Could almost hear the laugh, it

Was so real.
""Look at that fool,"" I said, ""in the
Middle of the bridge like that,"" a very
Womanly remark.

Then we heard the meaning of the noise
Of metal on a concrete bridge at 50
Miles an hour, and the far left lane
Filled up with a big car that had a

Motorcycle jammed on its front bumper, like
The whole thing would explode; the friction
Sparks shot up bright orange for many feet
Into the air, and the racket still sets
My teeth on edge.

When the car stopped we stopped parallel
And Wendy headed for the callbox while I
Ducked across those 6 lanes like a mouse
In the bowling alley. ""Are you hurt?"" I said,

The middle-aged driver had the greyest black face,
""I couldn't stop, I couldn't stop, what happened?""

Then I remembered. ""Somebody, "" I said, ""was on
The motorcycle."" I ran back,
One block? two blocks? The space for walking
On the bridge is maybe 18 inches, whoever

Engineered this arrogance. in the dark
Stiff wind it seemed I would
Be pushed over the rail, would fall down
Screaming onto the hard surface of

The bay, but I did not, I found the tall young man
Who thought he owned the bridge, now lying on
His stomach, head cradled in his broken arm.

He had glasses on, but somewhere he had lost
Most of his levis, where were they?
And his shoes. Two short cuts on his buttocks,
That was the only mark except his thin white
Seminal tubes were all strung out behind; no
Child left in him; and he looked asleep.

I plucked wildly at his wrist, then put it
Down; there were two long haired women
Holding back the traffic just behind me
With their bare hand, the machines came
Down like mad bulls, I was scared, much

More than usual, I felt easily squished
Like the earthworms crawling on a busy
Sidewalk after the rain; I wanted to
Leave. And met the driver, walking back.

""The guy is dead."" I gripped his hand,
The wind was going to blow us off the bridge.

""Oh my God"" he said, ""haven't I had enough
Trouble in my life?"" He raised his head,
And for a second was enraged and yelling,
At the top of the bridge ""I was just driving

Home!"" His head fell down. ""My God, and
Now I've killed somebody.""

I looked down at my own peacoat and levis,
Then over at the dead man's friend, who
Was bawling and blubbering, what they would
Call hysteria in a woman. ""It isn't possible""

He wailed, but it was possible, it was
Indeed, accomplished and unfeeling, snoring
In its peacoat, and without its levis on.

He died laughing: that's a fact.

I had a woman waiting for me,
In her car and in the middle of the bridge,
I'm frightened, I said.
I'm afraid, he said, stay with me,

Please don't go, stay with me, be
My witness ""No,"" I said, ""I'll be your
Witness later,"" and I took his name
And number, ""but I can't stay with you,

I'm too frightened of the bridge, besides
I have a woman waiting
And no license
And no tail lights ""

So I left
As I have left so many of my lovers.

We drove home
Shaking, Wendy's face greyer
Than any white person's I have ever seen.
Maybe he beat his wife, maybe he once

Drove taxi, and raped a lover
Of mine how to know these things?
We do each other in, that's a fact.

Who will be my witness?
Death wastes our time with drunkenness
And depression
Death, who keeps us from our

Lovers.
He had a woman waiting for him,
I found when I called the number
Days later

""Where is he"" she said, ""he's disappeared/""
""He'll be all right"" I said, ""we could
Have hit the guy as easy as anybody, it
Wasn't anybody's fault, they'll know that,""

Women so often say dumb things like that,
They teach us to be sweet and reassuring,
And say ignorant things, because we don't invent
The crime, the punishment, the bridges

That same week I looked into the mirror
And nobody was there to testify;
How clear, and unemployed queer woman
Makes no witness at all,
Nobody at all was there for
Those two questions: what does
She do, and who is she married to?

I am the woman who stopped on the bridge
And this is the man who was there
Our lovers teeth are white geese flying
Above us, but we ourselves are
Easily squished.

Keep the women small and weak
And off the street, and off the
Bridges, that's the way, brother
One day I will leave you there,
As I have left you there before,
Working for death.

We found out later
What we left him to.
Six big policemen answered the call,
All white, and no child in them.
They put the driver up against his car
And beat the hell out of him.
What did you kill that poor kid for?
You mutherfucking nigger.
That's a fact.

Death only uses violence
When there is any kind of resistance,
The rest of the time a slow
Weardown will do.

They took him to 4 different hospitals
Til they got a drunk test report to fit their
Case, and held him five days in jail
Without a phone call.
How many lovers have we left.

There are as many contradictions to the game,
As there are players.
A woman is talking to death,
Though talk is cheap, and like takes a long time
To make
Right. He got a cheesy lawyer
Who had him cop a plea, 15 to 20
Instead of life
Did I say life?

The arrogant young man who thought he
Owned the bridge, and fell asleep on it
He died laughing: that's a fact.
The driver sits out his time
Off the street somewhere,
Does he have the most vacant of
Eyes, will he die laughing?


A table they made and on it was laid a baby we gave and I'm so dry mud cracked I maybe we deny where these walls won't let go of my eyes we made a circle of smoke on a train please same me from saying it was easy we were driving across the bridge so slow he lost his child in the snow",Balance,2002

I don't need a job and I don't need no friends
People bore me to the end I wish that I were dead
All this stench that fills the air reminds me of the dump
And when I turn on my tv, the fuckin' Brady Bunch

In San Jose there's too many dicks, it's a bore, a bore

For a sign, a light in the sky,
Oh the message is clear, that the time is near,
For a leader to come again;

A circle of stones on the head of a hill,
Tonight is where it will be,
In this desolate place, we all stand and wait,
For a leader to come again, yes a leader will come again;

I suppose its because its so big and expansive,
When a long stranded cloud sits just above the horizon,
Leaving a strip of clear blue beneath it,
It becomes the panorama,

And the same line follows you round,
If the land is sufficiently flat,
Really nothing can be compared to it

Right out of vision, right out of hope
You work me up, just tear me down

What are we doing here if romance isn't dead
Mind your mouth as you walk with me
Take care oh ho, as you cross the street

That's enough, I've had it up to here
I've lost my vision, I've lost my hope
You set me up, just hand me down
You've lost your conscience 'cos nothing happens in my town

I'll do graffiti if you sing to me in French

Stay in line on the foreign trip

Like little pills cloud water
Dissolving inch by inch
Separating a fraction further

You helped to shape this space
We'd gaze at dancers
The view it fluctuates

Flattened bodies blown on the floor
Within a rectangle of cool green lines
We watched them in the wall
We breath beside each other

The stars, our landmarks
And we don't use them
The stars, our landmarks
You can't swing from them

I wish this was an endurance test
But there are no limits
I sent a letter to my own address
While you lived in it

You used to drink from that glass
Decorated in Scandinavia
You nearly ironed me out
And now I've changed my behavior

This morning I saw a blue metal star
I was on tiptoes high above the back yard
Competing with the real thing
It ends up dominating

The stars, our landmarks
And we don't use them
The stars, our landmarks
You can't swing from them

Everyone's got their own idea
Of Utopia and why we're here

Maxine Sullivan,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

I never wink back at fireflies

A lotta kisses at the bottom

Maxine Sullivan,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

That we were really through,
I said I didn't love her,
That we'd begin anew
And you can all believe me,
We sure intended to,
But we just couldn't say goodbye.

The chair and then the sofa,
They broke right down and cried,
The curtains started wavin'
For me to come inside.
I tell you confidentially,
The tears were hard to hide,
And we just couldn't say goodbye.

The clock was striking twelve o'clock
It smiled on us below,
With folded hands it seemed to say,
""We'll miss you if you go.""

So I went back and kissed her,
And when I looked around,
The room was singin' love songs,
And dancing up and down.
And now we're both so happy,
Because at last we've found.
That we just couldn't say goodbye.",We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye,1995

That you could ever care for me

That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

So carefree together

Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

Lately I've not slept a wink

Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again
Beguiled again
A simpering whimpering child again
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him

I've done pretty well I think
