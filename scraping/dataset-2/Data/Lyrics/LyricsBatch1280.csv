Wolfsheim,"here i am 
darkness night 
is masking the cold 
that embraces me 

can't you see 
truth means fear 
your lying breath 
never will resist 

alone i sit here waiting 
watching the world 
in it's agony 

because i have seen 
my future 
my crying face 
no cure i'm longing for 

and no healer 
heals the evil 
i sought truth for you 
condemned to fail 

for you, for you 
i'm bleeding 
and every new dawn 
ends in bitterness ...",For You I'm Bleeding,1993
Wolfsheim,"Alone ... but you're feeling allright
It's a lie, you're feeling good because 

Strange men want you to
Easy way to run away from yourself
It's a lie, no-one gets out of here alive

And everyone feels happy
Everyone feels great
Today ... walking through these gates
Wake up my dear ... it's killing day

Betrayed and kissed goodbye
Live your life, don't think about the reasons for it all
Following the line that never ends
The moon is looking down at fool's who always fail

And everyone feels happy...",Gates,1993
Wolfsheim,"Fear that threatens you inside you can run but you can't hide things you've never seen before and More ... and more ... and more ...

Strange ideas you have been taught
And false prophets got you caught
No way out ... this cage is made of thoughts
Get more and more

Work your fingers to the bone
For all the useless things you own
Happiness can not be bought
But you want more and more

You can't control your hunger
Deep down within
You can't solve the mystery
Of right and sin

No apparent difference
Will make it clear
Not the slightest trace of hope
Relieves your fear

Envy and prosperity
Wrapped in concrete
Draw the bitter consequence
Entire defeat

Trapped in neon wilderness
Oh, wasted land
Fat and ugly humanoids
Can't find no vent",Kaufraush,1993
Wolfsheim,"Wait my dear no jealousies
Silly thing you can't know how I feel

Come take my hand I will show you the flame
Burning secrets, burning wishes your name

Don't be insecure, don't be afraid I'll hold you tight
Oh, virgin weakness, infinite sweetness that's you so let's dance
All alone

I want to kiss you, want to feel you deep
Your silly skin, a tender touch,
A sign that promises so much
I want to kiss you, want to feel you deep
And so we dance

Nothing ever spoils my joy of loving you,
Of looking in your eyes I couldn't be that blind
That I won't crave for you
And still we dance all alone

I want to kiss you",Lovesong,1993
Wolfsheim,"Clumsy, always quivering
Always searching for your things
You don't work, but you cannot find a rest
Cause you gave up too soon

Old man sitting in your trap
Two lovers passing by
Don't be ashamed, don't be upset,
Enjoy it, dear, 'cause once you did the same

It's not too late, to charm away your ancient fears
It's not too late, to be wild for roundabouts, to be
Wild for life

Old man lying in your bed
Your friends are passing by
It's just a rule, kissing you goodbye,
Enjoy it, dear, cause once you did the same

I came across a few old things
Remembering the past
""Spare the rod and spoil the child 
There's no fool like an old fool!""

It's not too late, to start again
It's not too late, to charm away your ancient fears
It's not too late, to be wild for roundabouts, to be
Wild for life",It's Not Too Late (Don't Sorrow),1995
Wolfsheim,"You painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating
Going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun ist going down

Oh ruby, donÂ´t take your love to town

It wasn't me who started
That old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go
And do my patriotic chore
And... yes itÂ´s true, that IÂ´m not the man I used to be

Oh ruby, I still need some company

ItÂ´s hard to love a man whose legs
Are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs
Of a woman your age ... ruby I realize

But it wonÂ´t be long
I've heard them say until IÂ´m not around
 
Oh ruby, donÂ´t take your love to town

SheÂ´s leaving now
Â´Cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move IÂ´d get my gun and put her in the ground

Oh ruby, donÂ´t take your love to town
Oh ruby, for godÂ´s sake... turn around","Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town",1995
Wolfsheim,"here's to you ... my friend ...
here's a kind of love for you ...
can you see my eyes ... my view turns away
dancing shades on my face ... that's where stars cannot shine
silence ... is coming soon today ...
you think you're right
but it works inside
it's started long ago
you're bored by your ruined life
but you think it must be so ...
why can't you see ... these staring sick eyes everywhere
it's a sin ... that's a fact you can't deny ...
blow away these walls ...
your life a train just passing by ...
these always watching eyes ...
this killing voice ...
always talks to me ...
always spinning around
silence ... is coming soon today ...",Where Greed Talks,1995
Wolfsheim,"She once was seventeen but she never fall in love
Because she never felt the same
Like the other ones at school
Like all the other boys and girls around

Misery, talk to me
Youth and greed, walk with me

Now she's thirty three but there isn't anything
The really changed in her life
Not a moment not a while
She is married, bore a child
Growing old, growing older all the time
And she cries

A whining sound slips from her mouth
Trapped in here and no way out

Wait a while, wait a while
Mommy's pills will bring you to the other side

Wait a while, wait a while
Daddy's razorblades will make you feel so fine",Youth and Greed,1995
Wolfsheim,"walking down the streets at night 
i see her stumbling through the rain 
a skinny figure in the dark 
her face a shade of grey 

begging here and barking there 
she´s swearing all the time 
her fingers fumbling with her hair 
a dirty mess of grime 

and she starts to cry and she´s asking why 
her life´s always the same 
but she does not see, that unfortunately 
there´s no one here to blame 

""heroin"" she said, ""was the best i had... 
no more mountains left to climb. 
the world so slow... all my dreams just too high 
to be fulfilled in time...!"" 

she grabs my arm... and i feel alarmed 
her fingers gripping tight 
i see her pleading eyes... so i start to diguise 
and say, that everything´s alright... 

and the reason why i pretended and lied 
is that i don´t want to kill 
the poor dream that´s left in the deepest cleft 
of the thing that she calls will...! 

""heroin"" she said...","Heroin, She Said",1998
Wolfsheim,"Love, love is strange
Lot of people take it for a game

Once you get it
YouÂ´re in an awful fix
After you've had it
You never want to quit

Many people
They donÂ´t understand, no, no
They think loving
Is money in the hand

Your sweet loving
Is better than a kiss
When you leave me
Sweet kisses I miss",Love Is Strange,1998
Wolfsheim,"ItÂ´s getting dark... too soon... a threatening silence...
Surrounding me... a wind comes up from the islands...
Distance fades to stormy grey
Washed out from the deep of the ocean
Here I will stand to face your wrath...
While all the others are praying

Calm down my heart... donÂ´t beat so fast...
DonÂ´t be afraid just once in a lifetime
No rain can wash away my tears
No wind can soothe my pain

You made me doubt, you made me fear
But now IÂ´m not the same
You took my wife, my unborn son...
Torn into the deep of the ocean

I donÂ´t pretend that I love you
'Cause there is nothing left to loose

And when silence comes back to me
I find myself feeling lonely
Standing here on the shores of destiny
I find myself feeling lonely

I had a life to give... many dreams to live...
DonÂ´t you know that youÂ´re losing so much this time
Beyond the waves... I will be free
While all the others are praying

Calm down my heart...

The love in you, it does not burn,
There is no lesson you can learn
And there are sounds you cannot hear,
And there are feelings you canÂ´t feel

Calm down my heart... donÂ´t beat so fast...
DonÂ´t be afraid just once in a lifetime

I donÂ´t pretend that I love you
And this time IÂ´m not scared of you",Once in a Lifetime,1998
Wolfsheim,"Ich komm´ zu dir
Halt´ deine hand
Wir gehen gemeinsam durch
Dies wunderbare land
Das ich für dich erfand
Mit mathematischem verstand

Ein wunder hier
Ein traum gleich dort
Grad´ noch hier und doch schon fort
Ich zeige dir mein angesicht
Doch du siehst mich nicht

Ich weiß genau was dir gefällt
Ich schaff dir eine neue zauberwelt
In der kein regen fällt
In der nur deine wahrheit zählt

Ich zeig dir berge
Zeig dir seen
Hier brauchst du alles nur
Mit meinen augen sehen
Und nicht zu verstehen
Keine angst du kannst ruhig mit mir gehen

In ein großes all
Ganz für dich allein
Hier kannst du endlich mal du selber sein
Im neon-sonnenschein
Fang ich dir deine wünsche ein",Künstliche Welten,1999
Wolfsheim,"I think of you like I often do
When I hear the rain on my windowpane
Gently tapping at the glass 
Like your gently touching fingers
Just looking for the smile I give to you

[Chorus]
You can feel what no one feels
You can hear what no one hears
Just looking for the smile I give to you
You can feel what no one feels
You can hear what no one wants to hear
Just looking for the smile I give to you

Your darkness speaks and has eyes to see
and you know me by my voice 
But you know so much more than
""Don't fight the walls they're here for all""
Is what you said to me once
I looked into your eyes and I knew you were right

[Chorus]

And your darkness speaks and has eyes to see
I know you can win this life long game we're in 
""Hey darkness is a state of mind 
I can go where you would stumble""
Is what you said to me and I knew you we right",Blind,1999
Wolfsheim,"Don't understand you saying
""Our seas were always rough!""
We had to make it up someway
But years were not enough

I will not praise the times we had
And won't deny that I feel sad
The silence speaks for you and me
While we're dancing

I don't love you anymore
And we're dancing
You're not the one I'm falling for
But we are dancing

I will not praise the times we had
Look at what we have today
I can't live without you!
That's not what I want to say
But it seems so true

I will not praise the times we had

So many good times that we had
I can't help myself, I feel so sad
I wish that you would speak to me
While we're dancing
I don't love you anymore",I Don't Love You Anymore,1999
Wolfsheim,"seven hundred times 
thought of you 
a voice of innocence 
i hear it calling
i know it´s you

now i realize 
that it´s just hurting 
for the first time 
i feel it aching 
i know it´s you

seven hundred lies 
seven hundred ways

that i am longing

for sure...
i´m drawing your lines with my hands
i´m weaving the dream that never ends
i don´t play hide and seek... with you... dear
when i touch you...

You've left for me
I can't believe, you've gone so far
I can't believe

You could ask",Read the Lines,1999
Wolfsheim,"it started with a feeling 
a special kind of feeling 
we´ve lost somehow

idle thoughts are reeling 
i´m longing for your touch 
but you don´t understand 
that it means so much

you leave it up to me 
to sleep some 
how the anger that i feel 
must leave somehow

i hear you breathe... i´m waiting 
for the morning light 
i miss you... although i´m lying 
right by your side

you leave it up to me...

i don´t know why... our time went by 
there´s nothing left to feel 
except this boring kind of anger 
that´s wasting me

stay...

I know you're wrong but
I can't change a single thing
It's like it's meant to be!
 
Inside I feared to find itâ?¦
That cannot stand the fact
I'm not in love with you!
And I 
I've got the feeling
That I've really had enough
It had to end right here!
 
There is nothing left to lose
Despite the time we've spent 
Nothing left for you

Still had the feeling
I won't find in you what I still sought

weÂ´ll discover what will make us free

Wolfsheim,"And when winter comes around
You'll need your winter shoes.
But if winter's still about
To get too cold for you,
You'll need someone to keep you warm
Someone to help you through the storm
Someone who's good
Doing no harm
And he'll say

I care for you, I'm there  
I'm there for you, I care

And when the time is right
You'll wear your wedding shoes.
And if this life still seems to be
Not quite enough for you,

Wolfsheim,"Everyone who casts a shadow seem to stand in the sun 
And when your step leaves a track you seem to be going on 

I know myself... I know my shades...  but I donÂ´t see no light 
And if there's a track, it means no turning back
No matter what you try 

Everyone who feels his heartbeat seems to be still alive 
And by a look into your eyes I seem to know if you're lying 

But from time to time there is more to life than just a muscle working deep inside 
And to find the truth it needs much more than just a look into an eye",Everyone Who Casts a Shadow,2003
Wolfsheim,"When I wake up I find you're gone 
There should be grief but I feel none

I find you're gone 
I find you're gone  

You know it's wrong, you know the way 
But do you really want to stay? 
A sudden thought, a thing to mind  
It would be only wasting time 
No matter how hard you will try

Just 'cause you said you're mine.

I won't believe you could be far away
But staying on my mind.
I've to believe at last, there won't be
Anything that's left behind, my friend

The signs, but not their sense
And laid your trust in me I won't believeâ?¦

Wolverine,"""Oh what a ride... I can't believe it...
Felt so free... inside...
A new beginning? Dare I believe it?
My friends advise me to step inside...""

She's trapped inside a carousel
That will spin her 'round and force her right towards the end
She's in for the ride of her lifetime
Sadly nothing could ever make her turn while there's still time

(Headed for the sky, never asking why)
Never looking back she just craves for more and more
(Finding peace of mind with those of her kind)
Dancing with the souls that she thought she would never find

""Why should I care to look into the rear view mirror
When all that view has to offer me is misery?
I've come so far, I've feel so free
I've been offered a sip of life without the bitter taste of pain""

""My reality is flying through the air of my dreams
Dreams where I am the alpha and the omega""

""Stepped into a carousel
To lift me up and bring me closer to the stars
I'm in for the ride of my lifetime
Nothing could ever force me back to the ground""

""(Headed for the sky, giving up past life)
I'm never going back to the hell I called my life
(Finding peace of mind with those of her kind)
'Cause now I'm dancing with the friends that I though I would never find""

""Let me go now, let me leave your life
Let me feel free, let me see with own eyes
I will never be the one you'll love
You will never be the ones I'll depend upon""",Carousel,2004

Though a long time ago, the memories are all so vivid

The girl they all knew is fading away
She's turning black inside
Victim of indifference and betrayal
A mere shadow of her past
Crawling beneath the feet of our world

Inside her scream the echoes of them laughing
She's got nowhere to run or hide
Look at her porcelain eyes, they're breaking
Oh, she is breaking!
Right here, beneath the feet of our ignorance

""Scream for us, bleed for us
Make your way into yourself""
""Crawl away, hide away
Turn around and see us laugh""

And pound our words right through your skull)
""Pour your life into wide open hands,
And see it soak into the ground""

And watch it die before our eyes)

There's no need to be afraid the enemy has been slain today""

All I see's a grave digger

How wondrous the sight that had caused these eyes to weep
All of my death and hell You would bear and reap
Though all that I made was a terrible cold grave
In death there You laid, for You took my place to save my soul
To save my soul
To save my soul
To save my soul",Grave Digger,2016
Wolves at the Gate,"As I drift on the water, a voice calling to me had said
""Sail in to the harbor, cast down your nets and follow Me""
First of all the chosen, I saw the raising of the dead
It must be my devotion, for I stood alone upon that sea

So I walked on the tempest, I saw the waves below my feet
It's clear I was the bravest, to meet the stranger on the deep

I am the rock on which to build this land
Got the keys to the kingdom, I'm at His right hand
I was the first among the chosen, the boldest in devotion
Walking out upon the ocean, what else could I need?

I'm well-versed in forgiveness, as many as seven times repeat
In service was I fearless; attack my king, my blade you'd reap

What else could I need?
What else could I need?

Haunting my reflection, a bitter thought comes to my mind
I made known my objection, about how You had come to die

You said my thoughts were of the devil's kind
I was opposed to Your kingdom, and I should get behind
But You were talking like You're cursed, already laying in Your deathbed
Maybe somehow You were mislead, may it never be!

You said I would fall away, before the rooster's crow would end
To my shame did I betray, deny You as my closest friend

I'm singing, heart is hardened
I'm sleeping in the garden
I'm swinging swords I'm guarding my kindgom and my stardom

Am I different than Judas? For I betrayed the kindest friend
I'm all out of excuses, with nothing to make my amends

O Love! O Love! O Love!
You bottomless abyss!
O Love! O Love! O Love!
You bottomless abyss!

How tender You had spoken, though I betrayed the kindest friend
Faithful in devotion, such love I cannot comprehend

Oh when You found me I was broken
From the words that I had spoken
But You were faithful in devotion
You remembered me!
You remembered me!",Hindsight,2016
Wolves at the Gate,"Prisoned am I to this shell of the dust
It speaks of only fiction that I could never trust
Captured alive in this sinful estate
Vexed am I to see I do the things that I hate
Rip out the framework leave no stone unturned
Until my heart forgets all that my flesh ever learned
Tear down the structure till nothing is left
God deliver me from this body of death

O wretched man, wretched man that I am
Lowly man, who can save such a wretch that I am?
Who can save such a man?
O wretched man, wretched man that I am
Lowly man, who can save such a wretch that I am?
Who can save such a man?

In light of this truth: ""There is no good in me""
It causes all my soul to long for liberty
Be freed from my lies of death, spared from the shame
No more this sinner's breath forsaking your name

I will be free
I will be free

Tapping along in the dark before the dawn
Nothing is wrong, you're here
Abandon the sound of the captain's call
Grabbing my gear as I jump the wall before, before nightfall is here

I've crossed the line of the great divide
I heard your orders
I sneak past land mines
Watch them with each stride
I know the borders

Stumbled upon to the battleground
Search and look for the fight but a white flag's all I found
It's all I've found out here

I know, I know you said you've overcome
I think it's time I joined the fight

Lay down your arms young one
I realize it's hard to see the war is won my son
You must see the war is won over and done

Caught in the snare of the rival's jaws
Digging in deep as it rears it's vicious claws
I guess my fight is here

What have I done? I'm trapped and all alone
I'm bleeding out and fading quick

Footsteps draw near (Could this be it?)
Is my death now here (Could this be it?)
Who's this that's come for me in this dying and desperate state?

Lay down your arms young one
I realize it's hard to see the war is won my son
You must see the war is won over and done
Over and done
Done

Rough hands are placed upon me
I'm far too weak to fight and break myself free

I was chasing apparitions
What's wrong with my volition?

Just as my body floated
I dread and fear what is this stranger's motives?
What have I done?

I opened up my eyes to see the stranger bore a dear old face
And water filled my eyes, it was my captain that I had disgracedi
I turned to look away in shame

I've had enough of living
I've had enough of dying
I've had enough of smiling
I've had enough of crying
I've taken all the high roads
I've squandered and I've saved
I've had enough of childhood
I've had enough of graves

Get a job and fight to keep it
Strike out to reach a mountain
Be so nice on the outside
But inside keep ambition

Don't cry because you hunt them
Hurt them first they'll love you
There's a millionaire above you
And you're under his suspicion

I've had enough of dancehalls
I've had enough of pills
I've had enough of streetfights
I've seen my share of kills
I'm finished with the fashions
And acting like I'm tough
I'm bored with hate and passion
I've had enough of trying to love",Had Enough,2004

Women Who Drum,"Old red wine, well past its prime,
May have to finish it, after crossing the line.
Dusty old wine, two thousand a time,
An inch of black mud always left behind.
They say you turned in while the sun still shined,
That gorgeous girl with you was highly primed.
She said she'd take you way down or way up,
She might break your heart, she might crack you up.
Old red wine, not worth a dime,
Gonna have to drink it with you some other time.
Expensive old wine, forty years lying,
Mice chewed the labels, don't know what we're buying.
Back home in California, they got wine for the meek,
There's a Bowl and a Fillmore, the Cow and the Greek.
You sniffed at the cork, chose low on the list,
As you dashed to the lights and gazed through the mist.
Old red wine, well past its prime,
Gonna have to drink it with you some other time.
Just let it breathe,
Oh, let it breathe,
Breathe life, breathe life.
Let it breathe,
Oh, let it breathe,
Let it breathe.",Old Red Wine,2004

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall

Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He's a pin ball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
S'got such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?'

He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
'N' never tilts at all

Sure plays a mean pin ball.

I thought I was
The Bally table king.
But I just handed
My pin ball crown to him.

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall

Sure plays a mean pin ball!!!",Pinball Wizard (Original Album Version),2004

first time in my childhood

Fly so high?'

Women's Chorus of Dallas,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1999
Women's Chorus of Dallas,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,1999

It's a long long time ago
It was a strange story
A girl loved a boy
But here you have to know
When a witch loves
She looses her magic
One cold evenig at home
The boy found her broom
And lies flew away
And then she looked at him
And was filled with magic
She said to him
Whilst regaining her magic

This is witchcraft babe and it is everywhere
In the wood, in the sea and the moon's got it, yeah
This is witchcraft babe and it is everywhere
Shimmering and glimmering is what I am

And Miss Elliot with that
Really ugly Tweed Jumper
And those striking red shoes
They're a witness of times long ago
Close your eyes and see
That she's beautiful
But it's not the way you thought
Take care of the secrets
Old witches told

I'm not doubtful about you
I tie knots in my shoe laces
Let me sleep in your arms
We're at home where we're loved

This is witchcraft babe and it is everywhere
In the wood, in the sea and the moon's got it, yeah
This is witchcraft babe and it is everywhere

If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot

For your love is better than any love other I've know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood

I got superstitious about you, but I can't take change
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood

It's no secret, but that woman fills my loving cup
She sees, so ready, that I get enough
And her love is better than any other love I've known

Wood,"[Chorus:]
Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

Gripping on grain, while the fifteen's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
'Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to seventy one, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the hardest pit of the litter
Down south, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

Him standing by my bed, 
""They framed you on a murder charge,""

Says Joe, ""But I ain't dead."" 

And standing there as big as life
And smiling with his eyes.
Says Joe ""What they can never kill
Went on to organize,
Went on to organize""

In every mine and mill,
Where working men defend their rights,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill,

Wood,"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,1996

Woodford & Company,"You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
And babe you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to

Well you could of been

You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
