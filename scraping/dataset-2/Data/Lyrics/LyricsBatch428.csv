Jermaine Jackson,"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Silently for me.",Homeward Bound,1972
Jermaine Jackson,"In this world of ups and downs my dreams all fall through
Things just don't work out, no matter what I do
Disappointment haunts me, through each lonely day
The world around I see, in only shades of gray

But when the love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world I never knew, I'm in a different world
A world so sweet and true, I'm in a different world

I'm no longer just another face in a crowd
Hey, look into my eyes, you'll see I'm strong and I'm proud
You are all the sweetness of my life, you see
You have brought heaven right here on earth to me
No man of wealth, I know I'll ever be
But I'll be satisfied just knowing you love me

On the stage of life I've played a loser's part
It seems like I've been down right from the very start
Every time I lift myself up off the ground
Something always happens to bring the curtain down

But when your love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world so warm and sweet, I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me, I'm in a different world

Each time you speak my name or put your hand in mine
The empty life I knew, I leave it far behind
'Cause you gave me the love that I truly felt
Most of all you made me believe in myself
You're more than a love to me, you're my way of life
I'll forever cherish you, more each day and night

Oh,
I'm in a different world

A world that's warm, a world that's sweet
A world that's every bit complete
A world that's real, you've made me see
All the beauty surrounding me
Oh, look what you've done for me
Oh, look what you've done for me
I'm in a different world, now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world, and that's where I want to be
I'm in a different world, now that you've been loving me...",I'm in a Different World,1972
Jermaine Jackson,"If I were your woman and you were my man,
you'd have no other woman, you'd be weak as a lamb.
If you had the strength to walk out that door,
My love would over rule my sense, and I'd call you back for more,
If I were your woman.
If I were your woman, and you were my man. Um baby.
 
She tears you down darlin', says you're nothing at all.
But, I'll pick you up darling, when she lets you fall.
You're like a diamond but she treats you like glass.
Yet you beg her to love you, but, me you don't ask.
If I were your woman, If I were your woman.
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do,
I'd never, no, no, stop loving you.
Yeah, yeah, um
 
Life is so crazy, a love is unkind.
Because she came first, darling, will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me, and you don't even know it.
I'm what you need, but I'm too afraid to show it.
If I were your woman, If I were your woman, 
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do.
Never, no, no, no, stop loving you, ah, yeah.
If I were your woman, here's what I'd do.
Never, never stop loving you if
 

",If You Were My Woman,1972
Jermaine Jackson,"You're the sun that shines when clouds are in the way
You're the light of love to brighten up each and every day
And you care oh when no one cares at all
You are there when I need you
All I have to do is call and

I need you more, more now than ever
I need you more, as the days go by
I need you more, more now than ever
Oh without your love I couldn't live
I wouldn't even try

You're the birds that sing
You bring love song to me
You're the sweetest rose that will ever ever be
And you you make the world seem right
When everything is all wrong
And when I'm weak only you can make me strong
That's why

I need you more, more now than ever
I need you more, as the days go by
I need you more, more now than ever
Without your love I couldn't live
I wouldn't even try

Those softly whispered nicknames that only you would know
I'll never hear again
If you you should ever go

I need you more, more now than ever
I need you more, as the days go by
I need you more, more now than ever
Without your love I couldn't live
I wouldn't even try

Whoa oh oh I need you I need you I need you
More now than ever
Whoa oh oh
I need you, I need you, I need you
More now than ever
Whoa oh oh
I need you I need you I need you
More now, than ever",I Need You More Now Than Ever,1973
Jermaine Jackson,"A million to one
That's what our folks think
about this love of ours
A million to one
They say that our love will fade like yesterdays clouds
They're betting everything that our love won't survive
They're hoping in time we'll forget each other lives
A million to one
They say were to young to know the meaning of love
A million to one
That they've forgotten the dreams that were dreaming of
But we'll forgive them because we love them
after all that's said and done.
There's one in a million

Jermaine Jackson,"It never fails when I'm with you
I just freeze up inside
And you're waiting there with your arms open wide
My bashful feelin' just won't let me hide

You look as if you're surprised at me
I know its not the way its supposed to be

But did you should know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy
Did you know by now
Girl, I'm just too shy

I love to hold your hand
Tell you you're mine
But I just cant seem to make that move or to say those words
Somethin' inside me just hold me back

I want to save so much fun with you
I'm lost for words, I just can't begin

Baby, didn't you know it
Girl, I just don't show it

Jermaine Jackson,"It's been give years or more since we've sun our song
And I wonder why we took so long
Through all the pain and the tears that I cried
Our dream never died inside
While I was out there on my own
I loved you constantly
For I am my brothers keeper and my brother you're the keeper of me

Its hard being apart when you love so much
And I pray that we never lose touch
You came into my dreams and you answered my prayer
When you needed keeping I was there
And after all that we have been through
We're still one family
Yes I am my brothers keeper and my brothers your're the keeper of me
Our dream never died",I'm My Brother's Keeper,1981

Jermaine Jackson,"Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry

Jermaine Jackson,"Why don't you do what you do
When you did what you did to me
Love was so good, that it fills up all my needs
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right, go so wrong
My love, sweet love
Why don't you say what you say
When you say what you said anymore
Your eyes couldn't lie, so long goodbye, close the door
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
Tell me something I didn't do
Why did someone else put you through
Did they steal you away like a thief in the night
Love like this, must take flight
Why don't they play what they played
On the nights you danced with me
Remember the one we made love to endlessly
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong",Do What You Do,1984
Jermaine Jackson,"I don't know too much but I know love the way I've been touched
It's your love that heats me up
And there's no such thing as too much

That never stops for rest
Have I thanked you for letting me come out of you
And giving me all of your best

Have I thanked you for having our family
Without them I would'nt be here
Have I told you no matter how far I may go
All of you always are near

Oh mother you've never asked for anything

In ever soul that aches
You know it, the feeling
You want somebody
The message is loud and clear
I wonder if you can hear
This beating repeating
Inside my body
It only comes on me when I know you´re near
I hear the message calling fire fire
Love is a language that tells no lies 

I hear heartbeat
I feel love rise
I lose all control in your eyes
I hear heartbeat
I feel love rise

When it's from you
I'm a choosy lover
Cause only your love will do
Not like one who finds true love
Yet searches for more lovin'

Not me because I'm an easy take
When love's here to make like this
I'll tell you that I'm a kissin' fool
When under the magic of your kiss

But cannot believe that the best will do
I tell you I know nobody else but you
Can do for me but you

I really do
I think you feel darling
The same way too

It's you and me
I'm your sweet surrender

Jermaine Jackson,"If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking at you.
And if you could only see yourself,
You'd feel the same way too.

You could say that I am a dreamer
Who's had a dream come true.
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking at you.

If you're wondering why I'm smiling,
It's because I'm happy with you.
And the warm sensations touch my heart,
And fill me through and through.

I could hold you close forever,
And never let you go.
If you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because I just love you so.

Now my heart is an open door;
Won't you come inside for more?
You can love so sweetly now;
Take my love, take me completely now.

Oh... if you say my eyes are beautiful,
It's because they're looking for you.
And my eyes adjust the window
For my feelings to come through.

And by far, you are more beautiful
Than anything I ever knew

Jermaine Jackson,"Why do I seem to be caught up inside a dream
All my life, it's always been my shadow and me
Over my shoulder there's always a voice somewhere
Saying I never should try to set my heart free
I wish that love would come and take me in her arms
Show me what I've never known
Where I could hold someone, words like right and wrong
Just fade away like yesterday

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why, won't even let me fall in love
Oooooh everywhere I go always by my side
Won't even let me fall in love

I try and say I love you but the words won't come through
In my eyes, see all the tears and sad memories
Why can't I start out new and leave that old feeling too far behind
I guess that lonely needs company
Around each bend of road
I'm thinking that in time there will be that rainbow's end
But when I follow those self illusions
I find that it's only lonely and me again

Lonely won't leave me alone
Lonely won't leave me alone
Why, tell me why, won't even let me fall in love
Oooooh everywhere I go always by my side
Won't even let me fall in love

Lonely won't leave me alone
I wish that love would come
Lonely won't leave me alone
And take me home

My heart is full of love when you walk by my side 

Now you´re telling me that you´re leaving
I wonder if you´ll ever return to me
All I would have is the memories and photographs of you
And, a smile or two that soon will fade away
But we must hold on right this wrong
And make it like yesterday 

Precious are moments that we share
I´ll run away with you - go anywhere
Cause where I want t obe is wrapped around your heart
The world may be against the things we do 
I forget about the world when I´m with you
My heart is full of love when you walk by my side 

I´m in this world
Lost without you
I´ve never known love so true",Precious Moments,1986
Jermaine Jackson,"In the still of the night 
When the whole world is dreaming 
Shadows start to fall 
I can hear your spirit call 

And it stirs me inside 
All caught in the twilight 
Fantasies appear 
Whisper in my ear 

You are the one for me 
Come and take my hand and lead me on 
Let me kiss and hug you... Show me how to love you 
An´ if you won´t I know I´ll lose my mind 
´Cause I keep hearing 

Voices in the dark (love is calling) 
Talking to my heart... Without warning 
Images appear... Love is calling 
Whispers in my ear 

In the light of the day 
When my mind starts to wonder (my mind slips away) 
There is nothing I can do 
My thought run back to you 

You relly got me girl 
Come and take my hand and lead me on 
Let me kiss and hug you... Show me how to love you 
All night long 
If you won´t I know I´ll lose my mind 
I keep hearing 
Voices in the dark... Love is calling 
Talking to my heart... Without warning 
Images appear... Love is calling 
Whispers in my ear 
Voices in the dark 
Talking to my heart 
Echoes in my dream... Love is calling 
You´re the one for me",Voices in the Dark,1986
Jermaine Jackson,"I can't let you go tonight without a fight 
Oh you been sending love signs that feel so right 
When we move you talk of love I understand 
Oh baby there is no time like the first time 
I will hold you to the promises you made 
I know you'll be worth the wait 
When you're turning your words into action 
Letting your body do all the talking 
I wanna know how it feels 
When we love the first time 
When you're turning your words into action 
Letting your body do all the talking 

Chorus 

I can't let you go tonight but I know the way you feel 
I need real love 
I will old you and the promises you've made 
I know we can find the way

I wanna know if this is the real thing 

Yes I do baby 
Moving in time with you 
Oh won't you show me 
Living up to what you say 
Take my breath away

Jermaine Jackson,"Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand

I tried to cope, I really hoped that you would see
You were the only girl for me baby
I tried to mend but you condemned a love affair
You destroyed it beyond repair

You absorb the talk of a friend baby
She said project the harder stalk and never bend
And be free from me and the things I do
Can't you see she's trying to take me from you

Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand
Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand

The mental strain in my brain to great a price to pay
For the way you make me feel in bed, baby
And all our plans these grains of sand,
The waves have washed away, the book that I misread

You don't equate sex with love
But isn't the love we make worthy of
More than wishful thoughts and plastic smiles
And ecstasy that only last for a while

Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand
Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand

Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand
Why do we build this castle of sand
When we know very well baby, it will never stand

Would light up my world all aglow
I just kept my cool

When you put your hand in mine
I knew that it was time
To let you know how I feel
When you kissed me by surprise
I got buterflies
swiming around in my soul out of control

But it's you always starin' in the mirror 
Constantly fakin' it; ain't no mistakin' it 
Get a grip 'cause you're not far from breakin' it 
Thinkin' about the time when we used to be close 
It shouldn't be a past tense 'cause nobody knows 
What the future may hold, what tomorrow might bring 
It's not guaranteed that you'll be spreadin' your wings 
And funny it seems how it used to be 
Times when you needed to lean on me 
Now you're standin' on two, and you want to act now 
Girl, I ain't thinkin' about you 
Gone too far 
Ya better turn back

She was sent here from heaven
And she's daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
Oh but most of all

For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
Walk beside the pony daddy it's my first ride
I know the cake looks funny daddy but I sure tried

Oh with all that I've done wrong
I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every mornin'
And butterfly kisses at night

Sweet 16 today
She's lookin' like her mama a little more every day
One part woman the other part girl
To perfume and make up from ribbons and curls
Trying her wings out in a great big world
But I remember

Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
You know how much I love you daddy
But if you don't mind
I'm only gonna kiss you on the check this time

Oh with all that I've done wrong
I must have done something right
To deserve her love every mornin'
And butterfly kisses at night

All the precious time
Like the wind the years go by
Precious butterfly
Spread your wings and fly

She'll change her name today
She'll make a promise and I'll give her aways
Standing in the bride room just staring at her
She asked me what I'm thinkin'
And I said I'm not sure
I just feel like I'm loosin' my baby girl
And she leaned over

Gave me butterfly kisses with her mother there

You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip.
A quick hit, that's your game.
But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain.

Night is young, so are we.
Let's get to know each other better, slow & easily.
Take my hand, let's hit the floor.
Shake our bodies to the music.
Maybe then you'll score.

So come on baby, won't you show some class
Why you want to move so fast.
We don't have to take our clothes off

Giving me head, I call it blowing the mind out

But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

You are gay

Oh, go 'way!

We drink water from a dipper,
You drink champagne from a slipper.

Tho' it seems cruel to bust
All your dreams,
Still I must;
Here's the truth I tell you:
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes;
Stage door Johnnies aren't raging
Over you with gems and roses.
When you let a feller hold your hand (which
means an extra beer or sandwich),
Ev'rybody whispers: ""Ain't her life a whirl?""
Though you're warned against a ""rout""

I have played around

Wild old men who give you jewels and sables
Only live in Aesop's Fables.

Must pardon us if we do not believe you,

To smear my face with paint,
Causing ev'ryone
To think I'm what I ain't,
And I like to play a demi-mondy role
With soul!
Ask the hero does he
Like the way I lure
When I play a hussy
Or a paramour,
Yet when once the curtain's down
My life is pure,
And how I dread it!

There is nothing for me but to love you,

Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.

Strive for lofty goals,
Others play at smaller games,

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,
But we will always be called,

The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years.
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears.

The last time I saw Paris, her heart was warm and gay,
No matter how they change her, I'll remember her that way.

I'll think of happy hours, and people who shared them

When they caught me robbing his store

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The way you were lifted and how you never seem to land
The way the dream makes the stream ever damned

So slow to burn

Desire is my concern when I wake up and I'm lit
When I smell smoke, all I think is: this is it
Fan me down or push me over, I'm just about to turn
So goddamn slow to burn

So slow to burn

I'm sorry if I used you, if I used you as my bait
But when you're fishing there's the one your after
The one that got away
And I chase those dreams because I'm hooked and there's nothing I can do
But get up every morning and wait for my desire to come through

So slow to burn",Slow 2Burn,2004

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Jerrod Niemann,"Why'd you call me today with nothing new to say?
You pretend it's just hello,
But you know what it does to me
To see your number on the phone.

Now tell me, what do you want?
What do you want? What do you want from me?
Are you tryin' to bring back the tears or just the memories?
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back, where I've already been.
When we hang up it's almost like I'm losing you again.
Can't you see?
So what do you want, what do you want from me?

I get so tired, of living like this.
I don't have the time, neither do my friends,
To stay up at night, to pull me through,
And to find the things to keep my mind off of you.

So, now tell me, what do you want?
What do you want? What do you want from me?
Did you call to say you've find someone and I'm a used-to-be.
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back, where I've already been.
If you've moved on, why does it feel like I'm losing you again?
Can't you see?
So what do you want, what do you want from me?

What do you want me to say?
That I'm content?
That I'm on the fence?
That I wish you would've stayed?

Oh baby what do you want,
What do you want, what do you want from me?
To come here and make love tonight, 'cause you're feelin' lonely.
You keep takin' me back, takin' me back, where I've already been.

It's like living in a prison without committing a crime
Why not laugh, laugh, laugh when you can
So go bury your toes and troubles in the sand

No, It won't matter anymore
Pick a coast
Rent a boat
With your friends
Make a toast
It won't matter anymore

If you're hurt, hurt, hurt by the one you love
You're gonna be sad, so go be sad in the sun
Take a sip, sip, sip right out of your straw
Yeah, you'll feel better or feel nothing at all

You might be stranded on a tropical beach

Chase the moonlight up to the country side
See heaven is about four turns away

Farm hard walk, your hand in mine
Blood was right here, begging us to jump
Let's shut the world off and do what we want

Out here where the cool grass grows
The night sky is bright as it gets
Out here we can lay our blanket down
And know there ain't no one else around
Except for you and me and the crickets

This song is ready for work, my head is still spinning
And your good morning smile got this ol' boy grinning
Looking at my love, knowin' one you're all mine
Feeling your heart beat through the whispering pines
Lost in each other, lost from the world
Found this true love, found is my girl

Thank God for you
Thank God for dirt roads and where they led us too

Second: who knows
Last step's forever, we found where love grows

For a guy like me, guess he sees who needs saving
Every night I hit my knees again, thanking the Lord she's a lot like him
She loves me with a grace that's truly amazing

I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Hey, I'll hit 'n' run, you son of a gun
But I'll hit 'n' run, but it could be fun, I said

I don't wanna love nobody
Don't wanna take me a while
Girl, you just may not be ready
To go steady for the rest of your life

So for that reason, a one night affair
It'll be alright, a one night affair, let's start tonight
Hit 'n' run, aha son of a gun
I gonna hit 'n' run, yes, I mean it, yes, I mean it

Cause you see I've been a lonely man
And I want you to understand
That I'll never let you under my skin
Cause I don't want to be hurt again

Oh no, baby
(Hit 'n' run)
Um, hum
(Son of a gun)

I couldn't stand it, baby
(Hit 'n' run)
No, no, no, no, now

A one night affair, sounds in a hurry
A one night affair but you don't have to worry
I'll hit and run, I'll be a son of a gun
And I know you have been lonely too

That's why you will understand
Why a broken heart is so harder to mend
But one of these day, I'll be alright
If you just let me love you tonight

And though it may sound a little temporary
Sometimes, baby, it's so necessary

A one night affair, I declare
One night affair
Hey, just hit 'n' run, I'll be a son of a gun
Said I'll hit 'n' run, yes I will, yes I will, baby

One night affair won't hurt nobody
A one night affair

Baby
(Hit 'n' run)
Won't you be mine
(Son of a gun)

For just a little while
(Hit 'n' run)
Hey, won't you be mine
Won't you hold me

Don't mean she's gonna last

Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong
My mama had some great advice
So I thought I'd put it into words of this song
I can still hear her saying it

Boy, oh, I see you're sitting out there all alone
Cryin' your eyes out

There's gonna be, there's gonna be
A whole lot of trouble in your life
So listen to me get up off of your knees

You've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Don't go, all around with your head hung down

I wouldn't let that little girl
No, I wouldn't let her know
That she made me feel like a clown
There's a whole lot a girl
Lookin' for a good man like you
Oh, but you'll never meet them if you give up now
And say, your life is through

Then she said it
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive

Jerry Byrd,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

With sweat,

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

Grew restless on the farm
A good boy filled with wanderlust
Who really meant no harm

And combed his dark hair down

And his mother cried as he walked out
""Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town""

He laughed and kissed his mom
And said, ""Your Billy Joe's a man
And I can shoot as quick and straight

But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down""

""Don't take your guns to town son

His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down

But his mother's words echoed again
""Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town""

He drank his first strong liquor then
To calm his shakin' hand
He tried to tell himself at last
He had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side
Began to laugh him down

And he heard again his mother's words
""Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill

But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered 'round

It's the coming that I crave
Pour the sun upon the ground
Stand to throw a shadow
Watch it grow into the night
And fill the spinning sky

Time among the pine trees
It felt like breath of air
Usually I just walk these streets
And tell myself to care
Sometimes I believe me
Sometimes I don't hear
Sometimes the shape I'm in
Won't let me go

I don't know too much for truth
But my heart knows how to pound
My legs know how to love someone
My voice knows how to sound
It's a shame that it's not enough
It's a shame that it is a shame
Follow the circle down
Where would you be

You're the only one I want
I've never heard your name
Let's hope we meet someday
If we don't it's all the same
And I'll meet the ones between us
And be thinking about you
And all the places I have seen
And why you were not there",Highway Kind,1998

Memphis looks bigger at night
All the tattooed boys in uniform
Step in and out of the light

She bought me good whiskey in Memphis
She bought supper and she paid for the room
And as best as I can remember
She paid dearly for loving me too

Ain't you the one
The one with the guitar boys
And all them sad songs
About men in the rain

Two cigarettes lit up the room
Like two backseat lovers, can't wait to get started

This old ramblin' all around
And marry you a sweet loving wife""

More pretty girls than one
Any old town that I ramble all around in
There's more pretty girls than one

Hang down your pretty head and cry

Them pretty little gals and hoping that I never die

From a girl i used to know
I guess i read it front to back
Fifty times or so
It's all about the good life
And stayin' at ease with the world
It's funny how i love that book
And i never loved that girl

Hold this piece of glass
Up to the light comin' through the door
It's a prism glass i found on the road
Can you see that little rainbow
Well it's not really a prism i guess
It just broke in a funny way
I found it on my way from texas
Headed for l.a.

This guitar was given me
By old man thomas gray
It's not too much to look at
But i pick it every day
It's been across the country
Four or five times i guess
Between me and old man tom
It never got much rest

Well that's about all i own
And all i care to i guess
Except this pair of boots
And that funny yellow vest
And that leather jacket and leather bag
And hat hangin' on the wall
Just so it's not too much to carry
Could i see you again next fall

We forded the nueces
We swum the guadalupe
And we followed the brazos
Red river runs rusty
The wichita clear
But down by the brazos
I courted my dear

Lend me your hand
Li, li, li, le, le, le
Lend me your hand

Lend me your hand
There's many a river
That waters the land

Now the fair angelina
Runs glossy and gliding
The crooked colorado
Runs weaving and winding
The slow san antonio
Courses and plains
But I never will walk
By the brazos again

She kissed me and she hugged me
And she called me her dandy
The trinity's muddy
But the brazos quick sandy
She kissed me and she hugged me
And she called me her own
But down by the brazos
She left me alone

Now the girls of little river
They're plump and they're pretty
The sabine and the sulphur
Hold beauties a'many
The banks of the neches
There are girls by the score
But down by the brazos
I'll wander no more

I saw a hitchhiker
And his thumb was pointing my way
He didn't look suspicious
And he didn't look any too clean

I put on my brakes
And I opened my door
I could tell he was a bum
By the muddy boot he wore
He said I'm going down to Haskell
Got a woman down in Abilene

He said East Texas
Is where I come from
I was working a rodeo out there
And it sure got humdrum
So I'm just traveling around
A whole lot of Texas I've seen

I'm mighty glad
You were going my way
In your brand new clothes there
And your great big Chevrolet
I'm going down to Haskell
Got a woman down in Abilene

Well he was grinning like a possum
And a mighty happy rascal
And he waved good-bye
When I let him out in Haskell
And that's about the last
Of that old road tramp
I ever did see

Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie la lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

On a Tuesday, I was locked up in jail

On a Thursday, nobody would go my bail 

Almost done, I'm almost done, almost done 
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no pail 

Take these stripes, stripes from around my shoulder 
Take these chains, these chains from around my legs 
Lord, these stripes, it sure don't worry me 
But these chains, these chain's gonna kill me dead

Jerry Douglas,"I saw you on the avenue
You looked so tired and a little blue
You were in your Sunday best
With your father's tie upon your chest

[Chorus:]
Hey, you always stood me still
Hey, you always will

In the corridor of one hotel
We once crossed paths I recall it well
Voices in an empty hall
Slamming doors to hearts that fall

[Chorus]

Always will
Always will
Hey
Always will
Always will
Hey

Love has been my passer by
I stood too still to catch your eye
But there out on the avenue
In your father's tie I'll remember you

Jerry Douglas,"Watching the long faces
Riding this run down track
And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Away down the low road
A ticket to an empty room
A rendezvous unknown

I'm riding the blue train
Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there
To find me inside this blue train

Jerry Douglas,"My history is no secret it's written in the stones
In the hill beside this river rest my mother's gentle bones
And daddy there beside her among his next of kin
And their legacy passed down to me the sons of mountain men

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
If that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
When they lay me down remind them I was just my father's son

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men

Jerry Douglas,"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love
I'm sailing away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea?
From the place where I'll be landing?

There's nothing you can send me, my own true love
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Maybe silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

If I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
That's all I wish to be owning

Oh, I might be gone a long ol' time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy passing?

How can, how can you ask me again?
Well it only brings me sorrow
Oh, the same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow

Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from his ship a-sailing
Saying, I don't know when I'll be coming back again
It depends on how I'm feeling

If you, my love, must think that away
I'm sure your mind is a-roaming
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country where you're going

So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of stormy weather
And yes, there is something you can send back to me

Jerry Douglas,"You say this ain't over yet
I've said things that I regret
Won't be easy to forget
Scars take time to heal

Before another bitter word gets loose
I was hoping we could call a truce

Cause nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love get bruised
When we light that same old fuse
Again and again
Nobody wins slamming doors
We've both lost this fight before
And I won't play that game no more
Cause nobody wins

Darlin' we've got too much pride
It don't matter who's wrong or right
Honey love ain't black and white
It's the way I feel about you

All I wanna do is hold you tight
I can't take another angry night

When nobody wins, we both lose

When we light that same old fuse

Cause nobody wins

I know something's bound to break
If we don't bend

Jerry Douglas,"Baby, I know that we've got trouble in the fields
When the bankers swarm like locusts they're turning away our yields
Our dreams roll by our silo, silver in the rain
And leave our pockets full of nothing and our dreams in the golden grain

Have you sees the folks in line downtown at the station?
They're all buying their tickets out and they're talking a great depression
Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work  these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
There's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos in every page
Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder

And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil, no
If we sell that new John Deere
Then we'll work these farm with sweat and tears

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
Here in these troubled fields

You'll be the mule, I'll be the plow
Come harvest time, we'll work it out
There's still a lot of love
