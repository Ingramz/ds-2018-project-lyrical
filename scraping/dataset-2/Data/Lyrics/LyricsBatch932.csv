Rihanna,"I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

How did I get here with you, I'll never know?
I never meant to let it get so, personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

It's getting late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place

Rihanna,"We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on the brain, ball player in the face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He's staying with a flock of them, oh, yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop its
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever

Rihanna,"Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt,
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece,
Sorrow decrease
Pressure release, I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt (Yes)
But it taught me before a decision ask this question first

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances are given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances are given, question existing

Take off my coat,
Show them that under here,
I'm just like you, do the mistakes,
I may make me a fool or a human with flaws,
Admit that I'm lost
Round of applause,
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether ""win or lose""

Dear Diary,
It's Robyn
Entertain is something I do for a living
It's not who I am, I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal,
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt,
I think guys suck sometimes,
But when you're in the spotlight,
Everything seems good,
Sometimes I feel like I have it worse 'cause I have to always keep my guard up,
I don't know who to trust, I don't know who wants to date me for who I am,
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am,

Rihanna,"Baby, baby
When we first met, I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like

Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'd do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the way you hurt me, do you?

Rihanna,"Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me
It’s destiny
Just let it be
If the words can speak
Then baby sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

You could be a professional, boy you make a sale
I try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core, you know

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me
It’s destiny
Just let it be
If the words can speak
Then baby sell it to me

His arms, I want to roam
I want to love, give him my trust
I want to live, for both of us
I want to breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I want to warm you, when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love

Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me

Come on now, what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

Get it, get it, don't stop, it's a sure shot
Ain't a Ferrari, huh, boy, I'm sorry
I ain't even worried, so step inside
And ride, ride, ride

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waiting for, for, for?

Rihanna,"Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind

Take me down but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we've gone much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (Shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life

I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose

So that I can't stay mad at you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grand-mama's sofa
Girl I got us lovey dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your GUESS jeans on looking sexy, oh huh girl
Why could it not be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one? (Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one? (Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one? (Why? Why? Why?)

All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you

If you play, you play the key
Take the gun, and count to three

And you can see my heart, beating,
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer, to yourself
He says, close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

Now you can see it through my chest

So I made it, even though Katy
Told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time

They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me let go

But together we gon' be taking over

Ain't no timeout in my game, they already underway

'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love 
I'm like how could it be?

It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down
I need me a remedy, been looking for remedies
I need you to be around, baby I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey

I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grand-mama's sofa

I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your GUESS jeans on looking sexy, oh huh girl

Rihanna,"On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
'Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories

This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my finger
It seems like more than distance between us

For you're heart on me

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter

But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts

Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you

Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
Instead they say

Yeah hold up, bad girls ain't no good,
And the good girls ain't no fun
Look (And the bad girls want a real nigga!)
Yeah, cause real niggas just want (ha)
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing
Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king)

And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)

I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that I heard you (bad girl)

And Rhianna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya
Never did terrible bullshit ya
Enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost (Cause I've had some issues)
Yeah and I noticed it
You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion

Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink

So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'

One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian

I gently kiss her lips, touch her with my finger tips
Searching for the love I miss, you once gave to me
She is warm here by my side, I should be satisfied
It's sad to realise I'm still in love with you

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

A phone is ringin' but the message can't get through
A whisper on the wind as the sun goes down
A teardrop crashes to the ground and

That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks
That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks

Two people cryin' over broken vows
A door slams shut on an empty house
It echoes on down where the well is runnin' dry
Words lost in sentences we can't understand
A ring is slippin' off my fingers and slippin' through my hands, and

That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks
That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks

Blue notes on an old guitar, the silent fire of a distant star
The unforgiving rhythm of November rain
Rivers that are runnin' down a broken windowpane

That's the sound that a heart makes when a heart breaks

donnera un sens à mes lendemains,
Une petite main qui dans ma main,
change l’horizon en un tour de main

Confondere lo zucchero al posto del sale

E piazza della scala sembra decollare

Scritte sbiadite sui muri del bagno a scuola
La prof Santini è solo una stupida troia
Forse da oggi in poi diranno la stessa cosa di me
Che diranno della nostra storia?
Chi mi dice che sei serio e non vuoi solo quella cosa?
Camminiamo mano per la mano e l’invidia è una rosa
Un po’ ci lusinga ed un po’ ci addolora
Ogni ragazza sogna uno come te che non la faccia mai sentire sola
E se ti tocco come Stranger Things mi sento sotto sopra
Come lo facciamo sotto o sopra?

Sarà come prendersi delle colpe e poi per la mano
Senza ciò che provavi ieri, che non va e non ti starà mai
Sarà come perdersi, ma sott’acqua così prendo fiato
Scivolando, ciò che ho, che hai, di così sbagliato

Sei tu l’idiota non sai che cosa ti perdi
Quando mi rivorrai non riuscirai neanche a vedermi
Lara mi diceva che i ragazzi sono vermi
Non è oro ciò che luccica, i miei occhi sono verdi
Tu dove sei? Dovresti essermi vicino
Sei soltanto un bambino e io da te aspetto un bambino
Mi hai sempre detto che non esiste il destino
Ma adesso che mi ha colpito si attorciglia l’intestino
E Dio se ci sei perché ora non mi guardi?
Forse mi ha tolto il futuro per donarlo ad altri?
Nel fiore dei miei anni mi condanni
Mamma fuori piange di nascosto mentre asciuga i panni
Ma la vita è mia

Sorridi non per gli altri, solamente per te stessa

Didn't buy a chain, I bought a MX with a RED
Didn't buy to flex

You made a way for me, you gave my life a new beginning

All the times that he was there when I look back
Footprints in the sand played out what it looks like
Laid it all down for a wretch and the crook life
It's amazing, so amazing all the things I went through
And the only reason I made this 'cause my parent's prayers
'Cause you know that my layers deeper than I would let on
And I knew that I could make it had to push and press on
I stand tall like a beacon of light

Last winter I was working nights and I missed the last train
Nothing unusual, I walk home in the snow again.
A car stops, rolls down the window and asks me my name
I replied, I realize, 'It was you.'

And may all acquaintance be forgot but I remember you.
And I remember and I remember and I remember you
And I remember and I remember you.

I don't want you to think that this happens to me all the time.
I hope you don't think I make a habit of taking strange rides.
Conversation was easy there was glitter on your face (?).
We carried on and talked until dawn.

And my heart is breaking my knees is shaking and I just hanging around
The clock is ticking the world is spinning there's nothing that I found.

And may all acquaintance be forgot but I remember you
And I remember I remember when you gave me a word.

Discours d'un jeune en arabe

[Couplet 1]
Dans la tête d'un jeune beur
Originaire de Barbacha dans la petite Kabylie
Ou Nechtakarrom, les figues, les olives et ses arômes, les Hanouts
La douane et les excédents de bagages,
Cette coutume et ce mode de vie auquel on s'attache
La population assommée par le prix du kilo de viande
Au casse pipe même pour un Doro, jeune hittiste dans la contrebande
Atteni l'garro, des Rym Boro, l'ennui à s'en taper la tête dans l'hitt y'a pas d'boulot
La misère dans la rue la devise, les devises avant les deux bises, la bouche pleine d'Chemma
Qu'est ce que tu feras plus tard ? -J'sais pas khallina tranquille!
T'es plus un jeune t'as plus de 20 ans et t'as même pas un chez toi
Naal Shetane, tu gamberges entre deux pannes de courant ou d'eau courante
Ça reste incomparable avec le vécu de nos grands parents
Qui nous alimentent de leur savoir vivre, un trésor dans ce monde crapuleux
On leur a inculqué les valeurs très jeunes
La plupart illettrés ont vécu huit ans de guerre violente, la famine, le peuple engagé
Beaucoup ont vu la mort de près, perdu des proches pour arracher notre liberté
La fierté de nos moudjahidins, pour tout le sang coulé lors de la bataille d'Alger
A tous les pères de famille âgés qu'en ont bavé
Qu'ont le moral qui dégringole avec l'économie du pays
Chaque fois qu'augmente le Smic en France, au Bled c'qu'augmente c'est l'Smid
Éduquent les nôtres avec l'Nia
Un homme qui n'se consacre pas à sa famille n'en est est pas un
La religion rallie la communauté qui se surpasse pour vivre, tout est ghali
Comment ne pas penser à Paris ?

[Refrain]
Le manque de khedma, l'ennui, le stress, l'envie de bien faire
Dans la tête d'un jeune beur
Algériens, Musulmans, frères montrés du doigt mais fiers
Dans la tête d'un jeune beur
Pour la famille on souffre, assume ce qu'on est jusqu'au dernier souffle
Dans la tête d'un jeune beur
On pense à Reudwa , à fonder une famille, au visa et aux papiers militaires
A nos anciens qu'ont connu la guerre

[Couplet 2]
La première vague d'immigrés a servi à reconstruire la France
Pour des modiques sommes dans les travaux publiques
Pas fainéant quand le réveil sonne, le regard de nos anciens en disent long
Respect aux pères qui construisent nos maisons au Bled en dix ans s'il le faut
Depuis la guerre, méprisés, indésirables à la télé y'a des rebeus sur le câble
Branchés, câblés sur Al-Jazira et les chaines du Bled
Comme au bled là-bas, il s'imagine qu'ici c'est le Club Med
S'il savait que c'est plus galère que la file d'attente du Consulat
Quand tu postules à un emploi mais qui veut croire en toi ?
Hamdoulah on a la fois c'qui nous aide à tenir
Ça m'rappelle une phrase que j'ai vu sur un mur du Bled
""Mais où est notre avenir ?""

[Pont]

[Couplet 3]
Un coup de fil du pays, une commande, ils veulent des vêtements de marque
Chaque année un zinc débarque pour recommencer sa vie
Wesh Rak cousin? -Pas si bien que ça
Quand il voit que les bars sont remplis d'ârab
On a acquis une mauvaise réputation, nos mères s'inquiètent
Sortir sans papier est synonyme de complication
Un brin francisé mais me demande pas si je compte circoncire mes gosses
Par le Shétane courtisé, c'est vrai
Certains veulent simplement une vie simple
Se laisser guider par le Livre Saint
Voilà quelques fragments de ce qu'un jeune Beur ressent
Sa vie prend tout son sens autour des siens, près des siens

T’as vu? J’ai perdu comme j’ai vaincu

D’escalier, lié avec des fous à lier

Dis-leur, le manque d’oseille s’ressentait dans mes gestes
Ma musique était fidèle à mes convictions
Conforme à mes actions quand j’étais sur une mission
J’ai chanté la douleur des miens
Quand j’étais déchiré entre le mal et le bien
J’suis resté vrai et fidèle à moi-même
J’ai lutté pour le peuple et non pas pour le système

Rim'k,"Chez nous très peu de personne décède de mort naturel,
Soit attentif quand t'on parle d'islam, quand on te fait le rappel.
La liste est longue lourde, jusqu'a Landres et y'a pas l'ombre d'un doute.
Plus d'un de mes potes serait à cuba en train de manger des langoustes.
Sur tous ces drames, on prend des risques c'est pas a nous le monde,
La rue nous les a pris sans rien demander ce monde est fou.
L'essentiel je l'ai compris, partir avec la sensation du devoir accompli,
Chacun vit avec ses problèmes, sans qu'on s'en rend compte.
J'en ai pris conscience quand j'ai vu ce mec brûler vif à la pompe,
Parti lors d'accident mortel de maladie ou de leurs propres grès ou leur rime querelle.
Toujours la même grande peine qui t'empêche de fermer les yeux pendant des jours,
Qui te rappellera qu'on partira sans voiture ni bijoux.
Je connais des mecs qu'ont perdu père et mère,
Tu peux remuer ciel et terre, personne est éternelle une forte pensée pour mon paternel,
Même si dans parlé ca me fait mal, Nasser falbé,
La liste est longue le prochain c'est peut être moi qui sait,
L'ange de la mort passera me voir comme toi, tu sais.
Je sais c'que j'raconte on doit tous rendre des comptes,
Finis de se comporter comme des cons
On sait pas quand commence le compte à rebours.

Refrain (x2)
La liste est longue,
Tôt ou tard viendra le jour où sur cette terre on sera trop long lourd,
La liste est longue


Toujours un mal pour un bien, un être qui nous quitte
Et un autre qui vient au monde c'monde usé par les défauts de l'être humain.
On se demande comment on fera sans telle ou un tel,
Déjà trop de potes assommés par les lourdes peines ou one dead.
On regrette des actes des paroles malheureusement irrattrapables une fois aux funérailles
Cache nos douleurs parce qu'à la base on est des hommes,
Mais pire c'est qui y'a que les drames pour nous réunir.
Je peux pas m'empêcher de penser et parler
De ceux qui nous ont quitté tellement jeune
L.A.S, Mombi, Mamadou, Tchoul, Mohamed, Malek, Nouri,
Karim, Steven, Naser, Habib, Marc, qu' Allah nous préserve.
On cherche l'issue de secours, tente de traverser le désert
Juste à l'aide d'une gourde.
Cultive l'amour qu'on reçoit de nos proches
Ce qui nous aide à tenir le coup avant la fin du tunnel poto.


Refrain (x2)


Tôt ou tard viendra le jour où sur cette terre, on sera trop long, lourd
Nos vies sont courtes et trop.

Rim'k,"C´est mafia k´1 fry, 9.4., c´est mafia k´1 fry
Rim-k mafia k´1 fry, Rim-k mafia k´1 fry
Vivre sans gêne, ça c´est le son qu´on aime,
Ouais gros rim-k, 1.1.3., ça c´est les sons qu´on aime,
Le vécu et la ky-fun, par tradition, ça c´est le son qu´on aime,
Ça c´est le son qu´on aime, le vécu et la ky-fun.

C´est Rim-K le vitrio et sa bande, chez nous c´est la funk, les banques,
Un splif, ça parle, ça s´ taille, sur le banc des accusés,
Dans l´insouciance, tout le temps on vit dans l´excès, on fait qu´abuser,
Pervers après trois verres, on brise toujours les coeurs et les gueules,
Expert comme un?, et on roupille l´ dimanche,
Bouge jamais sans un truc dissimulé au ceinturon ou dans la manche,
Fait crier la voitise pour impressionner la miss, on a l´manche,
On a l´mort, te drague même en allemand, trop impulsif ch´te siffle,
Grimpe dans mon ambiance, fumée nocive
Appelle moi le gros, appelle moi le gros,
Ouais appelle moi le gros, appelle moi le gros, appelle moi le gros.
C´est la tendance fashion, coupe aux molards
Et c´est sans moi, p´tit clin d´oeil aux banlieusards,
D´mon jour, avec une ou deux dans le noir, aux regards glacials,
T´aimes ce son qui porte mes initiales R.I.M-K

{Refrain:}
Ça c´est les sons qu´on aime, vivre sans gêne, inconscients et jeunes, du respect,
Ça c´est les sons qu´on aime, le vécu et la ky-fun
Ça c´est les sons qu´on aime, vivre sans gêne, inconscients et jeunes, du respect,
Ça c´est les sons qu´on aime, le vécu et la ky-fun
Ça c´est les sons qu´on aime, vivre sans gêne, inconscients et jeunes, du respect,
Ça c´est les sons qu´on aime, le vécu et la ky-fun
Ça c´est les sons qu´on aime, vivre sans gêne, inconscients et jeunes, du respect,
Ça c´est les sons qu´on aime, le vécu et la ky-fun

Appelle moi le gros, appelle moi le gros, appelle moi le gros, appelle moi le gros.

Pour les hauteurs d´la ville, les youves dans les tures-voi,
Un p´tit son mélodieux pour les durs à cuir, Par tradition.

Quoi genre tu rentres pas, j´te met V.I.P. chaque VSD,
Une substance bizarre du genre LSD,
joue la profile bas,
T´auras du mal à déchiffrer le langage et l´délire, un jack, un coup bas,
La ky-fun par tradition, le rap c´est temporaire, ça m´a évité les missions,
La prison, de trop courir, car pour prendre le pied au cul on est sans gêne,
Dans les véhicules, au fumier, quand ça gèle.

{au Refrain}

Pour les hauteurs d´la ville, les youves dans les tures-voi,
Un p´tit son mélodieux pour les durs à cuir, Par tradition,
On veux des loves sans interruption, foulek à chaque apparitions,

Rim'k,"J'ai un petit problème avec la fume
Boozillé le shit fait des trous dans mes poumons comme un barillet
J'l'assume ça a jamais tué personne
Moi et mes potes on est les affran""shit""
Appelle moi Paul ou Poly, reste poli
Je fume pas de caille
On se fait livrer des colis, des délits on en a commis

A l'heure où je te parle le studio c'est un coffee shop mec
On fait monter les degrés Celsius
En vago j'cache ça dans le calcif
Les résidus radio actifs dans le lavabo
Ca irait si je buvais que de l'eau
Un soir sur deux ré-bou, des splifs V12
Il m'reste encore un ou deux trophées une ou deux vestes Reebok
Sous perf de Maroco
Mais dans l'armoire cache pas de bédos d'White Widow ou 3 kil
Juste de quoi assumer si je me barre en vrille
J'suis pas ceinture noire d'Aikido
Mais j'ai de quoi t'faire un deuxième nombril
Ba, ba, j'gravite toujours autour de la rue, je connais que ça
Consomme comme un porc sans ordonnance du médecin
Ca m'inspire gros après m'avoir encouragé à ne plus m'instruire

Refrain
J'ai la tête de l'inculpé, du coupable, du bouc émissaire
Même en étant môme, j'ai jamais rêvé d'être commissaire
Fuck la police, sors moi un bloc bien vi-ser
J'vais te montrer comment on se sert d'un mic
Chez nous même les mômes rusent et insultent les commissaires
Ca commet des adultères, picolent jusqu'à l'ulcère
On s'froisse les bronches  Portrait 
On s'en fout de tout et doucement on s'enfonce
Fonce pété au volant pour effacer ce passé turbulent
On vise les sommes mirobolantes
Fuck la douane volante, dédié à ceux qui enfilent le collant
Fume la thai grasse collante. Aux potos partis d'une mort violente

J'ai un petit problème avec le rap
On a déjà des disques d'or
Gros lâche moi la grappe
Ca m'gêne d'voir des pédales aimer le son que j'aime
J'ai commencé sous Heineken
Je suis comme Eugène
La voix rauque, j'ai pas une voix de chienne comme Pharell
J'viens pas du rock, j'suis à l'ancienne
Un deux test, traumatise les sales parisiennes
J'rap comme je vendrais du shit
Toujours un penchant pour le risque
Il me reste du jus pour saigner les maisons de disque
Dans la rue ou dans le disque
A 2-10 avec l'équipe, avec les trips
En boîte sur la table fais-nous un strip
Même pas rasé dans les clips
Le rap c'était un trip étant gamin
Depuis, entre mecs qui y croyaient on a fait du chemin sans l'aide de personne
Dans l'rap à Vitry c'est pas ce qui manquait hein ?
Mais bon bref

J'ai un petit problème avec les femmes
Trop gentilles, trop connes ou trop de Rllam
Qui kiffent les voitures confortables, saturent ton portable
Veulent le cortège avant le mariage
N'ont pas le sens du partage
Je fais encore des gardes à vue
Et vu que je bédave, ça leur plait pas trop
Tempérament de patron
S'il te plait ne m'en demande pas trop, c'est pas drôle
Ne me prive pas de sexe ou je me branle
Fallait pas faire la grande, hein ?!
Tu sais plus où aller (cut)  (cut) ou avoir la roue arrière voilée
Voyons c'est qui le voyou, c'est toi ou moi ?!
Je connais trop de meufs égarées
Trop de salopards aussi qui après avoir tiré leur coup ne pensent qu'à se barrer

J'ai un problème avec tellement de choses
De quoi se faire de cheveux gris, devenir chauve
Beaucoup trop pour un seul homme
C'est pas pour rien qu'on me surnomme Tonton La Découpe

Refrain
J'ai la tête de l'inculpé, du coupable, du bouc émissaire
Même en étant môme, j'ai jamais rêvé d'être commissaire
Fuck la police, sors moi un bloc bien vi-ser

Fonce pété au volant pour effacer ce passé turbulent
On vise les sommes mirobolantes
Fuck la douane volante, dédié à ceux qui enfilent le collant
Fume la thai grasse collante. Aux potos partis d'une mort violente

J'ai un problème, un gros problème
J'ai un gros problème avec la France en manque de franchise à mon égard
Ses brigades, ses regards, ses cars de CRS, fourgons cellulaires
Triquard comme un imposteur
Pourtant je suis dans la chambre de plein de jeunes français en poster
Et en CD avec un malien et un antillais
Dans les rues de notre ville, on roule pas en Roadster
On a notre méthode perso pour foutre la rage aux steurs
Toujours heureux comme un supporter de Manchester
Devant eux trop de vendus
Les baveux ça coûte chère, y'a trop de langues pendues
Rapports tendus, j'espère que je suis entendu
On n'est pas con on va au turbin comme on dit dans le jargon
Sans se faire pincer comme Alfred Sirven
On veut être des cerveaux
Etre mêlés à l'affaire Elf, toucher des pots de vin et se servir

Refrain
J'ai la tête de l'inculpé, du coupable, du bouc émissaire
Même en étant môme, j'ai jamais rêvé d'être commissaire

Ma mère m'aurait bien vu
à la place d'Rachid Arab
On ramenait jamais c'qu'on
volait à la baraque par peur
de s'faire maraav'
Débrouillard depuis
tout jeune
un gosse du rachid système
Beur et conscient
d'son potentiel
En France, si facile d'se
retrouver au habsse tahlafih
On trempe dans des coups, des traffics
J'sui toujours un p'tit
rehflit, toujours à l'affût,
vivcieux dès le sbarr
La débrouillardiste taharsar
C'est l'coup de griffe
Rachid system, pour ceux
qu'on pas froid aux yeux
Les adeptes d'l'extrême,
sui tentent de faire recette
S'mangent des coups,
d'relèvent
Et parfois c'est fatal
ça semble interminable
comme l'Intifada
Avec les moyens du bord,
dans tous les domaines
On a la rage,
taa les trabendos
Essuyant tout revers
ou critique, poto
Aussi vrai qu'j'aime mon
pays,et que rien n'le vaut
Le rachid système, gros

cabossées du bled

Les empreintes de mon
bled m'imprègnent
La chaleur émane du sol
J'reste relié avec les zinks
par taxis-phones
Dédié aux vendeurs
à la sauvette
Aux tiers-quar où
on roule encore en Solex
Pensez aux fréros au
Moyens-Orient qui grandissent
au bruit des roquettes
En quête d'encore plus de foi
Faire honneur à la famille,
c'est c'qu'on a en tête
Sans se soucier du regard
des gens, on avance
sans s'plaindre
Des dois par nécessité
on enfreint les lois
Pour ceux qui croyaient y trouver une terre d'acceuil
Du port du Marseille

Rim'k,"prends ces paroles comme si elles venaient de ton meilleur ami
certains courent apres le bonheur toute leur vie
et ne l'effleurent que de temps en temps

je ne compte plus les fois ou je l'ai echappe belle a des heures tardives
j'ai commence l'annee avec 3 parabellums braques en direction de mon pare - brise
en sursis a l'abri de rien, des longues marques sur un chemin perilleux
avec un parfum de violence, ca tient a rien
des menottes aux poignets ou un boule au pied
vulnerable jusqu'aux funerailles,
faut que tu l'acceptes comme la disparition de proches qui m'affecte
ou de voir mes neveux dans un ascenseur infect
tout jeune j'etais pas plus con qu'un autre
au milieu des autres a creer des liens impossibles a rompre
en bas des tours passifs, sur les traces des voyous qui nous fascinent
j'ai compris tout jeune que ca n'allait pas etre facile
je ne detestais pas l'ecole mais je ne voyais pas en elle une issue
trop de gens sur mon parcours scolaire m'ont decu, dechu, foutu d'apres les sondages
l'ete a la piscine municipale, toute l'annee avec un mental de sauvage
dans tous les coups a toi d'avoir l'imagination
assez large sans voir venir les soucis qui m'attendaient au virage
au tournant – d'innombrables – car chez nous le mal est palpable

refrain
sois conscient, combien d'epreuves au tournant
trop souvent, en silence ca nous tourmente

je suis curieux de savoir ou tout ca nous mene
au tournant, certains ne sont l'ombre que d'eux - memes
tu vois des potes sortir rentrer, les memes sortir rentrer,
une chance minime de se reinserer
les dents serrees, acerees devant la grisaille de nos batiments
le moral egratigne ca devient vite fatigant, captivant parfois, capture parfois
c'est plus complexe que ca, ce qui est difficile, c'est de durer
les regards froids une fois la majorite passee, voir les fourgons passer, repasser
au jour le jour vivre chaque minute avec compassion, les actions bonnes ou mauvaises
dure a mettre en application ce qu'on nous a appris et pour s'en echapper il y a un prix
faut - il le payer de nos vies ?
dure a comprendre donc dans la solitude, notre fortune est dans notre ame et celui - ci se consume
doucement a chaque epreuve qui nous attend – au tournant –

refrain

au tournant avec un brun de folie, avec ce qu'il faut sous le lit, insoumis
insomniaque on manque de tact
ca devient mauvais d'etre emotif
on a un parpaing au milieu des arteres
la rue t'emmene a commettre l'acte a ne pas faire
entre deux arrivages, deux orages
en attendant de courir dans la mauvaise direction
de tomber sur la mauvaise brigade, au virage et tellement peu bavards
meme au plus judicieux mais rien n'arrive au hasard
en embuscade meme tard la nuit
drogue douce, (whi)sky pour noyer les soucis sur les hauteurs de la ville
gamberger, on a l'age du meurtre
l'age ou on pense a se caser avec l'impression que c'etait hier qu'on se faisait bercer
nos parents s'inquietaient pour nous, maintenant les roles sont inverses
le temps presse, je pourrai me faire renverser
d'etre prier de me coucher a terre, d'etre encercler
c'est un cercle vicieux, un engrenage pour les coups de lame
et les larmes versees et les actes controverses
a dieu et ma famille, je dis merci d'etre encore la
chez nous dormir c'est perdre du temps
apres chaque nuit c'est tout ce qui t'attend

au tournant

je repense a ceux qui me manquent, au tournant

refrain

au tournant la famille, ca tourmente
au tournant la famille, ca tourmente",Au Tournant,2004

Je vis sur le cran d'arrêt
Me demande pas à quoi sert une maison d'arrêt
Les jaloux disent qu'on meure bientôt à ce qu'il parait
Ma vie de nombreux périples
Je prends le fric des MC qui à chaque sortie du périphérique
Appelle à tous les gores faut qu'on s'alourdisse
Je prépare des trucs horribles dans ma catégorie

Contrôlé à chaque feu pas déguisé pour rentrer en boîte

Favelas Favelas
Je commence par une série de coups de barre de fer dans tes reins, petit
Pour les rejetés de la France, ça a un effet thérapeutique
Je pouvais, je peux, je pourrais, j'ai l'espoir des favelas
T'as aucune idée de ce que j'ai pu faire pour en arriver là
Message à ceux qui pensent que cet album annonce mon deuil
Je suis plus que là, c'est Dieu qui a voulu, te fatigue pas à me jeter l’œil
Je suis comme toi re-frè, j'aime les gros billets
T'encombre pas avec le rap, va dans le foot ou dans la NBA
Si il veut une crête ton p'tit reuf
Faut que tu t'inquiètes la tendance c'est de plaire au meufs
Bicrave la 0.9
J'arrive des quartiers maudits
En Audi neuf
Les commerçants se font arracher leur recette
Les lycéens, leurs mobiles sont déjà partis d'ici les gavés
Ils restent que des mecs en position du fœtus sur le banc d'une GAV
Puis personne n'attend d'avoir d'la ch-
Nos espoirs se sont écroulés
En même temps que notre pouvoir d'achat

D'un endroit où plus personne emménage
Déclaré par la rue, jeune espoir des Favelas
On fuira en Modena
T'as aucune idée de ce que j'ai pu faire pour en arriver de là aux favelas

Message claire pour reuf, les reus
Mon album c'est deux, trois caresses, une quinzaine de coups de crosse
Des bruits de bécanes de cross, des arrachages de mallette
Pour les adeptes d'Enfant du Pays qui ont compris mon mal-être
Sans thune t'es qu'une merde, je l'ai compris trop petit
À qui le crime profite? Photo de face et de profil
Je suis né dans l'école du crime, Vitry, est-ce que ça fait de moi un français?
Avec deux, trois potos fiables je monte un empire financier
Et je fais quoi avec l'argent halal?
La même chose que l'argent sale
Sauf que quand y'en a plus bah ça fait plus mal
Je vends des disques alors on me sollicite
Tu veux m'appeler, je viendrais
Mais si ton son est mauvais
Ça sert à rien de mettre mon nom sur un feat
C'est fou le nombre de paires de cuisses que peut contenir une puce
Reculons, t'occupe, on nous soupçonne de financement occulte
On mettra les sacs Tati à l'arrière d'un putain de Porsche
Tiens, camoufle ma liasse dan ton soutien-gorge

D'un endroit où plus personne emménage
Déclaré par la rue, jeune espoir des Favelas
On fuira en Modena
T'as aucune idée de ce que j'ai pu faire pour en arriver de là aux favelas

On a forcés tous les cadenas
Déjoués toutes les caméras
On arrive des favelas
Les nois-ch, babtou, re-beu, négro
Fichés jusqu'à Rio de Janeiro (oh, oh, oh)
J'suis disque de diamant au Maghreb sans effet d'annonce
Numéro-un en cassette pirate dans tous les hanouts
Des rappeurs en France il y en a dix mille
Mais avec des clashs et des compets de merde
Faut pas que tu m'assimiles
J'ai pas appris le poker grâce à Patrick Bruel
J'attendais en bas de l'immeuble
Qui pleuvent des billets de cinq cent avec un sac poubelle
Devant tous nos prénoms, tu peux rajouter Abdel
On est tous fans des armes comme le petit dans Babel
Y'aura preneur même pour les pas belles

Rim'k,"C'est pas grave, tu sais ma peau n'est pas si fragile
C'est pas grave, c'est pas nos vies qu'on a rendu faciles
C'est pas grave, on sera quand même les princes de la ville
Leur dire ""C'est pas grave"" à découvert, même en terrain hostile

L'histoire de l'amour et la haine qui co-habitent
J'ai trouvé la formule mathématique pour le bonheur
De la foie plus de l'espoir multiplié par de l'amour
Et de la sincérité ça donne beaucoup d'coeur
Tout est grave, rien n'est grave, urbaine poésie
J'ai perdu la maîtrise, j'ai les yeux qui brillent, ma plume est triste
J'suis incompris, si on prie, qu'on partage des sourires des fous rires
C'est comme si j'avais gagné tous les grands prix
Cette impression d'être toujours en retard
D'avoir d'l'agressivité dans le regard
La défaite est un fruit amer, fini le temps des échecs
Les expériences difficiles nous ont toutes éméchés
Toutes les bonnes actions même les plus petites sont bonnes à prendre
Construire pour nos petits nous rendra grands
J'suis dans un combat social, j'ai des pensées spatiales
Je sais c'que c'est d'être seul, et d'avoir les mains sales

C'est pas grave, tu sais ma peau n'est pas si fragile
C'est pas grave, c'est pas nos vies qu'on a rendu faciles
C'est pas grave, on sera quand même les princes de la ville
Leur dire ""C'est pas grave"" à découvert, même en terrain hostile

J'ai pas d'chance aux jeux, pas d'chance en amour
Y'a pas de roses, ni de bleus
Que du gris en bas des tours mais c'est pas grave
Y'a le monde qui reste sourd et puis qui ferme les yeux
Me tue un peu plus plus chaque jour, mais c'est pas grave
On a pris de drôles de détour, il a fallu faire demi-tour
Y'a comme des bouchons sur la route, mais c'est pas grave
Y'a de l'écorce sur mon coeur, au pire j'espère des jours meilleurs
Au mieux ne plus avoir peur (peur)

J'ai eu les mains liés, une enclume sur le dos, le vent en face
J'connais par coeur nos parcours, y'aura toujours des coups d'crasse
Face aux galères j'suis prévenu, j'me suis construis une armure
Moi j'prends tellement d'recul que j'suis souvent le dos contre le mur
M'apitoyer c'est comme les baggys: c'est pas vraiment mon style!
Et tu m'entendras m'plaindre une fois par année bissextile
J'ai pas l'temps faut qu'j'avance, ça j'l'ai compris depuis le berceau
Il faut qu'je laisse une empreinte, c'est c'que j'viens d'faire sur c'morceau

Du starbst im Bauch, ich hoff', im Himmel gibt es Platz für uns beide
Und wenn ihr mich fragt, dann scheiß' ich auf euern ganzen Scheiß
Denn würd's um Rap gehen, sei dir sicher, Lakmann wär' die Eins
Sei dir sicher, ich spiel' diesen Track hier niemals live
Denn des ist nur für euch, damit ihr wisst, was ich da mein'
Ich mach' die Kippe aus und zünde eine neue an
Sie will meine Treue, ich frag' mich, wie lang ich's leugnen kann
Sie wollen mein Ja und Beziehungsstatus haben
Wenn ihr's wissen wollt, ich hab' eine Frau seit Jahren
Und ich laufe durch das Game für dich wie Legolas
Shoote auf die Exen, die mich testen wollen wie Legoland
Oh-oh, ich hör' Rapper dissen, fliegen Schüsse
Doch ich warne alle, denn sie woll'n nicht, dass ich flippe
Karrieren ficke, Lines schreiben, damit Leute zittern
Sneak-dissin', an mei'm Hals sind zu viel Schlangenbisse
Scheiß auf Eminem, hör' André 3000
Zahle Mamas Schulden, früher Weed in der Couch drin
Über eine Million Umsatz mit der ersten Platte
Ich weiß nicht, was ich vor'm Sterben mache, ich bin raus, whoo

Rina Ketty,"J'ai vu toute l'Andalousie, 
Berceau de poésie et d'amour.
J'ai vu, à Séville, à Grenade, 
Donner la sérénade sous les tours.
J'ai quitté le pays de la guitare, 
Mais son doux souvenir,
En mon âme s'égare, dans un songe, 
Souvent, tandis que mon coeur bat,
Il me semble entendre tout bas,
Une chanson qui vient de là-bas.

Refrain :
Je revois les grands sombreros et les mantilles
J'entends les airs de fandangos et séguedilles
Que chantent les senoritas si brunes
Quand luit, sur la plazza, la lune.
Je revois dans un boléro, sous les charmilles,
Des "" Carmen "" et des "" Figaro "" dont les yeux brillent
Je sens revivre dans mon coeur,
En dépit des montagnes,
Un souvenir charmeur,
Ardent comme une fleur d'Espagne.

La nuit se meurt avec mon rêve ;
La vision trop brève déjà fuit.
O jour ! verse dans ton aurore 
Le refrain que j'adore et chéris.
Malgré tout le chemin qui me sépare
Du pays andalous et des tendres guitares,
Je veux vibrer encore au rythme flamenco
Qui m'évoque dans son écho,
L'amour, sous un ciel toujours plus beau.

O que eu menos quero é ter inimigos
É ter inimigos

O seu dinheiro não me atrai

O que é meu, vem ni mim
Não é meu, reneguei

Investi, olha os trajes que eu vesti

Meu olhar é clínico, tão crítico

Mas não peça pra pagar você

Mama, I guess you have stood and cursed 
The day I found that old guitar.
When uncle harry died, 
The one we found in the boot of his old car.
I remember how my little fingers blistered 
When I tried to learn to play,
I bet you never dreamed that old guitar 
Would put me where I am today.

Yes, it's been a lot of years, 
I guess it's been an interesting life.
No, mam, I never found another woman 
That I wanted for a wife.
I guess the first time showed us 
That I wasn't the domesticated kind,
But I don't blame her for getting tired 
Of living from a suitcase all the time.

Yes, I know sometimes it looks
Like I've just simply thrown my life away.
I just always figured that if I hung on,
I'd make it big some day.
I guess it takes a special breed
To live this life and think the way I do,
But you'll be glad to hear that any more
I ain't near as bad to drink.

How is Tommy doing with the business
Now that daddy's passed away?
I'm sure daddy always knew that tom
Would be the one to take his place.
And when he tried to lecture me,
I'd sit and pick and sing and let him nag,
But way down deep inside I think
He always knew that hardware ain't my bag.

We open Monday night in bolton city
For another two week stand,
I wish there was some way that you and tom
Could come and hear my band.
Wish I had the time to tell you 'bout the
Places that I've been, the things I saw.
And I'll send the fifteen dollars soon
As I get to the club and make a draw.

When you're hot, you're hot there
Ah, I mean, ah, when what is",$15 Draw,1970

To go out and take me all over this land.
To see me the world, I left my sweet girl

And beau coups of blues.

Oh, sweet magnolia,
Breath carried over the marsh by a breeze from the gulf.
I'm coming home, (coming home)
I've had me enough.

Oh, where are the things I saw in my dreams?
Where's the happy that freedom should bring?
I see me today and know yesterday
That I threw away my most precious things.
I see me a man who's lonely, wants only to lose
Beau coups of blues.

And soon she'll finish me.
And the world's saddest man will live here in Los Angeles.

And to try to change you now, would be all wrong

A million passed me by.

They call the loser's lounge,
And I guess I'm a charter member, you could say.

Since love has turned me down,
Nothing to do but hang around
And listen to all the fools who come to say.

That life is full of heartaches for a poor boy,
'cause a bank roll can turn his woman's head around.
Ain't no use to try and run away or move to another town,
'cause any where a poor boy goes there's a loser's lounge.

Had a real good friend named Sam,
Said he just couldn't understand
Why in the world his sweet love let him down.
But a rich man caught her eye,
He had the money for things to buy.

Now there's a brand new member
Down at the loser's lounge.

HER MOTHER WROTE A LETTER,
SAID SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF SHE WOULD JUST STAY GONE.
SHE KNEW OF HER CONDITION,
BUT SHE WOULDN'T GIVE PERMISSION
FOR HER TO COME BACK HOME.

BUT ALL HE DID WAS SNUB HER,
SAID, ""FACE IT ON YOUR OWN.""

AND GOT BUSTED IN KENTUCKY,
ASKED HIS DAD TO GO HIS BAIL.

AND THE NOTE THAT THEY FOUND ON HIM
SAID, ""DAD, PLEASE TAKE ME HOME.""

",Love Don't Last Long,1970
Ringo Starr,"Patiently she stares down the runway,
Today's the day that he is coming home.
Seems like he's been gone a life time
And a life time is a long time to be gone.
But there are songs that need singing,
And there are things that must be done.
There are thoughts that still need thinking,
And there are wars that must be won.

He was just a boy when they sent for him
And overnight turned him into a man.
Proudly he had served his country
In a war he didn't seem to understand.
The flag still waves, his war is over,
He'll never have to kill again.
And as she waits, she thinks it over,
Is winning worth the prize we pay to win?

Her thoughts keep wandering to his childhood,
When all his hand grenades were merely toys.
And ""war"" was just a game that he was playing
With plastic guns like other little boys.
And ev'ry day when play was over,
He'd put his little toys away.
And she'd be standing, waiting for him,
The way she's waiting here today.

As the plane stops she starts thinking,
Will he still look the way he did before?
Or will his eyes reflect the pain of killing,
Like most young men when they come home from war?
These last few minutes seem like hours,
She tries her best not to cry.
But there's that hearse filled up with flowers,
Did he really have to die?

No, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no,

But it moves so slow when you're waiting.
And it's not much fun
When you let someone keep you waiting.
But you had me and you've still got me
Wond'ring what you'll do,
'Til you find your way back to me,
I'll be waiting for you.

Ev'ry day
Is yesterday when you're waiting.
And you dream a lot
That's all you got when you're waiting.

Ringo Starr,"Look at me now, ain't I a sight?
Eyes bloody red, face puffy white.
Hair tangled up and wrinkled old clothes,
I'm a living example of a big overdose of:

Wine, women and loud happy songs,
I had all three but none lasted long.
The women ran off, I drank all the wine
And the songs died away when I ran out of dimes.

It's strange how the wine works on a fool,
It seeps through his mind,
Leaves him glued to the stool.
Women leave you wishing you'd just never been
But the songs makes you happy,
Soon you're searching again for:

Wine, women and loud happy songs,
I had all three but none lasted long.
The women ran off, I drank all the wine
And the songs died away when I ran out of dimes.","Wine, Women and Loud Happy Songs",1970
Ringo Starr,"Softly I search my mem'rys
And hope I may find yesterday.
And just like her, my thoughts wander
And like her quietly slip away.
Love brings out the weakness in a man
And I'm so weak I just can't stand
To be without her,
Without her,
Without her.

There was a time she walked with me,
But yesterday comes only one time.
And I can see a tomorrow
With yesterday cling to my mind.
Time will take her memory they say,
But it gets harder ev'ry day,
To live without her,
Without her,

She's got her business in the street.
Her smile may make you think that you can own her,
But that smile's reserved for everyone she sees.

Woman of the night, I've heard them call her,
But she's still a woman when morning comes around.
She walks through the market as a lady
And she's kinda nice to have around.

She's a woman of the night and I love her,
Although' her love, my silver doesn't buy.
It's worth the rain to have a little sunshine
And you laugh much louder when you learn to cry.

I've seen them pay for her affection,
But when morning comes, no one calls her name.
She wakes to find no sign of appreciation,
Still she isn't wearing any shame.

SAIL AWAY, RAYMOND, SAIL AWAY.

HO!

AH!

NOW MOST FOLKS JUST BORE ME,
ALWAYS IMPOSING
AND IÂ'D RATHER MEET A TREE
SOMEWHERE OUT IN THE CORNFIELD.

AND IT'S A SUNSHINE...

IT'S A SUNSHINE LIFE FOR ME,
IF I COULD GET AWAY FROM THIS CLOUD OVER ME,
SEEMS TO JUST FOLLOW ME AROUND.

Ringo Starr,"For you and me, babe, it's time that we part,
And between you, babe, I gave you my heart,
For these few moments,
I wish we could start at the top again.

For me and you, babe, it's the end of our date,
Me and the band, babe, all thought it was great,
To entertain you,
But it's getting late and it's time to leave.

Now I want to tell you the pleasure really was mine.
Yes, I had a good time, singing and drinking some wine.
And when the sun sets in the sky
And you close your weary eyes,
I'll be in some night-club, getting high, that's no lie.

Now you and me, babe, we may meet again,
And in the meanwhile, stay out of the rain.
But keep your nose dry
And give as a smile if you liked the show.

Now I want to tell you the pleasure really was mine.
Yes, I had a good time, singing and drinking some wine.
Though I may not be in your town,
You know that I can still be found
Right here on this record, spinning 'round, with the sounds.

For you and me, dave, they turned out the lights,
The violins stayed to wish you good night.
Me and the band-aid are reaching the end, so it's off we go.

Goodbye, everybody!
Come on, lads, play it for me, boys, there we are.
""Well, it's the end of the night and I'd just like to say thank you to everyone involved
In this piece of plastic we're making.
Good, old Jim Keltner, Klaus Voorman, Nicky Hopkins, George Harrison and John
Lennon, Paul McCartney.
Richard Perry, who's producing this masterpiece, Bill Schnee, ever smiling, ever
loving, Vini Poncideo and all his other friends and everybody else who joined in and
helped us on this wonderful record.
So it's a big good night from your friends and mine, Ringo Starr.""",You and Me (Babe),1973

I never needed anyone
And makin' love was just for fun
Those days are gone

But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

Some times I feel so insecure
And love so distant and obscure
Remains the cure",All by Myself,1974

Sipping on a glass of wine and making time, - you know what I mean.
Then my favorite record played and I turned to watch the crowd,
But one dancin' lady made me spill my wine.
She looked so wild and she looked so free and she moved so temptingly,
All the boys had just one question on their minds;

Can she do it like she dances?
Can she do it like she dances?
Oh, the way she move, I'd like to rendezvous her,
Find if she can really do it like she dances.

As she moved around the floor I kept movin' 'round the bar,
Almost got into a fight to keep her in sight.
When the dance was finally through, found myself exhausted too,
And I knew that I'd be wondering all night:

Can she do it like she dances?
Can she do it like she dances?
Oh, the way she move, I'd like to rendezvous,
And find if she can really do it like she dances.

Some girls get off by putting on a show,
But when you get them home the show is over.
Well, on the dance floor there's no move they don't know,
But you get her alone and her body turns to stone.

So I finished up my drink and was heading for the door,
When I saw that lady giving me the eye.
Well, we danced the night away and I'm seeing her today
And I hope that I will find out by on by

Can she do it like she dances?

But, baby, when you came my way,
I thought I had found perfection.
But a strong wind came into my life,
It surely took me by surprise,
I can't seem to control these tears flowing from my eyes.

I've been down (one time) one time,
I've been down (two times) two times,
But I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love.

You know that I depend on you,
For our love's an obligation.
But now that you deserted me,
I'm in desperation.
But I'm in the middle of a bad love storm,
It really took me by surprise.
I look around and all I see is water coming over me.

[Chorus]
I've been down (one time) one time,
I've been down (two times) two times,
But I'm drowning, hear me, drowning in the sea of love.

And I've been down (two times) two times,
But now I'm drowning, drowning in the sea of love.

Ringo Starr,"Me and billy were a couple of kids,
Nobody knew about the things that we did.
Sharing our toys and riding our bikes,
We thought it would last for the rest of our lives.
 
But we gave it all up,
We gave it all up,
We gave it all up for school.
 
Then my fam'ly had to move out of town,
Made some new friends and started hangin' around.
Started stealing like the rest of the guys,
My friend got caught, I saw the fears in his eyes.
 
So I gave it all up,
I gave it all up,
I gave it all up for love.
 
She was eighteen and I topped her by one,
She said she's heard about the bad things I've done.
But she loved me and she just didn't care,
But one night she needed me and I wasn't there.
 
So she gave me right up, (gave me right up)
She gave me right up, (gave me right up)
She gave me right up for love.
 
As I look back and wonder,
Have I wasted my time?
Will I ever learn the meaning of life,
Will I learn it in time.
 
So I sit here with a couple of beers,
Wondering how I've lasted all of these years.
You're beside me and it's feeling so right,
How I'd like to thank you for the rest of my life.
 
'cause I gave it all up, (gave it all up)
I gave it all up, (gave it all up)
I gave it all up for you.

What they know is what they've seen
Education wasn't fun, but now that school is done
Higher learning's just begun

You're gonna watch what you say for a long time
You're gonna suffer the guilt forever
You're gonna get in the way at the wrong time
You're gonna mess up things you thought you would never

Disappointment breeds contempt, it makes you feel inept
Never thought you'd feel alone (at home)
His and hers forever more, throw your freedom out the door
Before you find out what it's for

Four weeks seemed like a long time then, but nine months is longer now
But ever if you never speak again, you've (you've already)

I can't take much more of this
Gonna put you in your place
Tellin' lies won't get you far
I learned that in my youth
I'm givin' you just one more chance
And all I want from you is truth

[Chorus x 2]

Forget about your credit cards
And all your fancy clothes
Forget about those rings and things
And the powder for your nose
It wouldn't take that much from you
To keep me satisfied
But you won't see my face no more
If you don't stop telling lies

I love you girl
That much is true
The truth is staring back at you
But you always break my heart in two
Oh why? Oh why?

I know you think what's wrong is right
You seem so happy when we fight
So I won't be coming home tonight
No lie, no lie
I've said all that there is to say
You better make up your mind
If you look into these lonely eyes
The truth is what you'll find

I'll be kissing you good bye

Neon light takes the place of day, stars like dust are falling
Inside there's a loneliness, the demon tries to charm you with his smile
No time to dream or rest, in the caves of steel, faces are changing
They're the runaways, children of the damned, they're the runaways
Running for their life, faster than they can, they're the runaways
On the street the traffic dies, the break of day it always comes too soon
Running out of reasons why, all your life you blamed it on the moon
Look out for the danger signs, you're stealing time but you know
	you'll never win
Another border line in the caves of steel, faces are changing
They're the runaways, children of the night, they're the runaways
Running for your life, faster than you can, they're the runaways
The nightmares chase the dreams away, the cold night reflects the
	way you feel
It's just another town, it's just one more night to kill
All the streets are empty now, like the wolf you'll walk this night
	alone
And in some other world in the caves of steel, faces are changing

But my licks were so hot
I made the teacher want to dance

I feel so frustrated

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

She showed me her room, isn't it good Norwegian wood?

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.

I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine,
We talked until two and then she said: ""It's time for bed""

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath

If everyone learned to live together
It seems to me  such an easy, easy thing this would be

That made me happy 
In so many different ways 
Like sweet Conchita 
And Isabella 
Back in my traveling' days 

Then there was Georgia 
She was a country girl 
She could reap all I could sow 
Not like dear Judith 
So fond of music 
And Edgar Allan Poe 

But when I think of Angelina 
All the others fade away 
I can't recover 
I know I'll love her 
Now and forever 

I took my pleasure 
Where I found it 
And the ladies as they came 
Like Liz from Tucson 
And Claire from Rouen 
There were so many names 

When unexpected 
Just like a whirlwind

Well, I can see no reason, you living on your nerves

I'm swimming in a circle, I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part

Someone thought of healing, But all I really want to know
I wonder if I'm dreaming I feel so unashamed

A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do
Swallow the pride and joy of the ivory tower

Sometimes I think it's bad

People everywhere just got to be free
Ah, ah, yeah . . . ah, ah, yeah

If there's a man  who is down and needs a helping hand
All it takes is you to understand and to see him through
Seems to me, we got to solve it individually

There'll be shoutin' from the mountains on out to sea
(out to the sea)
No two ways about it, people have to be free
(they got to be free)
Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be
(ah-ha)
It's a natural situation for a man to be free

Enough to move a mountain, make a blind man see
Everybody's dancin', come on, let's go see

That made me happy 
In so many different ways 
Like sweet Conchita 
And Isabella 
Back in my traveling' days 

Then there was Georgia 
She was a country girl 
She could reap all I could sow 
Not like dear Judith 
So fond of music 
And Edgar Allan Poe 

But when I think of Angelina 
All the others fade away 
I can't recover 
I know I'll love her 
Now and forever 

I took my pleasure 
Where I found it 
And the ladies as they came 
Like Liz from Tucson 
And Claire from Rouen 
There were so many names 

When unexpected 
Just like a whirlwind 
Angelina stole my heart 
We did some walking 
And got to talking, 
And said we'd never part",A Salty Dog,2001

Una tarda sera partì da Torre a Mare
Doveva andare a Roma e dopo ritornare
Pensò di non partire o pure senza fretta
Di lasciare il treno a Barletta

Svelò il suo grande piano all'altro macchinista
Buono come lui ma meno utopista
Parlò delle città di genti emigrate
A Gorgonzola oppure a Vimercate

S'è sposata Rita e Rita s'è sposata",Al Compleanno Della Zia Rosina,1976
Rino Gaetano,"Cogli la mia rosa d'amore
Cogli la mia rosa d'amore
Regala il suo profumo alla gente

Cogli la mia rosa di niente
Cogli il suo figlio in Germania
La miniera il carbone a Natale verrà

Cogli i muri bianchi di calce
La festa del Santo il giorno del pianto
Cogli la mia sera d'Aprile

Scrivevo parole faceva all'amore
Lasciale almeno i ricordi
Le loro mani nel chiedere e amore nel dare

Cogli la mia rosa d'amore
Cogli la mia rosa d'amore
Regala il suo profumo alla gente

Cogli la mia rosa di niente
Cogli il suo giorno di festa
Quando l'estate promette di tutto

E quando chi mantiene un sorriso
Cogli questo suo paradiso",Cogli La Mia Rosa D'Amore,1976

C'è un attimo però l'aereo per Francoforte 
Non ho più preso il treno da quattro anni almeno 

Un marinaio del Pireo sulla faccia aveva un neo 
La moglie inglese Mary gli schiacciava I punti neri

C'è da una settimana una sonda americana",Glu Glu,1976
Rino Gaetano,"Le paludi, le rose, i caffè, l'amore, le cose
Le vetrine, i vestiti di raso e un nuovo motore
E Daniela stasera mi aspetta nell'ascensore

I quattrini, la speranza d'averne, far crepare d'invidia
Il lavoro è a casa, da lei la carriera sicura
Poi la sera ritornare se stessi, pensare, pensare
Ieri ho incontrato Rosita, perciò questa vita valore non ha
Come era bella Rosita, di bianco vestita, più bella che mai

Le paludi, le rose, i caffè, Gesù tra i bambini
Un bicchiere il fumo distorto e un nuovo motore
Con un altra farei chissà che, con Daniela l'amore

Ieri ho incontrato Rosita, perciò questa vita valore non ha
Come era bella Rosita di bianco vestita, più bella che mai
Ieri ho incontrato Rosita, perciò questa vita valore non ha
Come era bella Rosita di bianco vestita, più bella che mai
Ieri ho incontrato Rosita, perciò questa vita valore non ha
Come era bella Rosita di bianco vestita, più bella che mai",Rosita,1976
Rino Gaetano,"Lei sfogliava 
I suoi ricordi 
Le sue istantanee 
I suoi tabù 
Le sue madonne 
I suoi rosari 
E mille mari 
E alalà 

I suoi vestiti 
Di lino e seta 
Le calze a rete 
Marlene e Charlot 

E dopo giugno 
Il gran conflitto 
E poi l'Egitto 
E un'altra età 

Marce svastiche 
E federali 
Sotto i fanali 
L'oscurità 

E poi il ritorno 
In un paese diviso 
Più nero nel viso 
Più rosso d'amore 

Aida 
Come sei bella 

Aida 
Le tue battaglie 
I compromessi 
La povertà 
I salari bassi 
La fame bussa 
Il terrore russo 
Cristo e Stalin 

Aida 
La costituente 
La democrazia 
E chi ce l'ha 
E poi trent'anni 
Di safari 
Fra antilopi e giaguari 
Sciacalli e lapin 

Aida 
Come sei bella",Aida,1977
Rino Gaetano,"Chi mi dice ti amo
Chi mi dice ti amo
Ma togli il cane
Escluso il cane

Tutti gli altri son cattivi
Pressoché poco disponibili
Miscredenti e ortodossi
Di aforismi perduti nel nulla
Chi mi dice ti amo
Chi mi dice ti amo
Se togli il cane
Escluso il cane

Non rimane che gente assurda
Con le loro facili soluzioni
Nei loro occhi c'è un cannone
E un elisir di riflessione
E tu non torni qui da me
Perché non torni più da me
Chi mi dice ti amo
Chi mi dice ti amo
Ma togli il cane
Escluso il cane

Paranoia e dispersione
Inerzia grigia e films d'azione
Allestite anche le unioni
Dalle ditte di canzoni
E tu non torni qui da me
Perché non torni più da me",Escluso il Cane,1977
Rino Gaetano,"Fontana chiara
Un poco dolce, un poco amara",Fontana Chiara,1977
Rino Gaetano,"Il corredo ce l'hai gia pronto
Puoi girare il mondo a piedi o in tram
Ruba picchia usa il pugnale
Se no a che vale avere la tua età
Bevi vino e whisky and soda
Perché è moda perché va giù
Fuma al mattino appena sveglio
Non c'è di meglio non c'è di più
Okay papà

Spesso il salmone e il mantecato
Più è pagato più valore ha
La donna di strada è un fatto mitico
Se a prezzo politico ci puoi pure stà
Da una femmina innamorata
'na volta data non te fa beccà
Una bella divisa da maggiore
Ti dà valore e virilità
Okay papà

Il vero metro è la ferrovia
Che come la CIA te può insegnà
Che una differenza sostanziale e profonda
Fra prima e seconda ci deve stà
Okay papà",OK Papa,1977
Rino Gaetano,"Rare tracce di signori
Benpensanti e non creduti
Traffichini grossi e astuti
Ricchi forti e incensurati
Rare tracce di vita su Marte
Venere e Plutone

Rare tracce di un cannone
Che ha sparato ha ucciso
Ha fornicato

Rare tracce di peccato
Di sevizie di ricchezza
Rare tracce di tenerezza
In un mondo che si nasconde
Nella propria incolumità

Rare tracce di un passato
Che è passato e che ritorna
Lascia un segno e poi sparisce
Dove andrà? 
Ma dove andrà

Rare tracce di un treno
Che parte veloce e spedito
Rare tracce di un perito
Di finanza e di evasori

Rare tracce di buoni gestori
Nella nostra società, società
Ma io conosco le mie virtù
I miei difetti la mia volontà
Ed io riconosco che ci sei tu
E faccio tutto
Penso, scrivo, rubo, mangio
Per conoscerti di più

Rare tracce di gente
Che lavora, che produce
Quando chiede nulla scuce
A un sistema che non va

Rare tracce di fortune
Che si perdono alla sera
Da teppaglia ammanicata
Capace solo di
Opinare, ponderare, deliberare, prevedere
Escogitare, ideare, meditare, concepire
Elucubrare, congetturare, arbitrare, giudicare
Disserrare, spalancare, strombazzare, armeggiare
Appagare tracce rare
Di chi è capace di operare

Reagire, realizzar,e effettuare, avverare
Rispettare, esercitare, lavorare, addestrare
Assuefare, applicare, elaborare, manipolare
Arrischiare, rinunciare, smanovrare, ammansare
Smandrappare, detestare, adorare, esecrare 

Ma io conosco le mie virtù
I miei difetti, la mia volontà
Ed io riconosco che ci sei tu
E faccio tutto
Penso, scrivo, rubo, mangio
E faccio tutto
Penso, scrivo, rubo, mangio
E faccio tutto
Penso, scrivo, rubo, mangio
Per conoscerti di più",Rare Tracce,1977
