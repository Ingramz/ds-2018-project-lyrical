Common,"Yeah! Ha! Yeah, we got, come on
Why y'all cats know the abstract nigga with the attitude
Pass the booze, and let's build on it
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
I ain't even smoke no mo' but I feel blunted
Yo I'm toking on the freedom
Stepping to the A.M., cats be taking in the P.M.
Tell the players I'm the G.M.
Told my team let me get my plays straight, I'ma feed them
They need me like I need them
See the streets is bleeding
Had to meet with my mind on how I could divined
Stay on my climb
I'm grinding, 'til I get blue balls
Everyday, same shit new star
Don't make me act like where I come from because he grew tall
There's a place that to run from it if you neutral
Hustlers and vogues, customers and smokes
I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go into a thrift shop
Connect, get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gonna get that kick-a-box
Make sure that bitch knock
If you gonna get that glock don't be scared to big shot
Hip Hop is changing, why y'all want me to stay the same?
Sorta like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Hey yo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that
Messing with no other man's women
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell
With the fan and the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberland's
I want a Rover, but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switch over, I just made my own lane

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

Like a pimp to a hoe I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to the light
I'm trying to do better
I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight
I stay on point like trick dice
Tweaking like the sound man who need to switch mike
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice
When our children's children sit nice?
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees, I'm peaking
But I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey ball damn chimpanzees
Mobbing through the Chi-Town to feel the breeze yo

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high",I Got a Right Ta,2002
Common,"Everyone hides their face, sets behind a mask they wear
Jimi was a rock star searching for that magic place
That he could touch in the sky just to get his people high

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Jack)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Life is so, colorful reds, blues and dreams
Jimi lives in a purple haze, in a psychedelic maze
Playing the streets like and instrument
Pulling strings wherever he went
Angel sent from the sky just to get his people high

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Women all around
(Eh, da, da, da, da)
Fast cars and sound
(Eh, da, da, da, da)
And freedom he was bound
(Ehh, da, da, da, da)
Couldn't see the ground
(Eh, da, da, da, da)

Jimi come out why don't you set me free?
(Set me free)

So high born to fly
Getting high off his own supply
Everybody follows the same Lord
Using his light to guide the way 
Try things but few die so young
Something among Jimi was stung

Everyone hides their face
Sets behind a mask they wear

Jimi come out, why don't you set me free?
Jimi come out, why don't you set me free?
Jimi come out, why don't you set me free?",Jimi Was a Rock Star,2002
Common,"Yeah! The war zone. Who you fighting for?

[Verse 1: Common]
It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
They could get robbed and stop the luck (?)
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a,
Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered, you forgot the mission
Listen!

[Chorus: Laetitia Sadier]
All traces of life
In our gats we carry
That's used to dress humanity
(iIt's a New Wave, Come on!)

[In French]
All traces of life
In our gats we carry
That's used to dress humanity
(It's a New Wave, Dig it!)

[In French]
This life is precious
It's goddamn? marvelous
Before it ever ends
(Common: it's a New Wave, Come on!)

This life is precious
It's goddamn? marvelous
Before it ever ends
(Come on! Come on!)

[Verse 2: Common]
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
For the people to make or wait it's better
In a room called real I stay forever
Everyday I lose something I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some it's like umbrella
Where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green ""Let's Stay Together""
How could a nigga be so scared of change
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Y'all rich, we could beef curry in the game
Out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go bang
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of things

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Common]
From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks
Didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent on backyards, wishing in the air for a black god
Where people fix cars and clap hard
And look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
Smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
That master anger and ain't afraid to shoot
Through poured liquor fallen angels they salute (Whew! Whew!)
Feel the wind blow
A new wave people with their hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals
And tell them that they're pharaoh so let go
Come on!

[Chorus]",New Wave,2002
Common,"Yeah, for the world!
Keep going so you can(yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going

Nigga breath can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no mo' so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip its like the boom bip to tip(q)
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nites over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ
You the Ray J Of this rap world
I travel the globe with a black girl name Becky
Grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed the law can't arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt
Like Jesse Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See through trying to out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrew s you know how we do
And bleed through the needle with truth
That needs no preview to proof its in the people
And how they react still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack you had a dope track I guess opposites
attract my mind state is black
Black like bernie mack no cowards soul power in the words we rap

Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples
My guy buy ice I search for the dark crystal
Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols
I spit through gang wars and strange doors
Out the sky flames pour the beats claims war
I see niggaz with flags who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga that you started changing the laws for
Orator of hard-core and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
Than made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence then you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made dear mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth your a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the Bee-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClerken
Hit puss and listen to it whistle while I'm trerkin
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war your stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I been wanted to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge
Get your own you see its like home grown herb black economics
The people we serve with Soul Power",Soul Power,2002
Common,"Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on. That's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

[Chorus]
Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, our love must shine
Erotica, wish on star 69
Erotica, wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca, wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca

Wish on star 69, erotica

So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love-reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns
Where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (ahh), feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist
As I stare in your face
Your mouth half open
Your love I can taste
Embracin' you
Life, I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

[Chorus]

Slave to your loneliness
""Slave to your loneliness""
Inside of loneliness
""Inside this (alt we bear)""
With love of loneliness
""With thoughts of loneliness""
Enslaved by loneliness

I want you to come
Inside your mind
And find a place
Nasty and kind
This is where
Our desires grind
And where they peak
Is most divine
A place and time
I hope we reach together
You are my queen
And freak forever
I feel you in-side my stomach
My body shakes

Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speak
Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, I'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
I'm getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifth teens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives 
To purify the world 
Flying through the night 
So watch out here he comes 
Aquarius! 

[Common]
Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replenish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius

But my job was to hustle 'dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go
I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends
But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side
And I no longer like you
Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends""
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends""
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends""
My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends""

Deep as the ocean is the motion of life
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Not knowin' you was trife
Stiflin' a nigga's growth
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks
Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke
I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor
The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper
I look through the mirror and see my reflection
It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend
Return to my bitch and wine ways goin' wild like West and Kanye
Wherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddammit I'm grown
Broke broad I'm a leave your ass alone
You still wanna ride though

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade

Common,"Yeah, this is the truth
Common Sense, wit Tony Touch
It's the type of music we be
From Chicago to New York
I ain't move, I'm just movin' crowds baby
Yo yo check it
Supreme life, I seen light at the end of the path
Beginning wit math, stumbled, found a gym in a half
Cognac, pimps, Hennessey's resemble my dad
Went to, the School of Hard Knocks, it's hard to remember the staff
From the land of shit-talk

Point stars and pitch forks, this ain't a game, only a bitch barks
The streets is stayin hard, peoples tryin to out-think God
Tradin crack for link cards
Heavy, so I sleep hard and breathe eye accounts
In this paper marathon, meditatin to tapes of Farrakhan
And Seravon, sharin songs wit broads, I know they need it
It's like I'm Eldrige Cleaver wit my mind set on cleavage
Reachin for the heavens since the bliss fell from the elevated, I speak
Wit Technics like a 1200

Black males wanted, the sign of the times
Read: one for project prisons wanted dead
I sped to the light, my realness bled through the mic
Like Marvin, I'm willing to save the children givin lead to the night
It was written but untold
Some hold the scroll in the hearts, the truth is told in the arts
Like old school to park, my thoughts connect

No longer is it impeach the president or break to mic check
I circumcised the clouds, wit thoughts that raise your third eyebrow
'cause the sun is my child, bloaw
Yeah it's Com Sense, Tony Touch

Common,"Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly away

Yo, fly in it
Blue skies the limit, the skies infinite
It reflect in the eyes of those who try to send spies in it
Capture the sun if they could, but they go blind by it
Look in the sky and I see Africa's eyes in it
The land is dry like the cry infinite
The tears we shed grow to fruit til' the eye replenish
The industry wanna try to give my rhyme a sentence
Behind bars with my rhymes diminished, they tryna end us
But all them clowns do is give my mind a senate
To watch my people's enemy die in my presence
Fly away on the highest adventure out on the line
And enter the gate of Zion, need to decide who sent em'
I went through the jungle (Yeah)
Stalking like a black panther, rap's answer to that cancer
Choking the life out the hood

A little baby girl trying to make it through
Through this earth, wind, fire and water
That I'm someone's daughter, cadence of divine order
Sorta sent to let the people know their times spent
It's precious and we can't keep our minds bent
On just the pleasures of sex, drugs, wine, bread
In essence, we one with the environment
Though I've been here, less than a year
Being so close to God, I guess I haven't learned the fear
When I heard nature telling me, time to come home
Told my mind this is the path for you to walk, not to run on
Understand the night to reach a higher day
Follow yourself so you can fly away

Fly away y'all

You are feeling the stress
But in life you're truly blessed
Go for nothing less
Spread your wings and fly away

This villain came to me like 'somebody lookin' at you'

I could sense he was tryna' bring it, but I wasn't ready to receive it
Fact I make him leave it
Before he popped some shit I did the opposite and stole 'em
Back his lady tried to hold him, like Big Pun I scold 'em and told 'em
I ain't a shooter I just punch a lot
Between blows this big tried to up his glock
His brother watched swoop like big daddy on teenage love
He got ??? to my tape by see nigga Dub
Got his dome in a hug, muffed his broad back with one hand
Tried to pop, it must've been a ??? 'cause the gun jammed

Whatever's in your heart is where you want to be

Even when you look it's never what you see
My hood is the ghetto
I've been down before up is just a reach
Cause my hood is the ghetto
Catch a second wind then begin again
My hood is the ghetto

Black magic in the hood, it's tragic but understood
Crack addicts, crack windows, crack wood
Even what's bad becomes good, status becomes stood
Upon the pedestal welcome to the ghetto show
Federal buildings, pissy hallways filled with children pushing children
Fiends lips peeling, shit seems real and
What's real is the estate of mind that we're in
The situation feels great
My man peels weight, so he can fill plates
You might get love but you still feel hate
With gang shakes and chain clinks, we communicate
Chicago to Brooklyn nigga real ones do relate

If lyrics sold, then truth be told
I'd probably be just as rich and famous as Jay-Z
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like common sense
Next best thing I do a record with Common Sense
Cause it's the music, the blues, it's the jazz, it's acoustics
Soul, Rock and Roll, the hip-hop that we producin', yea
It's the gear, it's the flare, it's the stare
Nowadays they'll shoot you where they used to shoot the fair
Remember lost soldiers, pour a beer, shoot the air
We got our own elected officials, no matter who the mayor
I know you know what I'm talking about

Yo, I grew up where they're playin' skelly in the parking lot
And sell paintings of Aaliyah, B.I.G. and Pac up in the barbershop
Buildings too big so you don't really see the stars a lot
But rappin', drinkin', and goin' to prison you see them bars a lot
I feel the spirit in the dark and hear it in my heart
And always keep my ears to the block till I dearly depart
Hip-hop is really the art
We have to express the part of ourselves that make us want to martyr ourselves
It ain't harder to tell when somebody stick you up and put the hammer to you
They want them dead presidents like stic.man and Mutulu
With a gun to your jaw, these kids don't run anymore
Kicks is a hundred or more

A man in front of the store, beggin' for money and mercy
I told him say a prayer under his breath, he cursed me
Niggas is thirsty I heard it's a drought
Up early, servin' from their grandmother's house
Sometimes the ghetto feels desolate, the eyes of the hood yo is desperate
Affected by the deficit, times and lessons get hard
Either get by or get God, but you try to get by
It's like the block keep blockin'
You try to make moves, its like the car keep stoppin'
These shorties in the court, need Cochran yea
I tell them while the weed seeds poppin', in the game you need options
No time for feet watchin', me and Kwe keep rockin' for the ghetto

Plus double D you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubble E

Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus

Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis

His name Kweli (You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lying)
Yo Kwe', she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She goin' think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high

Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes but
Get 'em high, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fitting to blow you trying to blow backs out
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, hey yo
Ain't you meet that chick that got friends with yo moms
And she's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get ahead of it

Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
With real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote, control rap is out of
Used to but still got love, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you
You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mug is to sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
To many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
Album, how come, you the hot garbager
The years clear your image and looped up
Label got you suped up, telling you you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infa', red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spitting through wires and fires, emcees retiring

Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now (it might be too soon)
Too soon?

I want the boom in the back of the truck
Ain't nuttin' the matter with a good dude havin' a buck
With that on my mind, I'm on the grind, it pays
We break it down in these three ways, yo

These days, I travel the Maze like Frank Beverly
To the East, lookin' for pieces of a better me
Responsibility of my man's felony fell on me
Celebrity status, make 'em think I got celery

Hell and I do sometimes, still the sunshine ain't even all day
(Yeah) The life of a baller, ain't even all play
I stack 'em, so the chips fall where they must
I ain't far from a Benz, or dude on the bus

Even when I don't have enough, still in God I trust
Said baby you're a star
Said I'm on the car, seen the jiggiest of stars
Become dust, and one love become lust for the papers
Had you gassed now that - gas became vapors
Tricked your cash on ice; shoulda had acres
Now your, empire fell like the Lakers
So you're talkin' to your maker

It's the nature of the business, they givin' niggaz inches
Takin' miles and mules, it's the wildest rules
I'm tryin' to walk in the black scent of proudest shoes
Makin music that the crowds can use

[Chorus: ]
Yo how the days of your life go Dave? (With sunshine and shade)
That's it? (Tinted window grades and Kool-Aid)
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now (that might be too soon)
Too soon?

I want twenty-four plus on these
Put the Pinto engine and the bus on these
I get that first class seat to escape the days
We break it down in these three ways

Check the life I got that antidote, cantelope scent, bent back
In the sunroom froze, put your flick on pause (and pop a cork)
There's no occasion nigga it's just because
I'm celebratin' for a hell of a day

Get these barbie filets on hot charcoal tracks, so black
Darko Pecoltrane plays them back
We them freedom fight kids who gon' ball and raise fists
If y'all down for the struggle, c'mon y'all, resist

Everyday script, I exercise cheek
Sixteen on the bar, I exercise speak (ha)
It's been a long time, Long Isle's on the map
While y'all stand on the corner, stoned like Chris Back
Kiss back, watchin' time - wrist back
Every second count but just finish this lap
You gamble on your life like casino slots
And cash out and still walk with a knot

Yo how the days of your life goes Merce? (Man I'm just holdin' my head)
That's it? (Shit, I'm also tryin' to hold this bread)
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now (that might be too soon)
Too soon?

I furnished the rooms, and mortgage on these
See them quittin' ass rappers caused a shortage on these
The soul boys of big illa-noyz get the praise
We break it down in these three ways

My moms died from secondhand smoke; so I wish yo' ass would die
From them secondhand rhymes you wrote
Or shall I call them second rhymes - written seconds 'fore you enter the booth
Words thrown together with very little truth
And a select few can do it (true) you ain't part of them scriptures
And got the nerve to feel you want me out the picture
But I was never in it, I'm the frame around the flick
Or dishin' in the mouth of your dame around my dick

Ladies and gentlemen, introducin' Workmatic
One of L.I.'s finest, and this is (my life)
Which is filled with bad minutes and good hours
And, good months and bad years and with my peers
We struggle to juggle the shit
Family life and the music game don't easily fit

My lady wants me home, sayin' rap tour three rap whores
And scores of scandal, even more than we can handle
Sometimes, the rhymes I say
Is the fly the currency to save the day
Can't turn it away, cause we out
To find presence way beyond our measure, so baby don't pout

Don't pout, Common Sense'll turn it out
Don't pout..",Days of Our Lives,2004
Common,"I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be something for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't goin' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matching shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me

Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understanding and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me

Yeah, yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinking you fresh
Suggesting beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, as love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard trying to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't goin' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right, I'ma feed you
Ticka tah, ticka tah, ticka ticka tickah
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times, when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me

(I'll) take my chances, before they pass
Pass me by, oh darling,
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree",The Light [Album Version],2004
Common,"I wanna be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talkin' Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in her direction, in the right way
Told inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Chicago nights stay, stay on the mind
But I write many lives and lay on these lines
Wave the signs of the times
Many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wonderin' where I'm
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise
I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah, might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, Pops they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
When drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back or too far in front of me
The present is a gift, and I just wanna be",Be (Intro),2005
Common,"And you say Chi city, we don't stop naw we don't quit

I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me
Took it outta space and niggas thought they lost me
I'm back like a chiropract wit b-boy survival rap
This ain't '94 Joe we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'ma take over
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw hustlers getcha bakin' soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and their faith over
It's a war goin' on you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement listenin' to tapes of Ultramagnetic to the fact the Messiah's black
I turn the TV down we could take it higher than that
I wonder if these wack niggas realize they wack
And they the reason my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christian
Pushin' Cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city,
Come on

And you say Chi city, we don't stop naw we don't quit

A black figure, in the middle of chaos and gun fire
So many raps about rims, I'm surprised @#%$ ain't become tires
On the street you turn code and then go screech
I tell 'em fuck 'em, like I do the police
The beast in runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryna have sex that's tantric
But the getto, tryna make a get up stand up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich
I slap a nigga like you
And tell him Rick James bitch
Witcha Hollywood stories on porches
We poli hood stories on who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com has never been involved in Run
Unless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm hotta than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip hop is goin', a Chicagoan
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'
It's the city, the city y'all, the city, the city y'all
Come on

And you say Chi city, we don't stop naw we don't quit",Chi-City,2005
Common,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love

What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die

Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today

And my baby momma late (uh oh, uh oh, uh oh)
So I had to did what I had to did
Cause I had to give (dough, dough, dough)
I'm up all night gettin' my money right
Until the blue and whites (popo, popo, popo)
Now the money coming slow, but at least a nigga know
Slow motion better than (no-oh, no-oh, no-oh)

You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers from the city of wind
Like juice and gin in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the spreewells
And trucks that's detailed,
Heartless females that want to ride in 'em
Felt the southside in them with raw hides and denim
Bent minds collide with them
A system that tries victims, we livin' in
My man in the fast lane pivotin'
On the block white is sellin' like m & m
On the block get jump off like Kim 'n 'em
On the block is how you can feel it in your skin
Shorties get the game with no instructions of asemblin'
Odds right it seems like the fight is dim in him
Call my man cousin like I'm kin to him

Fullbacks and tims, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts
Attires are ball shorts
We never fall short
With us it's all force like air ones
Some wave some air guns
The day of the fair ones it's over fo'
Cats is colder than four below, wha'sup?
I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I gotta bring back to the ghetto
Aeros or Tarot cards pointin' to the grind
Po' livin' and mo' prisons pointin' to my mind
Shine the light up!
Clench my fists tight and holdin' it right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, the jaws get tighter
My man trying to get his way to higher

A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Tripping on heights, wishing for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy,shown by the caddies
Uncles named Larry, that really never grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch through the bay bay
With waists so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day

Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gang bang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good working with my hands
My generation never understood working for the man

We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl selling her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, looking in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growing up she got to know hurt
very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was ike, so her mother he striked
she got to like like minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doing white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack

I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messing with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just going check myself in, again

They say what's happenin'?
We say the facts and if, they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say, but they don't know!

They don't know

They say ""dude think he righteous""
I write just to free minds, from stoney to rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or isis
They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard
Writing for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say ""sef kept the hood together""
I tell the young, ""we can't play the hood forever""
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was mr. f
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim ""king"" like don, or frank white
They say my life is comparable to christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say ""the crochet pants and the sweater was wack""
Seen ""the corner"", now they say ""that nigga's back,"" uh

New breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in her direction

Told inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Chicago nights stay, stay on the mind
But I write many lives and lay on these lines
Wave the signs of the times
Many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise
I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize that I'm gonna learn through her
The Messiah, might even return through her
If I'm gonna do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, pops they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
When drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun

It ain't ninety-fo', yo, we can't go back

The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'ma takeover
Tell these halftime niggaz, ""Break's over""
I'm raw, hustlas get your baking soda

Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and they faith over
It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement, listening to tapes of Ultra-Magnetic
To the fact the messiah is black

I'll turn the TV down, we can take it higher than that
I wonder if these whack niggaz realize they whack
And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap

Inspired by black Muslims and Christians
Pushin' cutlasses, dope and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city

I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric
For the ghetto, tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem
You spit hot garbage, son of Sanford
What you rappin' for, to get fame or get rich?

I slap a nigga like you, and tell him, ""Rick James bitch""
With your Hollywood stories on porches
We polly hood stories about who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch

You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com' has never been involved wit' run

Unless its DMC, or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary
Hopin' God's inside you, God is Halle Barry

[Verse 1]
Night Blows, Stoves don't work, Hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Tripping on heights, wishing for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy,shown by the caddies
Uncles named Larry, that really never grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggaz named Butch through the bay bay
With waists so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was Jay Jay
A skinny nigga, young girls with penny figures
So many niggaz, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good working with my hands
My generation never understood working for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot, as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

[Chorus Repeated Overlapping:]
""It's your world""

[Common] Yeah

[Verse 2]
Life and death law around us
Four pounds and pounds a verb from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl selling her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, looking in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggaz she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growing up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was ike, so her mother he striked
She got to like like minded niggaz, who liked crimes and figures
Doing white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jefferson's y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rooting for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Lovin' you is lovin' me

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Lovin' you is lovin' me

Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep 'cause on the real he had five kids

Live nig's, real niggaz express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showin' love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport

As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within

At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end, yo

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Lovin' you is lovin' me

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Lovin' you is lovin' me

It's all love where we come from
In the hood, love, we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hopin' it would come one

Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love, many hide, some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of actin' in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze

Tryin' to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?

Everybody loves [Incomrehensible] do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man, uh

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Lovin' you is lovin' me

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Lovin' you is lovin' me

Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion, we all in it

Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimage
Reminiscin' on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always, yeah

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Lovin' you is lovin' me

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Lovin' you is lovin' me

Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to
Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose
To cope with they lows the wind is cold & it blows
In they socks & they souls holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened & closed hoping for more
With nowhere to go rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they ain't knowing they goal
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing he code
By the fours I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes & roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a ""Olds"" with windows that don't roll

I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying

The corner was our time when times stood still
And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink
And colored blue profiles glorifying that

Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nikes they head & they feet right

Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where sheeplike
Rappers & hoopers we strive to be like
G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light
Cheese & weaves tight needs & thieves strike
The corner where struggle & greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's and I heard that she bites
The corner

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dancers and
War cries that broke out on different corners
Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its
Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist
The dirt isn't just fertile its people working & earning this
The curb-getters go where the cash flow & the current is
It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is
Where the money move & the determined live
We talk play lotto & buy german beers

Fine like the earth and the sea and the sky
Together we make stars we are truly fly
I wanna paint him take a picture of his soul
His story should be told

See he's like everything I dreamed of
But better than the preview
Now everything he working on
Has got me saying me too

Like he food that I need, blood 'cause he bleed
He real 'cause I see, it's all meant to be
Remember how to make believe
Yo these brothers are your enemy

Without your heart you'll never be

Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine I ain't trying, to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you

So tell the people like that y'all
And it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We bout to take it to the top

I was speaking, to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion
Using no protection, told H.E.R. on Resurrection
Caught up in the Hype Williams, and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H.E.R
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The Police
In H.E.R. I found peace
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, tricking off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty
Most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn
She started showing early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testing me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, making the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel
Like that y'all, hip-hop

It's like, word up, and it sounds nice

Rubber band together in cashless bundles

Common,"Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals
The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and profiles

Street lights and deep nights, cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It’s hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It’s steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong ‘cause it’s hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn’t just fertile, it’s people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It’s so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money moving, the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It’s so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?

Our Taj Mahal, our monument

Everybody's searching for somethin'
But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'
Back home
Ain't nobody hoping and praying
'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that
Life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
'Cause ain't a damn thing free
Back home

Back home they holler ""disciple"" and ""blackstone""
Some black they freebase yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies, and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it
In many ways this city raised me and gave me
The drama, honor, and bravery
The streets seem hollow when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow
Times hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow I borrow words from the
Bible and use them for survival gangs rival
Signs painted on the walls like hieroglyphics
I tell 'em that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt shorty's goin' through the same cycle
And trials like Michael tryin' not to stay idle

Back home it's not Compton but close
The same problems exist and the pain throbbin'
And folks are so common
It don't really bother us much we just swallow it uh
Crack the bottle and smoke hope tomorrow something
Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home we get the good life at glimpse
In the form of a rap start, drug dealers, and pimps
I'm back home

Back home I try my best to keep it together it's cold
Like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth looking for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source need something to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life
Only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight bringing truth back to the game

Back home we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on something 'cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop bottom line doing what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people calling us hopeless
People trying to tell us all we need is some focus
But focus
Focus is overrated
Cause you see very blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado K-Town and J-Town
Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver living right in the litter
Where kids write nigga right inside the L.A River
On the concrete a symbol of out everyday way
It's that color and concentration over heavy gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay",Back Home,2005

Oh baby, your love's crazy
'Cause you havin' my baby
(And there's so much more to love)

Take a look at my lady and my day began to shine
Told her, ""Baby being beautiful is a state of mind and you are so
Had to let your mind and your heart know
As you grow, the more, the more I see God glow""

I know it's probably strange, seeing your body change
Can't fit your clothes, nose ain't the same
But love still remains, it won't vary with me
Look at you and smile, thinkin' damn she carry a me

A life we created, we can cherish forever
You growin', but it's sexy, the sex is even better
But through thick and thin, pickles and peanut butter
Is a divine mother, queen and supreme lover, you still got it

I know that you still got it
(Baby I know you still got it)
Don't you know that you still got it?
(No matter what happens baby, oh baby)

You still got it
(Baby you still)
Don't you know that you still got it?
(Baby you still the one for me)
Don't you know that you still got it?
Don't you know that you still got it?

Common,"Yo  we gotta start respecting life more y'all 
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself 
Gotta see the God within him 
Brothers getting changed real quick over nothing 
We losing too many of ours 
Gotta recreate y'all 

Yo  check it,
Knowing you the best part of life  do I have the right to take yours 
Cause I created you  irresponsibly 
Subconsciously knowing the act I was a part of 
The start of something, I'm not ready to bring into the world 
Had myself believing I was sterile 
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl 
Turning this woman's womb into a tomb 
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need 
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed 
But someone, I would of fed this information I read 
to someone, my life for you I would of had to leave 
Instead I lead you to death 
I'm sorry for taking your first breath, first step, and first cry 
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially 
Having a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me 
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family 
I don't want to, go through the drama of having a baby's momma 
Weekend visits and buying J's ain't gon' make me a father 
For a while bearing a child is something I never wanted to do 
For me to live forever I can only do that through you 
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun 
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son 
I could have sacrificed going out 
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on 
I'ma use self control instead of birth control 
Cause $315 ain't worth your soul 
$315 ain't worth your soul 
$315 ain't worth it

I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer 
You said you would be here when it rained 

[Common] Yo 
Why didn't you stay 
Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself 
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt 
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are 
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination 
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation 
Back and forth my feelings was pacing 
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it 
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it 
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust 
Busting, more than the sweat in somebody you trust 
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough 
And believe, having this child'll make us have to stay together 
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better 
Thinking we all in love cause we can spend a day together 
We talking spending the rest of our lives 
It's too many black women that can say they mothers 
but can't say that they wives 
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding 
But I want our Parenthood to come from Planning 
It's so much in my life that's undone 
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one 
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from 
But I'm walking, finding myself in my God 
So I can, discipline my son with my writing 
Not have a judge telling me how and when to raise my seed 
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame 
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed 
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy 
So quit smoking the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy 

[Lauryn Hill] 
I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer 
You said you would be here when it rained 
You said you would be here when it rained 
Oh I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer 
Now the situation's made things change 
Things change 
Why, didn't you stay 
Why didn't you stay
I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer 
In summer 
You said you would be here when, it rained 
When it rained, it rained 
Oh I, never dreamed, you'd leave in summer 
You said you wouldn't leave 
Now the situation's made things change 
Things change, why didn't you stay?

Common,"Memories on corners with the fours & the moors [pronounced foes and moes]
Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to
Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose
To cope with they lows the wind is cold & it blows
In they socks & they souls holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened & closed hoping for more
With nowhere to go rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they ain't knowing they goal
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing he code
By the fours I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes & roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a ""Olds"" with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broke in & stole
These are the stories told by Stony & Cottage Grove
The world is cold the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

[Chorus]
I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

We underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when times stood still
And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink
And colored blue profiles glorifying that

Streetlights & deepnights cats trying to eat right
Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nikes they head & they feet right
Desires of streetlife cars & weed types
It's hard to breath nights days are thief like
The beast roam the streets the police is Greeklike
Game at it's peak we speak & believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where sheeplike
Rappers & hoopers we strive to be like
G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light
Cheese & weaves tight needs & thieves strike
The corner where struggle & greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's and I heard that she bites
The corner

[Chorus]

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dancers and
War cries that broke out on different corners
Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its
Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist
The dirt isn't just fertile its people working & earning this
The curb-getters go where the cash flow & the current is
It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is
Where the money move & the determined live
We talk play lotto & buy german beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument,
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace and to love

Spend so much on outfits she's about to get evicted

She was the type to watch Oprah and The Today Show
Be on the treadmill, like OK Go
Had the body that you can't pay for
That means she had some D's on her, but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive, a Drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spent class at the gym, striptease on the pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, trying hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp, but extra hard for these hoes
Reading US or People mag, trying to get these scoops
Chasing an actor for a Bentley Coupe
She recruit a ball player from the Clippers
Then came the pumps off
Thinking she Number One, when she just a jump off
Doing all she can for a man and a baby
Driving herself crazy
like the astronaut lady

He had paper since we was in, we was in High School
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ear he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types, the Dame Dash dudes
Pushed the Maserati Sport, reading the ROB Report
Wanted to be Mike, but he was never live in sports
Since golf was in, he was in the driving course
To live the rap life is what he was striving for
Spending cash at the bar to get credit
Drinking Chandon just because BIG said
They say Ye is, but dude big-headed
Rocked the fur in the summer, so, somebody'll pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his myspace page, half naked
It's a shame what they do for fame, and to be respected

Losing yourself and your lying and stuff

Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours, caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises, street life is pumpin' fast, lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it

Living once again, we live, then you're gone

Ashes and snowfalls
I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I never gon' run
Sooner then later, I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip, I watch the fat lady
Sing a song, on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong

Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone, hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight

He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black, maybe

We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from, from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged, you get laughed at, you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us, black maybe

Make cuts and got gashes, scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab pits to rappers

It's too many slashes in their name
Came in the game, these gun-clappers
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen them dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run
While I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlers
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game.

From the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beamers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
Good bring business to the hood like heralds
Five year olds walking by themselves in the street
The young die of cancer
I stop eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th street like peace
Even though it's war to G, got em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and his compliance with beats
My radio station is deep, so F em

When I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seem so long

Where did the king go wrong?

I need your warm
The taste of your mouth

Someday's I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over u, my god
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it remind me of you
Take a look at the moon it remind me of you
Hope the stars and the gods 
Align me and you

If I don't express it then forever I'll hold, inside 
I'm from a side where we out of control, 
Rap music in the 'hood played a fatherly role, 
My story's like yours, yo it gotta be told, 
Tryin' to make it from a gangsta to a godlier role, 
Read scrolls and stow slaves, 
And Jewish people in cold cage, 
Hate has no color or age, flip the page, 
Now my rage became freedom, 
Writin' dreams in the dark, they far but I can see 'em, 
I believe in Heaven more than Hell, 
Blessings more than jail, 
In the ghetto let love prevail, 
With a story to tell, my eyes see the glory and well, 
The world waitin' for me to yell ""I Have a Dream""

Should have been Kahlua or ice cream
My pipe dream's long as the fight scenes in The Matrix
Scorpio rising, sex fiend by nature
Try to control that shit so my soul don't get
Dirty for some girly, unworthy of the flowers
I admit that I got strange powers
Brain showers

Hold the bible and a rifle

If you keep keepin' it fresh
It ain't gonna go bad
I been through the valley of love
Rolled the shores of Cali
Just to find peace of mind
Lookin' to the sky
Askin' for at least a sign
Beautiful, you came at such a decent time
When we combine
It's like good food and wine
Flavorful yet refined
You remind me of the divine
So easy
Love can be lost and then found, like Stevie
I just love havin' you around

I'm wearin' a crown

But ain't no haps your dick isn't there 

You're thinking that, ""Oops, I made a mistake"" 
You say, ""Fuck Nell Carter, come on Jimmy, give me a break"" 
You made a mistake on the first take 
Trying to break a leg for take two 
You should of ate your Wheaties 
and Petey might of made a breakthrough 

You say to hope that things might bloom, so you assume position 
Wishing he would listen, so you start to kissing 
It's alive, and up goes, and up goes you're adrenaline 
You aimed, you fired, there you go, limp figures

Damn this never happened before, yeah sure that's what they all say 
Uh-oh you better get Maaco kid, cause old girl is saucy 

What was sweet to eat, has now dried up and rotted 
It's a pile of pew, pick up your glove and say, ""Yo I got it!""

Walking up and then down the strip 
Looking for some hip so I can skip 
I spotted this honey dip, and her friend tried to sell me a script 
That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the old Gus 
So I'm getting a bus, as I thrill at the disgust 

Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this 
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business 
Dipping from a distance, in an instance I got the digits 
and blew a kiss to her 
That old stank hoe, was mad I didn't speak to her 

I hooked up with the one that looked nice 
Took her mind, like an ice!
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice 
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill 
They told her to keep that booty still 
I been through more hoes than the pill 

Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete  
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (break) 
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was getting knocked 
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop 
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell 

Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail 
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat 
Like a belt, everything was strapped 
'Til my homey asked, ""What's up with that?"" 
The that was like dis G, I told him I got busy 
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy 

That was foul, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end 
The little wreck on that they locked the door and I can't get in

After bein' 25  you know  just trying to survive in the world 
Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows? 
Anyway  just when you start getting that little age and experience to you 
You start thinking about stuff, trying to make the right moves 
So bust it out  this is what I was thinking  check it 

Yo  the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn 
Began, began with time 
Being my bloodline is one with the divine 
In time brother, you will discover the light 
Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White 
Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right 
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear 
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear 
As a child, given religion with no answer to why 
Just told believe in Jesus 'cause for me he did die 
Curiosity killed the catechism 
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to 
And became a slave to master self 
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health 
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons 
Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital 
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys 
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief 
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em 
And use religion as an emblem 
When it should be a natural way of life 
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right 
That's who got you doing right and got you this far 
Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or Hum do Allah 
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you 
You let that show towards others in the things you do 
'cause when the trumpets blowing, 24 elders surround the throne

Only 144,000 goin' get home 
Only 144,000 goin' get it baby

I have taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I've cried 
I have failed and I have tried 
Sunshine, pouring rain 
Found joy through all my pain 
I just want to be happy with being me 

[Cee-Lo]
Let me voice my concern 
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title 
That their actions didn't earn 
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence 
Subconsciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince 
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place 
Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know 
Who you are in the first place 
So I try to find the clue in you 
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do 
Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden 
Damn, somethin' in me want to know who I am 
So I began my search, my journey started in church 
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief 
Hustling was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets 
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with 
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school 
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only 
Science and math are universal 
Taking elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran 
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites 
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White 
Some leads were granted with insight 
And it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to over stand 
He still created with the imperfection of man 
So, with followin' I disagree 
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but 
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind 
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas 
You goin' surely find there's no positivity without negativity 
But one side you gonna have to choose 
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse 
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession 
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and 
Can't follow your lesson 
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own 

Well, I've lived and I've learned 
I've taken and I've earned 
I have laughed, I have cried 
I failed and I have tried

Just want to be happy, being me

87th Street and Hyde Park was warring 
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pouring 
Suited in three-quarter Jordan's, pro-models 
And started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas 
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD 
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke 
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny 
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji 
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew 
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to 
Traveling like Vice Lords, down to the taste

Six deep in the Hyundai bumping Twilight Tone tapes 
Come home late calling broads hang up on they mother 
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other 
Get a room at the Dunes having bakeouts 
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out

Girbauds and Guess jeans we was taking in

It certain things about this I ain't figure yet

Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need

Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was sticking

Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is

An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin, more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin spendin the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers
but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our Parenthood to come from Planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin, findin myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my writin
Not have a judge tellin me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of Afrikan names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy

To my Gods held in court

I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, with Hieroglyphics spelled in chalk

Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to
Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose
To cope with they lows the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they souls holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed hoping for more
With nowhere to go rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they ain't knowing they goal
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing he code
By the fours I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors

Now I roll in a ""Olds"" with windows that don't roll

I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

We underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when times stood still
And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink
And colored blue profiles glorifying that

Streetlights and deep nights cats trying to eat right
Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's they head and they feet right
Desires of streetlife cars and weed types
It's hard to breath nights days are thief like
The beast roam the streets the police is Greeklike
Game at it's peak we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where sheeplike
Rappers and hoopers we strive to be like
G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light
Cheese and weaves tight needs and thieves strike
The corner where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's and I heard that she bites
The corner

I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling

The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dancers and
War cries that broke out on different corners
Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful

Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its
Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist
The dirt isn't just fertile its people working and earning this
The curb-getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is
Where the money move and the determined live
We talk play lotto and buy German beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative

I heard the boy he said OOH OH
The party people he said OOH OH
Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo
Check it, check it
Driftin' on a memory, brought forth
from a fifth of Hennesey, as in times
of eighty-nine they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggaz be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin' over if he said, ""Dumb bitch""
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
After parties in Wendy's parkin' lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin' off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

[Chorus]
It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh
It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh

Check it
Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
and start thinkin' they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
Saved my day, dancin' on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pourin'
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
and started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny

It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the taste
Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
at em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

[Chorus]

There go the break
To get the break go, it go OOH OH
Yeah, it go OOH OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it
Nowadays niggaz is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin' to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
remindin' me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes

Come home late callin' broads hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes havin' bakeouts
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out
Then everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' in
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin' in
Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T.
Rememberin' numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still

Common,"I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods
Thinking whats good, things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavours they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Th-th-the way that I rhyme, blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down
I should've knew it, Shock G and Pac told me ""She get around"", an angel

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin, ""Didilly whoooa!""
I got love for the streets, peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (Angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car, and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track

I wanna turn up the sound and spread
my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene, L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme
Yeah, keep on

There's no survival for the weak

I never knew a luh, luh luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it

Signed, sealed, delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault 'em 'cause I probably did it too

Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work

I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yo, yo, check it

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you

Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold star night's moon, you my light

If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call

So I pray everyday more than anything friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yeah, yo, yo, check it

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin' you fresh
Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to

At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence

The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you

As my reflection in light I'm a lead you
And whatever's right, I'm a feed you
Digga da, digga da, digga da, digga digga da da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you

Are you alone? Is your shorty asleep?
Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak

Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love

Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?
Erotica, oh yes, with love I shine
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica, wish on star *69
Erotica, wish on star *69, Erotica

So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?

Our love reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns, where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we ah, feel the most high in it

I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me, our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste

Embracin' you, life, I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

Erotica, wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica, can I come in your mind?

Enslaved by loneliness

I want you to come inside your mind
And find a place nasty and kind
This is where our desires grind
And where they peak Is most divine

A place and time, I hope we reach together
You are my queen and freak forever
I feel you inside my stomach
My body shakes

Wet dreams are on my mind, Erotica
Can I come in your mind? Erotica
Oh yes, with love I shine, Erotica

Ain't been exposed to the foes of most disciples

To say what I feel, get it off my burnt chest, my word becomes flesh
War going on between the West and the East
Of the land niggaz don't own a piece

Grease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me
My lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie
Throw your hands in the air if you the true and living
Beware the new world order, the Devil's new religion
Sent my homey to the number two division

Sellin' bootleg movies, got my VCR on a evasive maneuver
Be that as I chooses, drinkin' tropical
It's just sittin' at a table with sophisticated bitches
Nah, that ain't nothin', I would call my mother
Nor do I call every nigga, my brother
Gotta have Black Thought, it's sorta be like Malik
So don't Question a Brother to the Roots, I get deep

Your scholarship into the world of politics and mascara
We operate within this artificial opera
I bring hip hop terror like the Fuhrer, the Ace Ventura into the horror
Laboratory laborer, venture beyond the border
I'll structure a style, destroy your whole aura
Plus you're adrenalin'll rise before your eyes and mortalize
My image hit the skies, deceive the Devil in disguise
My music, I parenthesize, represent the wise

Here comes the hot package, through your block like traffic
The rock was typed graphic, now watch the mic blast it

Shootin' at the stars with emphatic rap static
See the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm bustin' back at it
The Lieutenant, the elephant, sippin' automatic
Mic, rippin' Asiatic, architects out to have it
The turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary
Exaggerated, niggaz is livin' highly medicated

I used to love but now she violated
Hip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated
They outdated and incarcerated
Loved and appreciated, hated and very debated
For every career created was eliminated
And that's the way the balance of yin and yang related

Get out the city for a sec, be at the places I be

Hey, I'ma be back on the deck
Opening business in places for you to cash your check
My neck of the woods ain't all good, ain't all bad
You can live in the burbs and still get had

The sad part about it, niggaz had houses on the lake
They tryin' to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate
For peace we skate, crackers we roll or player hate
Call each other 'cause, 'cause of how we relate
I see way too many Cadillacs with dope man plates
Through the wind and blow ups is how niggaz communicate

To the woods,to the birds, to the mud,
To the bricks over the curves, 
To the forced bizarre got with 4 acres 
And force with words,
Planted chrome for the young seeds to know, trees is blowing
We see change in the wind
This is new day and I gotta take it in, see a black man hero
We need him to win
Young eyes search search for a better tomorrow,
Let the belief lead the way and the angles halo,
Open doors for a hope for to go through,
Cause I would chose see and I'm supposed to.

I know that change come come
The race begun, we're almost there oh yeah

I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child, I always smile,
Let my mind float like child.
Wishing I was smart as these kids are now,
All grown ups still wishing I'm a child again.
Church saw remind me to stay grateful,a more ? remind me to stay playful,
Day's go by,my life all high
I leave all my walks so the fight don't die,and me
I found the purpose why I'm MC
Inspire a young world to be greated than me.
I fall awake and a dream a song,
So the little shorty's could sing along.

Welcome children, welcome me
Your sentimences felt in me,
I see the future and the walk your path,don't let these fools take you off your path.
Laugh if you need to,smile if you need to,
Life is a trip while a long and proceed to,
Try to believe to, do what you wanna do, remember you kings and queens are still humble to,
Life is a bitch now need to look back again,
Victory can be claim while you still battling,
Drive along with the food I provided you,
To awaking the boy's that is inside you.

Change is avreble,you can't stop it, changes happening and

And though it tastes like for ever it may not stay long?
Everywhere it's summer [repeat 4X]

A shaman since before my birth
And I came down to rock the earth
My mission condition:
I give you, you listen
I'm syncing in time in parallel
In binary, no third return
I'm planning intention
With love the redemption

No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop
We gon' do this thang till the sky just drop
Lock into you mind away we rock
In a rocket is the eighty seventh astronaut
Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole
At the moment they were sayin'
It was outta control
Strap into your mind
Why eyes see some recline
You'll see in time your season to shine
When the stadium is dark
MC's are defined
Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line
The race is on, to space beyond
You gon' get there by doin' what you want
Sometimes the most famous feel all alone
So we trip to a place that we call our home

They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained
So all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait til intermission, run buy your camera
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium

[Verse 1]
I was told by a wise old to come from the heart
Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark
The dark knight to spark mics, and start fights
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice
It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared
A beast amongst boys like Paul I'm revered...
Well,
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale
Still touched down cause I was off Artell
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail
Took the underground rail to the NFL
I rebel, NYSL
Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandela

[Chorus]

My words is the sword, my skill is the shield
My life is the style I stay dressed to kill
A legend like Will Smith with the steel
I could save the world when shit get for real
Skinny George Foreman, all in your grill
My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel
Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel
The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will
My drive... Is how I stay the livest
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids
You easy to take out cause you hot garbage
I'm amped like wattage, the truth nigga honest
Any moment opponents drop out like college
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust
Stadium hands in the air fists balled up

Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt
Scars over bars, symbols of the work
Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Some of you model bitches is so overrated
Don't mean to underrate it but damn it I made it
In the water I waded on the corner I painted
Draw blood like we related
MC's get de-decapitated
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick
Then light shit up like a dread with the herbs
Get sex in the city and head in the burbs
These are the words of a radical
The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud
To be the gladiator

Put down your bags love I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard in you but I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it though this love may hurt a bit
We dealin' wit this water love you even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you the pimp in me may have to die with you

Come close to me baby

You help me to discovery me I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me the aftermath is you touchin' me
It's destiny to we connected girl you and I we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane I want you to have my last name

We on a new tip, good music
We see the pen and the paper, we gonna use it
It takes a late night, to get them bright lights
We keep writing them songs, to live that good life
I do it for you, I do it for me
We break it down, Colbie, tell them the story

Listen can you hear me
Am I coming in on your frequency
I got a story
Subject of the plot, you and me
And when you're sleeping, and when you're waking
And when you're feeling good
I'll be the thing that, you want to sing back
Stuck in your head like I knew you would

I wanna be your favorite song

Something supreme

Love is the key, and it's made your life see
Common and Colbie, I'm dusting off the old me
Like the OLB we call 'em oldies
In your melodies, I'm hearing things you never told me

We stay in tune with each other,
In our room we'll discover new ways to do covers,
No matter how they dub us
We should stay true to the trust
And the winner of the best duo is us

Common,"I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

These are the words of a believer
Achiever, leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle
Walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and it's process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I can rest both mothers
And told ‘em, who’s in control is the one thats above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It’s tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us?
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven’t taught them?
Is it what we talking we really ain't walking?
Dudes, hustlers pay, how much did it cost ‘em?
Find myself on the same corner that we lost ‘em
Real talking, in they ear like a walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them, I see my baby girl
Believe!

I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

The lord lives among us
The young uns hunger become a means to get it
By any ways necessary, under pressure
Children feeling lesser, with the steel up on the dresser
Killin' will aggressors, destiny’s children
Survivors, soldiers, in front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning, shawty’s know to keep learning
Lesson’s in our life, but life stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street kids spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest
That seems beyond us, even through the unseen
I know that God watches
From one King's dream, he was able to Barack us
The prophets, nothing can stop us
Believe!

I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us",The Believer,2011
Common,"We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her, it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you, I admit I had issues
Like ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust from the cloth

Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh
La la la la, la la la la

This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love, but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take it's course
Because what's inside of us, no need to outsource
The cloth

Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh

Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights, tight never smother
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together

Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate the (?), they hate because we got love
It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lie than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening Rose for (?)
I'm a dreamer

It's for the world world world world world
Dream on

We take, uh, we make, uh, paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water, building my faith up
Niggas with no heart, I'm the pace maker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them
Career ain't random, make anthems, streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing, with (?) and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common, I'm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
To rock the planet, I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless hip-hop romantic

He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records, and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
To the dreamers

If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be no where near
You should just come here

Only difference is
You can live the dream

Common,"So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my soul

Ashtrays and cigarretes, last days, indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born, three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women
I was in France, in to see Hennessy blending
Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic, victorious, story is redemption

I'm sitting at the top, I'm not alone
I'm standing here with my soul

Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 5-0, but my creed's Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came, I made the song cry for 'em
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is the Kilimandjaro, like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival
Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido
Crash parties, any live yo
Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
From the pride we'll reign, kill the game and watch it die slow

A wise mister said love is gunna get ya
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, Y'all eat with us
It was hard for me to take down the benches
I was tripping, I even called her sister
I could be someone you could talk to, each and every day
But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had, some say it comes from not seeing my dad, keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I needa crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest

All, each and every one, the souls of one God
Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn
The blessing of transcending, time-traveling throughout the universe

She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she Sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok sometimes from commitment, we do them

She loves glamor bought Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette
My man is half hood half class
Photographers cameras caught us out there
The spotlight, I hope she can handle
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Event having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms

The life of girls and gold is so contagious

Took the C,O, double M road
Hangin' out the windows
Reachin for the world as the wind blows
The crescendo of my career loud in your ear, ear

Holding bottles, never bottled in
Probably with Chicagoans

Found forever in ways that are legendary

I'd be getting some Heinekens and stuff, and then uh, they'd go to Chocolate City, to the strip club.

Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse, they wasn't for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news

Common,"Gluttony baby
Is I needs what I see
Gluttony baby
Is us, aside to seat two

It’s knocking
Man, they gon, they gon, man they gon knock this one
Ride out to this

It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh y’all don’t need the address
It was ‘round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler’s insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that I’ll end up in a grave
It’s the arrogant they saying us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, then cane or khan, it’s called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
I seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath, y’all do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOB
They say use them rocks to make em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets it’s a felony
When niggas fucking with you commit fidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga you could have made it
Let me stay with that part, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that’s what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain’t no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth, it only happens when we eat
It’s gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It’s a dude that’s getting paid in full, causing jewels
Always played his four, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon want your food
Don’t overdo it, that’s an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix that’s in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustling, one of em ended up busting the other
Greed is a mother, it’s greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we living
The good thing is we can be forgiven

Between peace and prosperity, so marry me diamond

Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I’m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway”
Had a crush on what’s her name, the feelings never fade away

Said you can’t take his chain away
Real play you can’t take his game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller

Seeing a bigger picture, but now from different angles
Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game
Felt I had to leave home to be a household name
Show money low, needin' to stack fast
City did have my back, now it's a backlash
Was I a slave to the cash and wanting it so bad?
I just became a dad, rap was all I had
So I moved to New York, to make it pop
Did ""Like Water for Choc"", that album changed a lot
But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it
And his presence I didn't even acknowledge it
Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song

I still remember the first beat he played me
He came to the Chi late three that was crazy
Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free
I got the the D, ""peace yo, big love""
Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club
Then we made ""The Light"" and times got brighter
I said ""turn it up"" J'll take it higher
One day, I noticed he was tired quick
That's when I found out, JD was real sick
Things got worse before they got better
I said, ""come to L.A for peace and good weather""
We got an apartment just so we could spark it
MP in the front room, records in the closet
The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there
I'm wishin', I could wheel him out of his wheelchair
It was hard for me to come home every day
And see my homie J's life fade away
I stayed away some times, in other words I ran
Til one day J brought me this TV stand
It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it
It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it
The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth
I wanted him to have a grammy before he left this earth

You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur
Yea I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh
I come from the other, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga
Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor
The rich get richer, my dick get bigger
Cause I’mma go hard, g-go g-go hard
The more I know self, the more I know God
Coppin’ land from my bro [?]
Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate
Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit
In touch with the crib that’s why you feel this shit
The willingness to grow, the willingness to blow
The willingness to know that I don’t know shit

But I still wanna know
What the fuck you on girl

Enrichened souls, visions, goals, mission grows as I do
It was written like a haiqu when I was seventeen
I used to sell a [?] to forever dream
Now I’m a champagne king like Evelyn
Young hearts run free and forever sing
Yea

Tell me what the fuck you on
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run

State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplated with wine
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city
I contemplated with wine

State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplated with wine
State of the art, state of the mind
I contemplated with wine

It was red, I guess it had to be the bloodshed
Love shed, ‘nough said

But I still wanna know
What the fuck you’re on
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run
And I’m down to jump the gun with you
Tell me what the fuck you want
Cause your heart is sayin’ ohh, ohh, ohh – run
And I’m down to jump the gun with you

What the fuck I’m s’possed to do, you not around
I’mma talk about when we high and I’m on the ground
Always hold you down in and outta town
Maybe I’m a clown got me crying out in front the crowd
On the inside but it feel like a fuckin’ cloud
Out my fuckin’ mind, I’mma fuckin’ drown
Girl but I’m not gonna fuck around
I’mma fuckin’ marry you and learn to swim
Let me carry you I need to hit the gym
Young hard jab but the difference is
Got young love but I’m not young
Faith in love but I’m not dumb
I don’t need to give a fuck about the outcome

Common,"I'm sending my killers to the store for Patron and Danish
My nigga, my nigga, I would go get it myself, but I'm famous
And I ain't never changing, I'm never done paying my dues
My mind frame is ""I'm forever making my payments""
I walk by a so called tough guy, watch him tuck his chain in
No snatching though, watch what you put my fucking name in
Kind of like an armless actor playing an action role
I'm out on the west copping like Axel Foley, ask the police
But at least I'm active though
I bought my bitch an Aston, wrote it off on my taxes
Listed it as an independent backing like Macklemore
Half of my clique is bastards
The other half of my clique don't know half of the kids they having
Savage, that's average though
Like 30k a year spent on yeast
In order to walk in the streets
In my shoes, you're gon need Flintstone feet
And room for baggage, and room in your Nikes
So they can hypothetically tag your toe
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more about rhyme no more
Cause I'm so raw, will I win?
Ain't an if, it's a when
Kind of like asking ""what time is karma gon find [?]""
So tomorrow, in hindsight, if you an artist, death's near, the fans know
What you draw falls on deaf ears like Van Gogh
I chose rap glory over the stratosphere
No plaques or a trophy, I already have them here
(Let's go, Preem)
I'm just trying to leave my mark but I've got the same backstory as a tatted tear
The kind of frame I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothing about Budden, I suppose
I propose to all my girls too
I'm in the Forbes in in a pearl suit
Bitches know the score like Sheryl Swoopes
You know they say that you dying if you ain't living good
I'm dumping a hit man's salary worth of quarters down the world's largest wishing well
Wishing a nigga would
(Wishing a nigga would)

Ladies and gentlemen
I think my record speaks for itself

A rival of survival, idle movement and chatter
We was stepping in the Chi before we knew the ladder
Climb up till your time's up, but daily reminder
My daily operation is to spark the population
Salutation to the nation of the Nubians and hooligans
That knew me when we was boxing niggas up in Julian
The bond that I have with the Quran and the math
Supreme talk, I'm walking a king's walk
Watch it vibrate, while I take the wings off
Straight out of Chitown where they get that lean off
Fiends cough for serum, hitters rally rally like it's Durham
You in Illinois, we don't know what can cure 'em
I'm sicker than most of them from the 'Go so the flow don't end
Come get it bae like you from Oakland
I'm in the building and this my grand opening
I'm posturing with niggas that were supposed to been
Doper than, more pussy than fallopian

These are the sounds of days that are passed

Kick in the door waving the .44
Casing the floorboards, stays in the Waldorf
I will board a jet cheap, fly the way for sure to get deep
To show your crew my immortal technique
I'll elaborate, sixteen pistols and extendos
Hidden inside three or four twelve hundred crates
If we at war, I'll exaggerate
Sweep up the streets till the clique clean
Shoot you while we watch the tables turn like a twig scene
Street sweeper, knock his head clean off his body
Then keep sweeping long enough to clean off his body
Lean off the bottle then fly a nigga queen off to Cabo
Then have her feeding me papayas and grapes, I'm an acquired taste
If you don't like me, acquire some taste
And all I talk about is murdering
All you do is test pros, I'll shoot you while you protest
Shout to all my brothers and my sisters out in Ferguson
The police want us shot
And you gon be the next to drop in front of that donut shop

We record a new dimension of history

I kick my habits of visvum
Sneakers and developed into the new now
With Animal Planet I got me a plaque
And a Grammy well I'm goin' zoo now
Me still be irrelevant, then became the elephant
In the room now (is he gon' ever fall off)
No, I walk by a so called tough guy
Watch him pass me nervous, after I passed him
He gon' get what the street life for
He gon' turn the other cheek like
A half done assed job, sittin right
In front of a plastic surgeon
Then I jump in the black suburban
Snatch the curtain, wrappin' your R&B act in it
After I squeeze 21 entries, and it ain't no need to ask for ID's
I'm certain that if you offend me, that it shall get windy
And it's right before that Mack 10 is workin', click
And it ain't no I in me in the fact that I am

The city heard, the sounds of a pretty bird
Yelling from Slauson to 53rd
What happens if you holla and can't be heard?
For the birds and the drama, I paint these words
They say through the pain is how we learn
You landed on the window of pain, simple and plain
It's hard for you to fly in the rain
The way love goes is not the way that it came
Come fly, un-die, be born again
I've seen the strongest of them be torn from men
Ripped apart and get put back together
Them the ones with the most beautiful feathers
Lets, flock together, rock together, Nirvana
A birds persona to be free and honor
The sky, that's when you really most high
Unafraid of the unknown and now we know why

Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings

Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, ""Stay down"", and we stand up

Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history

It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory

And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots

Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me
When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA
So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain

The last note I sang was indeed a false behave
At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name
But I knew I couldn't work there, 'cause to follow my dreams
They tell me find that place, find that place

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

Deep in my destination, tryna find my destination
With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today
Constantly it's on my mind
I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration
Oh, I've got to cross this nation

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

As the rain falls down from the heavens
Think of how far I came since '87
Took my hustle and made it a weapon
I was always told ""in the pain there's a blessing""
Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons
Talking with God, I asked clearer questions
Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for?
If so? then what am I stressing for?
We tight, then why can't I let it go?
Everything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor
Let it rain 'cause it's ancestral
Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you
Let it rain and come down visceral
For those no longer here in the physical
Let it rain 'cause it's like tears from you
Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do
Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful
So that it can service you and return to you
Let it rain, let the rain surround me
And never drown me, I was lost when it found me

Yes Sir
Yo I reminisce over this chick
Colder than a soda
Princess a soldier
Raised in Islamic culture
Sexy as the girl on the Jamaica poster
Men are over seas where there really don't be no
Sistas
Brought her on stage as Bilal sang ""Soul Sista""
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and Sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I pimp the dime
Put the pimpin' aside I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was devine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce why'all

Because the pain, pain, pain
I remain all alone
Because I want you

I been thinking bout
I been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted 2 your love, feel I need another dose
I know it's a feeling
That should be long gone
Things seem to come up
When I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seem so long
Since I heard your voice
Where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls
I need your warm
The taste of your mouth
Girl I need your warm
Good food and love

They say you don't know know know 
What you got
Till what u got is gone
Yeah I write such and such yo a lot 
But the feelings not as strong
We were like two birds
That were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Someday's I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over u, my god
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it remind me of you
Take a look at the moon it remind me of you
Hope the stars and the gods 
Align me and you

Common and Styles of Beyond,"Back home
Everybody's searching for somethin'
But all they can find is a whole lot of nothin'
Back home
Ain't nobody hoping and praying
'Cause they feel like nothing can save 'em
And they try to hold out but they can't fight the fact that
Life goes black when those lights go out
But I guess you gotta just watch out for your own
'Cause ain't a damn thing free
Back home

Back home they holler ""disciple"" and ""blackstone""
Some black they freebase yo we trapped on
Where our grandmothers marched the guns clap on
There's liquor stores, beauty supplies, and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it
In many ways this city raised me and gave me
The drama, honor, and bravery
The streets seem hollow when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow
Times hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow I borrow words from the
Bible and use them for survival gangs rival
Signs painted on the walls like hieroglyphics
I tell 'em that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt shorty's goin' through the same cycle
And trials like Michael tryin' not to stay idle

Back home it's not Compton but close
The same problems exist and the pain throbbin'
And folks are so common
It don't really bother us much we just swallow it uh
Crack the bottle and smoke hope tomorrow something
Magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home we get the good life at glimpse
In the form of a rap start, drug dealers, and pimps
I'm back home

Back home I try my best to keep it together it's cold
Like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth looking for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source need something to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life
Only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight bringing truth back to the game

Back home we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on something 'cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop bottom line doing what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people calling us hopeless
People trying to tell us all we need is some focus
But focus
Focus is overrated
Cause you see very blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado K-Town and J-Town
Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver living right in the litter
Where kids write nigga right inside the L.A River
On the concrete a symbol of out everyday way
It's that color and concentration over heavy gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay",Back Home,2005

Seek the space to stop and soothe my troubled mind

We crawl away (Creatures dressed in grace)
We hide away (Freeze ourselves in place)

Your silence burns inside of me

Love sinks in slow decay
When hearts have been betrayed
In the darkest light of sin
Serpents shed their sin

Placing it under
Treasures lost and never found
Is it a wonder
We watch our world come crashing down

Try to understand the many years and where they ran
All his feelings shining in our eyes
Wish to wash away the wishing that his life would change
Stumble through the back roads of our lives

And the memories shiver down his spine
Sometimes in his mind he feels the pain go

Could you climb with healing into my tired life
Into my own life

And I frolic through my fears
When I stain myself in shame

I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes

Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration

It's like a competition, this mission here I'm tellin you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is fellin you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick

I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growin
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showin
A male seed, praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me?
The king of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top 'cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way

Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress
You know I'm still...

In battles, I'm warring/Warren like a G-Child
Searchin for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the bal-cony
Lyrically I put a hit on em, 'cause I'm the style-Nitty

His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change

Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear

With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky

Of a movie; me screamin' ""you're not my mom,"" set to

Six years of separation's damn near a generation
But you never stopped trying to understand my
Motivation
And you always had my back when push came to shove
We're the same blood, through the rain's floods ?

Built a bridge over the river of doubt and made ""sound""

And aint that what matrimony's about; a shared vision?
We draw on the strengths of intellect and intuition
You're the symbolism of liberated women, the definition
Of
What a companion does ? ""thank you for your love""

Thank you all for your support in my times of need
Your belief in me empowers me to lead
And they wonder how I stand this firm to transgressions
Y'all taught to me the lessons every man must learn
Mother showed me how to fold my hands and thank God
Through my sister's eyes ? compromise was not hard
My daughter teaches me honesty and honestly
My wife teaches love for my mother, now my cipher's
Complete

One mother, one sister, one daughter, one wife
Once lost in the darkness; blessed by sunlight
Once blind to the bounties of livin' ? Lord, surround

And a tender amazement 
Swallowed up the night

We could walk along, 
Be forever strong
Drive into the night, 
And the right and the wrong

It was 2 kids with a beat up nova, 
And a dream, and a two A.M. song
There ain't no dream
Like the one that's real

Ashby to eighty
Eighty to the bridge
Bridge down to one
Route one carry on

We ate the night up
And we shot the big coast
'Cause the shoreline makes 
A heart open like a rose

She found a song on the radio
And it wiped all the blood off my halo
It was two kids,
Whose hearts were their own

Trying to break a leg for take two 
You should of ate your Wheaties

Walking up and then down the strip 
Looking for some hip so I can skip 
I spotted this honey dip, and her friend tried to sell me a script 
That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the old Gus 
So I'm getting a bus, as I thrill at the disgust 

Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this 
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business 
Dipping from a distance, in an instance I got the digits 
and blew a kiss to her 
That old stank hoe, was mad I didn't speak to her 

I hooked up with the one that looked nice 
Took her mind, like an ice!
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice 
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill 
They told her to keep that booty still 
I been through more hoes than the pill 

Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete  
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (break) 
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was getting knocked 
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop 
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell 

Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail 
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat 
Like a belt, everything was strapped 
'Til my homey asked, ""What's up with that?"" 
The that was like dis G, I told him I got busy 
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy 

That was foul, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end 
The little wreck on that they locked the door and I can't get in 
No more no more no more and now I know and now I know

I ain't tryin' to be a stepfather so I don't bother 
Word to mommy dearest, I look farther 
Down the road, to a road not taken 
I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care 
A new flower, so Joe can take a shower

Never wore a leash but I get loose 
Producin' somethin' fresher than fruits, got more soul than combat boots 
Diggin' two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers 
So amazin' like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka 
I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow 
Me go with mi amigo, to see the Man named Chico 
The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals 
Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo 
Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears 
The way I freak funk oh the monkey's sayin', ""Hell yeah"" 
Correction, ""Hell yes""; old folks want to cuss

Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake

I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, bam, I slam 
Like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian 
Cause see I want it quiet in here
I Mark a Markyiana a bunch of funky Uncle Thomas's 
Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises 
To stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors

For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold 
And reach a large scale, sellin' for the pale male 
And I can't tell, why for a hoe you grow a tail 
And stop drinkin' ale, the booty probably smell 
Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid 
Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid 
Got doo doo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass 
If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache

It's like McDonald's sellin' fatback 
Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dance tracks 
I'm hearin' rap from Anthrax, my time the Caravan cracks 
You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter 
When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer 
I'ma shoot a dis well like a fist to all these wack groups 
Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops 
I'm wonderin' how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far 
I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R

If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk 
If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff 
It's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the 
Presents 
In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff 
I'm a nigga with soul, my last name should be Smith-sonian 
I'm gassin' girls heads, just like petroleum 
Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian 
And turn off the lights this is the likes of a 
Ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother 
Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter 
A chick is a chick that's how I treat her 
Never go pop I'm not a two liter 
A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow 
Whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto 
Wear em? No, share em? A hoe 
I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro

When life goes wrong, this train goes on

Somehow I manage to keep moving on
Searching for any place but where I am
And a first and second chance

Seemed like forever till we reached High Point
Now, Lynchburg to Danville - that's a ghost filled rail

Better say Manassas if you say Bull Run
Or in Virginia you won't get along with anyone
But just across the river you can change your tune

And I was raised by the graves

I wore my brother's clothes because our house - it was cold
With a cry of ""pennies make dollars""
And we settled down so far from that town
That God only knows if you holler

The softest touch of skin, the holy world unfolds
Till death, I promise all I have, this new discovered path
Where the wild things grow, we'll stay

Well sin, original or not
And not if you get caught, can scar your very soul
The gift that the pain and pleasure, bring make you silently sing
When the wild things grow

The begging for some more, some kind of problem grown
The noise of the dying being choked, the makers name invoked

Then the young and the old
Will stand at our side

If we only have love
Love that's falling like rain
Then the parched desert earth
Will grow green again

If we only have love
For the hymn that we shout
For the song that we sing
Then we'll have a way out

If we only have love
We can reach those in pain
We can heal all our wounds
We can use our own names

If we only have love
We can melt all the guns
And then give the new world
To our daughters and sons

If we only have love
Then Jerusalem stands
And then death has no shadow
There are no foreign lands

If we only have love
We will never bow down
We'll be tall as the pines
Neither heroes nor clowns

If we only have love
Then we'll only be men
And we'll drink from the grail
To be born once again

Then with nothing at all
But the little we are
We'll have conquered all time
All space, the sun and the stars

Company,"The old folks don't talk much
And they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of thyme, of old photographs
And an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away
When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us

Company,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

I had no complaints,

So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.

Their watch of wondering love

Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

And the days of our years
Will rise on that morn

To embrace without fears
We will kiss with our eyes
We will sleep without tears

Then the young and the old
Will stand at our side

If we only have love
Love that's falling like rain
Then the parched desert earth
Will grow green again

For the hymn that we shout
For the song that we sing
Then we'll have a way out

If we only have love
We can reach those in pain
We can heal all our wounds
We can use our own names

If we only have love
We can melt all the guns
And then give the new world
To our daughters and sons

If we only have love
Then Jerusalem stands
And then death has no shadow
There are no foreign lands

If we only have love
We will never bow down
We'll be tall as the pines
Neither heroes nor clowns

If we only have love
Then we'll only be men
And we'll drink from the grail
To be born once again

Then with nothing at all
But the little we are
We'll have conquered all time
All space, the sun and the stars

Company,"The old folks don't talk much
And they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of thyme, of old photographs
And an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away
When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us

""Son, it's not how many Germans you kill that counts
It's how many people you set free!""

Brushed my cap
Walked out into the world
Seventeen years old
Never kissed a girl
Took the train to Voronezh
That was as far as it would go
Changed my sacks for a uniform
Bit my lip against the snow
I prayed for mother Russia
In the summer of '43
And as we drove the Germans back
I really believed
That God was listening to me
We howled into Berlin
Tore the smoking buildings down
Raised the red flag high
Burnt the reichstag brown
I saw my first American
And he looked a lot like me
He had the same kinda farmer's face
Said he'd come from some place called Hazzard, Tennessee
Then the war was over
My discharge papers came
Me and twenty hundred others
Went to Stettiner for the train
Kiev! said the commissar
From there your own way home
But I never got to Kiev
We never came by home
Train went north to the Taiga

Up the great Siberian road
For miles and miles and miles and miles
Dressed in stripes and tatters
In a gulag left to die
All because Comrade Stalin was scared that
We'd become too westernized!

Used to believe that life was

Bust the sundial, wild advanced placement in effect

Stands brittle but be-boy shell rugged and practical 
Subtle anarchy, climate is unadaptable 
Vulcan, logic, brought upon his destruction 
Attack him at the fulcrum and society can't function 

I've been underground since thirteen literally 
Bombin the whole system up, beautifying the scenery 
Bless the turns I step up off these New Balance 580's on 
No order fool coherency Clinton speak Egyptian 
Get cocked, not back in the jungle, ease up friction 
High dose of energy fuels my fermenting splintering in three sections 
Each capable of launching attack in any direction 
Hook it back up and connect it 
Death-defying, all up on your e-mail addressing 
I defy, any and all attempts at logic 
Gray matter material formulate engineering solids 
Truck the vat scientific frontage off of science? 

Every bloodline is tainted, signifying malignant raps 
Who with bad intentions of boogeymen and death as a source of laughter

Company Flow,"At night I cover my ears in tears 
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers 
But one day you'll pay 
Doomed to this kid that you fueled with anger actions 
Disgust mostly sick most  never have satisfaction 
Till your bones melt high incident clips and crumple zones 
Hold a fix on you eternal  intruder interrupting my zone 
Dwell the matter I must follow  why you proposed only the lonely know 
Swallowed my mother when she was hollow 
Who can blame a woman like her, singular parent 
One love already dissolved and the solution left polluted 
Two kids with a father who broke out as resoluted 
So suck it she needed love and you provided false clout 
Stomping on the bottom man and I wish she just walked out 
Knew you was jacked as a stepfather, bit my tongue on the issue 
Next to stormy weather and forced tolerance but secretly vexed 
Wish I would have spoke on it but why deny the bliss 
Mom's with a new husband casting needles puncture pressure 
Briefly lifted the guilt from a divorce snuffing her pleasure 
Now you're all up in the family tree, come broken nuclear 
With termites corroded in your veins and elected to drown the pain 
But the pain couldn't quite die with a thrown back whiskey sour 
Puritan, crushing Moms between rocks for at least an hour 
Until the day I die 
Until the day I die
That's why 
At night I cover my ears in tears 
The man downstairs must have had too many beers 
Now every night of my life he beats his wife 
[Until the day I die] 
Until the day I die 
Timepiece must of read early morning at least 
So I lay death's cousin, woken by the sonics of the beast 
That somewhere deep beneath me a fracture had seized at my neck 
Breath was it, a flag that marked the end of my peace 
Conference of the birds I heard my mother dove cry 
Not absurd just routine I'd learned 
Just keep my fucking grill locked and hope the entropy stops me process 
Stepfather's got to fight verbally when his liver's soaked 
And products come in bottles stuck with drunken last nerve up too close 
But I couldn't sense the distinction from the other nights' livest wires 
Ceremony's sparked again a dry one in comparison to this one 
Handing crutches to my psyche, I was tripping 
Huddled up clutching sis I think I heard a dress ripping 
I should of reacted to that 
But I didn't know the extent, please 
You could of caught him in time 
Yeah, that thought's occurred to me constantly 
Now I've been digging my head and I don't know what he wants from me 
Until one of us is dead I suppose 
That's why 
At night I cover my ears in tears 
The man downstairs must have had too many beers 
Now every night of my life he beats his wife 
[Until the day I die] 
Until the day I die 
Until the day I die 
Much more than abrupt I heard the silence erupt 
But it was just a touch of tough love that I heard from above 
The calm and the climate confused me 
The dawn was a floozy 
Barely risen but still beckoning to me 
The song of the night's events amused me, morbidly 
In a petrified state I wait, to Deadwood on duty 
Just tempers flared I figured woozily 
When all is dead and done a pair is just as fucking happy as they choose to be 
Now off to where the wild things dwell for shuteye 
The prospect bored me, awakened by the step sounds coming towards me 
A quick glance at my mom's darkened silhouette in the hallway assured me 
So I sunk with the hope that hibernation would cure me 
And slept my last sleep while I counted clone sheep 
And dreamt about nothing for the last time ever 
The ignorance was blissful just a recollection 
Of the gift of innocent times from a merciful deception 
Woke to hazy landscapes to find my world defied the laws my mind mandates 
Patching jugulars with Band-aids 
The turn on you laid well above my bed 
Were here and only barely through the shock of what her broken face told me 
You should have known what happened 
I was young and oblivious 
He almost killed your mom 
If I knew I could have done something 
You'll never see him again 
Yeah but I see him every night 
And cover my ears in tears as he beats his fucking wife 
At night I cover my ears in tears 
The man downstairs must have had too many beers 
Now every night of my life he beats his wife

I'll do the simple shit; strike harder than Hoffa.
El the maladjusted, MC Funcrusher.
Massive; a sign for my condition, automatic.
Goldstar connect thoughts; get jostled at your position.
Listen, abort mission without further discussion.
Dual personality, half me.
Doc Jekyl when I burn your paragraph down to a haiku.
So Tootsie Roll, motherfuck, back to your seat, 'cause I don't like you.
I got a hundred beats; all nicer than your joint.
Karaoke MC's need not receive G's; that's the whole point.
Be out within' the crowd; get open like herpes simplex sores
On vexed pussy; found that I put more crush on crews than Jets.
You're just that simple, plus overfronted, but that's the status.
Cold caught my shit; you better not sit, so stop the madness.
With hip-hop guidelines, I state I never liked authority.
When sales control stats I place no faith in the majority.

Auto matic, just for my people.
Auto matic, just for my crew.
Auto matic; if you're wack then you'll get.
Knocked out of the box, and you'll deserve it too.

I analyze; people call me El, so, son, catch it.
MC's be disillusioned as hell; them can't hack it.
I'm a knock you out your tax bracket.
Slipped into the wrong hands; the mental barbarian
Stay-freshed in Ziplock; money plot hatcher.
How the fuck you gonna bring a Go-cart to the Grand Prix? Hee, hee. 
Laughter, enter for irreconcilable disaster.
I'm a protect mine like a Japanese fighting sticks master.
Aim; pierce your vital nerve; the bloody conquest.
Rappers they be like, bro, I sunk your Battleship.
Ultra-magneto; burnin' pee burns my credo.
Mad men cry like when you realize you got a shirt full of infrared
Dots, plus I'm scopin' at this bitch; be prepared for the mental headshots.

Now the mint and governor get paid, collectin' off raids.
All the cash that was made from a brother, New York Undercover.
Don't love her; still I'm SuperHun.
Rhyme styles monstrosities; fools never stoppin' me.
I swat MC's quite easily, Dunn.
Imitate styles; most complain you can't begin to express.
Elevate off this, nine times to your brain.
Makes your mind manifest; shit's hopeless.
Stop, stop the nonsense; this could not accomplish.
Low pro interactive; go open carsnatchin'.
CoFlow, by all means necessary, packin' rhymes is automatic.
Check the barrel circumference; who done it?  Confirm it; sewers done run it.
BMS just a killer plus serial,
But still ill, and Sugarhill, to the fullest extent.

Like the doors and this president.  (Dead presidents.)

All hold heart rocks down when I'm turnin' veterans to greenhorn.

The inconvenience to your master plan fell; your shit's abyssmal.
Decimal point zero for the judge burnin' rhyme books.
Fuck basic, iambic pentameter just dissolves,
So I'll say fuck you; suck your marrow like a chicken wing from pluck you.
Location I'll rock like Zeke, calamity.
What's your composure?  Shoot sex like Vanity; it's over.
Done it again; brainstorm slice in your direction.
Cut the belly of your block; open over to C-Section.
Death callin' one for the dysfunctional son.
Trapped in my digital domain... (The El to the P.) 
Yo, fuck rappers that freak a fable; phony will make them fall out.
Frequencies painful; run 'em as sonar; CoFlow's the callout.
You're misaligned, I turn benign breaks into malignant.
Knock 'em out the box; capture they flag and kick they can in.
Badlands live one down the information highway.
Write a rhyme in braille; send a fuckin' battle to your e-mail.
Yes, once again empty MC's we have had here; for those
Fortunate enough to feel this; blessed number one, ichiban,
Numero uno crew; track runner, stun gunner, plus vocal.
Freak show performance.
Company Flow rockin' shit from the intro to the outro.
Nevertheless I must digress for the master;
The walking FreshFest MC's pure when in soil,
Yet shallow when the bank roll.
The independent representation of what MC's can and should be.

Mr. Madman attract lyrics like magnets 

They fuck up speaking cavernous when I'm stabbing it 

Like the Juice, then go Bronco busting loose 

That's my word, you couldn't shoot or try to compute the math 

To kick any type sport like the vandal 

I manhandle, emcees get murdered like tennessa

Asides from gettin in you, the words will stain you
Permanent like ink in epidermis, from tattoo artists
To scar this, thought of partnership you may have fought
For this position and status, this entrepeneurship
Matter of fact, madness I planned this like serial killers are banished
Flows aquatic like fishes' surroundings, underground and
It's pounding, like pregnancies, with the expectancy
Of three times three, use my mental nine to climb
Like gladiator on wall, on call like physicians
To deliver my labor you savor the flavor like Punisher to the cure
A parent's birth picture, evade mixture of offspring
Ring ring the alarm, cause I set strong cases of fire
From my wire connections and disconnections
To settin sparks cause then I'm wettin, microphone checkin
Disrespectin amateurs plus they mentors don't be a sore sport
If it's meant yours, just pretend I liked yours

I can be a bit demanding, acceptin, nothing less than the best
I don't just flip shit anyone can kid, I stick the landing
And stand out, amongst most so don't stress
Trying to touch us, you can't come close like phone sex
I stay ahead of the pack, if you fuckin with Treds
Know that I cover the spread so always bet on black
I'll give you your money's worth, serve up somethin delicious
While, most of these rappers be makin my tummy hurt
Got me upset, sick of these crabs who can't kick it
All addicted to rhyming, I'ma stick them in rehab
Get em cleaned up you know, show em the light that they're
All bark and no bite, like a tree trunk
We slash and burn em, Indelibles, The Fire In Which
Suckers are finished, may they flow, rest in pieces
Cause we're dominating, so while they're busy happy
Just to be nominated son, we give acceptance speeches
Takin the crown, front doors, breaking em down

They also said, your time will come, it's time to take it cause
We just couldn't stand the wait like Jenny Craig

Thinking Indelibles will crash and burn you must be lazy and obscene

Slingin em 40 bottles frozen from rooftops and projects
Beware watch below for falling objects, rupturing your optical
Two one-hundred watt mono blocks is optional
To try to match wits with the Diamondback unstoppable
Background poseurs fiend for limelight exposure
When we rally back touch the microphone playtime is over
Who's trying to see the CF graf crew that visualize
Top to bottom, and stand out in New York like an L.A. gang tag do

You talk about, ""Respect mines,"" steady missin your layups
Hoes to foes, I start staring, wild truculant
Heart tearing style, fuck you then, order your demise

Only buck fifty you ever handed out was with a Metro card
I can fit the sum of your Tom Thumb concepts in a thimble
Simple bitches, Doctor Death lacing barbed wire stitches
A herd of mad cows bust through brick walls like Jumanji
Sixty-Five upsetter, malicious sickness scatalogics
Prophets turned skeptics, skeptics found Jesus
Right-Wingers turned leftist, everybody jumped on the dick of independence
Sorry we don't want you anymore get lost kid find an exit
Bugged, isn't it? Huh, live you fuckin suckers
I woulda been a witness to collapse your fame squadron
Pardon me, still a fan trying to understand how to be a master

Character closely cut from a fabric that's ferocious
With a misanthropes motive and a quote that drips from a slit throat
Livid and sickly corroded, fuck it I'm precocious

First fraud to get soaked equals the joke that stands closest
Tear the thugs up with clubs before the toast leaves their holsters
Purvey the unconveyed for the age of the no hopers
And never shut the fuck up till we have a sense of closure

Dissonant key, shines blind while I'm landing
Well I've lost friends to death and simple misunderstandings
Every breath is a zone, isolated and accident prone, christ...
Maybe I'm designed to live alone

'99 will be remembered as the time that shit cluttered my dome
So in 2000 when you talk to me (blah blah blah) 
Just watch your fucking tone
Some people think they know me 'cause they play me in their home

And lose perspective on the rules of engagement
Get smacked to the pavement
If the tune bruise hard, that's my whole job fufillment
So before your suck box squawks that smart thought...try to kill

Or space ghost might spit on you, we're tight like that...teammates
Been through too much shit to turn away now, no debate
I'm wild with a dosage, maybe something similar 
To the substances that threw some of my best friends out of focus

That take away our pain might croak us
88, eighth grade, weighs in with a grin
Smoking bones in tompkins park where all the crack heads lived

It was me and my friend jon and a bag without skins
So we emptied out a cigarette and stuffed that shit in
Way before The paincave made itself known, that's what we did
Like running around downtown brooklyn getting chased by the big kids

Now as a man I don't run much, still have the same click
That very few people I meet in this world can measure up with
Simple words can do work versus complexidus bids
Plus a rhyme style without emotion isn't telling me shit

This portion of the broadcast is adjourned with a dark tint
Now I've got razor blades in my throat and I don't mind it one bit
From the women I've loved down to the clubs that I've ripped
I dedicate my strange ways from in this maze that I sit

I don't wanna smoke that fucking haze wit' this wood no more
Hydro, shit got my hydro tasting like smydro
I'ma smoke a straight haze right now
(Straight haze)
Pone roll up there, ya heard me?
Yo Slaam roll up there ya heard me? Okay Slaam
It's like this, yo

Yo, yo, blood money is the anthem, it's never a myth
I smoke weed and I get drunk, and ride with gifts
If I don't roll, then my nigga baby, he just twist
He rolls Phillies and he busts the big the four-fifth
See shit change because I normally came
On the are train now me and 5 in the Range
We used to twist Phillies and fuck hoes, switch cars and trade guns

Them Queens niggaz then we landed in the millions
Iraq and the Bridge, the only difference is the buildings
The same crime rates and the same damn killings
A slice of pizza, and quarter water my juice
But now I'm Car hart and bullet proof is under my goose
And go to hell to that nigga that snitched on deuce

The curly-haired fro, I cut my hair but my beard grow
Yo, where my beers go? Send them right here, yo
Yo, party's over, tell the rest of the crew
Stash the drugs, the guns go to section two
See me, all my life, yo, I had to sell drugs
While you grew up with straight nerds I grew up with thugs
While you grew up with straight nerds I grew up with thugs

Through the test of time, I strive to get my shine
Upon them lives, slanging rocks 'cause the world is mine
I look out for you and you look out for me
And we hold it down, you just wait and see

Platinum chains and Carti' frames and jewels
Now these broke niggaz start to act a fool
Don't you know Thugged Out straight eat ya food
We keep guns on our sides, you know how dunn thugs do
'cause I'll be there with my thugs, I'll be right here waiting on you

For my niggaz who bust pies, the customized fives
To the vals, to the railroaded trails I cuss cops
Enough shots and any generation
I spit dead a plot in the making, I ride for every thug in the basement
My soul is cuffed to the corner, every gate, every car table
Every welcome to the hood sign, batting good times
It's on over the projects a dark cloud one sided
Till death bitches burning in gossip

It's my turn to deposit the real, the logic, no college
Just dollars and criminal knowledge
Me and my codies, pass [unverified]
I flash mo' wheat, than cash Cody, keep the mac on me
When you stack niggaz act phony
Shit in the ghetto, I spread love and shed blood
Never swear to a dead thug
My name should be brought up in fame
Never said in vain, spread like a letter chain in criminal slang

We done had some time, I strive to get my shine
On the block, slanging rocks 'cause the world is mine
I look out for you, and you look out for me

Compton Posse,"[ verse 1: king tee ]
They live on the street and they hustle for fame
Some kill for a livin, some sling cocaine
Because it's now a lifestyle and a full-time job
And if you live in compton, it's like at mccobb
From block to block everybody's bad
And if you don't know where you're at, then your life's been had
Cause they walk in the street with intentions to meet
Some sappy lookin punk with fila on his feet
And if you try to act tough, well mr. tough, you're through
Cause everybody's a family, if not, they're a crew
I'm here to give some advice advice (run!)
Cause if you're ever in compton, you better bring a gun

Yo, here come my homeboy mixmaster spade
Man, what's up, man?
Hey man, ain't you from compton, man?
(ah yeah)
Alright man, tell em what's up, man
What you used to do

[ verse 2: mixmaster spade ]
I used to cut up the beat on the two turntables
Now I'm rappin on the mic, cause I'm willin and able
When I'm on the mic I take no slack
And everytime that you see me I'm tearin a gat
I got .380s and .22s
You messs with me, I'm gonna bust on you
I got a .357 and a m-16
They call me master spade, and tee's the king
Now compton is the city where the homeboys stay
Rollin in a different car everyday
Can't roll too hard, gotta watch my back
Cause if I don't, I just might get jacked
Now compton is a city of a lotta fun
(can't walk down the street
(can't walk down the street
Can't walk down the stree without my gun)

[ female voice ]
Now you know this just don't make no kinda sense

[ verse 3: king tee ]
Now the next place is kinda risky if you're walkin with your mother
Y'all can get shot if she wears the wrong color
They're all from the old school, nobody's modern
The place I'm talkin 'bout is the nickerson gardens
You can get away with murder, cause they murdered the cops
Cause they said they tried to run a bumrush on watts
But they took control, slingers walk real tall
While real down gangbangers write their set on the wall
If I was you I wouldn't visit here, it's like hell
And if you get robbed, who you gonna tell?
I'm only here for advice advice (run!)
And if you're ever in watts, you better bring a gun

[ verse 4: king tee ]
Now you got a nice car with a brand-new paintin
Rag top convertable with all-gold daytons
You decide to take a ride down the crenshaw strip
You stop at the fat burgers to feed your lip
You got your sounds bumpin, playin zapp and vibe
A skeezer comes your way, you say, ""let's take a ride""
So you're cruisin crenshaw with her, you're goin to bail
A brown cutlass pulls up, they put a gauge to your head
They say, ""(get our your car) if you value your life
(and leave your money) if you love your wife""
Now you're standin in the street lookin like you're on crack
And you say to yourself: I can't believe I got jacked
You call the police because your car they stole
But when you get in touch with them, they put you on hold
Your car is gone, nothin could be done
So next time you cruise crenshaw, you better bring a gun!

Alright, I wanna thank mixmaster spade for comin out to rock with me
(and greg mack) the mack attack
And I also wanna thank j-ro and sweet tooth for comin out rockin
(and dj [name])
And I wanna thank scotty d, cold-crush chris

Back for the payback, black, you came up shorter
Geah, your ass is out, Eiht wrote a-
Nother funky rap about your jealous conflict
How you diss C.M.W, boy, you ain't said shit
Your senses should tell ya: kick it, don't be a hero
Equipped to whip is Eiht, unlike a zero
I gotta hitcha, or get witcha
Sit down, clown, I commence to paint a picture
Hm, it's kinda funny, but yet somewhat amazing
Take you serious? I think about it while I'm blazing
Only then will my reaction show
How I chill and let my tempo flow
Too sorry is the name for your rap
No competition, dissin, boy, you need to be slapped
Eiht ain't no punk, so learn it quick

You can get my duck sick

I don't believe it, how the hell'd you get on wax?
Makin demos on your tape deck tracks
You did a show, and I heard it was wack
You tossed our records, think I tossed right back
You got the nerve, tryin to go down like a trooper
In better words, you go down like King Cooper
So stop your little dissing, saying that I can't handle
I put your lights out, you have to rap by a candle
Go head up punk, or sell out, I know you must've
Heard the word, new jack, I'm not a buster
Always down to bust a record, a party, know what I mean?
But unlike yourself, sucker, I do it for cream
So period, end of story, don't even bore

Fresh off the Compton streets, so start runnin
You come across like a two-bit sucker
Tryin to compare with a hard mutphafucka
Punk, they call me Eiht, so give me respect
I heard you did a show on your Mom's tape deck
Fool, you fucked up smooth tryin to diss
A victim of a violent crime on the list
So wake up and smell the bud', you little pupils
Tryin to go head up, punk, you got no scruples
Conflict you pick, you're sick

All they gotta do is just give up that pussy
Girls, save the drama, cause I know you're in heat
Spread your legs and get ready for the Compton meat
I'm a hound, cause the twat makes the Eiht go wild
Throw your legs on my shoulder, or doggy style
Got to play the role like a punk-ass skee
Next thing that you know is, you give it to me
Girls in Compton say they ain't with it
Save the drag, stupid bitch, in other words, quit it
Cause I deliver quick fast like Roto-Rooter
Say the dick ain't potent, crazy duck, I shoot her
First you tell me 'no', then you tell me 'yes'
In a week you're sayin 'maybe', then you say 'I guess'
??? Compton ain't the Eiht, so what
All I know is that I'm a pussy hound, and you got to give it up

But Tha Chill is on attack smooth, more like a hype sex fiend
Give it up, don't play dumb, sayin what?
I got a little love, because my hand's on your butt
Girls walk, girls talk, girls talk smack
Don't play him, cause Chill ain't goin out like that
Shake your tight butt while you rock to the beat
Then you hound like a female dog in heat
Girls, I see the games that you're playin
Moment I arrive in the pussy, bitch, start prayin
Kotex, I fill it, girls too serious
Down some satin to the head, then I fuck you on your period
My dick's on hard while I'm rhymin
I want the real pussy, to hell with the grindin
I don't show no mercy
So go ahead and curse me

Straighforward to the point, girl, no bullshittin

Think a plot you can drop, yo, it pops on the twat
Juice me like a fruit, but you know it ain't cute

It's simple, don't try to front like you don't know

Put the damn mic down, boy, you can't handle
The pressure, or the assumption that I am great
Black psychologist known as Eiht
Let me suggest that the black race made up rap
And this black brother's here to clock them snaps
Let me propose that I can be nothing nonetheless
Yes, C.M.W. - funky fresh
My main attempt on this final approach
Is to get you to attend, but you can't, you whimp
My wisdom, as you can tell, speaks for itself
Try to compete, then I destroy your mental health

But down to kick butt of the fools that be geffin
Eradicatin, takin nothin I got
Prestige awarded, cause the Eiht keeps hot
It's mandatory that I can rock your world with see
Cause to me there is no world outside the see-p-t

Pop the chops too much, the Eiht'll hit ya

Stable, and yes, I'm able to get harder
So watch my tempo flow just like water
I rush a statement address to the press
You got to understand, my man, it's like fresh
A black entrepreneur with a theory
Suckers, open your ears, so you can hear me
I got the need to obtain a position
I keep my rhythm rollin, no intermission
In order to cancel suckers who want to diss
That means I cancel suckers who don't exist

Impossible, and yet unwise to disguise

Tired of the motherfucking jackin
Police, want to front; want to jack

On a day at the spot where the homies be chillin
Gossiping about the latest Compton killin
Brothers is deep, and no time to sleep
The Boys on the tip, and they trying to creep
Had a G-ride, so I suggest that we punch it
Grover was driving, and doing about a hundred
Hit a corner on the plata. Checked the spot
Seen the P.D. lights. Down the spot was hot
Ed Dog was cuffin'. Threw in the back
Chiste and Lil' Rock jacked for selling that crack
E, man, hit the fence. Yelled out, ""See you later!""
Shark then pulled out the big blue blazer
Dookie and Boo didn't know what to do
Jumped in the car with D.T, bumpin' CMW
Hit a you around the corner. Did it work? I wonder
C.P.D. on my ass, and they burnin' rubber
 Didn't want to be like Brother and Fly: locked up
So I downed the Bird that was still in my cup
Parked the G-ride, and I started to bail
'Cause my trip was to home, not the County Jail
Police swooped. By the time the Boys was near me
Go Go fled 'cause the homie was kind of leary
I wasn't sweating shit, 'cause they had nothing on me
Bam looked bag. They were named. Now his Pony
They peeped out the pager. Said, ""How much did it cost?
By the way MC Eiht, where's the dope you toss?""

Won't go down like the Compton gang banger.""

I hope the Stoney Boys don't try to jack us
Gas tank was loaded, and so was the E
Kind of buzzed of the sack of the good E.T.
Chill was bustin' raps about the good ol' days
Switching to another form about how he get paid
Just then the Boys came behind the truck
Tom looked out and said, ""What the fuck?!?!""
A motor cycle cop riding hard on the tip
Had to clown his ass once. N' said, ""This ain't no C.H.I.P.S!""
Homie had a warrant for a D.U.I.
And in my pocket was a fat sack of Chocolate Thai
Damn! (damn)
Now it's time to get nervous
Starey Clown caught back em
And they was fixing to serve us
Dumb Dumb walked up and started asking for names
They he peeped me out and asked what's the gang I claim
The fact that I'm black is the reason you jack me
I've got to gang bang 'cause of the hat and khaki's
If I was in the hood, the dummy wouldn't have found me
He said, ""Shut the fuck up 'fore you're headed for the County!""
He was already late. The fools had they nerves
To have us sitting contest on the edge of the curb
Twas showt, shorter that showt. What can I say?
""Keep on talking. Go ahead. Make my day

Kickin' the straight gangster shit, for the 9,1
You know what I'm sayin', gia

Growing up in the hood, yea boy
1984, was the year my peers didn't know, what was in store
A little hard head kid came abade
Time to pay my dues, learn the tricks of the trade

And at home it's the same ass story
Mom's treatin' me like she don't even know me
But my younger brother's got much clout
I can't take this shit, so, I bones the hell out

And roll with the pack of wicked motherfuckers
No shorts are taken, we're down black brothers
A little nigga with no problems at all
Fucked up and killed my first 8-ball

Quick up the stairs, so, little sucker stop lookin'
Stagger to the house, so, I can collect my whoopin'
But watch out 'cause a little nigga's up to no good
Growin' up in the hood

Life ain't nothin but bitches and money
'Cause in the city you live and let die
Nutting but bitches and money

I got hard times and will I escape, sometimes I wonder
But, it just seems that the hood, that took me under
Police sweat my tip and keep harassin'
Trying to lock me up 'cause I keep on blastin'

Community tryin' to shut me out
But the money keeps flowin' and I got much clout
With the cluckers, the brother back street punk suckers
Try to break me out fool, you be a short motherfucker

Always strappin', eager to peal a cap
I set up a trap, put your foot to a nap
'Cause I grew up fast on the wrong side of the law
So watch me take two to your jaw

Don't enter my hood, homeboy
Not a Robocop, a robogansta, ready to destroy
I take chances 'cause life to be ain't no good
Growin' up in the hood

Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost
Nothin' but bitches and money

1987, I'm back on the scene, out of jail, I'm legit
And I'm fuckin' up shit
I'm ready to peal a sucker's cap
And I heard that my hood was makin' snaps

As I precede to make my riches
Just like the neighborhood kingpin, pimp, and all these bitches
Task force tryin' to roll deep
But, I'm playin' these punk fools cheap

Niggas rolled by and try to blast, it didn't work
I seen the bullets flying and fool, I hit the dirt
Bullets fly through the window
Hits my brother, down goes my mother

As I'm rolling, I'm hitting my switches
Looking for the punk ass, sons of bitches
I found them, before I kill 'em, I said you fucked up good
Gotta handle that, growin' up in the hood

Life ain't nuttin but bitches and money
'Cause in the city you live and let die
Nothin' but bitches and money, yeah

A brother's on the run, I've got a hand in my stash box
Wanted 'cause I'm serving them the potent fat rocks
And my face is like a household name
Everybody warns their kids about the dope game

But I'm still makin' my profit
And the one time just can't stop it
So, I keep hidin' my face
No time to waste, they got me on the chase

Now, the neighborhood's on my line
'Cause some punk ass fool had drop the dime

Rush to the toilet, so, I could flush the rock

Out the backdoor, freeze, I heard a shout
Am I sure, yo, I guess I got no clout
But it's murder one, I'm the victim, damn
That ain't good, growin' up in the hood

Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost
Compton is the city that I claim
City that I fucked, take no shit from it, sure
Compton is the city that I claim

Where I'm at, if you're soft, you're lost

Got her to the room and she started to guzzling

Ran out about I'd say 8 different bitches.
They hung on my window, leaned on my hood, Sat in my seat.

Right then, yo, the shit was all plugged.
And after the night was over she'd be dug
out by a brother who wasn't saying a word.
Cause what I needed to say was already heard.
Picked the bitch up and went straight to get the liquor.
Then right back to my pad, so I could smooth dick her.
Told her a drag, it went straight to her head.

And he'll spread terror through the city and leave a trail of blood baths.
And to those that know, he's not a phony.
But tonight he'll get his vengeance on the fool who killed his homey.
Don't give a fuck, he'll take you smooth on out.
Cause the hood is where its good is what its about.
Geah. Don't want to squable, through down or even kick him.
Just pull the fucking trigger cause to him your just a victim.
Jumped in the car, ash traces of dub.
Hit a couple of corners and pulls up at the bud
spot where its hot. Yeah boy he knows it.
But before he does the killing, he's got to get loaded.
Throws up the set, then he bones out quick.
Then he spits at a bitch just for riding his dick.
Now he's at the curb and yeah he gots the feeling.
He tells his homey, ""G lets get ready for the killing.""
Little did he know Miss Daisy's in the kitchen
Standing cooking chicken, 9 started clicking.
Ran up to the back of the house like releigh races.
Just like a train robbery, bandanas on their faces.
He here's this fucking little voice in his brain.
And its saying don't kill, we're all in the same gang.
He tells it back, that ain't the gang I'm in.
Because the gang I'm in is like in it to win.
So he killed off the sucker right there he didn't stop.
Ran through the rooms and went pop pop pop.
The explenation for this, he must was crazy.
I guess that's why he had to driveby miss daisy.

[And now the driveby].....[Say hello to my little friend.]
[You die mutherfucker...] 

Check out the high rolling, young balling, pimp mack daddy.
Drive a 190E, ain't got no time for a caddy.
He got snaps because he jacked a nigga.
But he fucked up smooth and didn't pull the trigger.
Now there's a contract for your head on a platter.
If there's somebody with you they'll kill them too it don't matter.
Now your laying low at your girlfriends crib.
And your thinking of the shiesty shit that you did.
Now you got balls and you pull another jack.
Another and another, your pockets on fat.
don't give a fuck if he spends time in jail.
Just load up the 9 with the hollow point shells.
So nows he's on a mission, to kill or be killed.
Since somebody's got to do it and the shoes are to be filled.
So now its 12 o'clock, and its time for a jack.
Not even thinking it was time for payback.
And yeah you spot a fool who'll get the rag pack.
Rolling close behind while you blase a 20 sack.
He stops at a light on Elandra and Central.
Jump the fuck out put the gun to the window, its kinda simple.
But you know how it deal, and what the fuck was in store.
It was the same punk who you tried to jack before.
And he won't give up shit. Point blank hesitation.
Innocent Miss Daisy at the mobile gas station.
His 9 went click, your 9 went clack. 
Miss Daisy tried to run but got a shell in her back.
The explanation for this he must was crazy.
I guess that's why he had to driveby Miss Daisy.

I opened my eyes to realise I was dark brown.
And right there in the ghetto that color costs.
Brothers smothered by the streets meaning we're lost.
I grew up in a place where it was go for your own.
Don't get caught after dark roaming the danger zone.
Cause it was hell at the age of 12
as my Compton black brothers were in and out of jail.
Years went on, I played with the school crap.
Made it half way, it didn't pay, so I said fuck that.
Cause right then it was the cash I was after.
The street had a beat so I was caught up in the rapture.
It said sell, sell, sell.
And after that it was jail, jail, jail.
I also kept a nine as my toy.
I was only 15, so boys will be boys.
So by 16 I was hip to the groove
and fucking any stupid black bitch that move.
And on top of that I was down for the hood.
If you from Compton you know that the hood is where its good.
So load up the gatts and its down the avenue.
I'm kinda fucked up so I guess I'll kill a few
punk niggas trying to scheme on my tip.
Geah I'm selling the cavi and I'm checkin a grip.
But now the high rolling days been cancelled.
Damn, they kidnapped my homie for ransom.

But my brothers gangbanging, I guess I'll follow in his footsteps.
Claiming a set, jacking a brother,
beating a bitch, you diss the hood I'll put you 6 feet under.
Who gives a fuck if its wrong, no time for thinking.
Just think of the bud and the 8-ball drinking.
So now its time to show my loyalty.
Shoot up my enemy territory.
And my brothers got my back they won't trip.
And I'm in it to win it so I won't slip.
It was like we had a gangbang rally.
A thousand mutherfucking thuggish niggas in the alley.
So while we waited to peel a cap
the suckers crept, damn, shot me in the back.
so now I bail in a wheelchair, no more stomping.

One times seen the smoke they pulled a smooth jack.
On top of that I was bumping big noise.
It was the fucking CHP boys.
I didn't like those punk fools one bit.
Cause they be popping that KKK shit.
So I kick back and played with the routine.
and told the grand dragon I was 17.
Tell the police the truth then how the fuck that sound?
Cause if I told him the truth then I'd be county bound.
So I play with the routine, comma. 
While he say, hand over the marijuana.
I said officer, you must be joking,

So I sat with my but to the ground.
And kept on thinking would the fool beat me down?
They didn't find the gatt, it was a miracle.
But they still toed my mutherfucking vehicle.

2 years pass in O.B.G.
Spent half of my life in L.P.
Geah, now I'm out and I'm ready to sweat
a sorry fool who ain't down with my fucking set.
Nigga, stay clear of the gun blast.
If you thinking about ducking you better duck fast.
Oops, too late you got popped in the process.
Another point for the hood, one laid to rest.
Like a cannibal, I want to see meat.
Killing punk fools from the wrong side of the street.
Me and the homies rolling 4 deep.
Niggas on the run all strapped with fucking guns.
Ain't no time for you to think about ducking
when we start thinking who we start sticking.
Like I said, I don't give a fuck.
Yo listen up.

A tisket, a tasket,
Geah I see another one of your homies in a casket.
And to me that's a fucking shame
cause your R.I.P. 3 and no ones to blame.
Fool, can't deal when we roll on your fucking set.
Call me a threat because you know I ain't don't yet.
So I feel I gotta warn ya,
me and my crew kill fucking transformers.
Geah, toe to toe in the middle of the street.
Turn the other cheek as the Eiht commence to beat.
And I really can't stand this.
One more right to your fucking jaw as your ass hit the canvas.
Now my niggas on the run stomp.
As the Compton criminals, we down another punk chump.
Like I said CMW don't give a fuck.

Compton's Most Wanted,"One more man eater
but perpetrate like your sweeter
But I'm hip to the game, I know your nothing but a cheater
Always trying to game on my wallet
Fuck you or love you, how should I call it?
And its true, all you say is do
for you. and If you got a kid I guess I gotta do them too
Wrong, ain't no rings on your finger
You've mistaked Eiht as some punk love singer
Saying your down with me, and only me
but I'm hearing your fucking the neighbourhood G. Little Skee
Ain't nuthin popping
No snaps get spent until the panties start dropping
I guess a hoe is a hoe
but for you to gank me? Bitch, Eiht don't think so
Your nothing but a user
raised in the Compton streets girl you's a.....bitch

I met you when I was rolling, you and your home girl strolling
Flagging me down, I guess I'll stop for this sorry clown
Another stupid one, here we go again
Cleared my throat and said ""uhmmm where's your boyfriend?""
She tried to check me and say, ""I'm independent""
I said ""Girl Eiht ain't stupid, somebodies getting in it.""
""And if you got a man"" I said "" he's shorter than a midget.
""So come on this side and rush the 7 digits.""
I said ""what's the plan?"" She said ""I don't know call me later""
I said ""I'll call you later, you crooked alligator.""
Spent all my snaps that night, just to make you holler
I come home with a dollar
So one day I decide to make a surprise creep
You and another nigga hugged up in the middle of the street
Damn...Girl...Shit.. You's a.....Bitch

Now what should I do? Keep my cool, step back and clown?
Or go to jail for like months for beating you down?
But I can't afford that bad rap
cause my rep is too big to be caught up in that crap
You stupid little skeezer
In fact I'll call you a bitch, in other words a dick teaser
And its my style you cramp
You say pay for the play. I'll pay for it with a food stamp, tramp
Geah, and that's a fact
Whatever I'm giving your ass bitch I'm taking it right back
And in this rap I'll kick it
about the girls that's sly, slick, and wicked
So no more getting over
Walk out on your hind legs rover, you lost your clover
I'm [huh?] the nigga uses
You know what I'm talking about girl you's a .....bitch

Or should I stick my throat
Leave a pipe bomb and a fuck you note
Hallucinations of seein' lynched bodies burnin'
And all the po-po had faces like Mark Furhman
Tear gas through my glass window pane
They want to put me back up in the nut house again

(Verse 1)

Throw sum
Get ready for the hot one here it come

Too suspicious my Glock rocks to your jaw
Nigga just too vicious land of the lost
Who's the boss get tossed have you seen her
My Nina, she's catchin a misdemeanor
My rep gets bigger my finger on the trigger
I cocks the hammer back like 'fucks you nigga!'
I let loose shells fly like the [?spruise-goose?]
Push weight protects mine, much juice
I hoo-bangs with a gang and slangs caine
Fuck what you tryin to get nigga, it's my thang!

I'm hittin the one times with a fake last thing
Just to keep my ass on the streets, in the game, it's automatic

The niggas on the corner whop white to make cheese
If you want some then niggas bring static
It's automatic

You need to get at me, I'm the G
Locin and provokin dips blocks with cavi
Search a ki' cross the street and smash out
The '63 bounce back to the same route
You fools best get the fuck off my cold tales
Gang tales of how the fuckin dead body smells
Late night horror shows in jail cells
Represent where you from no one to tell
Life ain't nuthin but the hood and snaps
Hoodrats carry work with straps in they laps
Quarter niggas with nicknames play craps
Enemies tryin to cross the front line
Get capped nuthin but escape, uh
Second flat my gat let loose like 'Rat-a-tat-tat'
The underground hero guess y'all is back
My custom, my khaki suit and a blue cap, automatic   

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I make it difficult for a nigga to find me
Crazy-ass Hoo-Bangin G's behind me
You're fucked up for that last time fo' sho'
Now you know, two in your door, four to the floor

I guarantee your ass will hear the glock sing
Quick to hit out like [name] the street king
Shells ricochet up your body, ping ping
Eazy don't come to [??] pound

Greedy as fuck, a chicken tryin' to scheme on chickens
Greedy as fuck, to pay the bitch, she keep on lickin'

In the club bustin', knowin I'ma want that bitch
You ain't seein a nigga ghetto rich
Ghetto fab, ghetto star
Hop off stage, ???bless thou??
No questions asked, that's the role you play
You hit me up on Monday

Get down like you live and get down on a dime 
You bring yo' homegirl, that's fine

Comus,"The wolf's laugh eerie cracks the humid night air
The rabbit freezes the box in his lair
The owl hoots shrilly searching the dark
The moon white fangs through the trees tall and stark
Who would emerge on a night like this
Who would loose his bonds and greet the air with a hiss
The battered Christian bows his head in despair
The crown of sharp thorns revealed 'neath his hair
His scrawny body worn thin by the trial
Stands taut and painful on the pilgrim's last mile
A million fleshy things converge upon the spot
His eyes retort the atmosphere is hot
Aah
The wolf sniffs ivory fanged he bristles up his spine
The fox smiles knowingly but dares not step out of line
Through the twisting crashing silence the broken Christian creeps
Each footstep like a thunderclap amongst the trunky deeps
No bird makes sound no creature moves to break the gripping air
And the Christian he raises his hands up to his mouth for a
Whisper he cannot dare
La-la-la-la-laa...

The Christian wakes trembling with sweat
The cell's dark walls stony and wet
Metallic echoes as the bolts are drawn back
The door swings inward dull light through the crack
The jailer looks indifferent to him
A routine morning martyr's death for him
A misty cold sad morning greets the Christian's haggard grin
The rope is slung and the noose is tied and the Christian's neck is thin
The block is raised he stands erect the rope beneath his chin
They pull the block and the Christian drops he hangs above the sin",The Bite,1971

Through the steaming woodlands
His darkened blood through bulging veins

Down the leafy pathway
Aah, ah, aah, ah

The dim light she comes peering through the forest pines
And she knows by the sound of the baying, by the baying of the hounds
Diana Diana kick your feet up
Lust bears his teeth and whines
For he's picked up the scent of virtue
And he knows the panic signs

Lust cries running with his eyes the white-clad figure fleeting
Mud burns his eyes but desire burns his mind
Fear in her eyes as the forest grins through the steaming woodlands
Lust now his destroyed with enmity disarmed

The day advances oh so softly his shadow lengthens and his voice is mute
But clear his flute and sadly walks forward followed by the day
Herald of morning walks across the earth eternally
Oh

Ah
And somewhere in the black distance
Another herald puts down his flute
And the dewy dawn creeps on

Listen to what I'm spittin, who you think benefittin
while all these heads splittin they money-gettin
See the gangbangin ain't all about the red and blue

So many murdered behind unnecessarily petty games, it's all a shame
Doin crimes as a past time
Tryin my best to stay alive is all that's on my mind
I hit my knees and drop my head between and ask the Lord
""Please let me make it through this struggle"" even though it's hard
Jealousy got us hatin it, wantin to kill each other though
What ever happened to the sayin that we are all bro's

Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime

Or a friend when you're lonely, or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

Concept of One,"It's been so long since I've seen you last 
There's so many things I have to ask 
Please stop awhile and let me have some time 
So tell me what have you've been doing with yourself 
I'd like to know 
To be honest you are always on my mind 
I think about the times we had 
So much good it makes me mad 
To think that you just walk away 
Without a word to say 

Chorus: 
The question that I have to ask since 
I have the chance to ask it is, after all this time gone by please tell me why 
The question that burns in my mind 
That I've been living with deep down inside 
Is why you never said goodbye 

The scars have taken time to heal 
But now you're here once more I feel 
The pains that were subdude return again 
Not a word you said to me 
Before you left that day 
Please tell me honestly and by my friend 
I think about the times we had 
So much good it makes me mad 
What did I do please let me know 
Was it so bad it made you go 

Chorus 

I will be stong 
You took our love 
And threw it all away

A money mountain couldn't save you

Concha Buika,"Quiero emborrachar mi corazón 
Para olvidar un loco amor 
Que más que amor es un sufrir
Y aquí vengo para eso
A borrar antiguos besos 
En los besos de otras bocas
Si su amor fue ""flor de un día"" 
¿A que causa es siempre mía 
Esa cruel preocupación? 
Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar 
Para poder así brindar 
Por los fracasos del amor

Nostalgias 
De escuchar su risa loca 
Y sentir junto a mi boca 
Como fuego su respiración. 
Angustia 
De sentirme abandonada 
Y pensar que otra a tu lado 
Pronto pronto te hablará de amor 
Hermana 
Yo no quiero rebajarme
Ni pedirle, ni rogarle
Ni decirle que no puedo más vivir
Desde mi triste soledad veré caer 
Mis hojas muertas de mi juventud

Gime, bandoneón, tu tango gris
Que quizás a ti te hiera igual 
Algún amor sentimental
Llora mi alma de fantoche 
Sola y triste en esta noche
Noche negra y sin estrellas
Si las copas traen consuelo 
Aquí estoy con mi desvelo 
Para ahogarlas de una vez

Lagrimas de lluvia imploran
La tierra no bebe desde que te fuiste
Ni un beso me diste

El camino blanco que lleva a tu casa
Sigue tan vació, nadie pasa
Tan sólo algún niño perdido jugando
Como te extraño

Son tus caricias, las que cambiaron mi vida
Pero es tu ausencia la que domina mi pensamiento
Y por las noches baila mi mente con tu recuerdo
De madrugada, soñándote volverás mañana

Me ha dicho la luna que una vez te vieron
Ibas de la mano de otro caballero
Condenada luna seguro mentía
Tú sólo eres mía

Y si el viento pasa y el agua no llega
Y el árbol se muere y el río se seca
Seguiré esperando, sola en el desierto
Como te quiero

Son tus caricias, las que cambiaron mi vida
Pero es tu ausencia la que domina mi pensamiento

Soñando que tu volverás mañana

Que mata mi alma
Tan poquito a poco
Que me quita el sueño

Como llovía
La tarde en que te fuiste
Todavía pensando en ti
Me pongo triste

Te fuiste para siempre
Y siempre al recordarte
Considero que fue todo culpa mía
Cuando tú hablabas
Yo sin contestarte
Casi todo aquel silencio culpa mía

Culpa mía, las llamadas sin respuesta
Culpa mía, nuestra puerta demasiado abierta
Yo te he entregado mi alma sin pensarlo

Cerraos los ojos pa' no llorar

Vete, mujer mala, vete de mi vera
Rueda lo mismito que una maldición
Que un día me permita que quien tu mas quieras
Pague tus quereres, tus quereres pague
Con mala traición

Gitana, que tú serás como la falsa moneda
Que de mano en mano va y ninguno se la queda

Besó los negros zarcillos finos
Que allí dejara cuando se fue
Y aquellas trenzas de pelo endrino
Que en otro tiempo cortó pa' él

Cuando se marchaba, no intentó ni verla
Ni lanzó un quejo, ni le dijo adiós
Entornó la puerta y, pa' no llamarla
Se clavó las uñas,

De esta noche divina y prieta
Sobre la tundra
Que puebla mi alma siempre despierta

Se oye un lamento como preludio de las horas muertas
Horas que pasan con la agonía de una muerte lenta
Vuelve el silencio a vestirme de oro mi santo
Vuelve el recuerdo de mis abuelas a hacerme fuerte en la espera
Vuelven los discos que me enseñaron a adorar la música
Volvió mi padre después de veinte años
Ay si tu volvieras

Si tu volvieras te vestiría de oro mi santo
Callaría las cosas para que tu puedas oír mi canto desesperado
Sí tu volvieras te vestiría de oro mi santo
Callaría las cosas para que pudieras oír mi canto desesperado

Concha Buika,"Se fue tras una última noche fugaz
Y un amanecer absurdo pero elegante
Aquella tarde de luz, sus besos hicieron diana 
Justo aquí en mi corazón dormido y errante 
Recuerdo de otro amanecer 
Lindo y estúpido

Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Qué es lo que ha pasado
Hoy yo me pregunto cómo era
Yo ya no recuerdo cómo era 
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Ya no tengo ni un recuerdo de lo que he sido 
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió

Esos bombillos de bar que fingiendo 
Ser luna de abril, iluminas mi penar
Mi penar triste y hermoso ilumina también 
El camino lento hacia una nueva luna
Que ando yo superviviente de un amor casi imposible

Arrepentida de otro amor casi impecable
De nuevo al frente de este amor casi imposible

Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Y ahora me pregunto qué debo hacer conmigo
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Yo ya no tengo ni un recuerdo de lo que he sido
Cómo era, yo ya no recuerdo cómo era
Yo he besa´o tu boca y me he perdió
Pa´ que nadie pregunte, quisiera yo saber

Concha Buika,"Quiero emborrachar mi corazón
Para apagar un loco amor
Que más que amor es un sufrir
Y aquí vengo para eso
A borrar antiguos besos
En los besos de otras bocas
Si su amor fue “flor de un día”
¿porqué causa es siempre mía
Esa cruel preocupación?
Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar
Para olvidar mi obstinación
Y más la vuelvo a recordar

Nostalgias de escuchar su risa loca
Y sentir junto a mi boca
Como un fuego su respiración
Angustia
De sentirme abandonado
Y pensar que otro a su lado
Pronto… pronto le hablará de amor

¡Hermano!
Yo no quiero rebajarme
Ni pedirle, ni llorarle
Ni decirle que no puedo más vivir
Desde mi triste soledad veré caer
Las rosas muertas de mi juventud

Gime, bandoneón, tu tango gris
Quizá a ti te hiera igual
Algún amor sentimental…
Llora mi alma de fantoche
Sola y triste en esta noche
Noche negra y sin estrellas
Si las copas traen consuelo
Aquí estoy con mi desvelo
Para ahogarlos de una vez
Quiero emborrachar mi corazón
Para después poder brindar

Donde las gentes la recuerdan, no me escondo
Simplemente ya no atiendo a lo que no me alimenta
Y aunque el tiempo y la gloria tras mucho trabajar 
Me hayan traído cosas bellas alguna 
Que otra noche aún sueño con ella

Ella me dijo ""volveré"" y un segundo después 
La desterré al olvido. No fue un castigo,
Simplemente no debo volver a donde no me han querido

De esta noche yo sueño con ella

Fue un invierno inundado de calor 
Y al verano llegó el frio,
Fue tu miedo a dejarte querer y conocer
Fue mi lucha estar contigo
Y si no fuera porqué he tatuado tu nombre en mi piel

Será imposible no echarte de menos

Que cruzan mares prohibidos, se me rompe la voz

Somos en nuestra quimera doliente y querida
Dos hojas que el viento junto en el otoño ahí
Somos dos seres en uno que amando se mueren
Para guardar en silencio lo mucho que quieren
Pero que importa la vida con esta separación
Somos dos gotas de llanto
En una canción

Que mas da si sufrimos, nada mas

And a hand to help us stand

With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
He fills my soul with so much love

With him along, who could be lonely

Past the graveyard, voices whisper to me.
I was walking down the street, early this morning
And the silver tears of rain hung from the leaves
And I swear I heard the voices singing to me

Singing to the rhythm of the beat of my feet,
I swear I heard the voices singing to me,
Keep on, keep on, keep on.

Oh WOW! Thought I'd be out of here by now.
Still in Hollywood!
My, my I'm running on a wheel and I don't know why

And on the bus today, I met the queen of L.A.
At least she said she was and who am I to say?
She was sixty-five and full of life,
She had purple-painted cheeks
And glitter on her eyes

And the troll on the corner, I flipped him a quarter
And he looked at me and smiled.

He wasn't abused, he wasn't confused,
He had nothing to gain and less to lose in Hollywood
Oh WOW! Thought I'd be out of here by now.
