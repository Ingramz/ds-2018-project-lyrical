Help, not just anybody
Help, you know, I need someone
Help 

(When)
When I was younger, so much younger than today (I never needed)
I never needed anybody's help in any way (now)
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured (and now I find)
Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors 

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you, please, please help me? 

(Now)
And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways (my independence)
My independence seems to vanish in the haze (but)
But every now and then I feel so insecure (I know that I)
I know that I just need you like I've never done before 

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you, please, please help me?

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin

By making his world a little colder

Chord Overstreet,"Well she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another,
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, when I saw her standing there

Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another

Chord Overstreet,"Loving and fighting
Accusing, uniting
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone

You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming ""please don't leave me""

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

A long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Drivin' a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fadin'
Hiding in the shock and the chill in my bones

They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""please don't leave me""

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

I don't wanna let go
I know I'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you
Saying baby, let's go home
Let's go home
Yeah, I just wanna take you home

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you",Hold On,2017

Chorus,"Look out! Look out!
Pink elephants on parade
Here they come!
Hippety hoppety
They're here and there
Pink elephants ev'rywhere

Look out! Look out!
They're walking around the bed
On their head
Clippety cloppety
Arrayed in braid
Pink elephants on parade

What'll I do? What'll I do
What an unusual view!

I could stand the sight of worms
And look at microscopic germs
But technicolor pachyderms
Is really much for me
I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seeing things you know that ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright
What a sight
Chase 'em away
Chase 'em away
I'm afraid need your aid

Chorus,"Casey Junior's coming down the track
Coming down the track
With a smoky stack
Hear him puffing, coming round the hill
Casey's here to thrill
Every Jack and Jill

Every time his funny little whistle sounds
Everybody hurries to the circus grounds
Time for lemonade and Cracker Jacks

Chorus,"Look out for Mr. Stork
That persevering chap
He'll come along and drop
A bundle in your lap
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which
Millionaires, they get theirs
Like the butcher and the baker
So look out for Mr. Stork
And let me tell you, friend
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end
He'll spot you out in China or he'll fly to County Cork
So you better look out for Mr. Stork

Look out for Mr. Stork
He's got you on his list
And when he comes around
It's useless to resist
Remember those quintuplets and the woman in the shoe
Maybe he's got his eye on you",Look Out For Mister Stork,1941
Chorus,"Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike!
We work all day, we work all night
We never learned to read or write
We're happy-hearted roustabouts
Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike!
When other folks have gone to bed
We slave until we're almost dead
We're happy-hearted roustabouts
Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike! Ugh! Hike!
We don't know when we get our pay
And when we do, we throw our pay away
We get our pay when children say
With happy hearts, ""It's circus day today""

Muscles achin'
Back near breaking
Eggs and bacon what we need (Yes, sir!)
Boss man houndin'
Keep on poundin'

Pull that canvas! Drive that stake!
Want to doze off
Get them clothes off
But must keep awake

Grab that rope, you hairy ape!
Poundin'! poundin'! poundin'! poundin'!

Chorus,"I love you
Hums an april breeze
I love you
Echo the hills

I love you
The golden dawn agrees
As once more she sees
Daffodils

It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melodies

I love you
That's the song of songs
And it all belongs
To you and me

I love you
Hums an april breeze
I love you
Echo the hills

I love you
The golden dawn agrees
As once more she sees
Daffodils

It's spring again
And birds on the wing again
Start to sing again
The old melodies (mellow melodies)

I love you
That's the song of songs
And it all belongs
To you and me
And it all belongs
To you and me",Act 2. Scenes 3 & 4. I Love You (Ich Liebe Dich),1945
Chorus,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars
Little stars, big stars, blowing through the night
And we're lost out here in the stars",Hills of Ixopo,1949
Chorus,"Please let me say from the start
I don't pretend to be smart
I just suggest what I think best
Having your interest at heart

I only want what's the best thing for you
And the best thing for you would be me
I've been convinced after thinking it through
That the best thing for you would be me

Every day
To myself I say
Point the way
What will it be

I ask myself what's the best thing for you
And myself and I seem to agree
That the best thing for you would be me",The Best Thing for You,1950
Chorus,"It's an old-fashioned idea, marryin' for love,
And that old fashioned idea's what I'm thinkin' of!
Where there's love, poets have said two can live as one,
That's an old-fashioned idea, but it's been done!

If she must have gold, let it be in her hair;
Rubies, let 'em be in her lips;
Diamonds, let 'em shine in her eyes.

Just an old-fashioned romance with the moon above,
A romance, one that will end marryin' for love.
That's the kind of love that I'm thinkin' of.

If she must have gold, let it be in her hair;
Rubies, let 'em be in her lips;
Diamonds, let 'em shine in her eyes.

That's the kind of love that I'm thinkin' of.",Marrying for Love,1950
Chorus,"i'm not a millionaire, but i don't have time to care
got no future,  got no plan
still i guess i'm a lucky man

Got no mansion, got no yacht,
Still I'm happy with what I got.
I've got the sun in the morning 
And the moon at night.
Sunshine gives me a lovely day,
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way.

Got no checkbooks, got no banks,
Still, I'd like to express my thanks
I've got the sun in the morning 
And the moon at night.

And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
I'm alright!

And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
and i know, that everything's alright",I Got the Sun in the Morning,1950
Chorus,"Come on along and take a ride and look at life from the cheery side
Howdy neighbor, happy harvest
May your forty acres soon be fields of clover
Yes indeed and plant a wish with every seed and by and by
The sun and rain will make an etching 
Of a million little green fingers stretching to the sky
Howdy neighbor, happy harvest
Get your rocking chairs for all your cares are over
Clap your hands and lick your chops your bumper crops are on the climb
Hey we're gonna roll in plenty spend a $5 or $10 or $20
And those happy harvest bells are gonna chime
Remember neighbor when you work for Mother Nature
You get paid by Father Time
Chicks are gonna cackle
And every burlap sack'll be full of 'tatoes and tobaccos
And dozens of different good and healthy greens
And if the weather man won't upset us
Mister you can bet us they'll be lots of crispy lettuce in your jeans
If you're into livin' find out just what livin' means
Howdy neighbor, happy harvest
May your forty acres soon be fields of clover
Go on puff your corn cob pipes
And no more gripes and no more groans
No mortgages or loans 
And you won't see a trace of worrying on the face of Farmer Jones
Howdy neighbor, happy harvest
Get your rocking chairs for all your cares are over
Clap your hands and lick your chops your bumper crops are on the climb

Chorus,"I don't want to sound like I'm preachin' a sermon,
But I've heard people say:
The early bird catches the worm;

And if you want it to be a good day,
You've got to do a good day's work.

Chorus,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine

I'll be right there, I've got my fair
When I see that rusty haired conductor man
I'll grab him by the collar and I'll holler ""Alabam'! Alabam'!""

Begged for a story, ""Do, Uncle, please.""

Where she is now, pet, you soon will know.

After the break of dawn
After the dancer's leaving
After the stars are gone
Many a heart is aching
If you could read them all
Many the hopes that have vanished
After the ball. 

Bright lights were flashing in the grand ballroom
Softly the music, playing sweet tunes
There came my sweetheart, my love, my own
I wished some water, left her alone

When I returned, dear, there stood a man
Kissing my sweetheart, as lovers can
Down fell the glass, pet, broken that's all
Just as my heart was, after the ball 

After the ball is over
After the break of dawn
After the dancer's leaving
After the stars are gone
Many a heart is aching
If you could read them all
Many the hopes that have vanished
After the ball. 

Long years have passed, child, I've never wed
True to my lost love, though she is dead
She tried to tell me, tried to explain
I would not listen, pleadings were in vain

One day a letter came from that man
He was her brother, the letter ran
That's why I'm lonely, not home at all
I broke her heart, After the ball 

After the ball is over
After the break of dawn
After the dancer's leaving
After the stars are gone
Many a heart is aching
If you could read them all
Many the hopes that have vanished
After the ball.

Chorus,"Here we all work 'long the Mississippi 
Here we all work while the white folk play 
Pulling' them boats from the dawn till sunset 
Getting no rest till the judgement day 
Don't look up and don't look down 
You don't dare make the white boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your head 
And pull that rope until you're dead 
Let me go 'way from the Mississippi 
Let me go 'way from the white man boss 
Show me that stream called the River Jordan 
That's the old stream that I long to cross 
Old Man River, that Old Man River 
He must know something, but he don't say nothing 
He just keeps rolling, he keeps on rolling along 
He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton 
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten 
But Old Man River, jest keeps rolling along 
You and me, we sweat and strain 
Bodies all aching and wracked with pain 
Tote that barge and lift that bale 
You get a little drunk and you land in jail 
I get weary and so sick of trying 
I'm tired of living, but I'm feared of dying 
And Old Man River, he just keeps rolling along",Ol' Man River,1966
Chorus,"We all have been selected from city and from farm
They asked us lots of questions, they jabbed us in the arm

No private rooms or telephones
You had your breakfast in bed before

But you won't have it there any more
This is the Army, Mister Green
We like the barracks nice and clean
You had a housemaid to clean your floor

But she won't help you out any more
Do what the buglers command
They're in the Army and not in a band
This is the Army, Mister Brown

You and your baby went to town
She had you worried but this is war
And she won't worry you anymore

Let me see you smile maria
Close your eyes we're on our way there

My country was a great one once upon a time
I wish I lived when you didn't need borderlines
Somebody came and took the heart of my people away
Now I ain't worried baby come hear what I say
My people gonna rise again fightin' someday
I'll be there to see it I'll be there to welcome them home

Let me see you smile maria
Close your eyes we're on our way there

I saw Texas she looked so fine
I met some other people same story as mine
Laughin' and drinkin' waitin' for the sun to go down
We had life in our eyes as we crossed the border line
Shot six good men without tellin' them why
How could anybody steal the only thing a man has left

Wipe away your tears maria
There's a better life for us somewhere
Let me see you smile maria
Close your eyes we're on our way there",Maria,1993
Chorus,"I know you,
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you,
That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know its true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if i know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.
Once upon a night,
I dreamed we'd be together
In love forever.
Once upon a night,
I was wishing for a never,
A never ending.
Once upon a night
Once upon a time
Once upon a wish
Once upon a dream.",Finale,1993

Tho' your dreams
Be tossed and blown
Walk on
Walk on

Chorus,"If it were love I would give
That love every second I had and I do
Did I know where he'd lead me to?
Did I plan, doing all of this for the love of a man?

Well I let it happen anyhow
And what I'm feeling now
Has no easy explanation
Reason plays no part

Heaven help my heart
I love him too much
What if he saw my whole existence
Turning around a word, a smile, a touch?

One of these days, and it won't be long
He'll know more about me than he should
All my dreams will be understood, no surprise
Nothing more to learn from the look in my eyes

Don't you know that time is not my friend
I'll fight it to the end
Hoping to keep that best of moments
When the passions start

Heaven help my heart
The day that I find
Suddenly I've run out of secrets
Suddenly I'm not always on his mind

Maybe it's best to love a stranger
Well, that's what I've done
Heaven help my heart
Heaven help my heart

Chorus,"Some think the world is made for fun and frolic,
And so do I!
Some think it well to be all melancholic,

Is far from wrong!

Echoes sound afar! funiculi, funicula`.

Some think it wrong to set the feet a-dancing,
But not so I;
Some think that eyes should keep from coyly glancing
Upon the sly!
But oh! to me the mazy dance is charming,
Divinely sweet,
And surely there is nought that is alarming
In nimble feet?
Listen! Listen! music sounds afar!
Listen! Listen! music sounds afar!
Funiculi funicula`, funiculi funicula`,
Music sounds afar! funiculi, funicula`.

Ah me! 'tis strange that some should take to sighing,
And like it well;
For me, I have not thought it worth the trying,
So cannot tell!
With laugh and dance and song the day soon passes,
Full soon is gone,
For mirth was made for joyous lads and lasses
To call their own!

Only a song dying away, 
Only a smile to keep in memory, 
Until we meet another day! 

Only a rose to whisper,

Chorus,"The gold of Cortés
The jewels of Pizarro
Will seem like mere trinkets

The gold we find here
Will dwarf them by far

Dig up Virginia, boys

Mine, boys, mine ev'ry mountain
And dig, boys, dig 'til ya drop
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those lovely
Pebbles that sparkle and shine

Oh, how I love it!
Hey nonny nonny
Riches for Cheap!
Hey nonny nonny
There'll be heaps of it
And I'll be on top of the heap!

My rivals back home
It's not that I'm bitter
But think how they'll squirm
When they see how I glitter!
The ladies at court
The king will reward me
He'll knight me, no, lord me!

It's mine, mine, mind
For the taking
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold!
With those nuggets dug

It's glory they'll gimme
My dear friend, King Jimmy
Will probably build me a shrine
When all of the gold is mine

Dig and dig and dig and diggety
Dig and dig and dig and diggety-dig!
All of my life, I have searched for a land
Like this one
A wilder, more challenging country
I couldn't design
Hundreds of dangers await
And I don't plan to miss one
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame
The greatest adventure is mine!

Keep on working, lands
Don't be shirking, lands
Mine, boys, mind
Mine me that gold
Beautiful gold
Make this island
My land!
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
But I've got this crick in me spine
This land we behold
This beauty untold
A man can be bold!
It all can be sold!

And the gold
Is
Mine!
Mine!

Chorus,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

If you are there beside me
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

I was so afraid, now I realize
Love is never wrong and so it never dies
There's a perfect world shining in your eyes

And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you
They'd know love will find a way
Anywhere we go, we're home
If we are there together
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way
I know love will find a way",Love Will Find a Way,1998
Chorus,"Hush, my little one; you must be exhausted.
Sleep, my little Kovu
Let your dreams take wing
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king
I've been exiled, persucuted
Left alone with no defense
When I think of what that brute did
I get a little tense
But I dream a dream so pretty
That I don't feel so depressed
'Cause it soothes my inner kitty
And it helps me get some rest
The sound of Simba's dying gasp
His daughter squealing in my grasp
His lionesses' mournful cry
That's my lullaby
Now the past I've tried forgetting
And my foes I could forgive
Trouble is I knows it's petty
But I hate to let them live
So you found yourself somebody who'd chase Simba up a tree
Oh, the battle may be bloody, but that kind of works for me
The melody of angry growls
A counterpoint of painful howls
A symphony of death, oh my!
That's my lullaby
Scar is gone... but Zira's still around
To love this little lad
Till he learns to be a killer
With a lust for being bad!
Sleep, ya little termite!
Uh-- I mean, precious little thing!
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king!
The pounding of the drums of war
The thrill of Kovu's mighty roar
The joy of vengeance
Testify!
I can hear the cheering
Kovu! What a guy!
Payback time is nearing
And then our flag will fly
Against a blood-red sky
That's my lullaby!",My Lullaby,1998
Chorus,"Deception, disgrace
Evil as plain as the scar on his face
Deception, an outrage
Disgrace, for shame
He asked for trouble the moment he came

Deception, an outrage
Disgrace, for shame
You know these outsider types
Evil as plain as the scar on his face
See ya later, agitator
Deceive us 
Deception, an outrage
Disgrace, for shame
He'll not go back with you
He asked for trouble the moment he came
See ya later, agitator
Born in greed, raised in hate
Helpless to defy his fate
Let him run, let him live
But do not forget what we cannot forgive
And he is not one of us
He has never been one of us
He is not part of us, not our kind
Someone once lied to us
Now we're not so blind
For we knew he would do what he's done
And we know that he'll never be one of us
He is not one of us
Deception, disgrace
Deception, disgrace

Chorus,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1998
Chorus,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?

Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

Chorus,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,1999

It was dark in his arms and I lost my way

From the dark came a voice
And it seemed to say
There you go
There you go

How I felt as I fell I just can't recall
But his arms held me fast and it broke the fall

And I said to my heart
As it foolishly kept jumping all around
I got lost but look what I found

It would bore me terrifically,too,

I can stand the sight of worms
And look at microscopic germs
But technicolor pachyderms is really too much for me

I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seeing things you know that ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright

What a sight!

I'm afraid, need your aid

Chorus,"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

Chorus,"A secret, a secret, he says I've got a little secret,
A secret, a secret, a secret kind of secret.
I' aching for to shout it to every daffodil
And tell the world about it, in fact I think I will.

If this isn't love, the whole world is crazy.
If this isn't love, I'm daft as a daisy,
With moons all a-round and cows jumping over,
There's something amiss, and I'll eat my hat if this isn't love.

If this isn't love, then winter is a summer,
If this isn't love, my heart needs a plumber
I'm swinging on stars, I'm riding on rainbows,
I'm busting with bliss and I'll kiss your hand if this isn't love.",If This Isn't Love,2004
Chorus,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Prelude/Look to the Rainbow (Main Title),2004
Chorus,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed

Aladdin's Lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you.",Long Ago (And Far Away),2004

In the world of love that you keep in your eyes

Chorus,"What happened to the world we knew,
when we would dream and scheme and while the time away,
I have a dream, so did you.
Life was warms, love was true,
Two kids who followed all the rules, yester-fools, 
and now, now it seems those yester-dreams were just a cruel 
and foolish game we used to play,
yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.
 
Where did it go, that yester-glow
When we could feel the wheel of life turn our way.
Yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.
When I recall what we had,
I feel lost, I feel sad.
With nothing but the mem'ry of yester-love
and now now it seems those yester-dreams were just a cruel 
and foolish game we used to play,
yester-me, yester-you, yester-day.

Chorus,"Little town
It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say

Bonjour bonjour
Bonjour bonjour bonjour

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good morning, Belle
Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?

Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've, I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you off to?

To return this book to Pere Robert, it's about to lovers in fair Verona
Sound boring

Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

Bonjour, good day
How is your family?
Bonjour, good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive!
There must be more than this provincial life!

Ah, If it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?

Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?

I'm afraid not
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big

Bon voyage

Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!

Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best

But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined

Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of

Mmm je ne sais quoi?

I don't know what that means

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound,  excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so

There must be more than this provincial life!

Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!

Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!

It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in

'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle",Belle,2011

I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you,
That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know its true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if i know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.
Once upon a night,
I dreamed we'd be together
In love forever.

I was wishing for a never,
A never ending.

Once a year we turn all Paris upside down

Once a year the ugliest will wear a crown

And it's the day we do the things that we deplore

In a bra now, can you pull it off
Grew up on a rock get stoned cold

Please, I beg to survive. but nothing's gonna help me

The e-mail pisses me off, the faceless shit cuts like a knife
Starbucks pisses me off, 5 bucks a cup, what the fuck is up?
Cause my life pisses me off, I'm just a pawn in the human race

It's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me

The terrorist pisses me off, with his fucking heard the kind of the weird
And the war it pisses me off, the prices rise, the market fries
But the protests pisses me off pisses me off, you raise your sign and fucking whine

Where niggas pack everyday, and everybody crowd to eat
24/7, no time to sleep
A g and up, reign up, 3 times a week

Throwing numbers on the strip
The youngin' out the clique
Moves like Carl Lewis when it's coming out the clip
Uh, Still in school, all the learning I can get

Focused, trying to purchase all the burners I can get
I know plenty niggas fell, trying to chauffer through this shit
These niggas tell, then a murder gon exist
It's no joke in the hood

Especially when the boat ain't make it across
And we ain't got no coke in the hood
That's where rap come in at, more notes in a book
Dro in the woods, Mom dukes trying to lay low in the woods

"Chris ""F.L.O."" Conner","Yeah...for my street niggas

The sun never shines in the ghetto 
It always rains in the hood 
Heavy metals ring in the ghetto 
Everybody moves Cain in the hood (everybody move them things)
This for my niggas who stay in the ghetto (to my niggas stay in the ghetto)

It's lots of shine in the ghetto
Too many haters in the hood (too hard, niggas be hatin)
Gotta watch what you doin 
The ghetto only cop black shine in the hood (Freeway, Young Gunz)
This for my niggas who thug like shaked lights in the ghetto (Oschino)

Yo we gotta, hollow the gat, bottle the smack
When the cops pull up we gotta swallow the crack
All my niggas did time like Geronimo Prep
See the Benz like damn, what model is that
Oschino, the nigga who was locked in a cage
Niggas clockin my style like flavor flave
Fuck gettin the Source Award, or gettin Five Mics
I'm happy just gettin my daughter a pink bike
A roof over her head and some Barbie skates
It's plenty of nights man, I hardly ate
I'm from where the summers dangerous, the winters is cold
And bitches pop Van X's like birth control
I got bitches on death row, stuck with a cell number
So close to Jesus they got his cell number
The ghetto is trife, this is my life
How many rappers you know been down for murder twice?

Yo what up wit ch'all niggas
What it look like?
Throw it in the pot, see if the shit cook right
We can get it down, see if it bubble white or brown
Take it to the town and break my youngin's down
It's doin good, business is lookin fine
Get 'em for 20, but maybe 29
Youngin out on his grind, youngin poppin 'em nine's
I'm a juvenile delinquent, youngin was doin time
Cause Judge Reynold's left it up to my mom (what else?)
And I was thinkin like, damn ain't that crazy?
But mom duke's can't live without her baaaby
I'm back home, thrity eight strong, out on my own
Thinkin, get it wit chrome
Fuck makin them songs, but my mind right now
And this rap shit be my grind right now (now...now...)

You want to shit on? I'm on your boy like the narc's on 'em
You ever heard a nigga's lawyer scared to talk for him?
Creep in the dark on him, the led bark on him
I'm on his head til the Fed's spread chalk for him
That's how we do it dawg, these the last days
Yeah I had my bad days, I been through it ch'all
But I grew back (grew back)
Got my groove back (groove back)
That's how we do in trainin, cockin them two's back
Same dudes namin', givin up news
Gettin up on the stand, endin up on the news
It's fucked up what that pressure'll do
And you don't want to fuck up when they questionin you
Lecturin you, tryin to get shit up outta you
Crucial beatdowns til the bitch come up outta you
Cris come up outta you, dough that ain't right to do
Put that dough and get your body viewed

Let me get five for twenty, or seven for thrity
That shit that you hear in the ghetto
They don't care in the hood
Cop four twenties and seven thirties
Then niggas disappear from the ghetto
Get snatched from the hood
Feds grab 'em, and some get put in the dirt
Some live in grime, good with the work
Stick up kids get hit with the nine
But the funeral parlor good with embalming fluid
Good with the hearst
Some niggas don't even grind
But still make a stack every other night, good with the dice
So it don't even matter, get hungry in the hood
Miss Low is sharp with the platters, good with the rice
And her daughter's just like her
Shootouts, they stash my guns, and I got away good with the knives
The end of the nights, stash my ones
Cause I'm good with the rocks, the smokers good with pipes

[Oschino]
We all started innocent
Eating Reese's Pieces
I was young, then wearing 5 star Aleses
Bullet in ya gut a have a bag catch ya feces

20 months, vision quest, sleeping in a tepee
Since my dad died, attitude worsened
That's why I stole cars before I could write cursive
Thousand miles from being rich, stuck on my grind

Try to sale nickel bags like Louie Baton
I'm young, I'm good, best shape of my life
One shot from big shit a blow you out of ya Nikes
Only a dick head wouldn't want to be rich

And do his car like school and drop out in the 6
You could look at my wrist, It wasn't shit on it
But I was determined to get a little gliss on em
The 40 ounce bottles done turned to Cris on em
And every bitch that was fronting, I'ma piss on em

[Beanie Sigel]
My hood dog
Like any average one
You know the dirty kids on the block having fun
Hand to hand is how the grams is slung

In tanned Timberlands and [unknown] until them vans a come
It's all good now
But you remember those latter days
Them tubleware, soul food platter days

That was ya mom little hustle on a Saturdays
Back then, when it really didn't matter days
You would take that beating
'Cause you wasn't trying to be

The only one who missed the house party on the weekend
Knowing that them project chicks was in there freaking
Grinding off ""As We Lay""
Walk with me why'all

Back in the Day, you and ya man slap tapping away
Pitching chains, playing craps everyday
Getting high on the block
Green bottles of private stock

2 dollar 40's
Sparks tell ya story

[Chorus]

[Sparks]
I come up fragile and timid
Pressed to the limit
12 years old, no household
From the start I was finished

Disowned by the biologicals
And adopted by rolling stones on corners, sipping Thunderbird
Banging needles and pushing stolen Regals
And with no hoe and no money, layered my hunger pains daily with rice and gravy

Stuck between a rock and a hard spot as a juvenile
Just made me want to holla ""Lord help me""
But I had will power
Stole a burner from Uncle Lester

And that .22 long blossomed to wild flower
Now when I enter rooms the conversation stop
And them cock suckers whisper
These faggots ain't got no cahunas

So if they so much as touch me
I cock back and put like bananas on them mokey motherfuckers
Show no love for these cock suckers
Weeping

Who can't deal with life situations cause that's money to me
Uhh
Murder

Now who am I
Little nigga named Free from the hood

Plot, plot on

Now who am I
Little nigga named Free from the block

Make a living , make a killing on the block

What I'm trying to do now
Get my children off the block
And my real niggas, if they coming, clique come on
In my hood, F-are-double uh

Cock back, double pump
You rapping, I just happen to have some space in the trunk
89' dough, space in the front
Will ya hoe fit?

Beef come, we be dumping the whole clip
Having lunch, while you be fronting, be fucking ya hoe sick
Send her home, can't hump
Send my nigga's through ya block, can't pump

Grind, watch for the cops
Shit tucked
I'll be watching them lady CO's if I slip up
Uh Uh

Little nigga named Free from the block
What I do
Make a living , make a killing on the block

What I'm trying to do now
Get my children off the block
And my real niggas, if they coming, clique come on
In my hood, F-are-double uh

Cock back, double pump
You rapping, I just happen to have some space in the trunk
89' dough, space in the front
Will ya hoe fit?

Beef come, we be dumping the whole clip
Having lunch, while you be fronting, be fucking ya hoe sick
Send her home, can't hump
Send my nigga's through ya block, can't pump

Grind, watch for the cops

I'll be watching them lady CO's if I slip up

Yo, I'm saying Mac, I know I'm young and all

[Chris]
Yo I was brought up in the wildest streets
Where niggas pack everyday, and everybody crowd to eat
24/7, no time to sleep
A g and up, reign up, 3 times a week

Throwing numbers on the strip
The youngin' out the clique
Moves like Carl Lewis when it's coming out the clip
Uh, Still in school, all the learning I can get

Focused, trying to purchase all the burners I can get
I know plenty niggas fell, trying to chauffer through this shit
These niggas tell, then a murder gon exist
It's no joke in the hood

Especially when the boat ain't make it across
And we ain't got no coke in the hood
That's where rap come in at, more notes in a book

It's lots of shine in the ghetto
Too many haters in the hood (too hard, niggas be hatin)

The ghetto only cop black shine in the hood (Freeway, Young Gunz)
This for my niggas who thug like shaked lights in the ghetto (Oschino)

Yo we gotta, hollow the gat, bottle the smack
When the cops pull up we gotta swallow the crack
All my niggas did time like Geronimo Prep
See the Benz like damn, what model is that
Oschino, the nigga who was locked in a cage
Niggas clockin my style like flavor flave
Fuck gettin the Source Award, or gettin Five Mics
I'm happy just gettin my daughter a pink bike
A roof over her head and some Barbie skates
It's plenty of nights man, I hardly ate
I'm from where the summers dangerous, the winters is cold
And bitches pop Van X's like birth control
I got bitches on death row, stuck with a cell number
So close to Jesus they got his cell number
The ghetto is trife, this is my life
How many rappers you know been down for murder twice?

Yo what up wit ch'all niggas
What it look like?
Throw it in the pot, see if the shit cook right
We can get it down, see if it bubble white or brown
Take it to the town and break my youngin's down
It's doin good, business is lookin fine
Get 'em for 20, but maybe 29
Youngin out on his grind, youngin poppin 'em nine's
I'm a juvenile delinquent, youngin was doin time
Cause Judge Reynold's left it up to my mom (what else?)
And I was thinkin like, damn ain't that crazy?
But mom duke's can't live without her baaaby
I'm back home, thrity eight strong, out on my own
Thinkin, get it wit chrome
Fuck makin them songs, but my mind right now

Get snatched from the hood
Feds grab 'em, and some get put in the dirt
Some live in grime, good with the work
Stick up kids get hit with the nine
But the funeral parlor good with embalming fluid
Good with the hearst
Some niggas don't even grind
But still make a stack every other night, good with the dice
So it don't even matter, get hungry in the hood
Miss Low is sharp with the platters, good with the rice
And her daughter's just like her
Shootouts, they stash my guns, and I got away good with the knives
The end of the nights, stash my ones
Cause I'm good with the rocks, the smokers good with pipes

"Chris ""The Glove"" Taylor","Hey, boy!

Once upon a time a DJ's task
Was just to play records, what more could you ask?
But then came remixes, scratching and cuts
Which was too much for many, drove some DJ's nuts
But the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme
As the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene
So listen to him, check him out, but remember this
When the Glove's on the wheels of steel he's reckless

This high-powered music is truly unique
As the Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat
He moves like a madman as he spins his disc
He's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's reckless

Now I've seen DJ's, too many to name
Some gained recognition and even fame
But when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best
And when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's reckless

So listen very closely as the Glove throws down
He cuts like a razor to the big beat sound
Dave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like
With the Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're reckless

So listen to the music, let your mind feel free
Realize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E
Dave and MC Ice-T, you know you're with the best
Because when we're in the mix you know the groove is fresh
And reckless, reckless, reck-reck-re-reckless",Reckless,1984

Chris Amoo,"At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way
And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it

A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilby, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said (ah, ah)
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilby came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving: rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilby feared there was a man inside trying to escape 

He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him before 
He could burn himself on the metal

Are a million to one, he said (ah, ah)

Are a million to one, but still, they come",The Eve of the War [Early Band Take],1981

After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day

Chris Anderson,"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

Chris Anderson,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,2002
Chris Anderson,"Oh, there's a lull in my life 
It's just a void and empty space 
When you are not in my embrace
Oh, there's a lull In my life 
The moment that you go away 
There is no night, there is no day
The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops but the flame in my heart 
That keeps burning, burning
Oh, oh, oh
There's a lull In my life 
No matter how I may pretend
I know that you alone can end",There's a Lull in My Life,2002
Chris Anderson,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Chris Anderson,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Chris Anderson,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Chris Anderson,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1998
Chris Anderson,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1998

And I'll be at your side forevermore

Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again

Ohh I'm so glad I finally found you
You're that one in a million man
When you wrap your lovin' arms around me
I can stand up and face the world again

Got time and a story to tell 
Started when I was nine years old 
Woke up and daddy was gone 
I started hustling and the couldn't tell me nothing 
Fronting in the hood, trying to be somebody 
My soul was on empty 
I was searching for something 
Tried to be good 
Tried to keep from trouble 
Living too fast 
Trying to make a good hustle 

Sometimes it gets rough 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Times got hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta walk to work 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta do a little dirt 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Wasn' really looking guess I found it 
Five foot three light brown skinned 
Coming from the university 
Lifestyle looking kind of lovely 
Didn't know she had much game 
Down to ride out, even take the train 
Even take her to a poker game 
Top notch fried chicken and sushi 
Tried to be good 
Tried to treat you like a lady 
Tried to be your friend 
Turned out that you were shady 

Sometimes it gets lonely 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times ain't what they seem to be 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Some times would get the best of me 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Well, tried to be good (I tried, I tried) 
Wanted nothing but to love somebody 
Didn't want to die young 
Steady hustling trying to feed my family 
Too scared to have kids and like daddy did 
'Cause I'm so scared of failing 
Sometimes it gets hard 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 

Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta moan 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta cry a little louder 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you gotta fight the pain 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get a little worried 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes you get lost out of touch 
Comin' from where I'm from, I'm from 
Sometimes I think I pray a little to much

If that's what loves about I ain't with that
If I didn't wanna be with you I would've just hit that
And never call back
That's my word don't forget that
You know what never mind
And it's always your fault never mind
Pick a better line
Cause I don't know nothin' 'bout us gettin' back together again
Boo never again
Maybe I shouldn't say never
But in due time I hope I find something better

I see You in the rain
I see You in the laughter
I feel You through the pain

Everything that You have made is beautiful
Oh, my God, I can't believe my eyes
But in all of this to think that You would think of me
Makes my heart come alive

Your love is like a mighty fire deep inside my bones
I feel like I could climb a thousand mountains all at once
And I never have to wonder if somebody cares for me
I love the Maker
And the Maker loves me
And the Maker loves me

I see You, You are creation
I see the grandness of Your majesty
The universe is singing all Your glory
I can't believe You live inside of me

Everything that You have made is beautiful

And I never have to wonder if somebody cares for me
I love the Maker
And the Maker loves me

More than just some words upon a page
You've shown me in a million ways
But there is one that stands above them all
Hands of creation on a cross
The Maker, yeah

Your love is like a mighty fire deep inside my bones

Chris August,"I've been living in this house here
Since the day that I was born
These walls have seen me happy
But most of all they've seen me torn
They've heard the screaming matches
That made a family fall apart
They've had a front row seat
To the breaking of my heart

7 times 70 times
I'll do what it takes to make it right
I thought the pain was here to stay
But forgiveness made a way
7 times 70 times
There's healing in the air tonight
I'm reaching up to pull it down
Gonna wrap it all around

I remember running down the hallway
Playing hide-and-seek
I didn't know that I was searching
For someone to notice me
I felt alone and undiscovered
And old enough to understand
Just when I'm s'posed to be learning to love you
Let me doubt again

7 times 70 times
I'll do what it takes to make it right
I thought the pain was here to stay
But forgiveness made a way
7 times 70 times
There's healing in the air tonight
I'm reaching up to pull it down
Gonna wrap it all around

I lost count of the ways you let me down
But no matter how many times you weren't around
I'm all right now

God picked up my heart and helped me through
And shined a light on the one thing left to do
And that's forgive you
I forgive you

7 times 70 times
If that's the cost I'll pay the price
7 times 70 times
I'll do what it takes to make it right
I thought the pain was here to stay
But forgiveness made a way

Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn

How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there

And He will restore

I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

I got a fire in my belly, fire in my head
Gonna hi-di-hi 'til I'm dead

Sister Sue, short and stout
She didn't grow up, she grew out
Mama thinks she's pretty and she's bein' kind
Papa thinks she's lovely and he's half blind
Don't let her out much except at night
I don't care 'cause I'm all right

Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
And the young folks lay on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them bad times away from my door

Brother Gene, he's big and mean
He don't have much to say
He had a little woman that he'd whoop each day
But now she's gone away
Got drunk last night kickin' mama down the stairs
And I'm all right and I don't care

Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
And the young folks lay on the floor
Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
Keep them bad times away from my door

Chris Barber,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
Has my lover Johnny man been here?

He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong. 
Yeah Frankie looked over the transom door
And then to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny

Makin' love to Nellie Bly
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44

And through that hardwood (door) floor
Yeah she shot her man (yeah he was her man)

Yeah, you better walk right,
You'd better not gamble
And sure thing better not fight.
The next thing you know
The sheriff gonna arrest you
And some judge send you down
And you can bet your bottom dollar
Lord, you'll be chain gang bound,
Chain gang bound. 

Let the midnight special
Let the midnight
Shine its light on me
Shine, shine, shine, shine,
Let the midnight special
Shine on,
Shine its ever-loving light on me
Shine on me, yeah. 

Let the midnight special
Shine, shine, shine,
Shine its light on me
Shine, shine on me,
Let the midnight special
Way into midnight,
Shine its ever-loving light on me
Way into midnight, baby,
Let the midnight special
Waah...",Midnight Special,2005
