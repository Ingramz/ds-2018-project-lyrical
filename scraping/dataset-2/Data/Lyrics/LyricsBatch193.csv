Eduardo Galeano,"Oriol Vall
Que se ocupa de los recién nacidos 
En un hospital de Barcelona
Dice que el primer gesto humano es el abrazo

Después de salir al mundo
Al principio de sus días
Los bebés manotean
Como buscando a alguien

Otros médicos
Que se ocupan de los ya vividos
Dicen que los viejos
Al fin de sus días
Mueren queriendo alzar los brazos

Y así es la cosa
Por muchas vueltas que le demos al asunto
Por muchas palabras que le pongamos

A eso, así de simple
Se reduce todo
Entre dos aleteos
Sin más explicación
Transcurre el viaje",Intro: El Viaje,2014
Eduardo Gatti,"Tu silueta
Va caminando
Con el alma triste why dormida
Ya la aurora no es nada nuevo
Pa' tus ojos grandes
why pa' tu frente
Ya el cielo why sus estrellas
Se quedaron mudos, lejanos why muertos
Pa' tu mente ajena

Nos hablaron
Una vez, cuando niños
Cuando la vida se muestra entera
Que el futuro, que cuando grande
Ahí murieron ya los momentos
Sembraron así su semilla
why tuvimos miedo, temblamos
why en eso se nos fue la vida

Cada uno aferrado a sus dioses
Producto de toda una historia
Los modelan why los destruyen
why según eso ordenan sus vidas.
En la frente les ponen monedas
En sus largas manos les cuelgan candados,
Letreros why rejas.

Eduardo Reyes,"¡¡Hector y Tito!
¡Haciendo la diferencia!
¡A la reconquista!

En una disco, nos conocimos
Tu estabas sola, yo estaba solo

En una disco, nos conocimos
Y así bailando como locos nos quisimos
Tu estabas sola, yo estaba solo
Y entre las sombras de la noche nos perdimos

Tu querías bailar
Aquí te traigo yo mi ritmo
Mueve las caderas y se desata un cataclismo
Bien pegadito, junto a juntito

Para quedarnos tu y yo abrazaditos
Tu piel canela, con sabrosura
Me va llevando poco a poco a la locura

En una disco, nos conocimos
Y así bailando como locos nos quisimos
Tu estabas sola, yo estaba solo
Y entre las sombras de la noche nos perdimos

Oye mi canción que tiene crema de la buena
Sóbate, mi amor, porque te quema que te quema
Te di mi trago y tu bebistes

Y los secretos de mi vida conocistes
Bese tu boca, mordí tus labios
Lo que paso después mejor sin comentarios

En una disco, nos conocimos
Tu estabas sola, yo estaba solo

Bailalo, bailalo
Baila, baila, bailalo
Bailalo, bailalo
Baila, baila, bailalo

Bien pegadito, junto a juntito
Para quedarnos tu y yo abrazaditos
Tu piel canela, con sabrosura
Me va llevando poco a poco a la locura

En una disco, nos conocimos
Y así bailando como locos nos quisimos
Tu estabas sola, yo estaba solo
Y entre las sombras de la noche nos perdimos

Oye mi canción que tiene crema de la buena
Sóbate, mi amor, porque te quema que te quema
Te di mi trago y tu bebistes
Y los secretos de mi vida conocistes

En una disco, nos conocimos
Y así bailando como locos nos quisimos
Tu estabas sola, yo estaba solo
Y entre las sombras de la noche nos perdimos

En una disco, nos conocimos
Y asi bailando como locos nos quisimos
Tu estabas sola, yo estaba solo
Y entre las sombras de la noche nos perdimos

En una disco, nos conocimos
Y así bailando como locos nos quisimos
Tu estabas sola, yo estaba solo

Eduardo Tancredi,"Bewitched, Bewitched,
You've got me in your spell.
Bewitched, Bewitched,
You know your craft so well.
Before I knew what I was doing
I looked in your eyes
That brand of woo you've been brewin'
Took me by surprise.

You witch, you witch,
One thing is for sure.
That stuff you pitch
Just hasn't got a cure.
My heart was under lock and key,
But somehow it got unhitched.
I never thought that I could be had
But now I'm caught and I'm kinda glad
To be Bewitched.",Bewitched,1998
Edurne,"Ven, y abrazame otra vez que no puedo dormir
Me cuesta ser feliz Se, que nada volvera
Que nos falto escuchar, es tarde para hablar
Ves, aquello que se va, es nuesto 
Amor que esta cansado de esperar
No se porque te quiero sin querer
Me asusta verte bien, arrastrame esta vez

Hablo de amores dormidos, un album de fotos que sigue vacio
De frio en la cama, de frio contigo y un sordo paseo por el boulevard
Hablo de amores dormidos que sienten de besos 
Prohibidos y se hacen mil trampas que no juegan limpio
Que miran sentados la vida pasar

Tu, prefieres dibujar y yo quiero pintar el mismo despertar
Se, que todo esto paso porque lo tuve yo tuvimos mas valor
Asi que ven y dime que esta vez me quieres proteger del sueño que te hable

Hablo de amores dormidos, un album de fotos que sigue vacio
De frio en la cama, de frio contigo y un sordo paseo por el boulevard
Hablo de amores dormidos que sienten de besos 
Prohibidos y se hacen mil trampas que no juegan limpio
Que miran sentados la vida pasar

Te di mi voluntad, las ganas de luchar
Aunque con dormido a mal amigo mio ese miedo a despertar

Hablo de amores dormidos, un album de fotos que sigue vacio
De frio en la cama, de frio contigo y un sordo paseo por el boulevard
Hablo de amores dormidos que sienten de besos 
Prohibidos y se hacen mil trampas que no juegan limpio
Que miran sentados la vida pasar

Hablo de amores dormidos, que solo acarician sus hijos
Que fueron tan buenos amigos, que ya no podrán despertar",Amores Dormidos,2006
Edurne,"Estás a punto de explotar, se te escapa 
La vida, en un abrir y cerrar
Llegó la hora de poner cada cosa en su lugar
Y no mirar hacia atrás 
Porque no es fácil dejarse la piel y saber 
Que te volverá a ocurrir, otra vez 

Dices que el amor te enloqueció, se acercó 
A ti y te contagió con su dolor silencioso 
Como pudiste ocultármelo, no he parado de 
Pensar porque razón es tu dolor, tan silencioso 

No te escondas, eso no te ayudará a reconstruir tu valor 
Date prisa porque no hay tiempo que perder, 
Y debes continuar tu rumbo 
Porque es mas fácil desaparecer y saber que 
Te volverás a hacer daño 

Dices que el amor te enloqueció, se acercó a ti 
Y te contagió con su dolor silencioso Como pudiste 
Ocultármelo, no he parado de pensar porque razón 
Es tu dolor, tan silencioso 

Ahora las palabras se las lleva el viento 
Y no te cansas de correr 
Pero aunque te duele, no me dejes de querer 
De querer 

Dices que el amor te enloqueció, se acercó 
A ti y te contagió con su dolor silencioso 
Como pudiste ocultármelo, no he parado de pensar 
Porque razón es tu dolor, tan silencioso

Pulling and plucking up all of your flowers

They mean so much to me
The time is gone. The feelings last.

Sometimes a curse that hurts so much
Sometimes a blessing is the deal
Like a diamond I can't touch
Like a dream that seems for real

Well I don't have the real thing
It's the only choice I got
And the spirit's on the wing
So I lose my train of thought

Can't Kiss A Memory
Can't taste a thought about the past
They mean so much to me
The time is gone. The feelings last.",Can't Kiss a Memory,

I feel alone.
Always like to live on the safe side.
But now I'm gone.

Never cared to learn of a different way.
I need to break.
Living the life of someone else these days.
A dumb mistake.

I Know, I Know 

""I'm going crazy..."" ""Just can't find the time...""
A bad excuse.
Selling lies cause it's the easy way. 
A lame abuse.

So clear. So real.
Seeing places that I've never been
And they seem ideal

I want you to stay. Help me find my way.
Remember me.
Tears and laughter... Joy and disaster... Remember me.

I'm caught within an endless dream.
The time it passes slowly.
I hear the wind, there's no one there
I need you now. Console me.

Consider me.
The growing fear doesn't disappear.
Talk to me.
Soothing words. Singing birds. Sing to me.

I see the clock the hands don't move.
The time it passes slowly.
I sit inside this empty room.
I need for you to show me.

Just love me again.
Fill the life that time has left inside me.
Care for me.
I need you more than ever. My world isn't getting better. Care for me.

I look inside and feel alone.
The time it passes slowly.
I feel your love around my heart.
I need for you to hold me.

Edward Huerta,"It's dark out here, but I'm standing fearless
And nobody knows, where I'm going to
A little smile on my face, and a sense of wander
Words in my mouth, never rang so true

Walking alone on a River of Silence
Clearing my mind, no worries inside
The wind is blowing, taking troubles away
Feeling alive in the valley of life
On the River of Silence, On the River of Silence

My whispering thoughts, might get loud tomorrow
The birth of hope, seems finally real
I can hear my breath, inside my ears
I'm taking a break, from the noise I hear

Walking alone on a River of Silence
Clearing my mind, no worries inside
The wind is blowing, taking troubles away
Feeling alive in the valley of life

I'm up in the morning, feeling kinda small
The lady's sleeping and the writing's on the wall
And I say baby, you're looking kinda lazy
She flips me the bird and no I don't mean maybe

Sometimes I'm quite unsure, Why I put up with her at all
Well then in time you see, It all comes back to me
She Makes Me Crazy

Sometimes I'm quite unsure, Why I put up with her at all

Storms start rolling in
Something moves me forward.
Helps me walk between the winds.

Clouds begin to gather.
They hide the stars.
My eyes on the horizon...
The Zebra isn't far

The land before me, 
Seems too low. Seems too high.
The hills... The valleys...
Is where The Zebra meets the sky.

Gotta follow the path. Walk the talk.
Fear is the gate.
One day I'll kiss the border, 
Where the new horizon waits.

I'm not so sure of things today.
I'm in a constant haze.
Sunrise brings darkness.
Dawn's seen better days.

I won’t look behind me.
I won't go where I've been.
Something pulls me forward.
The Zebra shines again.",Shiny Zebra,

Edward Huerta,"Only a moment ago we had nothing but time.
Everything lasted forever. Your life was all mine.
Only a dream I know, thinking you'd never go
Tearing off pieces of myself
During the time that's coming

Fold my heart up small. Don't break it into pieces
Find somewhere and keep it there
Take It Where You Go

Staring right into my face, in front of my eyes
I saw it coming but still I was caught by surprise
All of this time I knew that I'd be missing you
That doesn't mean that it's OK
That doesn't mean that I was ready

Fold my heart up small. Don't break it into pieces
Find somewhere and keep it there
Take It Where You Go

Some things you'll always remember. Some things I'll regret.
No time to make it up now. It's time to forget.
That's no good for anyone. But there're still times I come undone.
I felt that I was less than what I was.
I felt so sorry.

But fold my heart up small. Don't break it into pieces
Find somewhere and keep it there

To turn my life upside down 
There you were, looking so pretty 
Crazy lady, I adore your look so much

Sparkling eyes, a hell of a body 
You really are one of a kind 

I wanna live the dream, Cause I've been waiting for so long 
If you, want to 
You seem to know me well, Better than everyone else 
It's true, you do 
We make the perfect blend, Don't wanna be just your friend 
I want more, from you 
Walk into my life. Take a chance on me. 
Will You? Will You? 

I still recall the night that you kissed me 
You gave me something to believe in 
Stealing time just to be by your side 
Waiting for the sign, a cheesy catchy line 

I feel the best is yet to come 
Destiny's on its way 
I'm full of passion, I feel alive 
What you got is way more than enough

I wanna live the dream, Cause I've been waiting for so long

Edward Nell,"Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle on
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the West commences
To many words, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
And I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

Oh give me land, lots of land, and the starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
Don't fence me in

No, Papa, don't you fence me in",Don't Fence Me In,1994
Edward Powell & The Samuel Goldwyn Studio Orchestra,"Nothing seemed to matter any more,
Didn't care what I was headed for.
Time was standing still,
No one counted till
There came a knocking at the door.

Love walked right in and drove the shadows away,
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day.
One magic moment, and my heart seemed to know
That love said Hello! 
Though no a word was spoken.

One look and I forgot the gloom of the past,
One look and I had found my future at last.
One look and I had found a world completely new,
When love walked in, with you.",Love Walked In [outtake],2000
Edward Redmayne,"The time is near
So near it's stirring the blood in their veins!
And yet beware
Don't let the wine go to your brains!
We need a sign
To rally the people
To call them to arms
To bring them in line!

Marius, wake up!
What's wrong today?
You look as if you've seen a ghost.
Some wine and say what's going on!

A ghost you say, a ghost maybe
She was just like a ghost to me
One minute there, then she was gone!

I am agog!
I am aghast!
Is Marius in love at last?
I've never heard him ooh and aah
You talk of battles to be won
And here he comes like Don Juan
It is better than an opera!

It is time for us all
To decide who we are
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now?
Have you asked of yourselves
What's the price you might pay?
Is it simply a game
For a rich young boy to play?
The colors of the worlds
Are changing day by day

Red, the blood of angry men!
Black the dark of ages past!
Red, a world about to dawn!
Black, the night that ends at last!

Had you seen her today
You might know how it feels
To be struck to the bone
In a moment of breathless delight!
Had you been there today
You might also have known
How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light!
And what was right seems wrong
And what was wrong seems right!

Red I feel my soul on fire!
Black, my world if she's not there!
Red, the color of desire!
Black, is the color of despair!

Marius, you're no longer a child
I do not doubt you mean it well
But now there is a higher call.
Who cares about your lonely soul?
We strive towards a larger goal
Our little lives don't count at all!

Red, the blood of angry men!
Black, the dark of ages past!
Red, a world about to dawn!
Black, the night that ends at last!

Listen everybody!
General Lamarque is dead!

Lamarque! His death is the hour of fate.
The people's man.
His death is the sign we await!

On his funeral day they will honor his name.
With the light of rebellion ablaze in their eyes
With their candles of grief we will kindle our flame
On the tomb of Lamarque shall our barricade rise
The time is here!
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts
But a jubilant shout
They will come one and all
They will come when we call!",ABC Cafe/Red and Black,2012
Edward Redmayne,"Monsieur, I bless your name
I am ready Fantine!
Monsieur, lay down your burden
At the end of my days
You’ve raised my child with love
She’s the best of my life
And you will be with God

Papa, papa, I do not understand
Are you all right?
Why did you go away

Cosette, my child
Am I forgiven now?
Thank god, thank god
I’ve lived to see this day

It’s you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It’s you who must forgive a thankless man
It’s thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet
Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home
To you

Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try.

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well when I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
The man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping

Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy.

Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory.

Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting
And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God.

Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of the people
Who are climbing to the light.

For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies.
Even the darkest night will end
and the sun will rise.

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord.
We will walk behind the plowshare
We will put away the sword.
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward.

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring

Ah!
Ah!
Tomorrow comes!",Epilogue,2012
Edward Redmayne,"In my life
She has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun
And my life seems to stop
As if something is over
And something has scarcely begun.
Eponine
You're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you I am at one with the Gods
And Heaven is near!
And I soar through a world that is new that is free

Every word that he says is a dagger in me!
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere, where he is
If he asked
I'd be his

In my life
There is someone who touches my life

Waiting near
Waiting here

A heart full of love
A heart full of song
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name
Dear Mademoiselle
Won't you say?
Will you tell?

A heart full of love
No fear, no regret
My name is Marius Pontmercy
And mine's Cosette
Cosette, I don't know what to say
Then make no sound
I am lost
I am found!

A heart full of love
(He was never mine to lose)
A heart full of you
(Why regret what cannot be?)
A single look and then I knew
I knew it too
(These are words he'll never say, not to me)
From today
(Not to me, no)

Every day
(His heart full of love)
For it isn't a dream
Not a dream after all

Edward Reekers,"Sweet Marjorie she's talking to me
I only say she's right
Knowing her that's the only way not to be here 
All night

Sweet Marjorie don't talk to me
Your eyes outshine the stars
Don't break the spell by saying 
Love is just a farce

She tells me I don't understand her point of view
And I admit I really think so too
My arguments don't ever seem to reach her
'No politics now, please'- but here we go again

She says ""now, this is where we disagree
You've got to open up your eyes and see
To live a periscope life like that

I'll tell you where I'm at
You may be better off dead""

She's so extreme, she won't let me dream
Won't let me love and caress
I'm always told to look around and conclude this
World's a mess

Sweet Marjorie, she's dining with me
I say let's order some food
Although the system's wrong 
The menu's looking good

I know the whole world fights and kills and hates
But lady must that always spoil our dates
I can't imagine that the world would end
If I would eat my steak now that it's warm

She says ""now, this is where we disagree
You've got to open up your eyes and see
To live a periscope life like that

Or just keep throwing facts
You may be better off dead""

She says ""now, this is where we disagree

Edward Reekers,"With a quivering voice you spoke the word
Shadow came between us, sharp as a sword
Gone is my gladness and vanished my pride
Cause luck didn't stay on our side

Lapped in luxury I cried for the moon
But the game is up, it all ended too soon
Awakening came as a bolt from the blue
At last rumours seemed to be true

[Chorus]
Oh my ruthless queen
You are still the treasure of my dream
It's the twinkle in your eyes
That took me my surprise
Oh my ruthless queen
I just can't accept our love has been

I bear you no malice, you'll show no remorse
Love is dead and gone it was no endless source
Your sudden leave was the finishing stroke
Considering everything broke

[Chorus]

Please don't tell me you couldn't care less
While I feel like a ship in distress
Oh my ruthless queen
I just can't accept our love has been

I can't bear to see you go
But it's all part of the show you perform
Letting romance fade little by little
Our love was precious but too brittle",Ruthless Queen,2007
Edward Ross,"When the cold of winter comes 
Starless night will cover day 
In the veiling of the sun 
We will walk in bitter rain 

But in dreams 
I can hear your name 
And in dreams 
We will meet again 

When the seas and mountains fall 
And we come, to end of days 
In the dark I hear a call 
Calling me there, 
I will go there 
And back again

Edward Sanders,"Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention, please? 
Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well 
At that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell? 
Yes they are, I can tell

Well, ladies and gentlemen
That aroma enriching the breeze 
Is like nothing compared to its succulent source
As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course

Ladies and gentlemen
You can't imagine the rapture in store
Just inside of this door! 

There you'll sample 
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies
Savory and sweet pies
As you'll see
You who eat pies

Throw the old woman out!

What's my secret? 
Frankly, dear — forgive my candor 
Family secret
All to do with herbs
Things like being 
Careful with your coriander
That's what makes the gravy grander

Eat them slow and 
Feel the crust, how thin I (she) rolled it! 
Eat them slow, 'cos 
Every one's a prize! 
Eat them slow, 'cos 
That's the lot and now we've sold it! 
Come again tomorrow

Hold it
Bless my eyes 
Fresh supplies! 

How about it, dearie? 
Be here in a twinkling! 
Just confirms my theory
Toby
God watches over us
Didn't have an inkling
Positively eerie

Is that a pie 
Fit for a king
A wondrous sweet 
And most delectable thing? 
You see, ma'am, why 
There is no meat pie

Herzlich willkommen! Oh!
Bushido! 
Yeah, DJ Destue! 
Sentino, hu!
Eine neue Zeit fängt an! Boom! 
Ha! Bara bam bam! 
Fickt euch!

Ich schreibe einen Hit für jeden Penner da draußen, 
Bin berühmter als die Rapper, die schon länger da draußen sind
Aus den Augen, aus dem Sinn, bye bye, geht Jungs
Wenn mein neues Album bald schon dein Scheiß Tape bumst 
1,2 Takes und die Bombe explodiert 
Du suchst Stress, okay, ich komme jetzt zu dir 
Du Idiot hast ein paar glückliche Fans 
Ich mach paar Model-Nutten glücklich vom Rücksitz vom Benz 
Denn es nützt nichts, denn du denkst, dass es dein Image rettet, 
wenn du nette Scheiße rappst als ob du beim Single chattest, ihr 
Kleinkinder hättet gern so viel Style, wie ich, 
Doch dein Flow hat mehr Lücken, als ein Polizei-Bericht 
Also hol die Mics, du Bitch, oder Soda mit Wasser 
Ich falle mit der Tür ins Haus, nenne mich Mohammed psst
Ab jetzt ist nun Berlin am Zug, das Ghetto im Regen 
Ich schlage zu, bis ich nächstes Jahr den Echo gewinne

Fick Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh
Deutschland, gib mir nur ein Song, ich schreib euch
Zehntausend Hits, geh raus und fick
Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh
Deutschland, gib mir nur ein Song, ich schreib euch
Zehntausend Hits, geh raus und fick

Lass uns wetten, wer als erstes im Benz hockt, 
Ich will grüne Scheine, dass mein Konto so aussieht, wie der Werder Bremen Fanblock
Ich bin Psycho, Psycho meine Ex hat Recht und 
ich mach Cash und du sitzt büß' im Büro 
Mir egal, mit welchen Tourbus du gekommen bist 
Warum ich jetzt zweimal im Bogen, wie das Logo von McDonald´s 
Ich wär' auf dem ganzen Globus was besonderes
wenn ich Fame bin und essen geh schieß' ein Foto von den Pommes 
Bei den Zeilen explodieren nun die Platten
Ich kann die Konkurrenz selber nicht sehen wie Tätowierungen im Nacken 
Bin nur hier, um es zu schaffen, der Rest kann gehen
Bring mir hundert MC´s her, bleiben sechs Mann stehen
Sechs von denen, werden nicht zum Problem falsch, schau mein Handgelenk an 
Es scheint noch greller, als das Licht im OP-Saal 
Also gebt mir ein Mic, gib's mir gleich, fick dir dein Weib
Sie schreit, gib's mir und weit, keiner sonst fickt sie so geil

Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh
Deutschland, gib mir nur ein Song, ich schreib euch
Zehntausend Hits, geh raus und fick

Ihr habt die Skyline gesehen, den Bordstein gehört 
Nicht mehr lang, und dann trägt auch Torch meine Shirts 
Vor zwei Jahren, kannten sie noch nicht mal meinen Namen 
Heute lassen alle Spaßten hier das Licht an beim Schlafen 
Klick Licht aus euer Albtraum ist back 
Du kriegst Schüttelfrost und 'ne viertel, halb kaum Respekt, warum? 
Weil du feige bist du Spinner bleibst nichts mehr, 
Als ein alter Sack, der sich von Kindern ein Vichs wär' 
Will etwas von mir Kommt her, ihr Hip Hop Teufel 
Ich mache einen Song und definiere Hip Hop neu 
Denn ihr wohnt im Dorf X, macht auf Nelly am Bahnhof 
Und seht mich auf Viva täglich nach Nelly Furtado 
Ich war schon mit 14 beliebt bei Frauen 
Hatte Schlampen, so wie andre, einen Freestyle-Raum 
Ich leb' meinen Traum, du lebst nur die Illusion 
Ich will Millionen in einer deutschen Villa wohnen

Fick Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh
Deutschland, gib mir nur ein Song, ich schreib euch
Zehntausend Hits, geh raus und fick

Ah, yo

Als Kind wusste ich, ich wird kein Feuerwehrmann
Sondern reich, doch ich wusste nicht, dass sie Steuern verlangen
Jeder Schlussstrich ist ein Neuanfang
Bald ist dein Junge wieder da
Aber als Rapper statt als Bundesligastar
Wer ist unser Liga Star? Er ist Sentino
Der Rest ist noch nicht weit entwickelt, wie ein Embryo
Scheiß' auf die alte Schule, es ist 2004
Ich mach mal 1,5 dort, mal 2000 hier
Schenk' die Hälfte meiner Mutter, sie hat meist viele Sorgen und
Sie will es morgen und man weiß nie was morgen kommt
Ich wird es schaffen nur für sie
Nehm' es mir von euch, dann Deutschlands Plattenindustrie
Denn ich machte hin und wieder Fehler, ich hab's oft bereut
Glaubte ich scheiter', jeder von euch hofft es heut'
Hofft, das mein Körper nicht im Takt ist
Wenn eines meiner Wörter nicht im Takt sitzt, dann ist es Absicht
Spuck' Flammen bis dein Licht entfacht ist
Vers um Vers bis dann Schicht im Schacht ist
Ich brauch es, dass man mich beachtet, du Opfer
Ansonsten hol den Wodka in Teufelskreis

Es ist ein Teufelskreis, ich komm nicht daraus
Mach dir keine Sorgen, ich komm noch nach Haus
Doch jetzt noch nicht, manchmal stresst es dich
Glaub mir alles wird neu und ich will dass du wieder träumst

Als Kind wusst' ich, ich wird kein Astronaut
Und ich wusste nur aus Filmen wie man sich im Knast so haut
Ich hab's gesehen (Bei Freunden)
Guck ich hab's von denen
Ich kann's verstehen, es läuft so bei acht von zehn
Acht von zehn sitzen 10 harte Jahre ab
Von acht von den Typen haben schwarze Haare und
Auf einmal soll aus mir was anderes werden?
Niemand kommt zu mir und sagt  aus dir kann was werden, denn
Ich hab kein Vater, der mir was erzählt
Nur ein kleiner Junge der mit seinen Lastern lebt (Der was erlebt)
Sein Text ist nur was er lebt
Die Leute hören ihn und wollen, dass es krasser geht
Keiner fragt ihn warum bist du wieder so?
Bitte sag uns, warum schreibst du deine Lieder so? (Warum?) 
Sagt er sein Leben ist ein harter Weg?
(Vielleicht!) Weil ihm doch eigentlich sein Vater fehlt
Der Mann, der sein Sohn mit zum Angeln nimmt
Schon mit zwei Jahren war ich, wie kein anderes Kind
Ich bin ein guter Sohn, der seine Mutter liebt
Und wenn er reich wird, es alles seiner Mutter gibt, komm

Es ist ein Teufelskreis, ich komm nicht daraus
Mach dir keine Sorgen, ich komm noch nach Haus
Doch jetzt noch nicht, manchmal stresst es dich
Glaub mir alles wird neu und ich will dass du wieder träumst

Es ist ein Teufelskreis, ich komm nicht daraus

Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros,"Once upon a time I was the hurricane boy
There was no eye in me for you to hide
Head low don't show oceans in my eyes
As the waves clap goodbye to sorrow

Daddy's on the mountain yellin' at the bloody sky
Mama's in the mirror actin' out another life
Children in the schoolyard singin' ""everybody dies""
And I am on the corner with a sentimental eye
I am on the corner singin' sentimental lies

Hopped up on a gypsy train with tracks that you can hide
That way no storm could follow our tomorrows 
But shackled to a suitcase full of automatic thunder
Clap
All hail to death's boy-wonder

JJ's in the kitchen talking bout the end of times
Mo's thowin' Kerouac to Catch Her In the Rye
Tempermental yogis bakin' merry weather pie
And I am on the corner with a sentimental eye
I am on the corner singin' sentimental lies

Sometimes said it's sun time 
Let it sunshine on my mind

All the same its conscience waiting
Cross the line

Last night I dreamed myself upon a golden glade
The clouds passed in and out of my reflection
And everyone I've known held my hands till they were clay
And the storm finally bled from my complexion

Now Jadey's on the mountain singing ""We will never die""
The band is in the rainbow playin' love for you and I
Heath is riding shotgun aimin' at the paper sky
And I am only ""I am"" now I've opened up my eye
I am only ""I am"" that I've opened up my eye

Sometimes said its sun time
Let it sunshine on my mind

Says she wants to be, oh wants to stay a child, child now

And I'll be there to play it, don't get me wrong
When I feel like dying and being gone
When life is hard
There's just one thing, let's not forget
Yes! life is it!
Life is it, life is it, it's where it's at
It's getting skinny, getting fat
It's falling deep into a love,
It's getting crushed just like about
Life there's no love, its getting beat into the ground
It's getting lost and getting found,
To growing up and getting round
It's feeling silence, feeling sound
It's feeling lonely, feeling full
It's feeling oh so beautiful!
Yes!

Life is hard
Come celebrate

Lose their taste for kissing?

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

And run back home to you

(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days

Made love in the toronto rain
(i've seen better days)
From hamilton i look the train

What you regret, you softly said are things you never do
I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days

Now i stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned i could have stayed
But i just walked away
I could have done a lot of things

Edwin & the Bedouins,"Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free

Ever stop to think about a downfall
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Games are to played with toys etcetera
Love is to be made when you're for real
Ups and downs are caused by life in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel

Shady as a lady in a mustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends

Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you
Somebody?s watching you

Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon

The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed

Somebody?s watching you

What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
How, tell me how will I know
Will my heart make me believe it so
Or can I trust the way I feel
If you could read my mind
You see how hard I've tried
Still I can't decide

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Oh, tell me could this be love

Do you know if it's true
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky
And do you know if you can fall for
Just a moment
Is a moment for all time
Why, why am I so unsure
Is that love knocking at my door
Or the sound of my beating heart
If you could read my mind
You know I just can't hide
What I feel inside

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love

Y la culpa la tiene este vicio
Me dejo la mujer que tenía
Y ahora pierdo también a mi hijo

El jamás supo lo que era un padre
Porque yo andaba siempre borracho
Él pidiendo en la calle limosna 
Para que yo siguiera tomando

Una noche lluviosa de invierno
Llegó el pobre hasta donde yo estaba
Y me dijo perdón papacito
Ahora sí que no me dieron nada
Tengo hambre y tambien mucho frío 
Por favor hoy no me digas nada

Pero yo ciego de tanta ira
Lo golpee hasta casi matarlo
Y le dije ""te vas a la calle
Ya no pienso seguirte aguantando
Ya no tienes ni casa ni padre
Si no traes para seguir tomando""

Y esto es Edwin Luna y la Trakalosa de Monterrey oohh

Salió el pobre temblando de frío
Y llorando por lo que le dije
Mientras yo en la casa embrutecido
Sabrá Dios qué tanto lo maldije

El alcohol y el sueño me vencieron
Desperté casi ya amaneciendo
Al abrir la puerta de la casa
No creí lo que yo estaba viendo

Ahí estaba mi hijo tirado
Había muerto de hambre y de frío
En su mano le hallé 2 monedas
Que me traía pa' comprar más vino
Y yo briago no oí que tocaba 
Y así el pobre murió en el olvido

Por borracho perdí yo a mi hijo 
Y a mi esposa que tanto adoraba

Edwin McArthur,"Oh listen, sister,
I love my mister man,
And I can't tell yo' why,
There ain't no reason
Why I should love that man.
It must be something that the angels done plan.

Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,
I got to love one man till I die.
Can't help loving that man of mine.
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
Tell me I'm crazy (maybe I know).
Can't help loving that man of mine.
When he goes away
That's a rainy day,
But when he comes back that day is fine,
The sun will shine!
He kin come home as late as kin be,
Home without him ain't no home to me.
Can't help loving that man of mine.

My man is shiftless
An' good for nothing too
(He's my man just the same)

He's never round here
When there is work to do.
He's never round here when there's working to do.
The chimbley's smoking,
The roof is leaking in,
But he don't seem to care.
He kin be happy
With just a sip of gin.
Ah even love him when his kisses got gin!",Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man [From Show Boat],1999
Edwin McCain,"Walk With You by Edwin McCainChorus
I’ll take this slow sweet walk with you
You’ll let go of my hand to say: I do
He will discover just how blessed a life can be
I know cuz all those years ago
Someone handed you to me

Every step that we take
Brings back the memories
Winter snows and horse shows
Dancing on the beach
I can’t help thinking that I’m the lucky one
You’re still my baby daughter
And now I’ve gained a son

Chorus
I’ll take this slow sweet walk with you
You’ll let go of my hand to say : I do
He will discover just how blessed a life can be
I know ‘cause all those years ago
Your mom handed you to me

Don’t miss a chance to put each other first
Now that you’ve vowed for better or for worse
Don’t let the beauty of this life pass you by
In the times of trouble you’ll stand side by side

Chorus
I’ll take this slow sweet walk with you
You’ll let go of my hand to say : I do

I picture a slow sweet walk yet to be
When you’ll take my hand and say : Daddy come see
Then you’ll know what it felt like
You won’t believe what it feels like
Then you’ll know what it felt like
When she handed you to me

She handed you to me",Walk With You,

I'm awake and my heart is still dreaming
It's 3:00 A.M.
Outside I hear the souls still screaming
It's been so long you know 
Since my head's been this clear
Just like a ship lost in the night

But I'll keep chasing my dreams
And only you can make them real
I pour my heart out every night
But do you know the way that I feel
Sometimes this is work
And don't you know sometimes this is play
Sometimes you are listening to me
And sometimes you don't hear 
A damn word that I say
Sometimes there's a girl 
Sometimes I go home alone
And I guess it's no wonder right now
That I do very well on my own
But I'll keep chasing my dreams
And only you can make them real

Down on old St. Charley's Street
He's cleaning up Fat Tuesday's mess 
He keeps the sidewalks neat
And he just lost his father 
And he just lost his wife
And if it wasn't for the music 
He couldn't get on with his life
And he knows what I know
It's not all that hard to survive
You take the good and the bad 
And the time in between
It lets us know we're alive
Well now Be Be's singing gospel
And down on Bourbon she sings the blues
She plays on all my heart strings 
Curls my toes up in my shoes
And she knows what I'm after
Chase my dreams with all my might
She says you shouldn't be so anxious 
And deep down I know she's right
And she knows what I know
It's not all that hard to survive
You take the good and the bad 
And the time in between
It lets us know we're alive
Well get on board the rocket
Step right into the front car
You know life's a roller coaster 
It ain't got no safety bar
Raise your voices up with laughter
Bring it in with one big sigh
Consecrated in the wonder...we're alive
Norman he plays music 
But only in my dreams
Shows me all the beauty 
That soulful music brings
But sometimes he's a specter 
And I wake up clenched with fear

Riding down America Street funny that it's one way
Riding down from uptown to where the buildings are broken down in decay
America Street it's right nearby
Land of the free and the brave
If we can't work and make some change
There won't be much of this land left to save
It's a classic case of misdirection and slight of hand
We watch while our deficit grows
What a shame that we can't teach our kids to read
Makes you wonder where all the tax money goes 
Well America Street it's right nearby
Land of the free and the brave
And if we can't work and make some change
There won't be much of this land left to save 
Won't be much to save

Because it's cold and I live outside
A thoughtful search into my pockets finds enough so he can rocket
Right up to the bar and enjoy his lie

She's cheated death more than one time
The tears roll down her face and on to the floor
The psychic's been reading her mind

Women with secrets men with their rage
The lines run deeper than words on the page
Breeze through the window, it turns bitter chill
Pretend we don't feel it, lie here real still

Whispered in visions of new earth shine
We volunteer to do nothing again
The world falls around us all we can do is whine
Living out the future of original sin

The lines run deeper than actors on the stage
Breeze through the mountains turns bitter chill
Pretend we don't feel it, lie here real still

Well now follow me to the water
Dive right through the film
Swim in the madness, fulfill every whim
Why worry about tomorrow that you'll never see

Why talk about the children that will never be
Give us this day our daily bread
Forgive us our monstrosities
No more stories of the Quick and the Dead

The asphalt will burn with our liabilities",Bitter Chill,1995

You know it just ain't my style
And I don't give a damn about that
You know it ain't worth my while

Burned some bridges in my time
You know those girls tried to tie me down
But my heart is still all mine

Well Elvis had his blue suede shoes and Samson had his hair
You know I got my music baby 
And my dreams will take me there
You know I don't smoke cigarettes

Just don't start talking that love talk baby
Don't Bring Me Down
Well don't call me a scoundrel
Baby don't call me a thief

Edwin McCain,"After all the corridors are darkened
When the royal crown is off your head
To your chambers I will creep not a word we will speak
Just love me while the fire light dances 'round the bed
Well there is danger in this passion
Because the king can never never know
And on my blood I've sworn my allegiance
So I'll leave you when the sunlight comes and beckons me to go
And the silver shine is tarnished from my armor
And in battle I am paralyzed with fear|
And this poison in my soul is the love we'll never know
And it finds me playing Lancelot to your Guinevere
Well and Guinevere is sly enough to steal a little taste
And her laughter it peals into the night
Oh but forbidden fruit always stays sticky on your face
And without virtue I'm worthless in a fight
Stealing little glances at the table I feel that this is theater in the round
But far away chasing vixens in the meadow
Your love like wind, blows right by and sweeps me off the ground
Your love sweeps me off the ground
Well now it sweeps me off the the ground
And the silver shine is tarnished from my armor 
And in battle I am paralyzed with fear
And this poison in my soul is the love we'll never know
And it finds me playing Lancelot to your Guinevere",Guinevere,1995
Edwin McCain,"Looking back on younger days the view stretched on for miles
We charged into our futures with laughter and smiles
As we traveled blindly the road became so thick
No chance to change direction and we've laughed until we're sick
Now I keep company with wicked evil men 
My generosity's brimming but I'm still inclined to sin
My friends think I am crazy and I know that may be so
But I'm as happy with a penny as coffers full of gold

And so for all of you I say, don't miss the forest for all the trees
And don't ever question Honor Among Thieves

The undergrowth has parted now the path is easily read
It's lined with all the doubters regretting all they've said
God bless all the dreamers and those who lead with soul
For how can you know virtue 'less you fought out of a hole

And so for all of you I say, don't miss the forest for all the trees
And don't ever question Honor Among Thieves

Trickle of a chuckle as laughter starts to pour
Bells begin to jingle the trickles now a roar
Pan floutist, cloven dancer

How did we betray our imagination
Watching our futures unfold

Without a whisper for fear of intrusion
We have to see how this part ends
Time out for commercials
Time out to be good friends

But our generation's angry
We're so scared that we can't see
The answer right inside of us
If we can find the place in our hearts 

Where we're all free
Does it see that time works against us
Or does it just march on and on and on
Sometimes it drives me crazy

Proving Nostradamus wrong, so wrong
But we still have secret silos with buttons, 
Codes and keys
We can avert this awful disaster 

If we find the place in our hearts 
Where we're all free
And what a tall order
Far be it for me to say

Maybe I'll try a little harder
Starting here today
Or just throw in the towel
Lay down five up the ghost

And join all the cynics
Luckier than most
Maybe I'll check out with a bullet

They have their own tune

Laughing at the prophecy, the prophecy he gave
Can we spread our wings like angels, can we break out of the grind
Are we destined to be Darwin's children this time

In the glow of our great teacher we sit and blankly stare

Edwin McCain,"The rhythm of life
Heaven withstanding and smiling we're all swept away
The rhythm of life
Is not so demanding as some caught in narrows would say

Fragile as ships as we pass through Gibraltar
The sirens have long given way
Dark as the murky graveyard of sailors
Whispering secrets told in the crashing waves

The beating of hearts
Set walls to trembling the power of silence persuades
The stumbling feet
Stagger predestined we all end up wild eyed and crazed

And from the madness most jaded of vision
Reflections of horror invade
Running and falling relinquish your venom
The antidote surely will cause your affliction to fade

How little we know of what we are blessed with
Our shimmering island it turns
How little we look at what we see clearly
Of tragedy's lessons not learned

Sleeping through classes we'll make it up later
There's still so much time left to go
Misguided roses we bloom in October
Emerging triumphant in time for the season's first snow 
",The Rhythm of Life,1997
Edwin McCain,"Whispered from my heart and soul to my unwilling eyes
Lift my vision from the ground lift it to the sky
Skies they used to be so ugly rain that stings my face
Opens up their glory just earth and sky and space

And your passionate embraces absolve me of my sin
Your life lifts me up so I can see
See the sky again

And I've lived through all the flash-fire set off like lightning spark
Yes they burn so brightly and oh they burn so hot
And these fantasies of all our love tearing at the ground
Wrapped up in the vortex of sweat and sex and sound

And your passionate embraces absolve me of my sin
Your life lifts me up so I can see, see the sky again

Hide me
From the love I'm too scared to send
Hide Me
'Til I see the sky again

Edwin McCain,"I pull my boots off, throw my weapons on the floor
Cry my eyes out, in my private little war
Well it seems I've been a soldier
Heaven knows I've been no saint
In my camouflage and armor, cold heart and grease paint
To you this has no meaning the Armistice laid down
The armies are all quiet and the guns don't make a sound

'Cause you melted the steel walls, tore down the barbed wire
Filled in the trenches, demanded a cease fire
And now you're leaving, there's nothing I can do
I want you to know you're gonna take me with you

Well now three on a match is suicide in the foxhole of my mind
And way off in the distance the air raid sirens whine
And they sing your song of rescue to my tattered worn out shell
You drag me to your safety from this my front line hell

'Cause you melted the steel walls, tore down the barbed wire
Filled in the trenches, demanded a cease fire
And now you're leaving, there's nothing I can do
I want you to know you're gonna take me with you

The blood that was spilled in the heartache before
Left road maps of scars that I never could ignore

'Cause you melted the steel walls, tore down the barbed wire
Filled in the trenches, demanded a cease fire
And now you're leaving, there's nothing I can do
I want you to know you're gonna take me with you

It ain't about the love you lost or the things you think you left behind

We've all made big mistakes that can never be repaired

Edwin McCain,"Rolled in last night
To the dawn, the porch, 
And both our floodlights
No excuse
But we were having such a good time
Why, oh why
Can't I just walk the straight and narrow
So ashamed 
But I'll do it all again tomorrow
Maybe you're the only one that sees
Anything good about me 
Anything good about me
I found a friend
To get the number just to call you
Line was jammed I tried and tried, 
But could not get through
All these calls
To warn you of my scoundrel heart 
But these walls
And still they can't keep us apart

[Chorus]
And I promise to take care
And love you
If you promise to keep seeing
Anything good about me  

And I swear sometimes
There's asphalt running 
Through my veins
And let me go
And never ever pull my reins
And I'll return 
With cuts and bruises 
Scarred but smarter
Lick my wounds
And try again but twice as hard

[Chorus]",Anything Good About Me,1999
Edwin McCain,"Another beautiful morning under stars and bars
And F series pickups and rusted out cars
And they're eating breakfast at the strip bar
Just to have a peek?

And the beer soaked angels spread their wings
And dream of twenties and diamonds and things
And somehow that might ease the sting
Of the company they keep
Yeah?

And the vets still talk about the Tet offensive
And the freshmen boys all look so pensive
Because living large is so expensive
Hope daddy fueled the jet?

And we'll all fly out to the Hard Rock casino
And we'll put on our neatly pressed and fine chinos
And we'll laugh at the guy in the El Camino
Is that the only car he could get?

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful life
It's just as advertised
It's all for one low price
Just read the fine print, and you'll be content
With your beautiful life

And record smoothies say ""What a sound""
You're the greatest thing we've found
But you're gonna have to lose a few pounds
We're gonna put you on TV

And don't think our place is so swank
Don't worry about that guy, he's high on crank
That's exactly why his last record tanked
And let that be a lesson to me

[Chorus]

And all our churches glow
Communion wafers trash TV shows
Say ""Hey, at least you don't have this strife""
'Cause you'll be warm and safe
In your beautiful life
Yeah?

And it's hard to tell what's true compassion
When it's dressed up in hair and nails and fashion
And the tabloids all rush to cash in on what we should believe
And I hope I never see the day

When there's nothing left on the planet left to save
And oxygen is the designer crusade
As we all fight to breathe?

[Chorus]",Beautiful Life,1999

All the stuff they told him
He's caught up in the fray
He said I've got this great big
Bag full of dreams
And I don't know what to do
I said a wise man gave me
The key to life
And now I give it to you
And I said
Just do your thing

You're running that race
A little bit faster now
Towards your finish lines

And dance and live
And laugh until you cry

Edwin McCain,"Ghost on the street today
Doorways of Jackson Square
In tinsel and tap shoes
Mardi Gras beads in her hair
Down to the graveyard
She wrung out her hands
As if he will meet her
All day she stands
So don't leave me
And I know you're justified

So don't leave me
Cause a part of you in me died
We wish ourselves beautiful
We cry in the night
And it's not the love you feared
But the fall from the height
My personal ledges
Afraid to look down
My crepe paper bridges
Enough water to drown

Chorus

And I see the lonely souls
Searchin'
But before the heartbreak rose
Draw the curtain
I'm a ghost on the streets today
Surrounded by eyes
I feel them peer through me
And my harlequin disguise
If it makes you feel better
Come join me the while
And there's love in these open arms
Some love in my spirits' smiles

Stories of canyons and Boston in winter

And I know that they deserve more

I would see off this mountain
On the nights stars fell
And see off this mountain
Through the tears in my eyes
I would see off this mountain

Down along Hickory Way
And the mandolin guitar
Like we used to play
And down on Dunn's rock
Brothers boasting a dare
We tell them they're crazy
And pretend we don't care

Through the clouds in my eyes
I would see off this mountain
On the nights stars fell
And see off this mountain
Through the tears in my eyes
I would see off this mountain

In the wind a carnival tune
It soars with our laughter
But we'll all leave too soon
So I raise a toast to family
Put thanks in my glass
In the arms of your loved ones
It's the only home that lasts
If I could see off this mountain
Through the clouds in my eyes
I would see off this mountain
On the night the stars fell
And see off this mountain
Through the tears in my eyes
I could see off this mountain

When the stars fell from the skies

Edwin McCain,"The night before your wedding 
I dreamed what I would say
I beg you for forgiveness 
For all the mess I made

I dreamed that you were gracious, 
I dreamed you wished me well
I dreamed that you were vicious, 
You damned me straight to hell

But oh sweet Kentucky
No matter where I land
I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man

And I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man

I'd tell you that I'm lonely 
And fame has let me down
Living like a stranger, 
Traveling town to town

And all my aspirations 
Don't amount to much
The wine and the women 
Are such a shameful crutch

But oh sweet Kentucky
No matter where I land
Cause I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man

And I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man

I know you will be happy 
And I'll be in the band
Cause I was just a boy for you
And he will be your man

You were the only one who loved me true

But there's a woman that we don't even know

But I want to tell her too
Is that her little boy still loves you

Does she need my help, is she cold on the street

Is that her little boy still loves you

For giving me life, I've done the best that I can

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May [*],2004

Just want to feel this way without chaining you down to some old cliche
You want water in my hands and we stand waist deep in the ocean
It's bigger than the sea, it won't let me

Say just anything, because I feel everything

I think I give you more, something there's no words for
You don't have to hear me to feel me trying
To say anything

Baby I know you try but somtimes I still want to hear it
Even when the waters calm but lately it's just when there's something wrong
Why can't we splash around and hold on to that playful spirit
Oh like we used to do and won't you

Give me just one word, you can scream or whisper
If you want to stay with me tell me why

As if someone else controls your very soul
I fooled myself as long as I can
Can feel the presence of another man

It's there when you speak my name, it's just not the same
Oh, honey I'm losing you
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere
Oh, I'm losing you

I can feel it in my bones, any day you'll be up and gone
Oh, I'm losing you
It's all over your face, someone's takin' my place
Could it be that I'm losing you?

When I look into your eyes a reflection of a face I see
Oh Lord I'm losing you
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me

Your love is fadin', can feel it fadin'
Oh, away from me
Can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere
Ooo, I'm losing you

I don't wanna lose you
But I know I'm gonna groove you

An automatic alarm
Turns my radio on
Before my feet can hit the floor

Man has a sense for the discovery of beauty
How rich is the world for one who makes you for us to show
Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me

Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms
There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life

If you knew how lonely my life has been
And how long I've been so alone
And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done

It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me
It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

A window breaks, down a long, dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright, 'cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see, through the dark there is light

Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
And if you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought that I'd love anyone so much

It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me

Edwyn Collins,"Don't try so hard to be different
The cracks are beginning to show
You drift like a cloud through the festival crowd
In a frock coat from Seville row

You've just been to a all night party
Where I have to admit it takes pluck
To go out on the floor and proclaim, ?What a bore?
In a T-shirt that reads, 'Disco Sucks'

Yes, here he comes, the not so young
Pretender to the throne
He's singing rag, momma, rag
Won't you give that poor dog a bone?

And he's wondering why we can't connect
When he's sworn to us that he's totally wretch
On the rustic charm that he affects
On a public schoolboy whim

With a raggle taggle plastic gypsy
Robert Zimmerframe
With a synthesized accordion
A scramblin' up my brain

With a fiddle dee dee, a fiddle on high
Excuse me folks while I kiss the sky
Or at any rate give it one more try
Before I die, before I die

The overrated hit the stage
Overpaid and over here
And their idea of counter culture's
Momma's charge account at sears

And they're wondering why we can't connect
With the ritual of the trashed guitar
One more paltry empty gesture
The ashes of a burned out star

Yes, here they come, both old and young
A contact low or high
The gathering of the tribes descending
Vultures from a caustic sky

The rotting carcase of July
And ugly sun hung out to dry
Your gorgeous hippy dreams are dying
Your frazzled brains are putrefying

Repackaged, sold and sanitized
The devil's music exorcised
You live, you die, you lie, you lie, you die
Perpetuate the lie, perpetuate the lie,
Perpetuate the lie, just to perpetuate the lie

Edwyn Collins,"There's something intriguing about you, that's for sure
Seems like you walked right out of my past
Oh, you swore we never met before?
And I know the reasons why you're shy
Of these feelings that we can't deny

But it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

Some kind of magic about you, I can't explain
And now you put your spell on me
And I know I'll never be the same
And I'm wondering is it self deceit
'Cause without you I feel incomplete

But it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

And I can still see you when I asked if you would stay
Well you looked right through me when you turned and walked away
But intuitively I knew that someday I'd make you mine
And even though our pasts were a skew, I knew they'd cross in time

And it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

You've got it on, I've got it bad

Amazed at what I saw
Struggling hard to find the words
When words tends to stick right in my craw

I'm talking about seizing the moments
When the moment has gone
There's no telling me 'cause I'm holding on
Hoping against hope that you've got it wrong

Like I love you
If you could love me
Like I love you

Frozen in time and space
Yet I feel no need
To get out of this place

And suddenly the earth moved
The planets grooved, I fell down on my knees
Someone whispered take your leave
You're free to go any way you please

You shut up shop, you're leavin' home
You feel no need to settle down
In the crippled crook of your earth bound town

And you've been down this road before
Which is not to say you're bored
Or that you shouldn't want for more
It's just your expectations should be lower

There must be somethin' more than this
More than ideal homes or domestic bliss
What is there left for you to do
'Cause you've seen the future and it's nothin' new

And you've been down this road before

Or that you shouldn't want for more

If you mean to offend me then you're doing pretty well
And how convincingly you've shown me
That the love I thought was built to last is now an empty shell

Things can only get better
What's around the corner, who can tell?
I'll build a little place just north of heaven
I'm kinda tired of living south of hell

Don't assume you can ignore me
You'd best bite your lip in case I make it after all
And how contemptuously you've shown me
That all my aspirations were so paltry and so small

Things can only get better
What's around the corner, who can tell?
I'll build a little place just north of heaven
I'm kinda tired of living south of hell

As if I give a fuck, at best I think they suck

As these four walls collide, as your whole world subsides
But you took it all in your stride
As a matter of course, not a matter of pride

So raise your glass, let's celebrate
'Cause we can force those hands of fate
No need to heed the call for greed, for acquisition
Now I ain't puttin' you on, this is my genuine position

As these four walls collide, as your whole life subsides
But you took it all in your stride

You know I like monkeying around
Y'see I'd rather swingfrom the treetops
Cos I can't keep my feet on the grounds

But I can stand tall
It's not that I'm living a lie
It's stars in my eyes
If I fall
I'd rather have stars in my eyes
Than nothing at all
20/20 nothing at all

Well some they like the straight and narrow
But me like a kink or two
So many winding roads to follow
But only one that follows through
If I just dip my toe in the water
It don't mean I'm gonna get wet
They say I've got a certain something
Is it something that I'll live to regret?

But I can stand tall
It's not that I'm living a lie
It's stars in my eyes
If I fall
I'd rather have stars in my eyes
Than nothing at all
20/20 nothing at all

It's safe to say my life is changing
My destiny is in my hands
This song just needs some rearranging
And then I'll make it to the promised land

Where I will stand tall
It's not that I'm living a lie
It's stars in my eyes
If I fall
I'd rather have stars in my eyes
Than nothing at all
20/20 nothing at all

And that's the way I feel about you
There are times like a magnet you're drawn into somebody's life

But you know it's right
There's a sense that the piece that was missing
Has suddenly come into view
That's the way I feel about you
That's the way I feel about you

I believe in this world there is nothing that happens by chance, no
There's a reason that at just this particular moment you came

The feeling won't leave my heart
Holding on without you
Alone here in the dark

The way I dream of you

To make them all come true

When, when you come back to me
I'll hold you till forever ends
And never let you go again
When, when you come back to me

I'll welcome you into my heart
Like we've never been apart
Our lives crossed in a moment
All the others disappear

A feeling so familiar
And the meaning was more than clear
When I felt your eyes break trough me
I knew I'd need you like the sun

And as the dawn came up around me
I knew you'd be the one
When, when you come back to me
I'll hold you till forever ends
And never let you go again

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far

I think of you

Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you

Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me

They ain't got shit on me		
And one of Nelly's bodyguards

But I know what's inside their hearts

But I keep my feelings hid
'Cause I know deep inside they're only frightened little kids

And if I press my breasts together
And arch my back just so
I can ask for pretty things
And they will not say no

No one should go without

I don't care that your friends say you're a mess
You laugh at all my jokes when no one else does
So I feel it's only right I must confess

You see, I wasn't really drunk, I was just pretending
Because I wanted so much to feel the way you do
Oh, this party, it seems never ending
I would gladly sip my champagne from your shoes

I found you sitting there under the table
I hoped that you would make some room for me
But I have never been much of a drinker
And at this bar they don't serve herbal tea

You see, I wasn't really drunk, I was just pretending
Because I wanted so much to feel the way you do
Oh, this party, it seems never ending
I would gladly sip my champagne from your shoes

I woke up with the dawn to fix you breakfast
I served it to you right there in your bed
But your bloodshot eyes addressed me like a stranger
As if I'd caused that pain inside your head

Because I wanted so much to feel the way you do
Oh, this party, it seems never ending

The shadows will let us be naked

If this engine turns over, we'll tear through the park
On donuts and milk of Magnesia
And I'll read you a poem of blue skies and eyes
In your sockets that bring them together
In your sockets that bring them together

And are your thighs ever tender
As they swell in my hands
And are warmed by the spit of my kisses
But I will just graze you like the sun does on grass
Pick at your flesh like an eagle

The thing you claim to love so much
You don't do very well

I'm sure someone will love you
'Til the day that they must die
And someone will mourn for you
With bitter, tear-stained eyes
Will this be enough for you?
You got them in your spell
Because the thing you claim to hate
You do it very well

Was it written in the stars
Or in your mother's gut
Will you be as pure as snow
Or just some angry mutt?
The price of it has just gone down
And you did not think to sell
But in doing all these hateful things
You are unparallel
At doing all these hurtful things
You really do excel

And do my best
Swear that I can pass this test

Some girl told me last night
She found my rhythms so tight
I swear she only bought me one or two
I told her all about you

You should try to be more kind
You know how I need to unwind
When it gets dark
And I wanna see some sparks

Europe's gonna love me
All in different countries
There is no way that I could turn it down
And anyway it's for us

Promise I'll be home before
That baby's knocking at the door
I'll be right there
To let it in I won't be scared

Waiting for me to fix her car

To dodge the bullets

And a lavender robe
That scratches his thighs
Through the hat that he strode
As he follows a path
Filled with every desire
And mimics his footsteps
And sets his prayers on fire.

Well I too have chosen
That which left no choice
To sing without loving,
A solitary voice,
To observe with passion
Each careful denial:
The protrusions which give my life meaning
For a while.

Sometimes I see you in berries and weeds
You're brushing your teeth with liquorice seeds
Standing too close,
Pulling your clothes,
Smiling at god
And the meaning of life grows.

No and I'll never tell
And I'll never know
What candles you light
After the show
And I'll never tell,
And I'll never ask
The meaning of life after mass.

Por seguirte voy sin dirección
Sé que nuestro camino hoy se tuerce en dos 

Por el amor que no compartes 
Por el dolor al que no guardo rencor 
Ahora siento que llego tarde a tu corazón

Siento que nunca te he conocido 
Lo extraño es que vuelvo ha caer
Me duele estar sola, me duele contigo 
Y perderte es perderme después

Por tenerte, por querer quererte 
Dejé de lado todo lo que sentía 
Yo no sabia que tu amor escondía la soledad 
Y aunque grites morena mía 
Desde esta orilla no escucho tu voz, 
No sé quien eres, no sé quien soy, no sé quien soy

Por callar, por no dañarte 
Y no enseñarte de mi lo peor 
Por que me dices esas cosas que me duelen 
Porque maldices al amor 

Nada es lo que sueles decir
Yo todo te lo quiero contar 
Nada nos espera después solo soledad

Ahora que empiezo a creerme la vida sin ti
Ahora que el viento ha borrado tu huella en el tiempo
Te había olvidado y ahora qué esperas de mí

Ahora que vienes abriendo la puerta del tiempo
Ahora que vuelves a hacerme dudar si miro
Tus ojos y sé que aún te sigo queriendo

Y ahora ya es tarde para lamentar
Todo llega, todo pasa, todo viene y va
Si de algo me arrepiento fue de atarme así
Y es que esta vida no entiende de ti y de mí
Ya solo quedan momentos en el corazón no supimos querernos

Ahora que vienes trayéndome aquí tu recuerdo
Recuerdos que siempre se alejan de la realidad
Ahora que desde la calma me abrazo al silencio
Por ti yo no puedo volver a dejarme llevar

Ahora que vienes abriendo la puerta del tiempo
Ahora que vuelves a hacerme dudar si miro tus ojos
Y se que aun te sigo queriendo

Todo llega, todo pasa, todo viene y va
Si de algo me arrepiento fue de atarme así
Y es que esta vida no entiende de ti y de mí
Ya solo quedan momentos en el corazón no supimos querernos

No supimos querernos

Y cada noche la razón que no entiende de emoción
Me dice que decrezco el corazon
Porque hay destinos en la vida que se encuentran
Y otros no los sabremos nunca tu y yo
Y no me olvido de ti, nunca supe entender
Que no hay mentira y no hay verdad
Ni siquiera hay un porque, ya no se que es el amor
Y anhelo tantos momentos
No supimos querernos

Y ahora ya es tarde para lamentar
Todo llega, todo pasa, todo viene y va
Si de algo me arrepiento fue de atarme así
Y es que esta vida no entiende de ti y de mí
Ya solo quedan momentos en el corazón
Solo los buenos momentos entre tú y yo
Ya no me arrepiento de aquello tan nuestro

Eff,"Hör auf die Stimme 
Auf deinen Wegen durch das Leben 
Da kommen Kreuzungen und du stehst 
Du musst abwägen und überlegen was du wählst und wofür du gehst
Die bösen Geister und all die Quäler
Immer wieder kommen sie zurück
Es wird nicht leichter, nein es wird schwerer
Du musst ihn meistern den nächsten Schritt

Da wo guter Rat teuer, du grad lost und gebeutelt bist
War da nicht immer diese Stimme, die dir hilft und zwar immer
Hör auf die Stimme, hör was sie sagt, sie war immer da, komm' hör auf ihren Rat
Hör auf die Stimme, sie macht dich stark, sie will dass du's schaffst
Also hör was sie dir sagt

Sag wirst du reden oder schweigen
Was wird passieren was kommt danach
Willst du weggehen oder bleiben
Du musst entscheiden keiner nimmt's dir ab
Das ist 'ne Reise ohne Navi
Alles offen und immer wieder neu
All die Prüfungen ich glaub' man schafft die
Wenn man sich so selbst so gut wie's geht treu bleibt

Und es ist ganz egal wohin du gehst
Denn es wird immer diese Stimme
Die dir hilft immer

Egreen,"Jake, oh
Conto I nemici che ho guadagnato
Puzzo di alcool e fumo tagliato
Questa musica la strada piange l'asfalto è bagnato
È venerdì, ogni scemo beve dopo viene qui
L'odio mi si attacca ai polmoni fra come l'eternit
Cosa cambia? Mangio ancora come dieci anni fa
Il fegato dei rapper col Chianti, fra come Hannibal
Non mi sono fatto fottere da questi fogli viola
Rap in plastica ipnotizzato da queste casse Roland
Di questi cash e flash io me ne fotto
Non voglio occhiali Versace ma con la vergogna sotto
So scrivere rap tanto pesante che sembra metal
Quella di oggi non è musica, è come dire droga alla keta
Scrivo rime con l'inchiostro di seta
Cane sciolto Jake è un asceta, un altro pianeta
Lancia testa o croce, va dalla strada alla discoteca
Lo stesso rispetto è lo stesso cuore di pietra, seh
Respira, respira, respira, respira
La musica è dura finché una voce la sporca
Oggi scrivo e non parlo tanto nessuno più ascolta

Questa musica è sepolta di vecchi rancori
Ma se esce testa vivi e se esce croce muori
Noi ci mordiamo sul collo per questi spettatori
E poi di nuovo in gabbia e poi di nuovo fuori
Questa musica potrebbe far fare i milioni
Ma è schiava dell'orgoglio che fa fuori i migliori
Al nostro tavolo è sempre pieno di giocatori
E se esce testa vivi, e se esce croce

Conto le merde che ho declassato sto all'angolo giudicato
Il patrimonio genetico di sto stato nel Rap è fallato
Memorie corte, carriera in pensione prematura
Le mosse contano quanto le abilità in scrittura
Non ho mai morso la mano che mi ha cibato
Salvo poi quando quel piatto davanti ne è stato avvelenato
E se l'ambiente davvero poi lo fan le persone
A me sta bene ma è col foglio la mia relazione
Più passa il tempo più resto, para, e non mi interessa
Più cresco più vi detesto, più pesto tengo testa
A sti fumetti cazzetti io c'ho progetti food
E da bollino blu il mio prodotto Cracco verbo shaboo
Vi tengo tutti a ruota, spiaggia d'Ostia negli Ottanta
Con la vena calda e la reputazione sempre intatta
Per darmi un tono non faccio concerti con la band
Se questa merda è testa o croce sono Harvey Dent

Respira, respira, respira, respira
La musica è dura finché una voce la sporca
Oggi scrivo e non parlo tanto nessuno più ascolta

Questa musica è sepolta di vecchi rancori
Ma se esce testa vivi e se esce croce muori
Noi ci mordiamo sul collo per questi spettatori
E poi di nuovo in gabbia e poi di nuovo fuori
Questa musica potrebbe far fare i milioni
Ma è schiava dell'orgoglio che fa fuori i migliori
Al nostro tavolo è sempre pieno di giocatori
Che se esce testa vivi, e se esce croce

Ti spacci per musicista e in bocca lingua da biscia
Perché l'ambizione di essere artista, o vola o striscia
Siamo passati dall'inferno della musica di nicchia
Diretti a un inferno di bimbiminkia
Io ho un cuore in sto purgatorio e tredici anni d'ora d'aria
Col fiato sul collo e sopra la mia testa più di un avvoltoio
Non ho la fame di ottenere sempre il risultato
Sono il risultato di chi ha fame col cuore tritato
Qualcuno indaga qualcuno ha fatto un identikit
Il Rap è morto ucciso da un ferro finto in un videoclip
Il mondo va al contrario fra i poveri hanno le Balenciaga
Come il loro rapper preferito che neanche li caga
Già, che neanche li piscia
Questi colleghi profumano di fragola come le nuvole fumando hashisha
Gioco ogni mano con malizia per me è sempre all-in
E batto cassa prima che il croupier mi fotta in deficit

Respira, respira, respira, respira
La musica è dura finché una voce la sporca
Oggi scrivo e non parlo tanto nessuno più ascolta

Questa musica è sepolta di vecchi rancori
Ma se esce testa vivi e se esce croce muori

And all the things that I've held dear have lost reality
I cannot go I do not know if you are really here
Just let me know

I need a friend to depend on
I need so much more
Another reason to live, my life is knocking on my door

I need to know if I can go
All the way down and back again
I need to know if I can take another leap of faith today

Someone tell me so I can figure it out
Something's wrong nothing's right 
My life is filled with doubt
Lost the only really thing that I've ever known
Lost it all and now my hope is gone

But I was born of another blinded faith (starting to push away)

Never let this truth be shown, 
Not afraid to be alone and I'm just letting you know

Look at me now because I'm living what's been lost (long before my time)
Head to head and even I found my cure (starting to push away) 
Every cell that binds that my soul is like a story told 
The ending won't unfold till I've done all that I can 
I'm ripping time apart, to get another start
Life made into an art, a painting of a man with a chance

Three days of aching sleepless
I wish these sheets would suffocate me while I wait
I love the cuts that make the lines
Arranged in beautiful designs
I fight with a sharp side of a razor blade
It's not right I can't escape the choice I made

One last chance to get me through tonight
One last dance with the lady dressed in white
I lost myself I lost my alibis
One last time to feed the enemy inside of me

It's getting harder to inhale
A quick fix to clear my secrets
Eyes die alit and stop the winding second hand
It turns the hours into days
Behind the sunlight my life fades to gray
Alone again with a razor blade
It's not right I can't escape the choice I made

One last chance to get me through tonight
One last dance with the lady dressed in white
I lost myself I lost my alibis
One last time to feed the enemy

Like the moments after a murder

Can't believe the things he saw tonight

Face to face I'm screaming at myself for help

Ehud Asherie,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine
All the way to the end of the line",The Trolley Song,2010

Tellin' you or what magic beans they sellin' you

You can collect your little petty cash advance HOE

'Cause I'm right there like nightmares;
I catch MC's while they sleepin'
I'm back these rap cats is wildin'
Got 'em in the studio poppin' Valiums, remasterin' they album
I'm about to re-up and restructure the case
You stuck, you about to get rearranged and replaced
I got plans for this rap game (uh-huh)
Put your head in the toilet and look son,
If you think my shit done changed
My shit is, out of your range, rip you out of your frame
Cop your tape, and the next day, copped an exchange
If you ain't, rockin' raw, what you rockin' for??
Without heat, y'all MC's, ain't hot no more
So for you lame cats tryin' to put your hit out
Try rockin' back and forth
It might be easier to get your shit out!

I'm Jedi Master, Mase Windu, what you been through
Keep MC's heads wrapped like Erykah Ba-do

Wackest MC's, we pee on those
No need to impede The High and Mighty mystique
That shit would be as ignorant as Jimmy the Greek
Claimin' they Godzilla's when they really Godzooki
Got a mill' from Charlie Brown, when I kidnapped Snoopy
Eon, sale or performance, in any ordinance
Rhyme menace, that burst your verbal nuisance
In accordance, with all the laws from the cordless
Starbuck coming through, leavin any pimp whoreless

And feel the emptiness
Of a relationship that turned into dust
And some wait for all of their lives
Because they're too afraid 
And they let their train go by

Living on the frailty
Of never letting go
Always hiding behind a mask
And though there's finally the pleasure of being always on their own 
While others waltz a perfect heart 
And a home

In a love affair
And others like to live their love
In the rain
And some live a million affairs
Believing all the time that no one will feel or care

Holding back their faith
Because their wounds will never heal
Made by rumors building hate
Or someone who's in a sin

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei mir bist do schon, please let me explain
Bei mir bist do schon means you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, again I'll explain
It means you're the fairest in the land

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say you understand

Bei mir bist do schon, you've heard it all before
 but let me try to explain
Bei mir bist do schon means that you're grand
Bei mir bist do schon, it's such an old refrain
 and yet I should explain
It means I am begging for your hand

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I could say ""Bella, bella"", even ""sehr wunderbar""
Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are

I've tried to explain, bei mir bist do schon
So kiss me and say that you will understand",Bei mir bist du schön,2004
Eight to the Bar,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man
'We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!",Hotel California,2004
Eight to the Bar,"You do the drying, I'll do the dishes
Who'll do the crying when all the wishes don't come true
You do the washing, I'll do the folding
Whose heart is breaking
When whose arms are holding someone new
Sittin' ona peaceful lake sunnin'
Didn't hear the roar of the waterfall coming
When it's all a storybook story
When it's all so easy and nice
Here comes trouble in paradise

You did the dusting, I did the sweeping
You did the driving oh and I did the sleeping a little too long
On a picnic 'neath the sky so blue
We didn't see the rain and heartache coming through
When it's all an old black and white movie
And you're sure you've seen the ending twice
Here comes trouble in paradise

You said everything was fine
I'm sorry, baby, I didn't see the signs
Oh so beautifully you read your lines
But in a play where the hero has no vice
And love comes without a price
So does trouble in paradise

Don't matter who did the dusting or who did the sweeping
Who did the trusting or who did the cheating when it's all gone
Laying in a field on a summer's day
Waitin' for those gray skies to clear away
Knowing all love's glory and beauty
Can vanish before you think twice
Leaving trouble in paradise

Now we share the laughing, we share the joking
We do the sleeping with one eye open",Jersey Girl,2004

Strictly pimping, as long as tricks invest in women
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-why-see I'm representing
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen
Big dicking, choking hoes with anaconda
If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer

But I ain't tripping though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n

Tongue-kissin' a hoe a nigga know she a doctor
Hoe can make a nigga think she a queen
She standin' there, smellin' like potpourri, I bet she stank in them jeans

Need to shake it, wash it, rinse it, squeeze it and douche it
Call a time-out, freeze, at ease that pussy
They comin' out the woodworks, ain't no pride
They don't get tired, play they vibe and they'll shake it 'til they foot hurt

Say she dressin' for time, she got a lot of that
She ain't no nickel and dime, she got a dollar back
When she step her ass bounce two times
The wobble, wobble, make it hard for her to walk straight lines

You might get stuck in there and need a camera to find her
Gotta hold on to them handlebars 'cause you don't want that broad
Goin' tellin' your dawgs you got handled boy

Give me head 'til yo' muh'fuckin' mouth hurts
Go tell your friends 'bout the suite up at the W
About the view and all the freaky shit I done to you

Now, when she see me, when you're not around
She be in my face, tryin' to see what I'm about
Here, take my number, maybe you can take me out
Take you somewhere and put some dick up in your mouth

No, I like the way you shake it to the left, girl
