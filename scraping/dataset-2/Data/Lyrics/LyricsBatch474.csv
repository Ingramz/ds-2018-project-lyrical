Joeé,"If I could
Then I would

I knew right from the start,
You had so much to hide
I could see it in your eyes.
I don't know what he does,
But I'll wipe your tears away,
Prayin till you see the day.

It's out of my hands,
Till you take a stand,
To his lies
And maybe I'm a fool,
Cause I'm waitin' here for you,

Just let me hold you baby,
If I could,
Then I would,
Give you the stars from heaven above,
In these arms (in these arms)
I'll take you around the world
With the love I have for you

Ooohhhhhhooohhhhh
It tears me apart,
Watchin you fade away,
Knowing he's the one to blame,
If I kissed you goodnight,
Would you believe in me,
Would it give you strength to see,

It's all in your hands,
I'll give you what I can,
Give you time.
And maybe I'm a fool,
Who keeps waitin' here for you

Just let me hold you baby,
If I could
Then I would,
Give you the stars from heaven above,
In these arms (in these arms)
I'll take you around the world
With the love I have for you

If I could
Give you the stars from heaven above
In these arms (in these arms)
I'll take you around the world,
With the love I have for you

I don't know if it shows,
If anyone knows,
I'm cryin' inside of my soul
But I swear (I swear)
It's for you(it's for you)
All I do(all I do)
Cause I can't live my life without you!

If I could
Then I would
Give you the stars from heaven above
In these arms (in these arms)
I'll take you around the world,
With the love I have for you. 
With the love I have for you. 

If I could,
I would!",If I Could,1999
Joeé,"All of this time I've been nothing but good to you
Do what I did just so we could survive
Took in your lies for awhile now I see through you
I still have my pride and it keeps me alive
See I don't believe you
Well I don't believe in you
How can I trust you?
So now whatcha you gonna do?
'Cause it's always about you
This world is only about you
All of this time I've been nothing but good to you
Did all I did just so we could survive
Took in your lies for awhile now I see through you
I still have my pride and it keeps me alive
I don't believe you
I don't believe in you
How can I trust you?
So now whatcha you gonna do?
Because it's always about you
This world is only about you
I think I'm better without you
(Better without you) x repeat
Because it's only about you
I don't believe you
I don't believe in you
How can I trust you?
So now whatcha you gonna do?
Because it's always about you
This world is only about you
I think I'm better without you
(Better without you) x repeat
Because it's only about you
I guess this song is about you",I Don't Believe You,2003
Joeé,"I want somebody to share 
Share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts 
Know my intimate details
Some one who will stand by
My side
And give me support
And in return 
Shell get my support 
She will listen to me 
When I want to speak 
About the world we live in 
And life in general 
Though my views may 
Be wrong
They may even be perverted
She will hear me out 
And won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking 
In fact she will often disagree
But at the end of it all 
She will understand me 

I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought and with 
Every breath
Some one who will help me 
See things 
In a different light 
All the things I detest 
I will almost like 
I don't want to be tied 
To any one strings 
I'm carefully trying to stear clear 
Of those things 
But when I'm asleep 
I want somebody 
Who will put there arms 
Around me 
And kiss me tenderly
Though things like this 
Make me sick 
In a case like this 
Ill get away with it",Somebody,2003
Joel,"I could hear 'em talking as I was laying in that hole
With a mountain of trouble weighing on my soul
They all stood around kicking dirt on my grave
It's a miracle I'm standing here today

I'm walking among the living again
I'm talking and breathing for giving up my sins
I'm finding new faith in the arms of old friends
Now I'm walking among the living again

Now the morning sun is warmer on my skin
I'm hearing nature's song, smelling flowers again
This world is so much brighter than I've ever known
And I swear I heard angels when I rolled away the stone

Now I'm walking among the living again
I'm talking and breathing for giving up my sins
I'm finding new faith in the arms of old friends
Now I'm walking among the living again

I'm walking among the living again
I'm talking and breathing for giving up my sins
I'm finding new faith in the arms of old friends
Now I'm walking among the living again

Joel & Luke,"Don't listen to the TV 
Don't listen to the radio 
Don't let anybody tell you 
That this old ship is going down 

Black bottom of the ocean 
Picked up by an invisible hand 
Have a feeling down my insides 
And now, the sea, the stars, the sky 
The sea, the sea, the sea 

Washed over to the waterfall 
I got swallowed by the undertow 
I twist, I turn, but I know there's only one way out of this 
So honey if you're listening 
Press your lip to the overflow 
Cause I'm just down here praying someone hears my S-O-S 
I'm drowning, reel me in 

Fly back into the lifeboat 
Where did the women and the children go 
Are these men my only friends 
And we love, we love, we cry, we cry 

Out of the boats into the crowds and ooh ho, 
Out of the crowds into the sleepy room 
Pull the covers up to my chin 
And we fall, our eyes, we rise, I fall 
We leave it all behind 

Washed over to the waterfall 
I got swallowed by the undertow 
I twist, I turn, but I know there's only one way out of this 
So if there's anybody listening 
Press your lip to the radio 
Cause I'm just down here praying someone hears my SOS 
I'm drowning, reel me in, reel me in 

Walk back along the gangway 
Back to the arms of the ones I love 
Guess you guys keep your secrets 
Hello, hello, hello 

Washed over to the waterfall 
I got swallowed by the undertow 
I twist, I turn, but I know there's only one way out of this 
So if there's anybody listening 
Press your lip to the radio 
Cause I'm just down here praying someone hears my SOS 

Washed over to the waterfall, ooh ho 
I twist, I turn, but I know there's only one way out of this 
So if there's anybody listening 
Press your lip to the radio

Joel B. Christian,"Oh, come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

God of God
Light of light
Lo, he abhors
Not the virgin's womb
Very God
Begotten not created
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord

See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks
Draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither bend
Our joyful footsteps
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus
To thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come
Let us adore him

Joel Baker,"Came to the city with a bag of dreams
Overpacked and split at the seams
Seems like nothing's really coming true
Even if it did, I still don't have you
I don't really know what these people want
I've seen guys signed without one song
Giving me advice, I just nod along
Leave the building, put Hendrix on

'Cause I know something's gotta give
I know what it is
How long, how long?
How long, how long?
How long, how long?

Got about two people I can trust
Rest of them, they don't know enough, no no
Chi told me that I'm living in my mind
Maybe that's the only home I can find
Lately I've been wondering if you're okay
Remember when you said we'd be friends some day?
I wonder if you know what's happening
Got me thinking 'bout just packing up

'Cause I know something's gotta give
I know what it is
How long, how long?
How long, how long?

How long, how long is it gonna be?
Is it gonna last? Am I gonna see?
Is it gonna be? Is it gonna be?
Am I gonna wait? My head don't wanna see

""Bakes, what's happening?
How you doing fella?
It's Courts, what's going on man?
How's the music going, man?
I've been hearing things, I've been hearing things
Don't, don't be too disheartened
Keep going, keep pushing, don't stop
You will get there in the end, my brother
I promise you",Bag of Dreams,2017
Joel Baker,"I fall for people that need fixing
I know it's a problem of mine
Maybe I need fixing myself
Maybe I don't want any help this time
I've found someone who could be perfect
But I know I'll be the one who's left hurt if
We break apart I've only just met you
But still I'ma let you climb up in my heart, well
She had a little trouble growing up
Didn't like reflections so she was throwing up
Now it's all blowing up, dynamite and lava
Pain written on her face in tears and mascara
She said I'm the only one she's ever told, what a heavy load
I wish I had secrets that I'd never told
'Cause I'd tell you, 'cause I trust you, more than myself
Most of the time it's just you, that I want, that I want, yeah I crave you
Something inside, has convinced me I could save you
That I can take you away from what you're used to
But I know I don't have much that you ain't already used to

I know it's wrong that you're leading me on
But I just can't help myself, I know it's bad for my health
I know I've, been here before, I'm in, love with the cause
My heart wants to help, but I can't save you from yourself

I already told you I got a spare shoulder you can cry on, lie on
And I'm a little older, so I'ma show you how life can push you over
Oh, you already know, you're, no stranger to pain; that's why I like you
Say we're just the same, how I'm just like you
But you're just the same as the others
Here one minute, gone next like the summer, summer, summer
When am I gonna grow up?
Can't let go of my past and my future won't show up
My heart moves fast but my head moves slower
Is it any wonder that my soul needs a sew up, sew up, sew up?
Or tie me up in knots
So hard to break free when my heart's tied up in knots
Well, I mean tied up in Notts where I grew up
Still got some of me left that you could use

I know it's wrong that you're leading me on
But I just can't help myself, I know it's bad for my health
But I've been here before, I'm in love with the cause
My heart wants to help, but I can't save you from yourself

Oh, darling, darling, darling
I can't save you from yourself
Oh, no no no
Oh oh oh, no I can't save you from yourself",Save,2017
Joel Baker,"I broke my heart and it healed back different
Even close up, I feel distant
Every love I ever found wound up missing
The magic is gone now
My dreams went broke and I woke up different
Now even hope looks different
Now there's four armies in my heart all leading the resistance
White flag in the ground, let me give up

Oh, break me in two so I can feel it
Breathe me to life, Lord I need it
Nothing's ever enough
It's getting harder to fall
Oh, open the blinds, let the light in
Stoke up the flames, let the fire in
When it comes to love
It's getting harder to fall
When it comes to love
It's getting harder to fall

Sad stories on the news don't move me
They tell me to be myself, I'm still asking 'who's me?'
Friends tell me settle down, tell me ""don't be choosy""
But I just wanna find the real thing this time
I used to fall in love with anyone at anytime
Bruises all over but I felt alive
Love used to make the danger feel safe
Take me to that real place
Lord, I'm giving up singing out

Oh, break me in two so I can feel it
Breathe me to life, Lord I need it
Nothing's ever enough
It's getting harder to fall
Oh, open the blinds, let the light in
Stoke up the flames, let the fire in
When it comes to love
It's getting harder to fall
When it comes to love
It's getting harder to fall

So tell me how to forfeit
Lower down the drawbridge
Horns around the walls like duh duh duh
Let the choir call blow the doors in
Open my heart, throw in your love then sew it back up
'Cause I just wanna feel something
Way back when love used to mean something
I mean it, I don't wanna wait
Someone tell me how, now what's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take, Lord?

Oh, break me in two so I can feel it
Breathe me to life, Lord I need it
Nothing's ever enough
It's getting harder to fall
Oh, open the blinds, let the light in
Stoke up the flames, let the fire in
When it comes to love
It's getting harder to fall
When it comes to love
It's getting harder to fall
When it comes to love
It's getting harder to fall",Harder to Fall,2018
Joel Baker,"You can reach me by railway, 
You can reach me by trail-way
You can reach me on an airplane, 
You can reach me with your mind

You can reach me by caravan, 
Cross the desert like an Arab man 
I don't care how you get here, 
Just, get here if you can 

You can reach me by sail boat, 
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down the slope, 
Into these arms of mine

You can jump on a speedy colt, 
Cross the border in a blaze of hope 
I don't care how you get here,
Just, get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us, 
Always something to get over 
If I had my way, surely you would be closer
I need,
I need you closer 

You can windsurf into my life, 
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon,
But you better make it soon 

You can reach me by caravan, 
Cross the desert like an Arab man 
I don't care how you get here, 
Just, get here if you can 

I don't care, I don't care, 
I need you right here, right now
Oh, I need you

See, I don't care, I don't care
No, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care how'll you get here
Just get here

Joel Baker,"If someone stood up in a crowd
And raised his voice up way out loud
And waved his arm and shook his leg
You'd notice him

If someone in the movie show
Yelled, ""Fire in the second row
This whole place is a powder keg""
You'd notice him

And even without clucking like a hen
Everyone gets noticed, now and then
Unless, of course, that person it should be
Invisible, inconsequential me

Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya, Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

Suppose you was a little cat
Residin' in a person's flat
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?
You'd notice him

Suppose you was a woman wed
And sleepin' in a double bed
Beside one man for seven years
You'd notice him

A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
Unless that human being next to you
Is unimpressive, undistinguished, you know who

Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there

I tell ya Cellophane, Mister Cellophane
Should have been my name, Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me and never know I'm there
Never even know I'm there

I hope, I haven't taken too much of your time

Joel Birch,"We began as the Earthwalkers shaping a dream.
We were the bright sparks of a new born flame.
Born among seven billion we were the hope interwoven in the web of life.
Power always moves in circles, infinite beyond all sense of time.
This is the force that binds.
Earthwalkers we journey on.
We give everything, everything just to feel alive.
We're following the signs that light the way.
We keep dreaming, this feeling there's no need to hide.
We just keep following the signs.
Now with one dream and many years on, we are the embers that never fade away.
Power always moves in circles.
Fathomless, passionate, won't you dream with us now?
Earthwalkers we journey on.
We give everything, everything just to feel alive.
We're following the signs that light the way.
We keep dreaming, this feeling there's no need to hide.
We just keep following the signs.
Here we are counting the years, as they go past it becomes even more clear:
that with the life of a fountain and the strength of a mountain,
Earthwalkers will never die.
Light the way.
We keep dreaming, this feeling there's no need to hide.
We just keep following the signs.
We give everything, everything just to feel alive.
We're following the signs that light the way.
We keep dreaming, this feeling there's no need to hide.
We just keep following the signs.",Earthwalker,2014
Joel Brandenstein,"Ich hab dich einmal gesehen 
Und für immer entdeckt
Ich hab dich einmal gefragt
Du hast für immer ja gesagt
Komm wir schauen zu den Sternen
Doch hier unten leuchten wir

Doch ich geh jetzt mit dir

Bis meine Welt die Augen schließt
Werd' ich dich lieben
Bis meine Welt die Augen schließt

Wir ziehen leise durch die Nacht 
Und wir brauchen nicht viel
Wir ham uns beinah verpasst 
Und uns dann ein Herz gefasst
Wir verstecken uns im Gras
Feiern lauthals den Regen
Wir brauchen nur uns
Wir fühlen uns wieder mal am leben

Joel Brandenstein,"Wie ein Floss auf hoher See
Treib ich so her, es ist ok
Wie ein glitzerndes Sandkorn am einsamen Strand
Versuch ich aufzufallen, doch bleibe unerkannt
Wie ein Hafen stillgelegt, wie ein Leuchtturm, dem das Leuchten vergeht
Wie ein Boot ohne Segel, das am Felsen zerschellt
Es tut alles gar nicht weh, hier auf hoher See

Wenn das alles nur so einfach wäre
Wär da nicht diese Leere in mir
Auch wenn das Leben manchmal schwer wird
Weiß ich, dass da noch mehr ist

Ich such' den Anker, der mich hällt
Weil irgendetwas in mir etwas fehlt
Ich treibe einsam um die Welt
Weil jeder Ozean von dir erzählt
Dich irgendwann zu finden ist alles, alles was für mich zählt

Wie ein Sturm, der sich nicht legt
Wie die schönste Muschel, der die Perle fehlt
Wie ein Rettungsboot in Seenot
Wie ein Schmerz, der nicht mal wehtut

Doch meistens höher als mein Verstand 
Denn irgendwo da über den Wolken
War stets der Platz wo ich mich fand 
Ich habe furchtbar Angst vorm Fallen
Denn bis ganz hier unten ist es endlos weit
Doch aufgegeben hab ich nie, weil Hoffnung mir Flügel verleiht

Ich will fliegen, wie der Wind, federleicht so frei
Weil Hoffnung mir Flügel verleiht

Ich will fliegen, meilenweit befreit, wie der Wind

Kennst Du noch den Ort aus diesem Traum? 
Wir fahren jetzt dahin

Komm steig ein, Radio laut und weg von hier

Das was Du tust, fühlt sich an wie eine Pflicht
Du spürst ganz genau das ist alles nichts, was Deinem wahren Talent entspricht

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

But I can’t finish what you want to start

And I held my breath as she climbed down
In a white sundress, she looked like an angel
Whose feet had never touched the ground

Stolen time was ours to lose, by the light of a July moon
We were gone in seconds flat
And she said trust me boy so I followed her voice
To find out where the fun was at

And She said take me where ya want to
And I couldn't get there fast enough
By the lake, we made some memories
A night that every boy dreams of
(Made for me & my summer love)
Made for me and my Summer Love

Thought that July, couldn't get much hotter
Until I saw her jump right in
So I waded out, into that water
Even though I could not swim

Not by choice we had to wait
Had to get her home cause it was late
Before her dad could kill me dead
But then she grabbed my hand and I knew right then
I was in over my head

She said take me where ya want to
And I couldn't get there fast enough
By the lake, she said I want you
A night that every boy dreams of
(Made for me & my summer love)
Made for me and my Summer Love

That girl was so full of surprises
I think of her and my temperature rises
Ohhh

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2006

There I'll keep you safe beside me

Where love grows free and wild
Come to my garden
Come, sweet child

Lift me up and lead me to the garden
Where life begins anew
Where I'll find you
And I'll find you love me too

Lift me up and lead me to the garden

Where life begins anew
(Rest there in my arms)
Where I'll tell you, where I'll show you
(There I'll see you safely grown)
A new life, a new life

Where spring will come and stay

Cette âme aux griffes de Satan. {2x}

Un cierge abondamment béni

Joel Favreau,"Anticlérical fanatique
Gros mangeur d’ecclésiastiques,
Cet aveu me coûte beaucoup,
Mais ces hommes d’Église, hélas!
Ne sont pas tous des dégueulasses,
Témoin le curé de chez nous.

Quand la foule qui se déchaîne
Pendit un homme au bout d'un chêne
Sans forme aucune de remords,
Ce ratichon fit scandale
Et rugit à travers les stalles,
""Mort à toute peine de mort!""

Puis, on le vit, étrange rite,
Qui baptisait les marguerites
Avec l'eau de son bénitier
Et qui prodiguait les hosties,
Le pain bénit, l'Eucharistie,
Aux petits oiseaux du moutier.

Ensuite, il retroussa ses manches,
Prit son goupillon des dimanches
Et, plein d'une sainte colère,
Il partit comme à l'offensive
Dire une grand' messe exclusive
A celui qui dansait en l'air.

C'est à du gibier de potence
Qu'en cette triste circonstance
L’hommage sacré fut rendu.
Ce jour là, le rôle du Christ,
Bonne aubaine pour le touriste,
Été joué par un pendu.

Et maintenant quand on croasse,
Nous, les païens de sa paroisse,
C'est pas lui qu'on veut dépriser.
Quand on crie ""A bas la calotte""
A s'en faire péter la glotte,
La sienne n'est jamais visée.

Anticléricaux fanatiques

Au fond, il est content pour toi,
C'est un modeste.

Si, quand un emmerdeur le met
En rogne, on ne le voit jamais
Lever sur l'homme une main leste.
C'est qu'il juge pas nécessaire
D'humilier un adversaire,
C'est un modeste.

Et quand il tombe amoureux fou
Y a pas de danger qu'il l'avoue
Les effusions, dame, il déteste.

Et s'il te traite d'étranger
Que tu sois de Naples, d'Angers
Ou d'ailleurs, remets pas la veste.
Lui, quand il t'adopte, pardi!
Il veut pas que ce soit le dit,
C'est un modeste.

Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito,
e incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito.

Volare, oh oh,
cantare, oh oh oh oh.
Nel blu dipinto di blu,
felice di stare lassu`.

E volavo volavo felice
piu` in alto del sole ed ancora piu` su
mentre il mondo pian piano spariva
lontano laggiu`.
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me.

Volare, oh oh
cantare, oh oh oh oh.
Nel blu dipinto di blu
felice di stare lassu`.

Ma tutti i sogni nell'alba svaniscon perche`
quando tramonta la luna li porta con se`.
Ma io continuo a sognare negli occhi tuoi belli
che sono blu come un cielo trapunto di stelle...

Volare, oh oh
cantare, oh oh oh oh.
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
felice di stare quaggiu`.

E continuo a volare felice
piu` in alto del sole ed ancora piu` su
mentre il mondo pian piano scompare
negli occhi tuoi blu
La tua voce e` una musica dolce che suona per me...
Volare, oh oh
cantare, oh oh oh oh.
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
felice di stare quaggiu`.
Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu
felice di stare quaggiu`.",Volare,2001
Joel Green,"Bartholemew bring me a fork
There's a minstrel parade on tv
Let the lights glow, an excellent reason
To stay home tonight

Oh the old men wave their canes
They have yesterday's brains
And their worlds stop turning on sundays
The young lives are clipped 
And smudged on the rocks
Distorted and forgotten

Quietly she enters the room
But we can't talk, we can not be seen
Returning her new pair of jeans
Just to stay home tonight

Oh the mirror always shows
There's a stranger in my clothes
Standing on the third rail
Lost at sea 
Searching for me
And we don't know how to sail

So if you go to guitar store
You will see me again
Holding the door
It's an excellent night to sleep on the floor
If you stay home tonight

Oh I saw you before
In the guitar store
I was lonely, lazy and useless
And Bartholemew moans 
To the counterfeit clones
When he feels like he's not a human",Bartholemew,2002

Joel Grey,"In the white room with black curtains near the station.
Blackroof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings.
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes.
Dawn light smiles on you leaving, my contentment.

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines;
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.

You said no strings could secure you at the station.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning.

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back;
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves.

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd.
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten.
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes.
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings.

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves.",White Room,

Joel Grey,"This town is full of guys
Who think they're mighty wise,
Just because they know a thing or two.
You see them every day
Walkin' up and down Broadway,
Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,
Like a chump playing stud,
If they lost that old ace down in the hole!",Ace in the Hole,2004
Joel Grey,"Here I am back home again
And I'm here to rest
All they ask is where I've been
Knowing I've been west -

I'm the family's unknown boy
Golden curls and envy hair
Pretty girls with faces fair
See the shine in the black sheep boy -

If you love me let me live in peace
And please understand
That the black sheep can wear the golden fleece
And hold the winning hand

With frozen smiles to chase love away
It's human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

To help the needy and show them the way

Joel Grey,"All you preachers
Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more

Sunny and green?

When other friendships are soon forgit, ours will still be it.
Ah loddle doddle hip hap hap.

Come sniffin around our land
Askin a bunch of questions

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold

He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold

I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
I'm payin' for my mistakes
Now girl, take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door, you may find the old one's closed

So be true to your good man 
Take a lesson from the story I have told
Or you just might get-a left now out in the cold

Joel Rafael,"Take a trip with me in 1913,
To Calumet, Michigan, in the copper country. 
I will take you to a place called Italian Hall,
Where the miners are having their big Christmas ball. 

I will take you in a door and up a high stairs, 
Singing and dancing is heard everywhere, 
I will let you shake hands with the people you see,
And watch the kids dance around the big Christmas tree. 

You ask about work and you ask about pay,
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day, 
Working the copper claims, risking their lives, 
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives. 

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air, 
And the spirit of Christmas is there everywhere, 
Before you know it you're friends with us all,
And you're dancing around and around in the hall. 

Well a little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights,
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet,
To hear all this fun you would not realize,
That the copper boss' thug men are milling outside. 

The copper boss' thugs stuck their heads in the door,
One of them yelled and he screamed, ""there's a fire,"" 
A lady she hollered, ""there's no such a thing. 
Keep on with your party, there's no such thing."" 

A few people rushed and it was only a few,
""It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you,"" 
A man grabbed his daughter and carried her down,
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out. 

And then others followed, a hundred or more,
But most everybody remained on the floor, 
The gun thugs they laughed at their murderous joke, 
While the children were smothered on the stairs by the door. 

Such a terrible sight I never did see,
We carried our children back up to their tree,
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree,
And the children that died there were seventy-three. 

The piano played a slow funeral tune,
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon, 
The parents they cried and the miners they moaned, 
""See what your greed for money has done.""

",1913 Massacre,2003
Joel Rafael,"I went down to the railroad yard, Watch the train come by 
Knew that train would roll that day But I did not know what time.

I did not know what time, boys, did not know what time,
Knew the train would roll that day but I did not know what time.
Good morning, Mister railroad man, what time does your train roll by?

Nine sixteen and two forty four, twenty five minutes ‘til five.
At nine sixteen, two forty four, twenty five minutes ‘til five.
Thank you, Mister railroad man, I wanna watch your train roll by.

Standing on the platform, smoking a big cigar,
Waitin' for some old freight train that carries an empty car.

I rode her down to Danville town, got stuck on a Danville girl,
Bet your life she was a pearl, she wore that Danville curl.

She wore her hat on the back of her head like high tone people all do,
Very next train come down that track, I bid that gal adieu.

I bid that gal adieu, poor boys, I bid that gal adieu,
The very next train come down that track, I bid that gal adieu.

",Danville Girl,2003
Joel Rafael,"As I walked down that old dark town
In the town where I was born, 
I heard the saddest lonesome moan
I ever heard before.

My hair it trembled at the roots 
Cold chills run down my spine, 
As I drew near that jail house
I heard this deathly cry:

O, don't kill my baby and my son, 
O , don't kill my baby and my son. 
You can stretch my neck on that old river bridge, 
But don't kill my baby and my son.

Now, I've heard the cries of a panther,
Now, I've heard the coyotes yell,
But that long, lonesome cry shook the whole wide world
And it come from the cell of the jail.

Yes, I've heard the screech owls screeching,
And the hoot owls that hoot in the night,
But the graveyard itself is happy compared
To the voice in that jailhouse that night.

Then I saw a picture on a postcard
It showed the Canadian River Bridge,
Three bodies hanging to swing in the wind,
A mother and two sons they'd lynched.

There's a wild wind blows down the river,
There's a wild wind blows through the trees,
There's a wild wind that blows 'round this wide wide world,
And here's what the wild winds say:

O, don't kill my baby and my son, 
O, don't kill my baby and my son. 
You can stretch my neck on that old river bridge, 
But don't kill my baby and my son.

",Don't Kill My Baby and My Son,2003
Joel Rafael,"If you'll gather 'round me, children,
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.

It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode. 

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard. 

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down. 

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name. 

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes. 

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill. 

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say: 

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief. 

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen. 

And as through your life you travel,
Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.

",Pretty Boy Floyd,2003
Joel Rafael,"I went down to the fishing hole, 
And I set down with my fishing pole; 
Somethin' grabb'd my hook and it got my bait 
And Jerked me out in the middle of the lake. 
Huh it was some jump boy, 
I got sunk, kinda baptized on credit.

Fishin' down on th' muddy bank, 
Felt a pull an' give a big yank, 
I drug out three old rubber boots, 
A Ford radiator an' a Chevrolet coop 
(Nothin' but Junk, so I handed it in 
For National Defence).

Settin' in a boat with a bucket of beer,
Hadn't caught nuthin' but didn't much care,
I guess I was pretty well satisfied, 
Had my little woman right by my side 
(Takin' it easy, just waitin' 
Worm been gone off-a that hook for a couple of hours. 
I was busy).

When you go fishin', tell y' what to do, 
Go set down by the grassy dew, 
Take a piece of string, tie it on yo' pole, 
Throw it way out in th' middle of th' hole. 
Find you a good shady tree and then just set down. 
(Go to sleep, forget all about it 
Can't catch nuthin' here anyways.)

Well I walked out to a sandy bar, 
And I caught myself a big alligator gar, 
Drug him home across my back, 
Tail was dragging a mile and a half, 
Flippin' an' floppin'. I sold him for a quarter. 
(Shot craps, got in Jall.)

Jumped in the river and went down deep, 
There was a hundred pound cat-fish lying there asleep, 
Well I jumped on his back and rode him all aroun' 
Saddled him up and I came into town.
People came runnin', lookin', dogs a-barkin' 
(Kids a-squallin').

Early one mornin' I took me a notion, 
To go out fishin' in the middle of the ocean, 
Well, throwed me a line, I got me a shark, 
I didn't get him home till way past dark. 
(Was he a man-eater, tough customer. 
But he wasn't quite tough enough.)

Late last night I had me a dream, 
I was out fishin' in a whiskey stream, 
Baited my hook with apple-jack, 
Threw out a drink, drug a gallon back. 
(Done pretty good till the creek run dry. 
I give the fish back to the finance company.)

The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away

If there are words for Him, then I don't have them.
You see my brain has not yet reached the point.
Where it could form a thought that could adequately
describe the greatness of my God
And my lungs have not yet developed the ability to,
release a breathe with enough to agility to
breathe out the greatness of His love
And my voice, you see my voice is so inhibited
Restrained by human limits,
that's hard to even send the praise up
You see if there are words for Him,
I don't have them
My God, His grace is remarkable
Mercies are innumerable
Strength is impenetrable
He is honorable, accountable
Favorable, He's unsearchable yet knowable
Indefinable yet approachable
Indescribable yet personal
He is beyond comprehension
Further than imagination
Constant through generations
King of every nation
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
You see my words are few
In trying to capture the one true God
Using my vocabulary would never do
But I use words as an expression,
An expression of worship to a Savior
A Savior who is both worthy and deserving of my praise
So I use words
My heart extols the Lord. Blesses His name forever.
He has won my heart, Captured my mind
And has bond them both together
He is defeated me in my rebellion
Conquered me in my sin
He has welcomed me into His presence
Completely invited me in
He has made Himself the object of my sight
Flooding me with mercies in the morning
Drowning me with grace in the night
But if there are words for Him,
Then I don't have them.
But what I do have is, good news
For my God knew that manmade words
Would never do, the words are just tools
That we use to point to the truth
So He sent His son Jesus Christ
As The Word, living proof
He is the image of the invisible God
The first born of all creation
For by Him all things were created
Giving nothingness formation
And by His words He sustains
In the power of His name
For He is before all things
And over all things He reigns
Holy is His name
So praise Him for His life
The way he preserved in strife
The humble son of God becoming the perfect sacrifice
Praise Him for His death (pause)
That He willingly stood in our place
That He lovingly endured the grave
That He battled our enemy
And on the third day rose in Victory
He is everything that was promised
Praised as the risen King
Lift your voice and sing
For one day He will return for us
And we will finally be united with our Savior
For eternity, eternity
So it's not just words that I proclaim
For my words point to The Word
And The Word has a name
Hope has a name
Joy has a name
Peace has a name
Love has a name
And that name is Jesus Christ

My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1999

Tantas mentiras que esconde el amor,
Tantos secretos sin resolver

Joell Ortiz,"Giancana back at y'all niggaz
This shit is bigger than killin' the President
Ignor-Entertainment up in this motherfucker y'all

It's nothing! Infrared beams laser the place
Two straps, radiate at the waist, I'm a marksmith
Them things bark man, sprayin' with haste
Shit razor gladiator your face, soakin your strip
Hoodied up, loc in the whip, pokin' the clip
Arm extended out the window, chokin' the fifth
Legend or myth seek a Taliban, hit Babylon
Don't misinterpret the smile of a Don, I'm fowl as a swan
Get at you, spit at you with ya child in ya arms
Clap at your bitch, full semi'matics eclipse
Display rage like an evil omen
Trust me in the backseat when you drivin'
I'll pop your fuckin' cerebral open
Take position when them snakes hissin'
End up nickel-plate kissin', out of state missin'
Get graveled in the battles and wars, rattle the four
'Cause cattle when you rhyme big you sound like you horse
Let's do it

[Chorus]
It's nothing! Dudes'll talk like they killers
But they eyes can't disguise the fact they really fear us
It's nothing! Them big rims on the truck
That slim hoe that you pluck? That flossin'll get you stuck dude
It's nothing! This ain't your ordinary rap
It's extraordinary scrap - Cris', pour the Henny back like
It's nothing! (What's my name?) G Rap, Giancana
No throwbacks are fitted, we own rap and spit like
It's nothing!

Five star general ranked in the game I don't respect y'all sergeants
I wreck you varmints, eject them comments, and wet y'all garments
I bank sure as the flames from out them Texas orange
Keep fresh hoes in flesh and bondage, collect and garnish
This ain't a threat it's a promise; give you a hospital bed
And a harness, reps get tarnished if you don't hit that deck
For homage and beg for your pardon, G Rap head of the squadron
Kid be sent to alarmin'; you flipped and stepped out of margin
You infuriated the Gods and the stars and
The sky's bout to thunder, you low-life come out from under
About to heat your winters and drought your summers
One right up on your fort, forty-five Colt buckin' the horse
Give your body your nuts in divorce
Dick in the dirt, you flip to the earth
Check where the hit tip grippin' the shirt
Get a flashback, flick to your birth
It's war for you morons, we wave four arms
Draw with arms, more arms and more arms and more arms
G Rap Giancana that raw Don made my bones
When I was a young buck I played with chrome
Blaze Stallone, get your brains blown, grazin' the dome
Get my stage on, the rage is on, my nigga

I ain't tryin' to bring New York back
I'm just a breath of fresh air
That good ole' New York rap
Slick talk to the track
C'mon who brought that
To the game
Graffiti all on the train
Get up your name
I don't feel how I used to feel
I'm in my 20's
So a new Nas joint used to give me the chills
In the barbershop tryin to cop a new hot tape
The Rob Lowe's is crazy
The duhops greatest Hip Hop (hip hop)
And yes I'm a fan first
If you from the south and you snap til' your hands hurt
If you from the west W's in the air
If you from the east coast act like you from here
The good ole' 2 step
The classic head nod
The thirsty ice grills
Who wants to get robbed? (robbed)
That was the energy in the club
On the real that was the energy that I loved

Aww man this is (hip hop)
Hands up if you forever a fan of (hip hop)

'Cause I am (hip hop)

I ain't tryin make you dance I just rip beats
But the soul in my voice give you quick feet
I don't know what it's like to not dig deep
When I'm holdin' this mic
I don't just beat pip squeeks
The tides come in and the earth shakes
200 mph wind I'm your worst fate

July 6 1980
How can your age even matter when you rhyme this crazy
Aw man I gotta thank the lord
'Cause with this pen in my hand
I don't think that hard
It just happens
Wrist action classic in the making
I kick back and just laugh I'm happy that I'm amazing
Look at me gaze into my eyes see the poverty
Now understand why me and this music gotta be
It's something that's inside of me
And I can't shake it
So I embrace it
And let ya'll taste it",Hip Hop,2007

It ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it real
When niggas see you, they salute you

Love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it true
When niggas see you, they salute

Royce da 5'9"" give ya ill verses
Ryan Montgomery is the real person
No makeup, that's why you couldn't touch me up
I remember being locked up
This nigga walked up, tryna battle, I went ahead and let 'em finish
Then I told 'em, ""Do that again, I'mma fuck you up""
Now take a journey through a nigga's psyche
The only snitch in my life is the chick tryna split up me and wifey
You think you like me, I'm aight with that
I don't even call my nigga Budden ""Mouse"", it sound too much like a rat
So may your steps be just like your stacks
High, afraid of death, having a life attack
It's I, got the soldiers for the coca price
Your poker face on, I'm a turn your channel to the Poltergeist
My outta town niggas know the business
When you land, I'll come get you, we gon' get it

It ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it real
When niggas see you, they salute you

It ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through and knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it trill
When niggas see you, they salute you

It ain't nothing like walking your block
One deep on your city streets nigga, no hawk or no Glock
No blades in your mouth or box cutters in socks
Cause real niggas show love and bad bitches on your jock
Every corner got a homie you know well
Even if somebody see a deal, then they won't tell
Your man say he got the goods, so you trying him out
The ice cream truck roll through, you buying 'em out
The youngstas helping out the old folks, with something hard to do
The kids is playing, nobody beefing and it's a barbeque
And every backyard with the old school jams on
Sweet potato pie courtesy of your grandma
Already, everybody's home, nobody on the yard
We drinking and smoking the night away with no regard
Nobody arguing and everything's good
Man it ain't nothing like love from the hood, that's understood

It ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like rolling through knowing you good
Cause you been keeping it real
When niggas see you, they salute you

Come on, it ain't nothing like love from the hood
Ain't no feeling like coming through knowing you good
Cause you be keeping it G
When they see you, they salute you

Word, it ain't nothing like, what I do every other night
Pick up the liquor, send the fiends to go get the cups and ice
Sit on that project bench and have some of the funnest nice
We spend that wrong doing making money the summer right
The smell of somebody barbeque got my stomach hype
'tata salad, rice and some chicken, a little something light
A beast with the cards, they always ask me to shuffle twice
Swear that I be cheating, I'm just fucking nice, cut that
Rug rat, niggas that robbed, never tried your boy
Only just me, no security that I employ
I never need to wear iron toy, I ain't naive
I just hang with some killers and I'm their pride and joy
But nah, ain't about that right now
It's about the jokes, weed smoke and the cat fights, meow
It's about them New Year's on the roof, with your gat like bloaw
Outside the booth I'm the truth, give me dap like ""Yaowa""",Hood Love,2009

The guest list has been compiled so that you go out in style
You don't mind if my friends introduce themselves, do you Leroy? 
Then let the games begin!

Ha! Back up in the booth and my ""V"" is for Vendetta
Fuck the last rhyme, to tell you the truth I got 10 better
I bend letters over 'til they look like ""n's""
And then offend so many men with them, they look like fems
I'm a feminine rebel, forever cleverer than your shit
Never be level with niggas' shit, my flow can float bitch
Figure out the dosage to administer vaccines
Sickness I invoke in close considered the Black Jean
It's Blakroc, it's Blacksmith
Miss Grae and I'm back, bitch
Hulk-smash harass a motherfucker most passionate 
Fashion plate, magistrate
Fascinating lady, grab your Vaseline and masturbate
Emasculate your manhood, possibly damn good
Dismantle all your posse turn them pussy with tan hoods
Don't push me, I don't land good
Liable to fly up off the handle like a pan would
And ""swoosh,"" hit. Mrs. Woods

Salt rivers flowing out my eyeballs
Pierced side, broke legs, bearing my cross
The old heads told me life wasn't a game
But mine steady feeling like pinball, dodgeball
Chasing freedom, establish a kingdom
And build a stone castle out of thinwall, drywall
I'm a keep going 'til God call or the sky fall
Or they blast me on a grassy knoll and try to blame Oswald
Average Joe Blow, mastering my mojo
Cinder block, karate chop
Practice in the dojo (uh)
If it's so-so, I'll probably be a no show
Shootin' the willy bobo out on Nostrand with the po' folks (uh)
Black dragon rap, flames out the nostrils
From Crown Fried to Roscoe's I'm spreading the gospel
I overcame like the Saints done the Falcons
Like Hoover did to Malcolm

Yaowa!
Y'all know what the fuck I do
Bubble gum buster, so easy to fuckin' chew
Lyrics I blow bubbles to
Unoriginal, it's easy to make another you
Finding my telly keys the only way you'll get a W
Niggas ain't grizzly, y'all all soft and huggable
I came up in the gutter, you came up like all the Huxtables
You don't want me to black-belt-to-death you
Karate chop your pops, Liu Kang kick your nephew
Hi yaowa! To hell is where I send 'em
Y'all just learned the art
I been tighter than your denims
I'll ""Ryu"" or ""Ken"" 'em
I'm classic with the pen
Give me five minutes I'll show you I'm deadly with the venom
Poison with the darts
See your boys be in the park
My boy be in the park
Yeah, annoyin' all the narcs
We two different types, see, you spit what you write
What I spit is the truth and truth comes to the light

Bang bang, tobacco roller, smoke show, mofo sensei
Blue cloak, red stripe, get right head shot
Bass bang, necks crane, fresh construction when
Ski percussion, black hour, bad Boogie Man
Brought all my cousins again
Sisters and brothers and 'em
Bey's they center edge, overs and unders of them
Ain't no fuckin' with them
Ain't nan suckers within
Never closed, hella flows
Ice cold, never froze
Me and the exceptionals
Too high to get over on
A blue Jabbar, sittin 'til it's game point
Pick and roll, give and go
No ordinary miracle
Freedom fighters' spiritual
Eagle eye aerials
Sun spot, mountain top
Fresh water fountain drop
Open our dreams
Fresh green, quartz counter top
The ashtray, that 3rd water Kings county rock
Black heed powerhouse
Can't shut the power out
Tell 'em quit wildin' out
Show ya what I'm bout about

Long nigga bustin' out they punk heat
I make a massacre, try to rob one of my donkeys
But I ain't wettin' that
I don't wanna send nobody back, violently, fakin' that
Promise you, got somethin' Lord that'll honor you
Blow your little head off while you're tyin' your shoe
But back in the kitchen, Pyrex's
Occupied by the twins, bank robbers with large records
Hard vest-es, '86 ga-ga John
Benatar rockin' some frames and fake guns when they rob Sha Born
'Til then they snatch you, axe you

And we don't wanna rap to you, it's not kosher
It's not a code in la costra nostra to roast ya

Rock you to sleep, like I got these lil' bitches, come over!

Shot my lil' cous', I do my art to favor, watch this
I never been this itchy, hope these cops just
Get a donut urge and just splurge, you got the nerve to play third?
In a softball tournament round my waist, yeah that's ya word
You bird, I'll put your beak on the curb but anyway
Looks like a good game, the pigs ain't leavin' so I'mma lay
Nice play, just too bad it's your last
Couple bundles of D, and 200 cash that sat you in the grass
I watch the teams line up, shake hands, guess the game's over
Faggot nigga hopped in the Liberty, fake Range Rover
I'm on his (Tail) like, Sonic lil' shorty
Palmin' on a 40, broad day I'm tryin' to dodge a cover story
Look like he stoppin for gas, I'mma pluck 'em, yay
This had to be his most, unlucky lucky day
Two brothers come out 7/11 in Army wear and stand there
I'm actin' like my tires need air
He close the gas cap, too many things goin' his way
So I just cash that, y'all probably think I'm buggin' but hey
I know them games in Lindsay Park is every Sunday, he ain't goin' nowhere
I went home, switch gear, went out and grabbed me a beer
Ten drinks later I'm at Burger King window for a Whopper
Look left and see partner, I hit the stash Blaka, now that's drama

Who the fuck you think you is, Ron O'Neal?

Fully dressed bitches watchin' them, with they snubs on

Niggas say they pushin' Phantoms, we don't see the opera
Niggas steady rockin' dreads, you ain't even rasta
Take your New Era off, and reveal

That'll chop your fuckin' head off, and throw it on the grill
Take the gold out your mouth and throw it in they grill

So I won't let up like constant rain
Fam y'all just suck, constant brain
Homie your flow is too frail for toe-to-toe with Joell
I know you want me to fail; IT'S SO!
It's hard comin from the bottom
So hard, the pressure to the top
But there's no going back now
Don't you quit, don't you give up
Don't you give up! No (never give up)

Joell Ortiz,"Uh, I got bitches on my dick, I don't want 'em there.
Closet full of brand names, I don't wanna wear.
Everybody got advice that I don't wanna hear, world in ya palm,
But you don't wanna share, still, I'm followin' you.
Are you leadin' me with the weapons drawn?
Co-dependent on her, but got me in bed alone.
You say if you love it, let it go.
Nothin' set in stone, plus every rock they throw, I use as a stepping stone.
Got questions, say the answers better left unknown.
No I may not never see you, I should know you never gone.
So I break the mirror cause, everything it's showin' me is wrong.
Grab your hand and go along, cause I'm followin' you.
Say I should be pleased, what if I'm saddened?
Always say I been through worse, what if I haven't?
But if that holds true, here's the lesson,
If you keep your head down, you might miss out on the blessing.
Sing!

[Chorus]
I don't need the money, I don't need the fame.
I don't need the lifestyle, I don't need the pain.
I don't need the clubs, I don't need the cars.
None of that really matters to me.
I don't want the bad bitch, I don't want the strain.
I don't want the high, enough shit on the brain.
I don't want whatever's gonna help me be sane,
I just wanna follow your lead.

You sayin', ""follow my lead, follow, follow my lead""
Brought me to my knees, she must wanna holla at me.
When the world feel like swallowin' me,
When every decision costly, and I ain't got a dolla on me.
Check it, I don't wanna pretend, I don't wanna live a lie.
I don't wanna be judged, don't wanna be criticized.
I don't wanna talk, if nothin' I wanna say,
Boy, I let 'em get to know me, the more they just runaway.
And that, must be your way of sayin' we should stay together.
I know how to fuck it up, more then I can make it better.
I figured folk around me would learn to take it better,
Instead of tryna change me, I been this way forever.
Time will reveal, more will be shown.
You pushed it, I thought the door closed on it's own.
But uh, nevermind what caused it, livin' a dream,
Nothin' in this world powerful enough to pause it.
Sing!

[Chorus]

Sayin' ""follow my lead, follow, follow my lead.""
Cig in my mouth, prescription bottle by me.
And even when I think you might be making a mistake,
I may not know the destination but I make it there safe.
Check it, when I feel like I can't get weaker, uh
You always come and make a cameo or feature.
I'm good with my insanity and fevers
Cause Pac's looking from heaven saying ""They ain't understand me neither""
Alotta times you leave me exposed,
And laugh at me, still thinking I could be in control.
Help me weather the storm, altogether I ain't norm.
Cause I always disagree, though you ain't never been wrong.
Listen, I was feeling nearly unstoppable,
And now I'm facing what appeared to be impossible.
Feeling unimportant enough to have to bother you.
But I'm down here alone nigga, all I got is you.

[Chorus]

Uh, follow my lead.
Ohhh, follow my lead.

(Check it, YAOWA)
I can't fit it all in a 16,
The night that I was tipsy,
And all them bullets just missed me.
The day they rushed the block,
I was strapped, but they didn't frisk me.
Why I ain't fuck that stripper?
Don't ask, and now she sick B.
The drop on that jewelry store for 50.
And I backed out last minute like ""nah, this shit look risky""
One of my mans dead, the other one in pikipsy?
'nother one in the feds, he'll be there until he's sixty.
I wanna thank you for the blessings and the gifts.
And the lessons and the messages they left, I get the drift.
Fuck the cheddar or whatever, it don't measure up to this.
I mean, never did I ever not remember you exist.
When I hop up out my bed, here's together,
And our wish, is what you is from the heart,
Inside my chest, you let it tick.
I love you from my soul, with every spiritual molecule.
Fuck twitter, all a nigga gotta do is follow you.

Joell Ortiz,"I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (yeah)
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

I look over my shoulder not knowing where it's coming from
But knowing that its coming, I was bugging as a youngin'
Now I'm runnin' from, a somethin' that'll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleedin' out his lungs and spittin'
Do any sins go unforgiven? I hope not
'Cause most of mine were hunger driven, nothing in my mother's kitchen,
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and that thunder hitting
So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missin'
So not a chef but the cocaine forever cookin'
I love kids but now I' selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand,
Gun on my waist and, ""I don't give a fuck"" is my plan.
You'll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet
Go on let shorty sing
'Cause ain't no way in hell this ain't Joell,
That's brave enough to tell you everything

And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

Fuck all that rapping, I'mma let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop it? Make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'mma take a shot
And Hope the stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yeah thanks a lot, I'm a bottle drinkin' nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleanin’ these demons out
In order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Ain't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon cause you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
That’s when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked I’s youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real, bro

I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet (yeah)
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

I thought I had it locked away till forever
But no memories fade away, they seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then why's the pain still with me?

See the problem is, I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there’s no remorse
Maybe the lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus all
We could talk about pain 24/7 dog, that’s my department
Intercity blues cruise and I’m blasting that Marvin
Skeletons ain’t in my closet, that’s my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
It's all bleak to me
Tell my Pop I ain’t bothered when he don't speak to me, I love you but it’s weak to me
On one hand life is short and there’s no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog, I’m kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam, judge but you don’t understand
Me against the world, I plan on winning, though I'm under-manned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent

Gave 'em that look so y'all don't know but that's your man now
My shooters is yours, extra hands out
But not a hand-out
Nickle, you had me feelin' fly up in the No Fly
Walkin' through that Motorcity Inn like I was multi
Goons on both sides, somebody sneeze that nigga daddy wear a bow tie
And Crook, I'm always comfortable on your side
Sauce you a Boss, Horseshoe what it do?
C-Style hold ya head, Tray Deee can’t wait to meet you
And Jumpoff, when that whole shit jumped off, I ain’t gon name no names

Chemistry you never seen before
We the four, Well-known plus worth knowing you niggas either or
Even if we was poor never seen a tour
And Eminem didn’t put our CD in a convenience store anymore
We can still hit the streets and score
I help us finance our dreams on a triple beam
Never bicker for simple things
Loyalty is royalty with these Shady royalties
I will loyally help you pay all your lawyer fees
It’s much deeper than the art of rap
It’s realer than me signing a few autographs
Rocking my new slaughter tats
I was raised to keep it G since snap Starter hats
And bury our enemies like artifacts these are the facts
Like Chinese food in the fridge we a cold combination
Slaughter slaughter my whole conversation

I'mma be mad cold and I’m cut this way, no matter where I’m at
It’ll be black roses on Mother’s day, on they mama front door mat
You know I'm, I’m quick to jump in front of fire in the line of fire
You ain’t got to ask what side I’m on I’m going homicide
May I simply cease to exist if I should be a bitch
If you should die and I should stay behind we actually a switch
As far as passing you a chick, you get the alley-oop you ask for the assist
This is a fact, it’s more than rap to me it's
More serious than holding a loaded gat to me I sold my soul to a bottle of Patron
And my favorite uncle died of an illness alchy related then he stole it back from me
And now he up in heaven like neph, you owe it back to me
I was taught that too much talking will make you fall faster
My actions show that I’m real I ain’t got to broadcast it
I called you and said that I had to fall back I had to recover
And here we are, that’s for my brothers

Look, the love I got for ya’ll goes unsaid
Was there when me and shorty unwed
For that I’m always down to pump lead
We formed a bond against the cowards
Only grew over time in the studio for hours
And tours with no showers, and towns I never heard of was no small fort
But we was all sports, Slaughterhouse t-shirts in our ball shorts
Quick all that other shit, that's just other shit
Love is love, we ain't even gotta discuss this shit
The part that's sick G?
My brothers love me so much, I think their punch hit ya’ll harder than it hit me
Four of the best in the world, I put a M on it
And if that ain't enough I’m putting Em on it
We back to hogtying beats up and stepping on it
Back on our old shit just like Nino Bless is on it
Crowds screaming, the fans can get excited
And oh, as far as that question? I won't even dignify it

Y'all don't know what we been through
It wasn't simple
She was bringing them ends through when it was rent due
I would scoop her from uptown inside that rental

To bail me out when I bailed on her for a couple pounds
She bought me all my Air Max's and I would run the town
Spinning Pun around in my CD player and bubble down
If it wasn't for shorty wop y'all wouldn't love my sound

Never wait to get shot at to shoot, that's some dummy shit

Moms ain't cook yesterday so ain't no leftovers
Still every fuckin' Halloween I would egg yolk ya

Your jewelry and clothes, that's startin' to pop up

I'm in the backway with a bird and I'm standin' behind her
I remember that first feeling, remember that first feeling
No condom, I was illin'
Dead ass
Young, dumb with a gun and just feining to turn you to a dead ass

And they found son in the street, nobody know what happened but

Let me leave that right there before I incriminate myself

Takin' cash from hoes like a sorority
Oh yeah they comin' for your life
I'm comin' for your life
It's bonded, I'm livin' out of spite
You ain't bleed then it wasn't worth the fight
I'm givin' y'all bread and water, ah bread and water all they get
And it ain't shakin' no hands, so fuck your politics

Their own cars is better than all our rentals are

Like Bruce Jenner and menopause
Ain't never told us detox the senators
I say they sent us to detox the criminals

Emilio ain't gon' ever fall, I told y'all

Everybody pressin' charges, they ain't change where I'm from
It's no game, even Ndamukong Suh
Connect try to keep me out the loop
It's canine proof, all my birds in the coop
Niggas wanna see me in the cage, but why?
My lawyer gets surprised with the money I save
I'm low like Fetty Wap's left eye
I coulda sworn I saw Left Eye at Best Buy
Nike slippers, read the paper on the milk crates
Sippin' Arizona, I got stripes like a Zebra Cake
Believe me, fast money like a relay
Shopped in SoHo when Prince Street had replays
?, I love my heritage
And fuck the race, if you real you my relative
Why so sensitive?
The revolution will be tele-vized
Excuse the grammar, I'm a ghetto kid
My grandma still alive and all 11 kids
Only my father made it, let's reminisce another time
Bought a watch with these bars to kill time
Sick in the head, now that's an ill mind
Shine like a d-d-diamond ? young
I said one day I'd have a Lambo, not a Hyundai
I kill for these stacks like Jimmy Caan
Wait let a G win like the Padres
Let a G win like Tony's last name
Who played first base for San Diego
Had to break it down
Fuck the cops, we gotta triumph
Fight for Freddie right now, it's about to be more riots
They wanna kill the youth when they need more guidance
With more violence you can only expect more defiance
It's hard to be vocal when they shoot you up and choke you
Die unexpected if the wrong one approach you
Sharpton ain't doin' enough, where's all the leaders?
Breakin' the same laws, we follow how they teach us
I never seen a thug win a million with Regis
Or a single mother from the ghetto either
Fuck y'all

It's a small island in the Caribbean that we be in
Goes by the name of Puerto Rico

Nigga the champ is here, Cassius Clay in his prime
The Mike Tyson, Bruce Lee, Stephen Hawking of rhymes
Combined with Einstein's mind and then refined like it's wine
I write divine rhymes, I fill my time by feelin' these dimes
Fill my satisfaction with valid rappin' and Magnum wrappin'
Fact I haven't felt emotions that's potent since daddy's passin'
I'm the Marilyn Manson of ? relax in baths of acid
I got True Religion jeans, if I kill you it's act of passion
I'm a dragon from ?
Aptitude is ample to pass all the rap masters
Who master it, cracking ribs
Put you in the earth, what it's worth you can act natural
The pragmatical mathematical rappin' cannibal
Who fight with animals, Bronx nigga that has an attitude
You see my avenue is compatible with a battle room
I never sold crack, just wrote dope lines to hand to you
Package that, I got the Cadillac of flows
Cataracts these hoes cause I'm soundin' like platinum gold
You never see a ghost, that's what me and my dad was told
So now I'm pickin' up the torch while these labels haggle my soul
Y'all can suck the undercuts of my nuts while I take a shit
Only spend nights, I don't gotta know what patience is
All you niggas bitches, to exist you gotta take my rent
Blow your fuckin' head off clean bro, save the witness

Latino, I'm that and I'm proud
If you don't know us, let me tell you about
Niggas that slam their dominoes loud, let you see copy
Beef copy ox cutter make his cheep choppy
Cherry coco, peña drip 'til your teeth sloppy
Hustlers become connects when they need papis
Lease a Honda, Chevy on the back block
Runnin' routes with the bow bow in the stash box
When I speak it's chop yaow, I'm a New Yorican
Calderon on the phone, I'm in ? creepin'
Y'all hangin' on resorts to just chill
I'm in the caserios take a walk down the hill
One way in, one way out, where y'all all could get killed
Leave them niggas alone, that's how the officers feel
Nigga, my people, beach, 98 gettin' our tan on
Slippers walkin' on ?, hittin' the sand strong
But plan wrong, it will transform
Wet you then find a Jet Blue out to San Juan
We don't look for parties, the party's wherever we go
Turn the corner section to the 4th of Julio
Too much to fit in one 16
So let me cook like the festival on 1/16
Mean, my career's been like one sick dream
A nightmare, scary how I does this thing
You ain't elite, I'm made of deep
God thought he was stuntin' when he created me
Rap's Bobby Fischer, nigga please take a seat
I made you in three moves: ink, paper, beat
Y'all keep playin', nigga, we play for keeps
Stop claimin' to be what my eyes don't see though
Every verse I spit, you get an 'ay dios mio'
This time with my amigos, Latinos","Latino, Pt. 2",2015
Joell Ortiz,"You niggas want war? Trust me you don't want war
Homeboy, you don't know how serious it could be
Man, the feeling starts, it's a million man march
No games, all my soldiers as serious as can be be
When we pull up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho
Then we run up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho

Man, y'all done gone and did it, well come on with it
The fifth got a kick, but won't slip, I rubber gripped it
Wrap you in them sheets on Christmas, I'm double-gifted
Double barrel shotty, you double jointed when you flippin'
Ask about your boy, they'll tell you I'm not the fella
Tomato sauce whoever tryna shred up my mozzarella
I guess it's in my genes, no prints if I got the poke out
Man, let these nigga's reach, I'm Iverson with the blow out
Sometimes you gotta show out, just to show 'em what Joe 'bout
Give 'em the green light, well fuck it, where we even goin' now?
Got shooters on the scanner, you never know what we spoke 'bout
Picture Tony Montana with hammers runnin' in Sos' house
Ghost Town
Bullets in the beach chair, lines drawn, break the sand
Got bad news, sit 'em down, nah, nigga take a stand
Dirty crackheads run up on you, ""What you was sayin', man?""
It's lights out, won't even take a bath, ha

No matter where they from I disappeared and dump
No choice but to swear they dumb, but we're not dumb
I'm on my Luke Skywalker, get your Jedi spun
I'm on my DMC, I hear them things rev, y'all run
Guess it's begun, get the private jet, pilot set
Alibi in check, to the island head, make sure it's no survivors left
'Round up all the hostages, bum stiggity bum, stiggity bum
Hey, I mean a lot of them, shit be soundin' like Das EFX
I pay no mind to the talkin' 'til it's a heightened threat
Never baby nigga's with envy to give me my respect
I eject bullets from rifles wearin' a sniper vest
Find your body OTC, you're like a Prilosec
Y'all won't even hear me comin', Michael Myers' steps
Hear that thing ch-ch-choppin' 'til no tires left
Bulldogs bark, 4s roars like a lion's breath
I love new toys, so I invest

Applyin' a sticker to his Spiderman lunchbox
When even role models tell us we're born to be felons
We're never gettin' into Harvard or Carnegie Mellon
And we gon' end up either robbin' somebody or killin'

That's why you hustle hella hard, never celebrate a holiday
That'll be the day I coulda finally hit the lottery
I refuse to ever lose or throw my shot away
Or chalk it up as just another one that got away
So I'm unapologetic, I'm on my calesthenics

My point of destination's different from where I was headed

Rise up
If you livin' on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
When are folks like me and you gonna rise up?

All my soldiers, what's good? We need to rise up
We ain't got no other choice, we need to rise up
Rise up!

Throughout my travels and journeys through life I've been searchin'
And been learnin' to be the type of person to display how determined I get
When I'm certain, inside I feel that fire that's burnin'
Like a knife that is turnin', I fight while I'm hurtin'
Sometimes they're right 'cause life is a burden
Like the pain from a bite that'll worsen
Tryna stifle the light that'll shine on me first and
Before I ride in a hearse and
My breathing stops and you'll never take my one shot I got 'fore I lie in the earth
And now I kill again on that Hamilton Hercules Mulligan
Readin' in Vanity Fair or the Huffington
Done with the sufferin', we in the guts again, family rushin' in
Wonder where Busta been, feelin' the hunger and feedin' the lust to win
See I've been patiently waitin' for this moment
To rise up again, that's the way I was molded
And as the last one standin' as the rest of them foldin'
Give me my one chance to grab the torch and properly hold it

Oh, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
And once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
Oh, why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

So, now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Oh, now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.
....................................

the original song of RICHARD FARINA
(copyright Whitmark and Sons) is the following

Now is the time for your loving, dear,
And the time for your company
Now when the light of reason fails
And fires burn on the sea
Now in this age of confusion
I have need for your company.

It's once I was free to go roaming in
The wind of the springtime mind
It's once the clouds I sailed upon
Were sweet as lilac wine
So why are the breezes of summer, dear
Enlaced with a grim design?

And where was the will of my father when
We raised our swords on high?
And where was my mother's wailing when
Our flags were justified?
And where will we take our pleasures when
Our bodies have been denied?

For I am a wild and a lonely child
And the son of an angry land
Now with the high wars raging
I would offer you my hand
For we are the children of darkness
And the prey of a foul command.

Joep Lumeij,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Joep Lumeij,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good

The winds that ride
On the high tide
Whistle a melody

And that's how the
Surf gave birth untold to

And you've gotta move cause

Puts a brand new kind of
Thinking in your mind
And you can't go wrong

He said I couldn't afford the one at Sears so the good lord planted one right here
He carved out what he saw within and he gave it to my dad when he turned ten

Past the bark and all the scars
There was a guitar in the heart of that old tree
All from just one seed
A hundred years and it just grew
And only heaven knew just what it'd be
And how that tree could sing
All the time to become what it should
There were songs in the heart of the wood

He said we can mark a tree to keep from getting lost
And it'll always point our way home like that old rugged cross

A hundred years and it just grew and only heaven knew just what it'd be 
And who'd hang on that tree it held the Son of God like it should
But I know it broke the heart of the wood

I'd go everywhere that old man went",Heart of the Wood,2008

A song lives forever and never ever dies
Sings enemies together and touches so many lives
Words and melody will always be, long after we're gone
Oh, how I wish I could live the life of a song

I could mend the broke and wounded, I could prove that love is real
And take someone from China to a Carolina cotton field
I could comfort every soldier, hum all the homeless home
I could change the world if I was just a song

Sings enemies together and touches so many lives
Words and melody will always be, long after we're gone

He slicked his hair back, he had a pocket full of pay
When she opened up the front door, he was grinnin' like a possum
As he handed her a daisy, she heard him say

And by midnight we just might wind up dancin' standin' still

Say we better kick it up a bit

Some say to go more country, 
Some say we should turn pop

Joey + Rory,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",The Gift,2011

Both black and fraid and warm
I was brought up to respect them
Since the day that I was born
One came here for minglin’
It’s been handed down for years
The other one was ordered from
A catalogue at Sears
When my mama read to me
Well, I was well into my teens
And I thought all the other one was for
Was to hold up daddy’s jeans
Till I told a lie and learned
It had another purpose too
And behind the shed, my daddy said
Does it hurt me more than you?

‘Cause one had my daddy’s name on it
The other said King James
With love they taught us lessons
But we feared them both the same
One led us to heaven
And the other hurt like hell
But those were the days when kids were raised
With a Bible and a belt

I remember when I was twelve
I stole a dime store comic book
And how mama read what the scripture said
To take back what I took
When I refused my daddy took
My arm and said “come on”
I needed more, he knew than just Matthew
Mark, Luke and John
Sometimes it made me cry
Sometimes it made me frightened mad
I wish I’ve been raised without them
Like some other children had
But now I’m grown with kids of my own
And I know just how they felt
And though it seems to me that what the world still needs
Is a Bible and a belt

My first time was in her bed Lord we couldn't wait
We drug cans behind her on our wedding day

Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul

Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin' passion
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter
Right after I start laughin, they start askin “what happened?""

Catch you in the wrong spot, you dust
Statik ill, bring the havoc, this is magic
Fake niggas flee out, fly out the mouth, I get you gatted
Sports cars, re endorsed yards
Everybody four stars, ray like forty jewelry gaudy
Your creature game corny, I eat your dame, you hop up on me
Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred texts
Flash flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buzz ain't only in it only for the tokens
Cause they say if who you joking with, chokin' potent with
Tag team the joker chicks, the ones who do some bogus should
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is

It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon
My sonogram was an image of a gun in the womb

I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you
And what I'm sure you wouldn't want is any kind of trouble
Unless you got a crash dummy or a body double
You got a couple homies down to catch a homi- for you
Well I'mma fold niggas into origami for you

Whole story is glorious, stoic warriors
And I got my eyes wide open on you quasi-

Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta,
I might slice my wrist or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks!
And I swear it hurt me soul I try to prevail
But when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper,
Fuck it painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein',
You would be in trouble to body double or couple me
To these others 'cause comparatively speakin',
My reach is beyond the bubble that they put me in,
My vision's beyond the Hubble's I huddle with Nubians,
New beginning again you in school at 10, late,
Radioactive's goin' gold and so? Great!
Do I give a flying duck if I'm applyin' 
Love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a flying duck
Nothing but a buckshot, chck-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf!

Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this, ""Ho, I'm the meanest""
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, on shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich pot shit
Hoes on some God shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

Swiftly, I shift the Beamer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth (uh)
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse (uh)
Red roses drop on boxes very often (uh)
Confetti torture, drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton (uh)

The cloud of smoke like the phantom (uh)

Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham (Big KRIT, shawty)

Spit like my last breath, casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes and cherish your wins
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, ‘86er, nigga, that’s my born year
Get the fuck from ‘round here, that’s just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma’s titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin’ hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won’t have to drop another album
B.b. King saw the king in me, so why can’t you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past fuck your Louis flag,
Popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?

X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)

Joey Bada$$,"Ayo I don't really cry, ask why
Cause inside no one ever really dies
Your presence is still alive
Your voice I still hear it
I still feel your spirit in a room feel heavenly with the scent of ya
We wasn't on the issues but couldn't help but notice your views
So many aspects of truth
Infact you let the past get to you
So thoughts on a better future, it couldn't suit you alone
We was stoned, by the snakes of this life of sin
But you taught me a life lesson, the fight within
Use the power of our minds, I was confused at some hour in time
My eyes were dark brown but blind
But, now I see even the sun shines through blinds
And now I move enlighten in sightings that I find
Enticin' in my prime, like, look at me now
You used to tell me read books, niggas bookin' me now
But how, could I have done it without you though
You was the big bro I never ever had you know?
Why you had to go? It hurt me inside
I feel guilty walking around outside with false pride
If only we could vibe like, one more time
Hear one more line or share one more rhyme
Even show me one more sign of destiny itself would be fine
But there's no turning back the, hands of time
Or delayin' the plans of your mastermind
So I hope you came across of what you had to find
And watch over the ones you once loved
You was my nigga when push came to shove

One love

The sky's the limit
That's what they told the fuckin' fool
I disguised the limit
Now I'm aiming for the sun and moon

Joey Bada$$,"Yo, Badass don't act or pretend, back at it again
Hit it from the back, she a addict within
I got her on some shit like ""I'm a get tatted for him""
She a ride or die, slim, when she in the denims
Remember it like it was yesterday
Another case of ""I fucked your bitch, nigga"" but a more clever way
Quarter in the room to elevate, said if you ever may
Slip then hit her on the hip where the Beretta stay
Catch me somersaulting my eyelids
Awakened from a dream, just perceived how I live
So it's make believe, rather unique
Lavish, sweet all live in a rapper physique
Hit up a show then after retreat back to the telly with freaks
Pack up a bowl and we ain't even eat
But we got a appetite for cookie creases and treats
And they all got tricks up they sleeve

I'm ashing on the bridge, Mary Jane, fuck your cigarette
I'm laughing out loud, ask me if I'm still stressed, possessed
Hope the boys in blue don't arrest yours truly
Respect but suspect, protect your neck jewelry
47s and Uzis, well-connected and recruiting
I be with my Mexicans, I know they got the toolie
I'm smoking doobies with like 20 of my goons
Hotbox the whip and let smoke fill the room
Even through my lenses, my sense is on the moon
Dirty be the name and I came from the black lagoon
I'm sick with the ink like infected tattoos
Just one love but the two-three's branded on my shoes
You would think I had a eighth the way I'm crushing them grapes
Had her whining for a taste, that's why she's up in my face
Them Apex taking over like we running with Apes
What's the verdict? Nothing but a fucking disgrace, nigga

This ain't Quidditch but you know the snitch get caught
Then get bitched like the bitch she brought, throw your fit then walk
When they clip all of your Christmas thoughts
There's no giving when they take what you got
Placed in the crop circle, doc with a smocksie
Art what we drop, shopping cart with Da Vinci, whimpering
Leave that risk to your Pros
Wrist full of stone, lapidate if they pass me the smoke
I'm strapped and irate, daps from the fake
Get me mad and I contemplate irrational mode
Don't think about nada, strung you by your collar
The flow father who balanced out his chromosomes proper
I'm going home partner like Posada, they talk beef
But toss the ensalada, peep the blue Impala
There's arrogant cops who stay intruding
Can't stop the 47 like protagonist in Absolution
Them wack rappers who track-eluding
Critic is a random student who use the era as a new rap influence
Faster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid
I still kill and you can't lose it",47Goonz,2013
Joey Bada$$,"And we smoking, toking potent herb
Preaching spoken words that might just poke your nerves
Hope you ain't scared, my jeep go ""Scrrrr""
I peep the obscured, and what ain't normally easy to observe
I swear I'm born abnormally absurd
If I give you a piece of mind, you've been disorderly disturbed
That's my word, flip similes and verbs, now I'm eating
Retreating for seconds and thirds, y'all niggas seasoned (Oh, you salty)
Don't worry what we ate, you don't want that plate
I combine yours with mine quake, and make the earth shake
Supernatural disaster on you half-ass rappers
Pass the herb to an actual pastor, word to the black lip bastard

Every time I drop a line, it touch like five placentas
Schooling your offspring, drop heat all spring
And stay hot for five Novembers, I think y'all niggas lost me

And I just kill it every time

Instead of lead slugs, I spreads the love
Like a bed bugaboo does, I'm in the W with your lovable slut
I'm in the walls while you bugging her up
I'll do your girl like this beat, straight fucking it up
Y'all niggas nothing to us, this feels like nuttin' to us
Son, taught your daughter how to bust a nut for fun
Recollect and collect the funds
When she see the sun spit the proceeds when I cum
'99, 'til infinity beyond
Hold my peace full of energy 'til my enemies be gone
Until then niggas in my vicinity gone
Peep the melody we on, but they don't know the remedy to these songs
Basic necessities on how to be put on
Cause they see my team, we strong, Beastcoast in your region
If you get dropped you can't rejoin, they wanna know
Whose shoulder we leaning on but all we do is show them who we leading on

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
And I just kill it every time

95 'til infinity time
We in disguise behind enemy lines
Women with no identity signs, they can't get my lines
I used to give a fuck you could find

Cause they will never stop for a young black male
Black mailed in braille that means what he felt
And the very reveal could appeal
Put you on the Alcatraz trail or railroad to hell
Oh well, some of us is taught there is help
The other source is lost in all sorts of wealth
Uh, roots of all evil
The highest stars Evel Knievel
I see through people's door, the world may never know
How my third pupil show, Incognito and cold needles flow
And I don't throw subs, I throw torpedos
The Don, not Cheadle, this don got a Cornelius fro
Afro punk festivities
This for my negus that's lying with queens like Nefertiti
Waking up to pyramids and big kitties
Gold soul theory, but what is life really

Got the bomb nigga, Baghdad, I'm blown away from a bad pass
Walk on grass, blow skunk, I smell sole funk in the stash

Call me young Evel cause I crazy stunt

Swank the lord and hallelujah
Still praying to the allahs, gods and judahs

Cause you only live once 
Once, once

White girl wasted, my wife girl hate it
‘Cause when I’m faded I just wanna
See her naked
Adjust adjacent, like baby let me see your matrix
Kama Sutra, back to basics
Since I was on the go, back to the block
105 on, started bumpin’ Hard Knock
I looked at my nigga Fly, as my heart dropped
Sedan in front swervin’ as the car stopped
In that split second, my foot steppin’ breakin’
I thought to myself, I always knew that I would make it
All it took was patience, and now I’m on the stations
Luckily I made it right before my life was taken
It was too good to be mistaken for happiness and riches
People callin’ my phone, like they happy that we did it
Little did they know I was ‘bout to meet my maker
Till an angel came down and told me that my time was later

Pass off to my man, be a baton

So swift we moving through clouds intruding
Celestial Nubians, known them since
I was a Brand Nubian and they influenced him

Sittin’ and spinnin’ and spittin’ in ya city
Swimmin’ in ya bitty, put kin in her kitty and breasts
Got protection in the vest, but still penetrate correct
The vets, I got the remedy for these bitches
Inject, enter sex and eject get some intellect
And jet cuz all we do is flex on the weekends
They upset cause I learned how to flex on the weakest
End of my strength they drenched in they trenches
The fence in my terrace is gold, leave ya defenseless in the cold
And I know all you nigga’s weaknesses

Thoughts at the speed of light years, I could see the light
Yeah, this the right year made the flow yeah
Clear and easy to steer in space and time erasing fine
Amazing in the maze of cliches
Each day weighs out enlightenment
Niggas blacked out cause I got ultra violent
Now my wave lengths to the radio waves
Still keep it under pavements but not a ratio change
My patio the same, but I ain't even got to tell them that
Poppy leave them dimes at my welcome mat
Get high as heavens, Hope hell never come back
I'm like 5'11, but have angelic contact
The devil jealous in fact, Cause I rebel the spells
With a letter to god, I swear you know me so well
This one time, I said lord would you help?
Some short time after see my music on the shelf
And of course, I gotta thank myself
My wealth is in my happiness and mine
And not my pocket health in its ashes

If its passion and relationships synchronize

Demons of lust, keep hinting they stunts when I'm drunk
What if I jumped off this cloud full of thinking aloud
Into a, pool of my sorrow and start sinking in doubt
Rethinking it out, cause tomorrow ain't ever promising
And ever blink it counts for a prophet who see deposits
But he ain't always see the positives
He used to live in poverty, thinking probably
One day, he strike the lottery
Cause dreaming big never been odd to me
And since a kid ive been on a musical odyssey
I knew the day would come where I wouldn't be sorry in a pile of g's
Or probably be rehearsing a verse on the beach

Shook for days, don't ever judge a book by a page
That could be a cover up if you ain't looking that way

Time will tell cause even fall lasts for a season
So keep on believing, you live and learn die and you teach

Love is really a war
And sometimes I feel threatened cos she really know all

Sometimes we fight, won't speak and shit

It's like a never-ending cycle
Something like your menstrual
The day you put your menopause

No, one man's clever, one knows no better
I like to go get her to keep her warm in cold weather
She blow below better then she goes for endeavors
Write our names on the clouds in bold letters
If hoes ever touch me she load Berettas
But trust me, she's lusty it must be me
Rubbin it off on her skin
I can't budge her, a pen?
I swear that her love is just a sin
We back at it again
Fussin and fightin' I start cussin she cryin'
Break up to make up
I start cuttin' then slide it in
Then we mix the vibe with some Hen
You got five, I got ten
Now we some trippy niggas as high as a fin

We some ordinary people but extraordinary poets
Get lost in the moment when I po' it
Fuck it if we drownin' in pain 'cause we don't really show it

Word to mother, I'm goosed up
My two fucks in two cups

Kill it like airborne diseases

Like please eat your vegetables
So I took a dose of the edible
Ain't an overdose
Already a rap monster fucking overload

With hooked on phonics the pot could get em hooked on chronic

Racing like Sonic inhaling the tonic

Themes behind it rob you for ya mind like thieves is behind it
So we had to squeeze in knowledge
To pile it when the green sees wallet
Anything to let the green seize wallet

I blew it on the purple fume and I know I read your mind, right
You're bright, you want green of all types like limelight
Balance is the kiwi fused in the tunes
Third eye sight, she rodent the car with three blind mice
They chase cheese and don't think twice
And for that, some niggas in the cut get sliced, she looking back

Down as shack she throw it back for that, willingly
She hope I catch children

Joey Bada$$,"We done came up
Everybody love ‘em
On the regular

Lookin’ at popular colored faces
Observing what my brothers faces in all races
Lost in generations before hatred
See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs
But keep it sacred G, fuck a rat race, we take the cheese
Jack cheddar from the make believe
Break the trees on they eighth CD
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully
I’m a Brooklyn nigga, basically I grind with the grimiest
Learn how to eat in the jungle full of hyenas
And vultures, don’t worry what a verse will cost ya
From the young scorcher, just remember who taught ya
I’m gonna spark it off unorthodox
Won’t sign to no major if no wager
Less than a 3 million offer off the top
I’ll be in a box with my coughin’ drops
Why settle for a office spot?
Niggas don’t always make it off the block
Unless they extort rocks or support the cops
They still snitchin’ let me guess, that’s your mannequin?
Leave ‘em shook while you’re standing and quit the shenanigans
Have you panicking, induce damages ‘til you’re vanishing
Words are told properly, resort top sea examinin'
This is for my real hip hop fans and ‘em
I dispose for 'em, leave fake MC’s in the post mortem

Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won’t sin
No he won’t give in
Yo this world is bone chillin’
Make meals in hell’s kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya

It ain’t easy being this royal
When you got this much going for you
It ain’t hard to be disloyal
Comin’ straight from the soil with lines that never coil
Start to think pretty off new career with this spoil
The kid is that sick so expect more coffins
I’m the chosen one so you can expect more offerings
I be sonning niggas so expect less orphans
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often
Word to God I’m the best offering
BMX like Hoffman, BMF like Ross man
Young boss, man, got Jimmy Fallon endorsements
From porches, to Porsches, getting portions of fortune
They said next up so I stepped up
Fly like I dressed up
Bitches try to hang like left nuts
Like orangutans in the west of
Of the motherland, but I’ve got the swank of no other man
Brother man
They can’t understand
Pro Era boys pop rubber band

Cause money ain’t a thing if I got it I won’t spend
All I got is my Pros, I don’t need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won’t sin
No he won’t give in

Properly delivered drop trees in my swisher
And bring that back to my property wit ya

Better tell that doofus deuces before he catch a whipping
Hit him in his Charles Dickens and strip him for his Scottie Pippens
Cause it's all about the big pimping
Rob him for his Nixon, and then question him about his timing
Right here, it gets reckless, best advice is
To tuck your necklace, and put your arms right back into your Lexus
Cause G-Stone Crips, they ain't nothing
To flex with, and billy gang Pyru, they really on some next shit
So if I were you I would probably ride with two
No fool, not two dudes, two tools
As in deuce-deuce cause niggas jack you for your soul
And your new shoes and your jewels too
There's something about another nigga having shit
That have a nigga spazzing clips all up in your back and dip

If looks could kill I let the swank drill like a deadly weapon
I drop bombs on an enemy at any second
Look at me wrong I turn you to tomb stones
Lock you in the crosshairs then you gone, then I throw my deuce up
Sip sangritas with your señorita, like me gusta
See what that early morning cock will do up to your rooster
I bet my cockiness will boost her confidence

They want another black man in penitentiary

Used the underground railroad like a runaway slave
Broke off the chains still runway fresh

A thousand ghetto youts with a thousand guns
Cooler tequila with frozen lungs

Although I regret where my time was played
If I could go back, some things would be changed
And I would know that, for a fact, it was fame
That drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brain
That withdrew me from familiar and the closest remains

And I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rent

Cause I'm bout to take that flight

An ode to the worst of my days
I've been working away
But the sky's been looking so gray
Sometimes I really need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
I just need to get away, yeah
Sometimes I really need to fly away

Indigo father, [?] father
And travel across the water, and conquor a million dollars
I am the spirit, I am the guap
You sippin' out of your coconut beverage on the Bahamas
Pardon me mother, pardon me father
I'm glad that you spared a part of us, part of my firestarter
Along with niggas, bitches and ballers
And people that look down on me like they so taller
I go harder, I go smarter, the flow's water
Like I always [?] how to rob a dollar and a single piece of change
Movin' to the woods so I never ever change
Lose a couple things but I never ever change
I probably miss somebody but I never ever change
And they can say whatever but I never ever change
I feel I understood what the stars wanna say
I'm brain battered from [?] every Saturday
Pitter patter with people that really matter
And I'ma fuck her regardless cause I'm a kid right?
That's why you can't spell summer without trouble
Stripper with no bubble, threesome with no double
Love without hate, life without pain
This without that, choice without thought
A dog without day, Seattle without rain

If it rains in Seattle
I'll [?] then you can ride with your nigga
Fly with your nigga, get high with your nigga
Ride with me, survive with me
Say, If it rains in Seattle
I'll take you round the world on Sunday
With me, some day, one day, one day",Escape 120,2015

Ready to bust my gun, I'm rushin' in like Vladimir Putin

The 47 Goonz recruitin', join or die
We comin' for groups of guys in suits and ties
Who choose to hide truth from the eye
Grab a white collar by his white evil eye
Fight or flight, yo, that's just what it is
When you see a pig, hit him in his baby back ribs
But don't trip, I'm just another black kid, caught up in the mix
Tryna make a dollar outta 47 cents
Yo, this shit is intense, a dumb cop stoppin' me, probably
Cause he's still livin' in the past tense, how shit was back then
They wanna see the downfall of all black men
And African, I was sent to put action in
But what's new when the po keep flashin' in?
News flash niggas, get a news flash

What's my name? What's my name? Badmon
What's my motherfuckin'

These niggas ain't ready for the war
Know what I'm 'bout, cut the cheddar, close your drawer
Please put your bread up
We ain't gon' settle for no iceberg lettuce
Let us eat when there's war
Or end up like venison meat in the street
They're not ready for beef
Let the fish burn in the pot, niggas all in the spot
When it turns 12 'o clock then, we'll be curvin' the block
Yo cut this shit
Man, I'm the best in the sector
Get your ear buds to grip, then I dissect ya
Inject ya with my lethal weapon
Plant a mine in the deepest section, guess who's least expected
Mothafucka please respect it
The last one to pull my card was easily dealt with
They felt it, the shift, records can't be reckoned with
On tracks wreckin' shit, ask me why I'm reckless
Break a wrist, approach my demo with a risk
Brought my demo listens, I'm a demolition specialist
I got the blueprint to this shit, Jay to the Oh Vee
If Blue was a prince, I'm still Joseph Kony
Niggas know they can't ever little bro me
No matter how big they blow, they still a little below

Joey Bada$$,"My mind just booked a first class ticket to my destiny by the way
Yeah

Maybe I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day

So gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen and that's when I drew my first blood
Spit my heart again, cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circle of friends
All that’s left now is the radiance
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain't scared of no man
I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done
I show all my soul purpose but I’m pretty sure there's one
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
And read here lies a G followed by a poem
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrong
With both shoulders that my head is always on
I trudge through harm's way with heavy boulders on my arm
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that
Rain on my parade, seen the dust cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gate
Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2 Pacs, and the big L rolled proper
And that's a big pun, know that I'mma join him
When my time come, but the story just begun, so

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (fly away, fly away)

My clouds grey, I hope my pain don’t show
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd
The trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’m just sayin’
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking, they too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty
Long as rolling and Whitney's seen different cities, different titties
I bring no money with me, I'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man
'Til we fly man, 'til we fly man, 'til we fly man
You gon' miss us when we fly man

Don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zone
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on

On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on, on and on

Really started from the bottom, boy, cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men, pride is higher than the prices on your pradas
Balenciagas, balance my soccer with the henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas wanna copy, thanks for listening
This kid ain't been the same since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch your tradition and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rocking on this bass with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
He duckin' down, got some issues now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who put the clown on lock, jaws like the blue knows
Froze, keep your mouth closed or you can see the soap, dog
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows, this wisdom
The Pros been on a mission
Listen into the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' max, I raise stakes to keep the brolic

The mastered sonics is lightyears above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learnt from my penis
I got dreams filling arenas and breaking brackets
Tend this racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due

Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here
Just trying to get a deal out here

Let me tell you what shit is like right now y'all

What life like now, tryna figure out
They put this mic on trial cause he be killin' now
Forever bitin' my forbidden style
Laying low for a minute in the game
Since I came all these niggas lookin' timid
My life can never dimeth, the Lord is my sheppard
Jesus woke a devil in him, the sinnin' with least effort
Thinking back to those [?] days
And I ain't been the same since I left 6th grade
My mind's strayin', you think I had the biggest heart
Taking walks with abuela in the park just to tell her
I'ma grow propellers one day and be a good fella
Play the hero or whoever, the hood gon' tell us
Let's just pray it ain't the villain
Tell 'em I be feeling some way
Thinkin' I can get the Maybach off gun play
Instead I let the words play with 90 beats a minute
Bet the streets lose a heart beat before the verse finish
But life goes on, basic rules still apply
And you can feel that lot in any hood that you live by
From Flatbush, the [?]side, I was a school boy too
Hoppin' trains, I just missed my que

And what's life like for me, it's but a dream

The surface is but a screen, we only see

And what's life like now, I can't figure out
They put my mans on trial, say he a killer now
Conspiracies, we gon' get you out
Just keep ya head up G, shit is wild
It's bugged out cause I know you tryna see your child
But I'ma hold you down still cause you my brother
I just gave Will a lil' somethin' for your baby mother
But don't stress, know you caught up in the b.s
But next time you see us, we gonna be our best
Love you my nigga, word is bond, you'll stay strong
Out in New York this same shit is goin' on
Peace to all my brothers who keep still holdin' on
Been away so long, feel like a tickin' time bomb
They make judgement to my kind, who the odds is against
Put our backs on the fence, so we self defence
Followed by a series of unfortunate events
Looking like white America got a brother again

I see vividly, hysteria
Cause misery on the interior
Shit gets more scarier, I'm never in fear
Just a little inferior in some areas
But I share, wisdom with Sumerian's
Somewhere we in the place
Peace means harmony, not war and armory
But fuck that, cock your gun back
This survival of the fittest
Some cats get boxed in where they litter
These niggas don't beez in the trap, they like beez in the track
Get smoked out and I ain't talkin' bout what you toke out
You toked out for really thinkin' that this shit is a silly dream
When actually reality ain't what it really seem
And I ain't actin' on the scene, nigga's scream
The actions ain't screened, just well-schemed
I'm tryna' have wealth for my well-being
By eighteen, pockets healthy green
What the fuck is twelve beams?
I need the cake and cream
The stakes is high like fiends off a dream

Carry a vest, you know the reason
I'm in Chi-raq and i'm getting blown like the breezes

Thighs, legs and the breast part is the cleavage
She even lick it down to the bone marrow
She in love but I ain't got a bow and arrow
I'm known to jack the booty like i'm Sparrow

They ain't tryna' see me in the battle
The lines is too narrow
We couldn't even outshine my shadow

They just living out the saddle, so sad though

Overdose on high fructose, rolling toast till i'm over-throat
And over-slowed, I been speakin' over tones
Low but keep them L's high, legends live long
And we gon' be forever, this for the Era
They tried to tell us we too deep in the flow
The mo' the better, the mo' clever, et cetara, whatever
Why do they sweat us? [?] they just met us but they won't forget us
They don't know better then the worst case
I be headed for first place
Purchase they position cause' they worship oppositions
But I to had no pot to piss in, [?]
And they still ain't got my decision, I won't stand under no man

Lust demons get hornier and hornier
As the kills gets gorier and gorier
From corridors to corner stores
Catch him on the block
With the orphans in the streets
Violin's playing as another black coffin
Speaks at the thought
Of another ignorant phone call
Who is this calling me at 5:47 in the morning
Crack of dawn and why she mourning
Bittersweet, hit it both ways, now I'm scorching
First things first, man
You fucking with your hearse
So rehearse who you coming at
Aye aye squintin' at Captain Kirk
Star trekking, playing my role
But still follow scenes tread
Enemies, friend up ahead of me
Show no empathy
Get smashed like a centipede
Sent to energy
Don't bug me with your sympathy
You ran a whole train on a bitch
She still suck a mad dick
When the clock tick
As I elect no cause of politic
Could you picture the damage that we inflict?
I'm staring at my own, own fucking depth
Backwoods smoking out my motherfucking chest
5 minutes to death
I'm still in bed, get high at rest
As I arrest the sex pin
My love reminisce
Learn to architect, computerize love
It's that project that'll
Shock her back to cardiac arrest

I got some problems that I can't get away from
If all else fails, know I got my day ones
I got five on it
Keep a nigga face numb
Fuck five on it

My trigger finger get hornier and hornier
Finger fuck the grip til it spit on a cop
A warning shot for the warden
Holla, say the word if you want it
I'ma bring the ward in
Peep holes straight through ya doorman
My sound reach foreign
Y'all still be local, I'm in this foreign
My vocals still ain't focal
Rap game in a chokehold
I smoke those who don't know
Who could get lunged in the air by the dope flow
Matter fact, I flow dope, bars by the boatload
You said you ready for war, boy I just hope so
Let me vindicate for all my indigos and negates what I indicate
Been the great, the Flatbush renegade niggas been afraid
Squeeze the life out you rap niggas like lemonade

All this money I make, no thanks to federal bastards
Tell me why they take a piece of my assets?
Does Bill Gates have these same fees? I need the answers
Cause I think somebody taking advantage behind the camera
Watching, hoping I end up like Hammer in the slammer
Tiny flaws in my grammar, using anything to slander me
Looking at the Canada, can't wait to put and end to me
Bury my entities, hating only wastes your energy
Fuck negativity, I got love for all my enemies

My closet like a mini-mall and I'm expecting many more
The new millenials and the Inidgo's survive
So it's about time 'fore it changes into tide
Let's put the drum aside and read between the lines
I'm in America screaming ""Who will survive""
If only you could see through my eyes and perception
What it means to have is complexion
What it means to have these connections, to the most high
How it feels to have your two brothers in the skies
Sometimes I wanna cry, sometimes I wonder why
Sometimes I question God, can you blame me?
The sun ain't been shining here lately
And I swear it ain't the same cause

Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you
Everyday I think about you
Before I got to sleep, I pray I dream about you

My creator had a master plan
Back when I was just an average man
Life is a snowball and avalanche
I heard a inner voice say i still had a chance
So i found my self trapped in no mans land
I felt a little tight, smoked the whole damn gram
I took that to the face, now I'm on my way
So insightful, been [?] on my mind all day
Step up the plate when it's a fork in the road
Each spoonful of knowledge is a fortunate load
That's food for thought, a little salt in the cone
On the pineal, life is bitter sweet, that's so perennial
We gotta move on from the ignorance, if I'm resilient
Moving coherent, changing appearance from the villain
Penicillin whenever this pen is spilling
They can't see what's really written, but they can feel my brilliance
They don't feel me though, they don't feel me
I swear they gon' kno

At the table ripping bread with my day ones
Ain't shit change dawg I got the same number

Took those off, hit the stage wearing sandals
Four X white t-shirt, that's standard
And1 shorts, '96 on the camera

So I hit her with that New York dick
Number 3, John Starks on the jersey

The hair on my face says I'm a dominant man with no regards
Catch ya boy on Queens Boulevard
Sunk in the seat of something classic
Sittin' on the floor like a gypsy in a basket
Damn I'm a bastard

It's a beautiful life

The lemon grass in the bally shack
Hit up Chuck, what up I'm on my Cali swag
Cadillac dreams, transactions in between
The man and his cream, every thought brought the penny back
Ballin' off that, yo thanks for the alley act
Probably paint the cut, all black like an alley cat
Middle fingers up
You fuck boys, fucked up
Ya dismissed, had one shot but time's up
Make the block boys go crazy
Take a whiff
Ain't worried about another life
We tryin' to change shift
My reality, life from my ankle ain't actually
All you perceive these eyes can deceive
Holdin' back but I'm never holdin' out

Know they strapped like the back of the couch
We the era, black out on any rat in the house

Don't worry about beef

Joey Bada$$,"Yeah, ride
Roll something to this one right here, man you know what I'm
Nah, man, I can't roll nothing up to this one right here
We want to keep it all clean you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, ride with my, ride, ride
Just ride with me, ride with me

Yo, and I'll be here for you when there's no one else
I see things been getting hard, you need somebody's help
I'm really worried about the kid's of tomorrow's date
That's why I'm always conscious in everything I say
My little brother getting big, yo, he just turned eight
Know he be looking up to me, I see it in his face
When he listen to my music it takes him away
My only wish is that it brings him to a better place
You see, the universe is listening every time we speak
What you seek, it seek in you, so practice what you preach
And if I got some type, a voice should be used to teach
My young world, your wildest dreams are within your reach
And I'mma tell you, just like I told me
Believe in yourself, you can do anything
No matter what they say you can't do or won't be
Don't ever listen, keep limited homies, plus limits don't know me
See, knowledge your pops and wisdom's your og
Experience is born and understanding of thee
Of whom you've come to be, this child of destiny
Nothing's coincidental, everything meant to be, now

Oh, the poem you need to listen in
(you just fly with the most)
And you can find my love
Love blowing in the wind

I always knew that one day I would be a star
Since I was a kid I always had this feeling in my heart
Sometimes I wonder if I'm really this special or
Is there something that you ain't been telling me lord
You see I learned something vital with my whole career
From just watching, observing things over the years
A secret that I don't think that I'm supposed to share
But I don't care cause if they kill me, I was never here
You see, the truths been hidden under your nose for a long time
The only real power is the one over your mind
So once you seek control of every little thing you do
Start to unlock the potential that's inside of you
Don't you get got or cell blocked
Thinking the world's dark and hell's hot
My only hell is being enslaved 'til I'm in the box
And to my brother's treating life like it's another bitch
I encourage you to find yourself another chick
And treat her with respect, cause the moment you neglect
Start to fade and pick away pieces of your flesh
So be smart cause it's never too late for change
Never met a man who gained without feeling despair

Oh, the poem you need to listen in
And you can find my love
Love blowing in the wind

Yo, a country boy dream can beat the odds
Watching [?] on the falling stars
I pray that you make it out of the booby traps
And feeble daps that people give you on the low
Let's face off in the grass, just be careful when it grow
It's more about the messaging, less about the flow
The sky ain't the limit, although that's what we're told amongst other things
Like you can't be successful with out a flooded, embezzled, diamond chain
Well damn, what about feeding families? giving your all to manage
Don't sacrifice your canvas to paint a picture of some bullshit
Be weary of the path that talk of private jets in the pool pit
Got to be real, through your heart, to your core
Don't give up on god, when there's so much more in store
Now I don't mean to be preaching, some might say I'm reaching
But lord knows, somebody gotta teach it
I'm hoping that you listen

Oh, the poem you need to listen in
And you can find my love
Love blowing in the wind

Yo acapella, cause statik won't give me no beats
But I spit bars no matter what in the heat
It's eighty degrees out in the street
We in greenpoint or bushwick
I push shit, that's it
I ain't even got the headphones on
No headphones
Hold the headphones in my hand to make 'em handphones

Ain’t no time for tryna lay low, bay bro, if you can’t do it all you gotta do is say no
I’ll take it from there, Asians on gram ready to work it, displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge, behind the van, in the cab, I made the drop off
Thanks Einstein that nothing popped off, since I was young,
handled lots of foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that bad thing, I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in, of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music, thinking how I’m gonna do this

It had me low for a while now I’m picking it up
Holding the spot straight sticking it ripping it up
I dropped 99 problems, switching not giving a fuck
So what you what you want? got your bitch nigga gripping the butt
I ran my dick, taking pics nigga flicking it up
My clique is a circle, fuck you want?
You’ll end up dumped jumped party in a truck in New York
There’s no ducking me, the Bada$$ time, there’s no fuckery
Won’t find a chick who got a diamond, or take a single buck from me
These hoes be loving me, I keep it so G
Respecting where I be nigga check your OG
My back flow will mirror your fat flows
Well here it go my, visage is lineal when I’m ripping the video

What the government is doing to most our people is 
Downright evil but not surprising, that's for certain
Under the conflict of propaganda, I believe simply trying to slander
Start a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those elite
They are simply pushing us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it
They want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails
Alton Sterlings are happening every day in this country and around the world
The scary part, boys and girls, is most of these stories 
Don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness
It is for sure time that we as a people stand up for 
Acknowledgement and accomplishment of what we call human rights
It is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell
I just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it
Because this is all part of the government's plan they been plottin'
They're literally begging for this to happen
So they can kill us off using uprising and rebellion as an excuse in a timely fashion
The cancerous foods, the chemical warfare
Economic suffering is not working fast enough
There are many steps ahead of us and manifesting the future that they want
We have to work together, not only rattling them 
On a physical plane but to outsmart them 
On an intellectual mental level the same
As black men, I think our gangs need to do a better 
Job at protecting us, the people, our communities
And not assisting in destroying them brutally
It's time to even the score
'Cause who do we call when the police break the law
We are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another
But not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other
The code words to killin' a black man by police is ""He's got a gun""
Damned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs
Or what about them, them murderers got it
We need solutions, you better start plotting now
It's always been clear that they don't value our lives
My people been suffering way too long, and I'm tired of singing the same old song
People acting like this shit isn't happening, it's downright wrong
Justice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that
What are we to do? We're scattered around
With no clue of this ugly truth
All we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed
Time to wake the fuck up and do our own research
And not form opinions based on just what we've heard

Now, what's freedom to you?
Let’s talk about it, take a minute, think it through
I'm all about it, but the concept seems loose
The cops will still shoot us down on Channel 5 news
Lock us up for anything we do to pay dues
Some of us woke while some stay snooze
Zombies walking around trippin' over its shoes
The knowledge is official but it’s often misused
America my masseuse, massaging my back
Tryna' act like, she ain't gonna do me like Pratt
Geronimo, take a leap and lay flat
I'm down to go for my message to spread across the map
Holy, cross on my back got a bullseye on it
I gotta get stoned to fulfill my moment
Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it
In search of the healing components that you would notice
If you took notice, but you too nosey
Time to wake up
Won't you come and smell the hot coffee
Stick your nose in the wrong places, no wonder you OD
I swear the whole world on me
I'm nothing close to the old me
If you never knew me then it's too late to be homies
Homie say fuck what you told me
I’m riding all by my lonely

Will for sure inspire actions in your first child

Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle
They built for us
The first step into change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I just need some more closure
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over
Let’s face facts 'cause we know what’s the real motives

In the land of the free, it's full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be the organ donors

Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
All our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
We all fit the description of what the documents written
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
The Lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission
A human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
It's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another black man a victim

This is legendary
Always been my mission, never secondary
Getting better every January, it's very scary
They gon' recognize eventually
I take it if they don't give it to me
Swear all of it was written for me (yep, yep)
By a higher card just spiritually (up, up)
Up in the wages, up on a plane, get out my way right now
I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth
I threw a coin in the well, 'cause I was feeling so well
A token of how I felt, never heard it fulfilled
Not a noise, not a sound, still no reason to doubt
Quality what I sell, quantity in the cells
Quantum physics myself, count a million atoms of cells
This life I'm living it out, you're right, my vision is now
Don't let the prisoner cell build a strut to break out
My brothers at the brick house, the undercover stakeout
Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out
What you think? I do it for my brothers under a spell
It's clear we living in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waiting for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now
I see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house
An elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb
And introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon

A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

Ready for whatever comes
I hope for the best, I taste the piece and pray it never leave my tongue
But yet, before long, the feelings done
Perhaps I was foolish just like the boy that prays to only see the sun
Maybe, life happens like tides
One minute you're low and feeling shallow then all of a sudden you rise
Just, ride the wave, I say to myself
Find a way, the weight of my wealth
It's honestly a lot to bear
I play the game of stacking knowing that I ought to share
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons
I look at all I got like ""What's missing?""
God is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress
I find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed
Real blessed, life has always got me wondering
(Wondering, wondering) Am I doing it right?
Am I hurting myself?
Am I wronging the ones that love me the most?
What a burden to have
That ain't no way to live
Or maybe it is
Well, maybe it is

Joey Cavaseno,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004

Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive

No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

Misguided heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you want to use that line you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't want to end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside she felt a connection
She fell in love.

What is the feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open my door (open my door)

What happened to Miss Independent?
No more the need to be defensive
Goodbye (goodbye), old you (oh you)

When Miss Independence walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of why can't that be me
I'm so glad I finally feel...

Joey Cool,"I won't look back anymore, after this
Pitch black, star bright, yeah that's my life
A bit of fire and ice
Watch friends, plot foes, stock ends and pot holes
'Cause when the tank hit the bank, it just got closed
Don't be stank in the paint cause the yak froze

Wish I knew back when I was strugglin'
If I plugged in and kept bustin'
I'd be buzzin', that'd make me super rich
Never knew my sufferin' over but
Cousin, I keep it up and gushin'
And tell all of my family, aunts and uncles, cousins to do the shit
Just gain power through all of the rain showers
No different, remain sour cause someone else's lame hours
Wish I woulda known to tell 'em all to start they own business
Make long digits instead of havin' a boss who talk at the wrong pitches
To fake friends, cause it's never enough
At hostile situations with folks, I learned it's better to bust
First, and you still a nigga no matter how much ya stuff's worth
You love who love you, do hug who does true
Connect the true blood to cuzz blue
So keep hopin' the Lord does show up
'Cause it'll never be no peace on earth for all of us
'Till this mug blow up

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Ponderin' these thoughts while sittin' idle in this mezzanine
Feel my feelin's boilin' up, I'm simmerin' on everything
Goin' for the gold because it's shimmerin', but everything
That you encounter seems to be devoured, need a better team
Every thought and every dream, every plot and every scheme
Lurkin' around the corner is a hater waiting like a fiend
And choice of drug is negative, and they use it like a sedative
Success becomes the cause of this effect, abuse the medicine
You thinkin' you can let 'em in, partake in buildin' excellence
The serpents come in twos and they meticulous with they meddlin'
The feathers flock together, see the relationships we settle in
Got consequences so it's best to let 'em go, we blessed again
Disloyalty unfoiled, trynna justify they pestilence
I don't understand why they so demanding manic pessimists
I guess if I had to guess, I'd make an estimate, I guess that they
Was just afraid so watch us levitate 'till I'm at heaven's gate

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Mmm, life sentence for fallin' out ya physical body
Illuminate my soul, officially became godly
I be the one, all of these demons runnin' from
Dumped a gun, lifted spirits, niggas deem me the chosen one
Phony family in my crowd, rappin' gap and loud
Facin' twelve in the pen, none of them niggas made a sound
None of them niggas round
Now the fame close and the name boasts
I'm 'posed to break bread bitch, taste toast
I should smoke them ungrateful bitches
They doin' the most to see what make you choke
It actually leave ya throat missin'
I'm on a mission to revisit kin and
My prime been hidden, trynna dine with women
Dipped and find this linen, try and find a business
I love who love Gee, fuck you if it's fuck me
That's just how it gotta be, cause I'm paper routin'
Tame nuisance, insane view and check on my lawn
Strange recruit me, guess when the god speakin' Strange Music

Joey Cool,"I got a story to tell
'Bout when I ginormously fell
Won't say no names though
'Cause it ain't no game bro
And it ain't no angle making no woof tickets for me to sell
It's about to, buddies in the middle of a bout too
A lady on the daily putting out two
One of the buddies she told him never let his mouth spew
Don't let your bro know what's happening
'Cause we were together, plus shacking in
That's what you call gettin' back at friends
Shoulda told him I was tapping in

I was 21
She was 40-something, say she wanna give me some
So I started putting Tecca Nina in the lungs
Of the photographer that my homie, then he brung
But it was a catch, he didn't want a nigga to rack
'Cause her and my homie were together, he'd give her the scratch
After every photo-shoot but he'd have a bitter attack
If he knew his colleague would shoot me then deliver the snatch
So I kept her secret like a dummy keeping it professional
I didn't tell my homie but I was full of regret you know?
Riding out with my homie, out my mouth ain't no decibels
But when she finished flicking me, we bang out on the sectional
I used to throw him hints saying ""I really wanna smash her""
Then he would look at me like I was doing it with laughter saying
""She would never do it, I don't know what you after
Out of your league, man you young, broke and plus you a rapper""
Damn

Bros become foes yeah (bros become foes)
Lord knows the lovin' was fly though
It ain't worth livin' these lies though
On my dog (On my dog, on my dog)
Yeah
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
(That I was tappin' in)
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
('Cause he was a best friend)
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends

She would pick me up for photo sessions
But I didn't tell my homie we were low-low sexin'
Man this lady had a body like she was SoloFlex'n
So right after work, she let me give her a pogo lesson
No confession never told him, I was grindin'
On his workin' roommate, I was slimin'
But I messed up and told my other homie
But when me and him fell out he told my best friend that I was lyin' all this time
And then my homie said
Why is you playin' me, I'm hearing too many rumors
Yo you got something to say to me, man?
You know about my affection for that woman that stay with me
You supposed to be my homie, why you fuckin' and fakin'?
And then I gotta hear from someone else
You selfish man all you think about is your fuckin' self
You and her be together, I don't need no one's help
I'm feel like I'm finna lose it, I don't know what I'ma do
But I swear to
Hold on my nigga, you can't be callin' me trippin
I'm with my family and I don't know what the hell you talkin' 'bout that's fuckin' insanity man
Why you lyin' to me bro, you know these people be talkin'
And their stories sound the same and you makin' it awkward
And I ain't finna be the type to act like this don't really hurts
What am I supposed to do 'bout it when I'm at work?
You and her, we supposed to be brothers that make it worse
And he told me everything y'all be doin' don't do me dirt
Don't deny it homie, really you oversteppin' your turf
Told me y'all was snappin' photos and you removin' her skirt
Even said you shoulda known this fuckin' chick was a flirt
Well how you gonna believe every damn thing he say?
Dog you for real? You shoulda told me without delay
We was like fam, now you got me dealin' with hearsay
And everything that he say, she say
Oh, I gotta go

Bros become foes yeah (bros become foes)
Lord knows the lovin' was fly though
It ain't worth livin' these lies though
On my dog (On my dog, on my dog)
Yeah
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
(That I was tappin' in)
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
('Cause he was a best friend)
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends

So that is how me and my best friend fell out
'Cause I told another homie something he had to yell out
All of our business ventures and dreams was the hell out
And I'm left with underhanded things that I can tell 'bout
Lost my best friend, 'cause I was young and dumb
He lost his life to another brother with a gun
I never got to tell him that I was sorry, I was sprung
My other homie just died of cancer, I'm numb
So the moral of the story is
Don't lie to get something that you really want
Always keep it real, though a lot of people don't
That's why they always in funk

Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Chorus: 
Open up your heart lend a helping hand, have a little faith in your fellow man, cause every single soul has a purpose here, try and free your mind it will all come clear that every little thing that you say and do, can help to make a change if you want it to, can?t ever have a tree if you don?t plant a seed, all things are possible just believe 
Got to know who you are, if you don?t stand for something you?ll fall for anything we make are choices, you know what I mean, cause a t any time any were temptation breaths, it waits for times when the soul is weak, Just when I start to lose my faith in this world, something stirs inside of me, I look in the eyes, of an incent child, and it keeps my spirit alive 
It?s got to start here with me , I?m making a change , a change to be, stronger than I?ve, been before got to let hate out this door, got to give faith, another try, got to be thankful for this life, everyday?s a blessing can?t ignore, I got to believe with all my heart.

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday

To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Some day I'll find my love

And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,

Joey DeFrancesco,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1994

And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,1995

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

With gifts they will come

Love is a spark lost in the dark,

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

I hope that he turns out to be

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good

'Cause we were so strong, had lasted so long 
How could I have been so wrong? 
You said you can hold on 
That your love for me was not that strong 
So thus I ask you was it love at all? 
Now I have to know 
Will you ever come back?

'Cause babe, my heart is calling for you to hold me 
And my soul is screaming out your name 
And my mind just can't stop thinking about you
Baby, why did you cause me so much pain? 
Baby, why did you cause me so-o-o-o much pain?
Come on baby, tell me why... 

Now everyday I try to pick myself up (pick me up) 
But all this trying is really worth nothing 
'Cause you keep haunting my mind 
Keep making me cry 
I can't get over you 
But babe, I gotta say, I must say
It was such a cruel way 
How you broke it to me 
Just to get up and leave 
After all we've been through 

Now you say you can hold on 
That your love for me was not that strong
Thus I ask you was it love at all? 
Now I have to know

And still the magic sparks the flame 
That burns without our souls

Both black and fraid and warm
I was brought up to respect them
Since the day that I was born
One came here for minglin’
It’s been handed down for years
The other one was ordered from
A catalogue at Sears
When my mama read to me
Well, I was well into my teens
And I thought all the other one was for
Was to hold up daddy’s jeans
Till I told a lie and learned
It had another purpose too
And behind the shed, my daddy said
Does it hurt me more than you?

‘Cause one had my daddy’s name on it
The other said King James
With love they taught us lessons
But we feared them both the same
One led us to heaven
And the other hurt like hell
But those were the days when kids were raised
With a Bible and a belt

I remember when I was twelve
I stole a dime store comic book
And how mama read what the scripture said
To take back what I took
When I refused my daddy took
My arm and said “come on”
I needed more, he knew than just Matthew
Mark, Luke and John
Sometimes it made me cry
Sometimes it made me frightened mad
I wish I’ve been raised without them
Like some other children had
But now I’m grown with kids of my own
And I know just how they felt
And though it seems to me that what the world still needs
Is a Bible and a belt

‘Cause one had my daddy’s name on it

With love they taught us lessons
But we feared them both the same

Honey, I can't be hurt by what I see
They were teaching you how to love me
They were teaching you how to love me
The way you do
And that's teaching me how to love you",Teaching Me How to Love You,2012
Joey Martin,"No, I don’t mind if you
Sit down if you want to
I’ll only be here few
I’m waitin’ for someone

Yes, I’m drinkin’ wine
One more would be just fine
To pass the time
While I’m waitin’ for someone

I guess he’s runnin’ late
Oh, I hate these blind dates
Waitin’ for someone

What’s that? No, not me
I’m still single and free
Someday I wanna be
I’m just waitin’ for someone

Yea, I like this song too
Why sure, I’ll dance with you
Just one or two
While I’m waitin’ for someone

Oh my, it’s getting late
I’ve been here since 8
Guess he’s not gonna show
Sometimes that’s how it goes
Waitin’ for someone

It’s really not that far
But you can walk me to my car
Now here we are
Waitin’ for someone

Yea, I’ve had a nice time too
Sure, I’d love to hear from you
You know? I think I’m through
Waitin’ for someone

‘Cause to tell you the truth
I was just waitin’ for someone like you",Waiting for Someone,2012
Joey Martin,"A bright sunrise will contradict the heavy fog that weighs you down
In spite of all the funeral songs
The birds will make their joyful sounds

You'll wonder why the earth still moves
You'll wonder how you'll carry on
But you'll be okay on that first day when I'm gone

Dusk will come with fireflies and whippoorwill and cricket's call
And every star will take its place
In silvery gown and purple shawl

You'll lie down in our big bed
Dread the dark and dread the dawn
But you'll be alright on that first night when I'm gone

You will reach for me in vain
You'll be whispering my name
As if sorrow were your friend
And this world so alien

But life will call with daffodils
And morning glorious blue skies
You'll think of me some memory
And softly smile to your surprise

And even though you love me still
You will know where you belong
Just give it time, we'll both be fine
When I'm gone",When I'm Gone,2012
Joey Martin,"Had my golf clubs on my shoulder when you saw me first today
And my old army sweater that you thought you threw away
And when you saw me standin’ there you shook your head and sighed
When you saw I bought a six pack I thought you were gonna cry

Your man loves you, honey
I don’t know what else to say
Your man loves you, honey
But you can’t change my ways

Now before you say you’re angry you remember what I did
Went to church with you last Sunday, took your mama and the kids
Sit right up and heard the preachin’, even wore my Christmas tie
I’m not much on organ music, five stringed banjo’s more my style

Your man loves you, honey
I don’t know what else to say
Your man loves you, honey
But you can’t change my ways

Oh you should’ve had a knight in armor and a castle fate
Not some restless cowboy faded jeans and shaggy head
I can’t make it big without and you know that it’s true
Keep me around for last and I’ve been good for one or two

Your man loves you, honey
I don’t know what else to say
Your man loves you, honey
But you can’t change my ways",Your Man Love You Honey,2012

No tender voice like Thine can peace afford

Joey Mazzarino,"I know a tropical island
Where the mango moon and banana sun shine
Kermit the Frog:
And on this tropical island
There lives a cousin of mine
He's a Caribbean amphibian
He likes to hop in the tropical sea
Caribbean amphibian
A frog in a coconut tree
He's a Caribbean amphibian
He likes to hop in the tropical sea
Caribbean amphibian
A frog in a coconut tree
Kermit the Frog:
The flying fish and the turtles
They've seen him hop where the pineapple grows
He likes to see all the islands
So island-hopping he goes
Sometimes he hops to Jamaica
Sometimes to Haiti he hops
Sometimes the warm Puerto Rican beach 
Is where he finally stops
He's a Caribbean amphibian
He likes to hop in the tropical sea
Caribbean amphibian
A frog in a coconut tree
A frog in a coconut tree
Sometimes he lives in the water
Sometimes he lives on the land
Sometimes he likes to play music in
An all-amphibian band

Don't you ever wish 
You were someone else 
You were meant to be 
The way you are exactly 
Don't you ever say 
You don't like the way you are 
When you learn to love yourself 
You're better off by far 
And I hope you always stay the same 
'Cause there's nothing 'bout you I would change 

I think that you could be 
Whatever you wanted to be 
If you could realize 
All the dreams you have inside 
Don't be afraid 
If you got something to say 
Just open up your heart 
And let it show you the way

Believe in yourself 
Reach down inside 
The love you find will set you free 
Believe in yourself 
You will come alive 
Have faith in what you do 
You'll make it through
