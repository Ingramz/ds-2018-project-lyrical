Alison Krauss,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.",Why Me,1999
Alison Krauss,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mister Webster could never define
what's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all",When You Say Nothing at All,1999
Alison Krauss,"Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of his name never read her his word
Two non believers walking lost in this world
Took their baby with them what a sad little girl
Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs
She'd watched the TV and sit there on the couch
While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting
Just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding
Oh what a sad little life

And like it always does the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her mom and then took his life
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad
Kisses and hugs every day!

Her first day at Sunday school
The teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of him
She said I know that man
There on that cross I don't know his name
But I know he got off
'Cause he was there in my old house
Held me close to his side
As I hid there behind our couch the night my parents died",The Little Girl,2000

Alison Krauss,"Some bright morning when this life is over
I'll fly away
To that home on God's celestial shore
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, Hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away

When the shadows of this life have gone
I'll fly away
Like a bird from these prison walls I'll fly
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, Hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away

Oh, how glad and happy when we meet
I'll fly away
No more cold iron shackles on my feet
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, Hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, Hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away

Just a few more weary days and then
I'll fly away
To a land where joys will never end
I'll fly away

I'll fly away, oh glory
I'll fly away in the morning
When I die, Hallelujah by and by
I'll fly away

I'll fly away",I'll Fly Away,2000
Alison Krauss,"Tell you a little story and it won't take long
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
The reason why I never could tell
For that young man was always well

He planted his corn in the month of June
And by July it was up to his eyes
Come September, came a big frost
And all the young man's corn was lost

His story, kith, had just begun
Said, ""young man, have you hoed some corn?""
""Well, I tried and I tried, and I tried in vain
But I don't believe I raised no grain""

He went down town to his neighbor's door
Where he had often been before
Sayin', ""pretty little miss, will you marry me?""
Little miss what do you say?""

""Why do you come for me to wed?
You, can't even make your own corn grain
Single I am and will remain
A lazy man, I won't maintain""

He turned his back and walked away
Sayin', ""little miss, you'll rue the day
You'll rue the day that you were born
For givin' me the devil, 'cause I wouldn't hoe corn""",The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn,2001
Alison Krauss,"From the bright sunny south to the war, I was sent,
E'er the days of my boyhood, I scarcely had spent.
From it's cool shady forests and deep flowing streams,
Ever fond in my mem'ry and sweet in my dreams.

Oh, my dear little sister, I still see her tears.
When I had to leave home in our tender years.
And my sweet gentle mother, so dear to my heart,
It grieved me sincerely when we had to part.

Said my kind-hearted father as he took my hand:
""As you go in defence of our dear native land,
""Son, be brave but show mercy whenever you can.
""Our hearts will be with you, 'til you 'turn again.""

In my bag there's a bible to show me the way,
Through my twelfth year on earth and to Heaven some day.
I will shoulder my musket and brandish my sword,
In defence of this land and the word of the Lord.



",Bright Sunny South,2001
Alison Krauss,"I lit my love and watched it burn
Asking nothing in return
Except the lessons I will learn
From holding crazy faith

I've been touched by that bright fire
Down to the root of my desire
While the smoke, it rises higher
Glowing crazy faith

You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know but my faith says so
It tells me

Am I a fool for hanging long?
Would I be a fool for being long gone?
When is daylight gonna dawn
On my crazy faith?

The questions will not let me sleep
The dance is buried way too deep
But the bottom lover, lover's keep
Made by crazy faith

You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know but my faith says so
It tells me

Love, you're losing those you love
Let the hope fly from the glove
Do not search the skies above
Search your crazy faith

Love is lightning, love is ice
It only strikes the lucky twice
Once or you will know the price
And once for crazy faith

You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can

Alison Krauss,"Daylight falls 
And I'm lost in the big parade 
Hold my hand, darling 
I'm afraid of the daylight 
 
Shade is dark 
Cool and languid for life or long 
Safe in shadow, 
It's never as dark as the daylight 
As the daylight 
 
When I was just knee high 
My momma told me never try to be  
Someone that I am not 
Yet over time I had forgot 
A wandering child, so lost at play 
He's found himself, 
But he can't find his way 
In the daylight, oh the daylight 
Oh daylight, oh daylight 
 
Life is short 
And there's no turning back the time 
Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb 
In that daylight  
 
In my mind 
There's a corner I need to turn 
Lessons left is a lesson learned 
In the daylight 
In the daylight 
 
I miss the forest shade 
That took me there 
The promise I made 
Can never leave the dark so dear 
Safe and soothing yet I fear 
As I recall and I reflect 
I see it's safer to connect 
To the daylight 
Oh the daylight 
Oh daylight, oh daylight 
 
Daylight falls 
And I'm lost in the big parade 
Hold my hand darling, I'm afraid  
Of the daylight, of the day ...",Daylight,2001
Alison Krauss,"When you came to me
You said love could not erase
The ever present memory of another face

I tried to make you love me
How I could I be so blind
To think I'd be the one to change your mind

[Chorus]
And if I'm gone before you start
Well you can find me in your heart
Who can say if its right wrong
I've waited for you too long
And if I can't hold on
I'm Gone

When you came to me
I said love will find a way
For every heart that leaves another heart must stay

I guess you couldn't see
As the shadow's in the night
It seems the time for us just wasn't right

Alison Krauss,"Who do you think you're talkin' to
You know me and I know you
Your silence and your stony face
You don't have the ground to waste
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you

What can we say when all is said
A house divided cannot stand
Your head and heart and chary gaze
Life is just too short to waste
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you

I've paid for you and you don't seem to mind
I'm bending over backwards, you're not satisfied
What more can I offer to leave 'pon the alter
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you

What can we do when all is done
Your life's not the only one
Just take a look beyond yourself
The reason of your private hell
Your love is gone 'cause it all comes down to you

I've paid for you and you don't seem to mind
I'm bending over backwards, you're not satisfied
What more can I offer to leave 'pon the alter

Alison Krauss,"Momma loved us, every one
Every daughter, every son
She gave herself so happily

From dawn to dark she'd find a chore
And work it 'til it was no more
And every day until she died
In the evening, momma cried

There was mourning in the evening
And momma cried
'Cause her little girl was gone

But all of us had debts to pay

There was mourning in the evening

Let it soak me down
Before I called you . . . I called 
You didn't see me there
Hidden by the rain
Beneath your window . . . but I saw you

Putting on your face before the
Mirror on the wall
Dreaming that the looking glass was me
Catching your fondest gazes
Living through your fickle phases
I love you

And it's getting easier each day
To weep about you
Harder every night to sleep without you
How many years must I be driven
By this dream
Of love with you?

Spend my dimes on phones
Trying just to talk but
You don't answer . . . you let it ring

Spend my nights alone
Catching falling stars to
Give to you, love
They're just for you

For stars fall every time a

And far too many stars have fell on me
And as they trail the skies
And burn their paths upon my eyes

Don't choose me because I am kind.

I would be, for you, an opening door.

Alison Krauss,"Everyone in this room has been associated with Whitey
Either through basketball or the mall or various odd
Jobs he does around town for free or at most a dollar
And I'm guessing 99% of you have either laughed in Whitey's
Face or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or voice or sister
Or shortness when he wasn't looking
But the next time you'd see him he'd still go out of his way to 
Smile and wave at you and ask you about your mother's
Operation or something like that because he, unlike us,
Actually cares about someone other than himself

The reason I bring this up to you is because I was the worst
Offender of all
My life was simply going nowhere
Then a tiny little man rushed to my side
He should've gotten a big thank you
Instead he got a Porta-Potti ride

I was such a shithead
But he never quit on me
'Til I told him he was useless
And his sister was freaky
Once when we were watching Sunday football
A fuzzy screen was all that we could see
Whitey came over with a hanger
And spent the game atop our T.V.

And when the lightning struck him
He let out a wicked, loud yell
But we just turned up the volume
And ignored the burning smell
We should all rot in hell

As a joke I told him to meet me at the prom
When he got there, I said:",Bum Biddy,2002

A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he hold inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of  you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
Opened the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things

Alison Krauss,"Is it still love when we no longer touch?, 
Passing white sheets in the night, 
Love goes unspoken, we don't say a word, 
We simply turn out the lights.
Lost in the silence but still I can hear, 
The sound of my own breaking heart, 
I can't pretend that my world isn't falling apart.

And I don't wanna go through love like this, 
'Cause I won't ever know what I might have missed.
I wanna burn with desire, 
I want to feel the fire when we kiss, 
But I don't wanna go through love like this.

I still remember the taste of your skin, 
The sound of you saying my name, 
The way that it felt as we laid in the sand, 
And passion came crashing like waves.
The wind of your laughter, the longing, 
The love lead us to lacking inside
There must be some way for lovers to turn the trash.

'Cause I don't wanna go

Like strangers living like two people 
Who'd never known what is like to be loved.

Must I accept his fate
Or take myself far from this place

When he wants every thing

We´ll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride

Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught in a mechanism
And swindlers who works like kings
And broke those who break everything
The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
Why would I want him just to lose him again

The cannon's thunder can't prevail
And those who hunt thee down will fail
And you will be my ain true love
And you will be my ain true love

Asleep inside the cannon's mouth

Until the night

He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger

Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, 'I'll love her till I die.'
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time

There's a festival of friends
And we'll take up where we left off
When we all meet again.

I can't explain it. 
I couldn't if I tried

Like the laughter that we started
And it hasn't died down yet

And don't we make it shine

Like a light through colored glass
Some give it all in one great flame
Throwing kisses as they pass

Crossing over Jordan
To the other shore
I'll be standing, waiting
With all who've gone before

I've been to the mountain, left my tracks in the snow

And peace is a gift that must come from within

Teach you faith and hold you by the heart
Though your mother's heart is broken by your leaving

With Heaven's love at stake and hell to pay

Alison Krauss,"In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town
The father went out hunting, the boys had stayed behind
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side

The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light

Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry, and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and eerie dream
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God

Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?
The day is almost over, soon it will be night
We're so cold and hungry, and our feet are tired and sore
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door

A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east
With a guide to take him there Jacob came upon the scene
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door

Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door",Jacob's Dream [#],2007

So, lay down beside me

And kiss all the hurtin'
Of this world away

Beware of night rambling
By the setting of the sun

She was going to her uncle's
When a shower came on
She went under a green bush
The shower to shun

Her white apron wrapped around her
He took her for a swan
But a hush and sigh
Was his own Molly Ban

He quickly ran to her
And found she was dead
And there on her bosom
Where he soaked, tears he shed

He ran home to his father
With his gun in his hand
Saying, 'father, dear father
I have shot Molly Ban""

Way back in the hills
There used to live a mountaineer

Was sawing on the strings

So, get out the fiddle
And rosin up the bow

We'll make music till the rafters ring
All that pickin' and a sawin' on the string

When the neighbors had a shindig
And they all had vittles to eat
We'd always have to wait on Will
To make the frolic complete
When he comes down from the mountain
All the gals began to sway
Sometimes he'd pick that ol' five-string
Until the break of day

So tune up the five-string
Tighten up the hide

Must I accept his fate

Of swindlers who act like kings
And brokers who break everything

Alison Krauss,"Gonna lay my burden down
Lay my body in the ground
Cold clay against my skin
But I don't care at all

Can't seem to find my piece of mind
So with the earth I'll lay entwined
Six feet underground
My feet are warm and dry

When I get to the other side
I'll put your picture way up high
But I'm not coming back to you
It's just too far

If I was cast off on the sea
Would you come and look for me
Or would you just let me sink
Beneath the waves so blue

What if I had learned to fly
Fly all night till day drew nigh
Touch down upon a branch and
Scan the crowd for you

When I touch my feet on the land
I'll kiss your lips and take you in
But you know I'm not here to stay
It's just too far

Darling can't you hear me cry
My bones are broke
My tongue is tied
The moon is swaying back and forth
Against the navy sky
Is all I can see
My body is trembling on my knees
Just have a little mercy on me
Run away and hide

When I sleep the angels sing
But I cannot hear a thing
Eyes close
Dreaming of the better days gone by

When I wake the trumpets play
And I'm standing at the gates
Fall down and joy
I know my race has just been won

When I was young my momma would say
Well life is hard, but that's O.K.

Alison Krauss,"I grew up in the scantling yards of Wheeling, West Virginia
A wheelhouse cub looking for an open door
In the packet ways a Sweeney wed the keel of my Bonita
Just two months from her timbers 'til she moored
I paid the fare in billet on her maiden voyage to Vicksburg
And talked my way to hand the tiller on the course
In her planks I carved a notch and sealed the vow 'Be my Bonita'
And her dowry was my life between the shores

I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray
The calliope serenades, made the old towns come running
And the boys would gamble shards to pull her chains
The striker's boast would fain me loss, about the wrecks the shoals were keeping
And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved

On the lake at Bistineau, she set the wharf at Dixie
With a thousand bales of cotton on her main
As the great raft disappeared, the watermark went sinking
And she was stuck right hard, a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze, I stood my last upon her
Then climbed the prow and took a landsman's trade
'A derelict now Milady' said the watch log I've concorded
'Have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change'

Cause I was born with rouging ways, and she steered me like a woman
From the port calls and the bawds that lead me stray

At three scores aloft this crooked frame

And how the old girl's got poor Billy's ransom saved",Bonita and Bill Butler,2011

Staring so far away
He can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching my restless days

He turns from the window to me
Sad smile his apology
Sad eyes reaching for the door

Daylight loses to another evening
And still he spares me the word goodbye
He sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
He struggles to speak but in the end I only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The words that would help me speak my troubled mind
He's offering these to me as if to be kind:
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a world, you know
And there is a way to go
And we'll soon be gone, it's just as well

A woman's silk lying on the floor
And he would keep me here if I were able
And lock us safe behind this open door

Planted on their columns now that bind me

Because they thought we fit, together walking

It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find

That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and you were gone

I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind

But not to where I cannot see
You walking on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

You dip your cup of soup, back from a gurgling
Crackling caldron, in some train yard
Your beard a roughening coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across your face

Through cupped hands 'round the tin can

Keeping me on the narrow way

Jesus savior, help me each day
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior, help me to stand

Jesus lived through darkest pain
Rejected by men, despising the shame
Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief
He gave His life so we may be free

Jesus savior, help me each day
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior, help me to stand

I know that Jesus died for me
Canceled my debt at Calvary
Rose from the dead, unlocked Heaven's door
Trust in His love and live evermore

Jesus savior, help me each day
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand
Jesus savior, help me to stand

Alison Krauss & Union Station,"I'm writing my last love letter
And for reasons now, I don't know where to start
Seems so many times I've written down ""I love you""
Well I hope this time I can get that through your heart

Only fools will go on and keep talkin' to a wall
But I can't fool around forever
And if stone is the wall that you've built around your heart
Then I guess it's goodbye in this letter

And maybe I was wrong to ever think that you could love me
I was hoping you just couldn't find the time
Have my efforts been in vain with pen and paper?
Did you ever care, did I ever cross your mind?

Only fools will go on and keep talkin' to a wall
But I can't fool around forever
And if stone is the wall that you've built around your heart
Then I guess it's goodbye in this letter

Alison Krauss & Union Station,"Sad songs and teardrops will surely mend this broken heart
Time forgets these bitter things I feel
But your days are numbered
You'll learn your lesson well
When you finally play a heart that plays for real

There's a new fool somewhere waiting
For your old fashion heartbreak love affair
She'll see through your intentions
With each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new some way

Leaving was so easy
But old hands do make fancy moves
And I for one fell victim to your game
But someday, you'll see that cold hearts can be broken too
What goes round must come around your way

There's a new fool somewhere waiting
For your old fashion heartbreak love affair
She'll see through your intentions
With each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new some way

I'll think my life is over
But the Lord he comes to me
He heals my wounded spirit
And he sets me on my feet

Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive

Keep your head and hold your shield high

Ever fond in my mem'ry and sweet in my dreams.

Oh, my dear little sister, I still see her tears.
When I had to leave home in our tender years.
And my sweet gentle mother, so dear to my heart,
It grieved me sincerely when we had to part.

Said my kind-hearted father as he took my hand:
""As you go in defence of our dear native land,
""Son, be brave but show mercy whenever you can.
""Our hearts will be with you, 'til you 'turn again.""

In my bag there's a bible to show me the way,
Through my twelfth year on earth and to Heaven some day.
I will shoulder my musket and brandish my sword,
In defence of this land and the word of the Lord.

And talked my way to hand the tiller on the course

With a thousand bales of cotton on her main
As the great raft disappeared, the watermark went sinking
And she was stuck right hard, a listing on the bank
With the furnace still a blaze, I stood my last upon her
Then climbed the prow and took a landsman's trade
'A derelict now Milady' said the watch log I've concorded
'Have the bosun sound us eight bells for the change'

Alison Krauss & Union Station,"More wishes than a thousand hearts can count for you
More smiles than a merry-go-round
The sweetest ending to a bedtime story told
My love follows you where you go

More laughter than a kindergarten out to play
One Sunday morning song that says it all
More summer than the California beach can hold
My love follows you where you go

Future like a promise
Your city of gold
Stubborn in your bones and
Jesus in your soul
Seeing you stand there
Starin' at the unknown
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me
Watchin' you walk away slow

Take forgiveness, take a prayer, take the deepest breath
And take the answers in your heart
When you wake up and the world is cruel and cold

Stubborn in your bones and

Seeing you stand there
Starin' at the unknown
I won't pretend that it's not killin' me
Watchin' you walk away slow

More freedom than a field of flowers in the day
More beauty than a mornin' after rain
Up the steepest hill, a dark and crooked road

Alison Krauss & Union Station,"My love stands before the open window
Staring so far away
He can almost feel the southern wind blow
Almost touching my restless days

He turns from the window to me
Sad smile his apology
Sad eyes reaching for the door

Daylight loses to another evening
And still he spares me the word goodbye
He sits alone beside me fighting his feelings
He struggles to speak but in the end I only cry

Suddenly it's so hard to find
The words that would help me speak my troubled mind
He's offering these to me as if to be kind:
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a world, you know
And there is a way to go
And we'll soon be gone, it's just as well
This is my opening farewell

A child's drawing is on the table
A woman's silk lying on the floor
And he would keep me here if I were able
And lock us safe behind this open door

But suddenly it's so clear to me
I've asked him to see what he may never see
Now his kind words find their way back to me
There is a train everyday leaving either way
There is a world, you know
And there is a way to go
And we'll soon be gone, it's just as well
This is my opening farewell",My Opening Farewell,2011
Alison Krauss & Union Station,"You close the door in front of me, I wait patiently outside
And as the minutes tick away I feel my anger rise
And who's the object of my rage, and who's not being fair?
Is it you for your indifference or me for just standing there?

'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand, when they say that pride's a sin
Should I go or should I stay on the outside looking in

Well I didn't make the grade today and I'm not the only one
But my heart, it won't stop hurting and feeling all alone
Maybe we'll trade places in some not so distant year
I'll hear your voice calling out, and I'll cover up my ears

'Cause in my mind the room beyond is bathed in golden light
I dream about you through the day and I toss and turn at night
Sometimes it's hard to understand, when they say that pride's a sin

Well I could brag on the things I've done or the places I have been

Wanting a change
I never meant to hurt anyone
Never meant for you to pull out your guns

Dividing up the pieces that we were

Trying my best not to forget
What happened to us, what happened to me
What happened as I let it slip

I was confused by the powers that be
Forgetting names and faces
Passers by were looking at me
As if they could erase it

Baby, did you forget to take your meds?
Baby, did you forget to take your meds?
Baby, did you forget to take your meds?
Baby, did you forget to take your meds?

I was alone staring over the ledge
Trying my best not to forget
All manner of joy, all manner of glee
And our one heroic pledge

How it mattered to us, how it mattered to me
And the consequences
I was confused by the birds and the bees
Forgetting if I meant it

Baby, did you forget to take your meds?
Baby, did you forget to take your meds?
Baby, did you forget to take your meds?
Baby, did you forget to take your meds?

And the sex, and the drugs, and the complications
And the sex, and the drugs, and the complications

And I think to myself what a wonderful world.

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you.

It is not dying, it is not dying

Lay down all thought, surrender to the void,
Is it shining? Is it shining?

That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

Love is all and love is everyone
Is it knowing? Is it knowing?

That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

But listen to the colour of your dreams
Is it not living, is it not living

Or play the game ""Existence"" to the end

When the light stole in it found me wide awake.
Wasted from a sleepless night, I reach to touch your hair.

Save the ticking of a clock
Whose hands are sweeping past its face.

And I just don't want to be lonely,
Night and day.

But as I look around me, I just feel that way for you only.
I turn my hand to something that would clear my head,
But I could not forget the parting words we shared.
I opened up my mind to all the pictures I could trace.

But I could not recall the contours of your face,
And, oh,

""If I did something wrong, please tell me;
I'll accept the blame.""

Alison Moyet,"Into your car park, drive obsolete motors
With petrol consumption at too high a price.
Sell us through windows at backroom board meetings;
Blindfolded and handcuffed and in single file.

On your money mile,
We are the faceless, the nameless, the homeless.
On your money mile,
There in your fortress where you couldn't care less.
On your money mile,
We are the caseless, the raceless, the hopeless.
On your money mile,
You were caught in the crossfire hauling the flag right down.

Send us to battle; send us to the frontline.
Point us at the enemy.
Lest we forget;
It's for our protection that we lay here slaughtered.
It's for our survival we bury our dead.

To reassess the situation and decide what's mine.

With no consideration for the way I feel inside.

And you just look at me like you don't understand.
How could we... how could we let it get so out of hand?

Don't steal me blind.

You, my friends, would bleed me dry,
And with no hesitation you would pass me by.
And you keep telling me that you don't understand.

There's no one left to come and find you.
You're soaking wet, but the file won't dry you.
I'd like to help, but I can't stand by...

They've got you wasting your life.
Can't stop you twisting the knife.

Caress me with your anger;
Sting me with your kiss.
You've been pushing too hard.
I've been trying too long.
Now I don't believe I have the will to carry on.

Then it's two steps back.

Don't evade me now.

This glorious love will tear us down
When nothing is left to turn around,
And giving it all is not enough
For this glorious love.

(if there's a full moon in Taiwan 
I want half of what you're on)
I want to open up your mind
Leave it all behind you and me 
We're one of a kind
We may find that we're getting 
High on something peaceful
We're gonna take it for a ride
Goin' nowhere fast but we got 
Nothin' to tie ourselves on

I""m tired of me

For anything, it's all in
And I'm not afraid I don't fear

I love to watch his hands
White and smooth 
Almost feminine
Almost American
I have to watch him

In his face 
Age descends on youth
Exaggeration on the truth
He caught me looking then 
But soon his eyes forgot
And everything he seems to do
Reflects just another 
Shade of blue
I saw her searching into you 
And ached a while

I watch his lips 
Caress the glass
His fingers stroke 
The stem and pass
To lift a cigarette at last
He dries his eyes
From a shadow by the stair
I watch as he weeps unaware
That I'm in awe of his despair",Ode to Boy,1994

Wave me till I'm gone

And you're still here with me, but maybe

But somewhere it stops and that's letting go

Can we not buy someone famous?
And pull a crowd we can't contain at all, all true

Give me what you got

A heaven of rain clouds crown my day, queen of the wet ghost town brigade
Then you walk by and from my sky, nothing falls without a sparkle.
Feeling it kissing my face, so even I don't know I'm crying
Now you're him, out is in, who has time to live in sorrow
Umbrellas are chapel ceilings in chrome
And I dig the nylon blue lining your avenue
I'm not waiting on the sun like a bus that never comes
I'm at home with my colander sky
I'm just hanging with a friend
I don't need this storm to end
I'm in deep with my colander guy
It's you, you and me babe, and our colander eyes
Then you walk in, and for my sins
Nothing hurts for feeling groovy
Everything seems appealing
And even I don't know I'm lying
But we soon forget how to get on wet
We pass the towel and get back to drying
And only the time is flying
But then with only our chances slim
Back to nephrology again

I could flirt with all the guys
Smile at them and bat my eyes
Press against them when we dance
Make them think they stand a chance

Then refuse to see it through
That's a thing I'd never do

I could stay home every night
Wait around for Mr.Right
Take cold showers every day
And throw my life away
On a dream that won't come true

I could hurt someone like me
Out of spite or jealousy

It named me as the fool who only aimed to be

Almost blue

Say it like you feel it, you can't say it like you feel it anymore. 
Say it like I mean it, I can't say it like I mean it anymore.
 
Hold it up to the light it looks like love, 
It's what the mirror said, you name it so. 
But you cut your pretty shapes as paper flakes 
From careful sheets that blow away, 
Not made to keep. 

What if alteration makes a little liar? 
Watching paint instead is easier on the eye than watch you hide. 
Say it like you feel it, you don't say it like you feel it anymore. 
Say it like I mean I, I can't say it like I mean it anymore, not anymore.

There are people who you think you're gonna love forever, 
Oh well you should know better, should know better. 
Some people only see you as a move they're making, 
With a better stake in, better stake in. 
There are people who you think you're gonna love forever, 
You're gonna stay together, you should know better. 
Some people don't give you what you give them freely 
But you found it easy, you got it so completely.",Can't Say It Like I Mean It,2007

With your every word tasted

Alison Sudol,"Leaving on time
Gone to look for a place to stand
And watch the world pass by

Living on a smile
There's nothing you need to explain
Where no one knows your name
And that suits me fine

Once I was young, I was stupid
And sure of myself
The truth is the word that
Gets harder and harder to spell

Maybe tomorrow I'll wake up
And all will be well
But time moves slow

Tonight

Sleeping lay my body down
Dream a dream where everything
You lost can still be found

Escaping laying my body down
All the weight of my skin it goes
At the great unknown
It's all uneven now

Once I was hot, I was hungry
I knew I was right
It's easy to do if you're wearing
Your wounds thrown inside out

Stretching out back
But time moves slow

Tonight

I'm leaving for a world
Gone to look for a place to stand
And watch the pass go by

Remember, remember, you told me
You'd be always be mine
We run, we run, we run, we run
We run, we run, we run, we run

Tomorrow wake up 
Make up my mind
But time moves slow

The kind that always leaves
Just as the best part starts.
It ends so abruptly
And leaves you stunned and naked
In your bedroom all alone.
It's kinda funny how something so soothing
Gets interrupted by the ring of a telephone.

And you broke me like the cigarette
That I busted on the day I quit.
But now that I've been drinkin'
I'm out of smokes and I wish that I had it.
Woke up to my daily headache 
And the realization that you are gone.
Oh my sweet darling happiness
You've been away from me all along.

One thing that I never said
I'm truly happy in my heart and in my head.
A lonely liver suspended in liquid.

It comes with the wind that once wiped off our smiles
Alarm clock bells are screaming out the same routine again

He went to see her but her eyes were burning a different stare.

Before that steak knife took my eyes

I looked up to the sky
For the last thing I would ever see
For the last time I'd cry
When was it that you sold your life or wasted

Every bite of that small slice you never tasted
I guess I should be one to talk
There's nights that I can't even walk
There's days I couldn't give a fuck

And in between is where i'm stuck
From blocks away I heard somebody screaming
That small child inside of you that you left bleeding
You stabbed him up not once but twice

Cubicles will now suffice
Some say it's the roll of the dice
I think they're wrong I know I'm right
Every breath that I could barely breathe

Could barely make it past my teeth
I took a blowtorch to both of my lungs a long, long time ago
Every step that I could take
Every one more difficult to make

Well do you find you like to fall in love with people that you're never gonna meet?
It's easier then breaking up and crying in the street
Do you curse the happy couple?
Do you cringe at wedding bells?
Do you drink up all the punch while you wish 'em all to hell

[Chorus: ]

You can't escape this fatal case of melancholia
It's in your face, in every place you go it's stalking you
And there are days when we all say we feel we just can't go on
But you've felt this way all along

À la mairie, on leur a demandé un terrain d'foot
Ils ont refusé, on s'est mis à bicrave et on a ouvert un terrain d'chnouf

All,"I go to that wishing well
Stand looking down
So many thoughts cloud my brain
As I think about their lives
If wishes could come true
I think of all the things I'd do

Each time I leave that wishing well
Because I'm not afraid to dream
I hold my head up high
I'm not afraid to cry
I think of all the things I'd do
If wishes could come true

(only wishes don't come true)
If only there were peace on Earth
If only justice walked in blue
(only wishes don't come true)
If only everybody cared
If only we could never say never:
(only wishes don't come true)
I think of all the things I'd do
If only we could work together
If wishes could come true

Each time I leave that wishing well
I hold my head up high
I've got a thousand wishes
And I'm not afraid to try
If wishes could come true
I think of all the things I'd do
I tossed a penny in the well
A useless gesture, just as well
I watched it fall

A penny for your thoughts -
Do you care at all?

I think of all the things I'd do
If wishes could come true

All,"I live in a box. I live on a one way street, but I don't mind.
'Cause I live alone. Nobody has to share my home.
And if I could choose I might pick a bigger box
My home on the range is underneath my black hat
But that's all I'd change, until I get a credit card
Until I wake up
I will not be watching you so you should not be watching me
I've got what I need. I've got a car that doesn't work.

I've got blood to bleed. I've got a bar of soap. I've got shampoo too

I won the Nobel Prize. I made a thinner dime.
So I look like me but I smell like you.
You know I'll get my act together when I find the time
But right now I think that living is a place to lie down.

You see I rule the dirt, so I'm the king of this town.
I live in the dark. I live in the silence, and I can say
And if I could choose I might pick a darker void
My home on the range is somewhere in the closet,
That I see and hear how much more than the average bear
But that's all I'd change, until I get a bigger club

Until I wake up.
I will not be watching you so you should not be watching me
So here's what we've got. You tell me what I am.

I'll tell you what I am. We'll both scratch our heads
I'll tell you what I am not. You tell me what I'm not.
Like we give a damn. Please tell me who comes out ahead
Was it me or you? Was it me or you? (probably you)
I live in my skull. I'm under my eyelids. You can't touch me.

'Cause I'm fast asleep. You wouldn't like the friends I keep.
But that's all I'd change, until I get a safe way out.
And I could choose I might pick a larger head
And don't you dare wake me up.My home on the range is right behind my eyeballs.

Somehow I lost track of time, but you know I'm a fool for you

I send a bouquet of roses, the kind that you're allergic to
You know that I don't know better, you know I'm a fool for you

Head over heels, banana peels, it's funny how you make me feel
Like of love sick slapstick tragedy - would you like to
Fool around with me?

I'd fall of the highest mountain, drown in the deepest river too
Catch a cold in the hottest desert, you know I'm a fool for you

I would sing outside your window if I could only hold a tune
I suck so hold it against me. You know I'm a fool for you

But I love your laugh and I hope you see that I just might be the

All,"My pappy said ""Son your gonna drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that hot rod Lincoln""

Have you heard the story of the hot rod race
Where the Fords and the Lincolns were setting the pace?
Well that story is true cause I'm here to say
I was driving that model A.

It's got Lincoln motor and its really souped up
And that model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall

It's got a four barrel carb, and dual exhaust
With four, eleven gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
Breaks are good, tires fair

Pulling out of San Pedro late one night
With the moon and the stars just shining bright
We was headed up grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still

All of a sudden, in the wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said ""Boys this ones marked for me""
But by then the tail lights was all you could see

Now the fellas rid me for being behind
So I thought I'd let that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot of the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into over drive

Wound it up to 110
My speedometer said I hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
And that's all there is, and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought that I'd lost my sense
Those telephone poles were like a picket fence
They said ""Slow down, I see spots!""
The lines on the road just looked like dots

Took a corner, side swiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clicking the guard rail post
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

We had smoke coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
But don't you know by then we'd be low on gas

I had flames coming from out of the side
Feel the tension, man what a ride
I said ""Look out boys, I've got a license to fly""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

All of the sudden she started knocking
Down in the dips she started rocking
I looked in the mirror. Red lights were blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln - Damn

The arrested me and they put me in jail
Called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said ""Son, you're going to drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot Rod Lincoln""

Can find no rest,
Waking for his nightmare.
Safe in bed,
But in his head
He knows her soul resides there

That blows the candle out
And chills the room
As summer burns without...
Calling your name.""

His soul tormented,
Sleeping in the embers.
As good as dead,
He's lost his head -
But how ? no-one remembers !

That guides your hand to write
I'll turn you pale
With ink and second-sight...

All About Eve,"Late last night, about a quarter to twelve
In the middle of an awful storm
I took fright at the terrible sight
Of a raven flying into my room
My blood ran cold, my heart stood still
As I pulled the covers over my head
A minute dragged by as I opened my eyes up
To find her at the end of my bed
Then she spoke in a devilish croak
About herself being one of a score
And I felt sick at the very idea
Of dealing with nineteen more
She said, ""look out your window""
I see a skyfull, I pull a rifle on them all
Pink sunrise in the wintry skies
All warm on the wings of a dove
She sinks and lands on the back of my hand
And sings with the voice of love...
""Thoughts made flesh can be beautiful things
As I am one of the same
Fed so well on the best of your dreams
And the beauty found within
But those black beasts that you see in the east
Are scratching on the orchard floor
At split, sweet fruits and the writhing worms
That you keep behind the straining door
Go to the cellar!
I see the beasts and they're eating
Feasting on it
Fill my head with small white flowers
Help the sweetness heal the sour
Draw on high religious power
Free the ravens from the tower",Ravens,1991
All About Eve,"I'm nowhere that I've ever been
I'm no-one, I can't remember me
Make it all go
You're showing me heaven

When your door is always closed
Like the church doors are
When you need a little Jesus
Outside his business hours

You know, where were you
When I needed you to
Hold me, give a little beat of your heart to me
You've got to hold me, it's like the rhythm of life to me

How I long to take some comfort
From your arms
I am denied
I never relied

On the comfort or charity of strangers
Hear all the low, lonely lullabies I love
Dearer than life.
The warmth of a friend that I could depend on

To listen to me.

A paper doll who thought she was a dancer
Fusing with the molten grey

Of a soldier of tin
Who happened once along her way ?",Rhythm of Life,1991
All About Eve,"Madeleine hears the bohemians say
She's selfish and crazy
Which isn't so far from the truth
She's the essence of youth
The flower you place on eternity's grave
The romantic who isn't afraid
Of the beat of her heart
She raises a glass to your art
And when she gets drunk she says...

Oh, give me the autumn, give me the trees
Gather up everything I ever wanted
And give it me, please
Give me the ocean, give me the sea
Gather up everything I ever wanted
And share it with me

How many hearts are knocked down in the street?
How many poets are driven
To drink and to verse
By her singular eyes piercing out through a flight-path of
Rarified air
Where all the shiny black birds of the west
Make a rest in her hair?
She raises a glass to your love
And when she gets drunk she says...

And you ask where she comes from
And she tells you: ""the earth""
Like the place that you come from
Is a whole different world
She says ""life is a banquet
So why hang around
Catching crumbs from a table ?
Come share it with me""",Share It with Me,1991
All About Eve,"Were you looking for a sister
Or looking for your mother ?
I was looking for a love inspired
I didn't need a little brother to hold
When the wind blew cold
A string of hearts lie in your wake
You tried to take along for the ride
I must be out of my head
To get strung out on your silver thread

A strange way of showing your love
You had a strange way

I hear you met a young girl
I hear she is your lover
So when you break her young, sweet heart
She'll find it easy to recover
Not like me, I took you seriously
And for a while I lost my smile,
I lost my way but I found something out
It's going to take something more than you
To break a spirit like mine

A strange way of showing your love
Just for the thrill of it all
But then the future is blind
Just for the thrill of it all

But I'm on my way, I've had enough

He's terribly ambitious and he's occasionally vicious
And if wishes were little fishes
He'd be every fisherman's friend
I found him 
Looking in a mirror, then looking in my shoes,
Looking in my pocket for a razor 
He's my blue sonic boy
I believed in his watery lies
And his half-arsed scheme to rule the world
But you know it isn't easy hanging out with the timelords
When you're a Dalek and can't even climb up the stairs
So when you wake tomorrow, stick a bell in your van
Be a ""99"" man, it will help you in your endeavors
To greatly succeed.

Or a heartache,

Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

Swingin' low true, you fugazi, yo shit's shaky, made you shady
The mega psalms hades, never play thee
Put in work till shit's gravy, move greatly, up in the grey v-12
Puffin the hazy, eyes lazy, thoughts paisley
Me and my shorty from baisley, all city raise due
New ones to follow, chrome nozzle, we spit things that leave you hollow
Sophisticato, strictly for the cargo, gems sparkle, new wave
El demarco, I play my part though, the city hot though ""crew""

Yo, I'm certified raw, you heard of me before
Verbally I'm bringin war to those who want to murder me
Put ya niggas servin' me, king put 'em through surgery
Had you on a respirator in state of emergency
Rob you for your currency, y'all worry me not
Blast a shot and watch you faggot niggas scurry from spot
I play the devils advocate play me sideways I ain't havin' it
You rather get mauled by attack dogs, that's havin' this
You can't fathom this, when in the presence of the fabulous
Rap attackin' this, fly at niggas with the rapidness
Who 'bout to clap at this, we at the top of our rank
Your shit is juvenile compared to my style you shootin' blanks
Behold this metropolis, gold, throw ya hands in
Me and my mans'n, we explodin' like loose cannons
Lace you quick with the basic wit, tiger like asics

I took her to the yacht, the shrimp and steak
Then I took her to the gym so she could get in shape

Hey going put that ass on me like a bee sting
Hey let the King on, beat it like a tambourine
And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine
I see her face down, ass high
Make everybody throw that cash high,

Sexy when I sleep,
No more fantasies I want the real thing.

As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before

A lonesome girl in a lonely world

In this cold rainy winter night

A cold existence left to pass
Too many feelings are shaped like glass

In this cold endless final strife

Niggas run but they can't hide
'Cause it's world wide (Inglewood)
I'm jackin' and lickin' niggas that's straight trippin'
Square-ass niggas can't tell a ounce from a chicken
I fill you full of lead and I take you big heads
So nigga, watch how ya talkin', I'm still chicken-hawkin'
So hit the deck, punk, don't move, my tech is bigger
And you'll be dead if I pull this trigger

Serving all enemies, fuck your whole set
This is the Westside Connect, I'm stealing to the neck
Nigga, where y'all from, where y'all from?
Better be the same that I'm claiming muthafuck explainin'

Steadily hoo-slangin' out the blue Monte Carlo
Spitting hollows out my Roscoe in packs as I blast
Getting my stalk on walk-on nigga waving my flag

Cock the hammer back and all smiles turn to frowns

Pistol-whip they ass 'till they open up the safe in Calabasas
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, nigga

You can't break a heart if you never had the key but you gave it to me
You can't break a heart if you don't know what to do
I was counting on you
I made you blue and you made me true
I made you cry and you made me too
But its here and there and I've seen the crushing glare
So don't forget that after all its just a Brooklyn phone call
And (his cry as a roof may be)
Its nothing compared to the love of you and me",Brooklyn Phone Call,2002
All Girl Summer Fun Band,"Canadian boyfriend, makin' my way up i5

Canadian boyfriend, for too long I've been away
Canadian boyfriend, today is the day
And I can't wait to see your face
I like staying at your place
And the way you make my heart race

â??I'll see you when I see you.â??
Please don't laugh at my broken heart
It's bad enough that my car won't start
There's nothing worse than being lovesick
When your broken down car, a real piece of shit
You broke my heart, my car won't start
You smile at me as is if you cared
With the smell of your goodbye, hands in my hair
Why did you wait 'till a quarter till one
When there are no buses running, not even one
You broke my heart, my car won't start
You broke my heart, my car won't start",Car Trouble,2002
All Girl Summer Fun Band,"It's the oldest cell phone in the world, yea yea yea
Heavy as a brick with a cord that curls, yea yea yea
But its alright when I call my baby

So big and heavy that it hurts my hand
But it's alright when I call my honey even though I might look funny, yea yea yea",Cell Phone,2002
All Girl Summer Fun Band,"Do the stars shine the same over there
While she runs her fingers through your hair
The hair I won't cut anymore
Now you're with your Australian whore
She can have you I don't care
I'll never have to cut your hair
She can have you I don't care anymore
â??Hey where's some good food in this town?â??
I wouldn't know I can't keep anything down
The thought of you both on your knees
Rearranging all her CD's
So sharp the shears, so many years we were together
She can have you I don't care
I'll never have to cut your hair
She can have you I don't care anyway, hey hey",Cut Your Hair,2002

If lovin' him's a crime
(Later operator)
I'm guilty all the time

Won't even buy me cheap, cheap cake

On a scooter all over town
He's on a first-name basis with the cops

All Girl Summer Fun Band,"I just saw that boy again, I wanna be his next girlfriend
He was so tall, he seemed so true
And so skinny I could break him in two
He must be new in town, I've never seen him before
Except for yesterday and the day before
I just saw him again, again, again.
I just saw that boy again, I've got to be his next girlfriend
He got behind me in line at the grocery store
I dropped my avocados on the floor
He must be new in town, I've never seen him before
Except for yesterday and the day before
I just saw him again, again, again.
When I see him walking home alone at night (You wanna hold him tight)
I can see that him and me could share our love eternally.
I just saw that boy again, I'll never be his next girlfriend
I saw him at this punk rock show, sitting with this other boy I know
They were arm in arm, they were knee to knee
They sure looked cute, I hope they'll be happy
I just saw him again, again, again.",New in Town,2002
All Girl Summer Fun Band,"You flip the coin to give others good luck
I'll say it's based on only pure luck
You like it when things are hidden away, 
Secret treasures one finds on the way
So it's true when they say that your friends will find you
Angels somehow always know just what to do
Treasure finds might be rare, but inside it is clear
A picture of friends whose friendship is dear
You're staring ahead and I'm looking at you
And cameras, like angels, they know what to do
So it's true when they say that your friends will find you
Angels somehow always know just what to do
And someday I'll flip my coins over too
Hoping good luck will fall over you",Somehow Angels,2002

He's coming around and I'm sticking my ground 
He's counting times I stumble over my do do do do do
