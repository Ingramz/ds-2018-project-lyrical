Johnny Paycheck,"Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
I need that woman's love to set me free
Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
Till I can make her love me

Hey, I know you're out there somewhere
And I know you've got the power to make her care
If you've ever thought of helping me, help me now
Take her by the hand and guide her to my arms somehow

Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
I need that woman's love to set me free
Mr. Lovemaker, don't let anyone take her
Till I can make her love me

Till I can make her love me",Mr. Love Maker,2003
Johnny Paycheck,"A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

Johnny Paycheck,"He said ""I'll love you till I die"", she told him ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by, she still preyed upon his mind

He kept her picture on his wall, went half-crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all, hoping she'd come back again

Kept some letters by his bed dated nineteen sixty-two
He had underlined in red every single ""I love you""

I went to see him just today, oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away, first time I'd seen him smile in years

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

You know, she came to see him one last time. Aww, 'n' we all wondered if she
would. And it kept runnin' through my mind-""this time he's over her for good.""

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today",He Stopped Loving Her Today,2003
Johnny Paycheck,"Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
 
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
 
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
 
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone",Help Me Make It Through the Night,2003

Johnny Paycheck,"Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.",Jingle Bells,2004
Johnny Paycheck,"What a beautiful mansion he built you
Splendor Lord you got it wall to wall
And yet with all of that you're still not happy
Cause everytime he's gone I get your call

Slide off of you satin sheets
Slip into your long soft mink
You know where to find my door
And I know what your cryin for

Baby you once told me I was good for nothin
And you couldn't live on dreams and crystal balls
His money buys you everything but my lovin
So I guess I'm good for something after all

Johnny Paycheck,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
An emblem of sufferin' and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a word of lost sinners were slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown",The Old Rugged Cross,2005
Johnny Paycheck,"Carolyn let me tell you what I heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
'Til he came to a city, bright in the night time like day
There they say he met with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb, dripped with honey
And somethin' about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm, and not alone

Yes Carolyn a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe a man will do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home

Johnny Paycheck,"You can find me in a dim light bar-+room
If your coldness should ever turn warm
But the chances of you ever changing
Are as slim as your two loving arms

So I'm turning off a memory
As quickly as time will allow
Yes, I'm turning off a memory
And the wine seems to help me somehow

If he's lucky he'll someday forget her
When the wine finally takes full control
But that's not much of a future to look to
But I can't stand to see the pain in his soul

And he's turning off a memory
As quickly as time will allow
Yes, I'm turning off a memory
And the wine seems to help me somehow
Yes, the wine seems to help somehow
Yes, I'm turning off a memory

Johnny Pecon,"I wondered alone one night. 
Till I heard an orchestra play.
I met you when lights were bright,
and people were carefree and gay.
You were the beautiful lady in blue.
I was in Heaven just dancing with you.
You filled me with strange delight,
and softly you strolled away.
 
I dream of that night with you,
lady when first we met.
We danced in a world of blue.
How can my heart forget.
Blue were your eyes,
and blue were the skies.
Just like the blue skirt you wore.
Come back blue lady come back.
Don't be blue anymore.",The Blue Skirt Waltz,2013

The tables must be turned, why, why, why
Why, oh why do you try

Don't waste my Monday (Wednesday, Friday)
Don't waste my Tuesday (Thursday, Saturday)
Don't waste the time I have
For making up the time you waste

Not much is being said by anybody in the world
About the things we get a hold of that could make a
Working brain go dead
If I try, it seems I'm not accepted
Why do you listen to the one who has nothing to say
The one who has nothing to say, why, why, why
Why, oh why do you try

Don't waste my Monday (Wednesday, Friday)
Don't waste my Tuesday (Thursday, Saturday)

Where would my body be?

My hands can't help my eyes
My eyes can't feel

Why do I try this way?

If I can't feel that's something's wrong

Whippin' your ass with a restaurant chain
Pumpin' that poison in your vein

They can't afford that pharmacy
Cut it down if it don't agree
Do you really care what a sick man needs?

Down on the ground you freaked out clown
Can't be sayin' them things out loud
Better off turnin' that smile to a frown
Hands on your head till you all calm down

Hey hey, what do you say
Is everybody scared of the man these days?
Scared to be you, scared to be me
Scared to believe that you can see
People in need, burstin' at the seams

Oh no, where do you go?
Blisters on your feet with your frozen toes
Everybody's tryin' to save your soul
Teachin' you things you already know

Hey hey, what can you say?

Can't be sayin' them crazy things
Ain't enough money in change these days

Won't you believe in the president's ways?
Give your rights away and say hurray
Hurray

Hey hey, what can say?
They pulled the plug on your membrane
Back to the streets with dope to blame
Puttin' your voice back in its place

Hey hey, what can you say?
You think that they can change their ways
I bet they can if they get paid
Prozac will come save the day

Hey hey, what can you say?
The big man spends your hard earned pay
Yellow brick roads have turned to clay
Chokin' blue collars to a dollar a day

Hey hey, what can you say?
Shut your mouth or get in the way
Speak your mind or go insane
It's a choice that you can make

Whatever we run into

As sure as I am I'll never let go of your hand

I promise you we'll fly up in sky's of blue

To get out of the storm

Dry your tears the only shelter you need

Is right in my arms

Take a deep breath and just hold on to me believe

You belong in the sun now baby right here next to me

Is she part of your plan

That in the morning she'll be there 
And if I die before I wake 
Chalk it up to give and take

Johnny Reid,"

Here I am an this road

Thousand miles from her

There's an echo in my soul

Like waves against her shores

She's the place that I go

When I find myself alone

With her fields of purple heather

And her fences made of stone

She calls me home


Something that I always felt inside

A dream I had to chase

And a mountain I just had to climb

To see what's on the other side

It doesn't really matter how lost I get

Or how far I roam

She calls me home


She's the comstant strength in my restless heart

She's the reason why

I got this far in the first place

Her voice rings clear in the back of my mind

When I can't go on

She calls me home


She calls me home


There's only one place where my roots run deep

There's only one place where I can swing

In my family tree

I know what it means to me

It doesn't matter how lost I get

Or how far I roam

She calls me home..


",She Calls Me Home,2007
Johnny Reid,"

Sixty to Zero:

She had blue eyes, the colour

Of Amarillo skies in summer

And when we'd fly

Her hair would wrap around me


The smell of leather and gasoline

A little danger sitting next to me

And when I was with her

Man, I never felt so alive


Sky was red, I was green

Road was black, seventeen

She was fast, I was slow

She was all I could hold

Summer flew, she was gone

Little did I know my heart could go

From sixty to zero


We'd sit in my car night after night

Watchin' the stars as they flew by

We'd go 'round the world at the speed of light

And never turn the key


Still I wonder where she might be

And if she ever stops and thinks about me

'Cause God knows

I sure think about her


(Repeat Chorus)


Sixty to zero


We loved and laughed enough to last a lifetime

But at least for a little while she was mine


(Repeat Chorus)

I still hear your name

Well I guess I must be crazy

To learn to live with what you left behind

Babe, I bet your ears must be burning by now
Where ever you are, stand up and take a bow
Cause tonight I’m just trying to get a ride
With you standing in the wings

When it’s wrong it is amazing
After all you put me through
Well I guess I must be crazy
Still talkin’ ‘bout

Your touch was too much, how can I ever give you up

To never fall again
I put up a defence
And I let nobody in

The way you left my heart
How can I forget

And how do I erase a tear
That's fallen on my page
I don't know where we went wrong
But I know this ain't no love song
Yeah I know this ain't no love song
But I wish it was

there's no one here to blame
So I guess it's up to me
To look the other way
Even though it's hard to see


And how do I erase a tear
That's fallen on my page
I don't know where we went wrong
But I know this ain't no love song
Yeah I know this ain't no love song

Down in the gutter life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade

The flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere someway
Where they're downing only deer 
A hundred steel towns away

Oh rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky 
I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene light up my darkness
Light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley I've got my eyes all over you baby
Oh baby

Oh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing

Oh I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Oh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
Never will I roam for I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky 
I'll be sailing

Oh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum

Johnny Reid,"She's sitting staring out a window, trying to figure out just what to do.
The last time that she gave her heart away it came back broken in two.
Like an old abandoned car she parked it down on a lonely avenue, she forgot about it till the day she laid her eyes on you...
And her heart said fire it up, and her soul said fire it up and her mind said fire it up, let love live again

He's sitting at a subway station watching as the trains go flying by
He used to hate the black man till the black man reached out and saved his life
He was pulled out of the darkness, rescued and blinded by the light
Ain't it crazy how one simple act of kindness can open up our eyes, open up your eyes
And let your heart say fire it up, and let your soul say fire it up, and let your mind say fire it up, let love live again

Here we are again, you and me still trying to figure out the world
Searching for a reason to believe what makes this big ball turn?
If we hold on to each other, give love, show love for all love's worth
Yeah they might call us crazy but tell me who's it gonna hurt, who's it gonna hurt
to let our hearts say fire it up, to let our soul say fire it up, to let our mind say fire it up, let love live again

Back to 22 (??) when we got to the liquor store
Slide on my shades as i walked through the front door

I bought a bag of chips 'cause you know i got the munchies
And some ruff riders for all the freaky honeys
Hey yo, stop barkin' you're fuckin' up my high
And i got the freak with the light brown eyes
Man pussy ain't got a name on it

Tú eras la niña de lentes y trenzas del décimo grado
Cómo has cambiado, te has transformado en una bella mujer
Y mirarte me deja atontado

Ahora recuerdo, fue en una fiesta
Tú me mirabas mientras yo bailaba sin tomarte en cuenta
Por esos días, yo no sabía
Que con el tiempo, por estar contigo, daría la vida

Pero el tiempo de estudiante ya pasó, se terminó
Ahora somos dos adultos que se encuentran
Y va poniendo a prueba el corazón
Y materias que no te enseñan en la escuela
En la ciencia tan difícil del amor

Yo era tan loco, tú eras tan seria
Tú ibas a clases, mientras yo mil veces me quedaba fuera
Cuando pasabas yo te ignoraba
Nunca pensé que una chica tan simple a mí me gustara

It's my own fault for what happens to my heart

Pay that no mind
Just find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Well, I know they make you sad
They make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me like you should
Folks got ways to make you feel no good
I'd guess they've got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And boy, you never lied to me
And the part of you they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

A mountain of love, a mountain of love, you should be ashamed
We used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside a church there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringin' and they shoulda been ours
That's why I'm so lonely, my dreams gone above
High on a mountain of love

I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said, 
Ain't that a kick in the head?
The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back.
Like the sailor said, quote, 
""Ain't that a hole in the boat?""
My head keeps spinning;
I go to sleep and keep grinning;
If this is just the beginning, 
My life's gonna be beautiful.
I've sun- shine enough to spread;

Tell me quick, oh ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?
You're nobody til somebody loves you
You're nobody til somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess the world and it's gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old
The world still is the same, you never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody til somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He fell in love with an indian maid over in the antique store 
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show 
So she could never answer yes or no 

He always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk 
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk 
Kaw-Liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign 
Because his heart was made of knotty pine 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head 

Kaw-Liga was a lonely indian, never went nowhere 
His heart was set on the indian maid with the coal black hair 
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show 
So she could never answer yes or no 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head 

Then one day a wealthy customer bought the indian maid 
And took her oh so far away, but old kaw-liga stayed 
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be 
And wishes he was still an old pine tree

Johnny Russell,"One day the train was passin' I caught it crawlin' by
To look this old world over under God's blue sky
My darling stood there weeping as I was looking back
I kissed my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home you'll be my dream
Goodbye so long there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter but I'll be driftin' back
To where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I like to keep on goin' it helps me when I'm blue
I get the urge to travel that's all I want to do
I know I just can't settle down because I like to roam
And when I hear that whistle blow I've gotta move along
Goodbye so long there's something down the track keeps calling me
Goodbye so long I guess that's just the way I'll always be
So when I get that feeling don't try to hold me back
I'll only leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I know my baby loves me I love my baby too
But she don't understand me when I'm feeling blue
And when I hear that whistle blow I hurry home and pack
And leave my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long I hate to leave you but I've gotta go
Goodbye so long it's coming now just heard that whistle blow
It'll be here in a minute you'll wave and I'll look back
I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

I'd say a lonely prayer again

I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
Just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
While all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
Merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
Do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
Is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
And when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
And if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
It's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Johnny Smith,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks,1967

Until I'm almost mad

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

Johnny Smith,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with

With eyes of their own to see with

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2002

Your mirrors get jammed up with all your friends

That personality everything starts to blend
Personality when your mind starts to blend
Personality impression of a friend,
Of a friend, of a friend, of a friend, of a friend
Personality wonderin' how celebrities ever met
(Look and find out on television)

Personality crisis you got it while it was hot
Frustration and heartache is all you got, don't you worry
Personality crisis please don't cry
It's just a personality crisis, please don't stop

Because you walk a personality

You change on into the wolf man howlin' at the moon

On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'

Johnny Tillotson,"I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
The pillow where you'd lay your head
Now holds my lonely tears instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurtin' since you're gone

They say a man should never cry
But when I see you passin' by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
You broke my heart and set me free
But you forgot your memory

That was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant

And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit

Puisque le tien viendra vers moi

And the fantasy won't let go
Sooner or later somethin' is gonna break
She'll find out the hard way

Show up in red and end up wearin' blue

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.

To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do

Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...

With a new step ev'ry day !
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !

And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.

Every new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.

In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep

Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes 
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?"" 
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""

Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King

Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done 
Just take everything down to Highway 61"" 

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night 
Told the first father that things weren't right 
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""

But the second mother was with the seventh son 
And they were both out on Highway 61 

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored 
Trying to create a next world war 
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor

We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun 
And have it on Highway 61""",Highway 61 Revisited,1976

But you keep it hidden deep inside
So it's got nowhere to go

Don't hide your love
Don't hide your love
Don't hide the love that you're afraid to feel
That's a low down dirty deal

You got miles and miles of deep-sea smiles
But I never seen them surface
You got this and that and the other thing
But you don't realize their purpose

How can you be so damn naive?
You cause me some frustration
You keep it under lock and key
Why don't you try my combination?

Don't you hide your love
Don't hide your love

Johnny Winter,"Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all kiddin' you

You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be on your own with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
Don't you know you only used to get juiced in it?
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say,""Do you want to make a deal?""

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all came down and did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You should never let other people get your kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at?
After he's taken everything he could steal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts and things
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe

You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, and you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be without a home, with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

I heard you telling Jimmy I ain't got no sense.
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You done put me in a trick-bag.

When I come home, start an argument,
Just to keep you from asking where my voodoo went.
Peep out the front door--I hear the back door slam.
I peek out of my window--somebody's taking it on the lam.

Johnny Winter,"These women loving each other,
You know they ain't thinkin' about no man
They ain't keepin' secrets no more,
They playing a wide open hand

I saw a little girl the other day,
I asked her for a little thrill
She said I'm so sorry daddy,
But I'm puttin' out the same thing you is

I took the woman out ridin',
Bought her all kinds of whiskey and wine
I guess I was too drunk to realize,
She say I'll see you some other time

The woman gets all dressed up to boogie,
Goes out smelling sweet like a rose
Comes home 5 o'clock in the mornin',
With that fish scent on her clothes",Bad Girl Blues,1989
