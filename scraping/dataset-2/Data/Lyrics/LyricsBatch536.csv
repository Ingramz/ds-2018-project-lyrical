Keiko Lee,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",Lover Come Back to Me,2006
Keiko Lee,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2006
Keiko Lee,"I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
I really mean to learn

Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me",How Deep Is Your Love,2007
Keiko Lee,"Hang on to the world as it spins around 
Just don't let the spin get you down 
Think of moving fast 
Hold on tight and you will last 
Give yourself respect, your manly pride 
Get yourself in gear 
Keep your stride 
Never mind your fears 
Brighter days will soon be here 
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free, yeah 

Keep on walking tall 
Hold your head up high 
Lay your dreams right up to the sky 
Sing your greatest song 
And you'll keep going, going on 
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free 
Hey, just wait and see, some day we'll all be free, yeah

Keiko Matsui,"""How ya doin' girls? Long time, no see.
Listen, I've been to the doctor lately.
Honey, I just spent forty dollars to hear that from that guy?""

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
The way he described it he said,
""You'd be better off dead than alive.""
I didn't listen to his jive.
I knew all along he was all wrong,
And I knew that he thought I was crazy,
But you know I'm not. Oh, no.

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
He said I need treatment.
But I'm not that easily led.
He said I was the type that was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind.
And he thought I was nuts.
No more if's or and's or but's.
Oh, no.

They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas.
But I knew what was happenin',
I knew I was a genius.
What's so strange when you know that
You're a wizard at three?
I said, ""Baby, this is meant for me, me, me, me.""

I heard little children were supposed to sleep tight.
That's why I drank a fifth of vodka one night.
My parent's got frantic, didn't know what to do.
But I had saw some crazy things
Before I came to.
Now, do you think I was crazy?
I may have been only three but I was swingin'.

They all laughed at A. Graham Bell,
They all laughed at Edison,
And also at Einstein.
So why should I feel sorry if they just
Didn't understand the reasoning and the logic
That went on in my head.
I had a brain, it was insane.
So I just let them laugh at me
When I refused to ride on all those double-decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top.
Aaaaaaah.

""Did you ever hear a story like that in your life?
Honey, that chick is bananas. Do you hear?
Bananas. Oh, waiter, bring me another banana dacquari, would ya?""
Ba, ba, ba, ba!
""Oh, here she comes again.""
Badada, badada, badada. Wo!

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head.
But I said, ""Doctor,
I think that it's you instead.
'Cause I got a thing that's so unique and new,
It proves that I got the last laugh on you.
'Cause instead of one head, ooh, I got two.
And you know two heads are better than one.""

""Honey, she is twisted""",A Great Romance,2007
Keiko McNamara Trio,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1991
Keiko McNamara Trio,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1991
Keiko Toyama,"Carolina 
Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Keimzeit,"Weißt du, Rosi,
Wir sind älter geworden.
Auch du siehst nicht mehr
Ganz so frisch aus.
Mit der Zeit sind nicht nur
Uns're Ideale gestorben,
Nee, irgendwie sieht es rundrum
Nicht mehr ganz so rosig aus.

Wir haben uns oft
Mit jedem Idioten geschlagen.
Und dabei alles riskiert.
Jetzt hör ich uns
Über unsre Zähne klagen.
Wir überlegen,
Ob man sie nicht
Irgendwann mal weiß lackiert.

Unsre Väter sind genervt,
Unsre Mütter stricken fleißig weiter
Handschuhe,
Wenn es kalt wird Socken.
Wir haben schon so lange nicht
Im Schnee gebadet,
Um unsern Kreislauf zu schocken.

Stattdessen sitzen wir hier
Und trinken Kaffee.
Machen zu jedem Witz
Ein gutes Gesicht.
Ich erklär dir diplomatisch,
Dass ich dich immer noch so lieb hab.
Und du glaubst mir das.
Oder nicht.",Rosi,1990

Gestatten sie, bitte,

Gewöhnlich hab ich mir,
Was ich brauche, geklaut.

But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
'Woe is me' if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let all these memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and

God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
We're searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

I thought I saw you out there crying
I thought I heard you call my name
I thought I heard you out there crying

If you told me last year I'd be laid up like this man
I would have never believed you
Things are a lot different

Seems like it was just a year ago
I was talking sleek about girls
About the little things they do to just piss me off, oh yeah
I was better off alone

I became numb and insensitive
Started being bitter and cold
Tuning in and listening to pimps on the radio and you know
It started making sense to me

But that's when I met my lady
Woman came and changed the game
Happy that I found my lady
And my life would never be the same, oh yeah

Wasn't even looking to fall in love
Was the last thing on my mind
Didn't see it coming till it already had me down
Struck me blind

I was on the verge of being through with the pain
Didn't see a reason to try
Couldn't understand what all these fools kept singing about
'Till I became one of them

When I became your lady
Everything started to change
Happy I became your lady

Why do you come here when you know I got troubles enough?
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone?
Make me lie when I don't want to 
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stare when I should not.
Are you so strong or is the weakness in me?

Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by?
But I need to see you
And I need to hold you... tightly

If I choose now, I lose out

I need you and you alone

It was like I already knew your game, your game
You're caught in a trap, but I'll say one word
How come you don't talk to me with so much left unheard

So many things I wanted to say to your face
Never quite had the right words to say, to say

Some kind of complicated emotions playing on my mind
Some kind of easy solution I've got to find
It's time to change thoughts up in the night
'Cause if I won't, what's gonna make it right

Never a day that goes by without you leaving alone
But don't come to me and try and tell me things
That I already know, I already know

So many things you needed to say to my face
Until you do I'm walking away

Some kind of complicated emotions playing on my mind
Some kind of easy solution I've got to find
It's time to change thoughts up in the night
'Cause if I won't, what's gonna make it right?

Some times feeling a little lonely, I need some one I can talk to
I don't care what you say
Maybe we gotta find something that we, we both can relate to
So that this is all we do

Try looking in another place,
If you think it could be torn apart,
Try looking in another place

But don't mistake me for somebody
Who's hung up on you.

Can hide the key and lock you away,

There's always someone else there to blame,
There's no time to grieve or feel sad about it,

身を削りながら生きることも
忘れ去られながら老いてゆくのも
優しい素振りや 醜しい癖も
世間にとっちゃナンの意味もない

逢わせて 咲かせて 夢よもう一度
渇いた心に命与えて
酔わせて イカせて ダメよもう二度と
野暮な躊躇いも今はただ
ラケルの横道に埋めました

神が宣ふ、時代は変わり
答えは風に吹かれていると
心 ブルーにこんがらがって
転がる石は女の如く

人波に押され 溺れながら
子供らはどんな未来を描くの？
黒い瞳の見つめる先に
何が待ち受けているのでしょう？

あの頃 夢見た場所はどんなトコ？
愛しい誰かの腕の中でしょうか？
柔肌重ねて舐る夏の夜
初心な恥じらいはぼんやりと
暗渠にとけ出していきました

逢わせて 咲かせて 夢よもう一度
渇いた心に命与えて
酔わせて イカせて ダメよそんなこと
野暮な躊躇いも 今はただ
深い谷底に消えました
大河の一滴になりました

He is my light, my strength, my song
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
'Til on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the pow'r of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand
'Til He returns or calls me home
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.",In Christ Alone,2011

Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby pickin' wildflowers

Hey baby mother nature is waiting and
Love's bloomin' like a cherry tree that's
I'll buzz around maybe do some pollinate
Yeah, dive in like honeybees

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby

Pickin' wildflowers

Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby won't you come with me

Whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time pickin' wildflowers

Whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours

Keith Anderson,"Same Saturday night, same ol' crowd
Draggin' Main to the Safeway then turn back around
'Til curfew and then head down to the river's edge and get drunk
Ain't nothing new what else you gonna do out in Podunk

Well I knew this six-string was my ticket out
No flashin' red light was gonna slow me down
18 years old everything that I owned in the back of that truck
I put a dip in my mouth and I headed straight out outta Podunk

1st Chorus:
Goodgye, daddy looked me in the eye said go where you gotta go
But don't forget to call home
And momma cried keep Jesus in your life and I hugged her one last time
And then I headed down the roadin a dusty cloud of smoke
Out of Podunk

Bridge:
A lot of years gone by showin' on my face
Nothing in this life that time hasn't changed
I chased a lot of dreams and some of them came true
Ain't it funny how the very place I ran from is the place I'm runnin' to

Another Saturday night singin' to the same ol' crowd
Still playin this six-string but things are different nowI met one
Of those girls turn your whole world around girls
And wouldn't you know it
We got our eyes on a house 'bout a hundred miles south
Out in Podunk


Goodbye, her daddy looked me in the eye
And said go where you gotta go son but don't forget to call home
And her momma cried said keep Jesus in your life and we hugged her one last time
Then we headed down the road to start a family of our own
Out in Podunk

Goodbye, her daddy looked me in the eye
And said go where you gotta go son but don't forget to call home
And her momma cried said keep Jesus in your life and we hugged her one last time
Then we headed down the road to start a family of our own
Out in Podunk

Goodbye, her daddy looked me in the eye
And said go where you gotta go son but don't forget to call home
And her momma cried said keep Jesus in your life and we hugged her one last time
Then we headed down the road to start a family of our own

Wiped the sweat off his brow

As far as I can tell
Ooh, brrr, mama he's a double XL""

And I turned red
And we both laughed

Quicker than I could say sin
I slipped further in than I was planning
Never shook the devil's hand

To telling God ""to hell with him""

Find the glasses for his eyes 
Aren't what they used to be 
Picks up the clothes he's worn so long 
On the bureau sits the picture of a lady 
And the mural of a man who's been gone for many years 

[Chorus]
The old man walks in Echo Park 
From bench to bench he moves from morning â??til dark 
For the ducks some bread he brings 
Wonder if he'll feed them this time next spring 

Listening to the children play 
Reminds him of other days 
Many years ago 
Thoughts of a child that he helped grow 
And the memory of a letter saying dear sir 
We regret to inform you, your son will not be coming home 

[Chorus] 

Old man tell me are there fears 
Do you measure life in years 
Or is one day all you'll ever know 
I've got to know

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can","High Flying, Adored",1995

And everyone's sportin' the same profile
And all of y'all wearin' the same name brands
I hear everybody jackin' these played out jams
I won't reach for no gun, punk, I use my hands
I rock mikes and roll bikes, I cross foreign lands
I made my bones out in zones where twilight be
And every time I touch the mike it's Fright Night Part Three
For every emcee that wannaa test and try
In your custom made wears thinkin' you too fly
Make it up in gold chains what you're lackin' for brains
It's time to call your ma, duke, scoop up your remains
And finally lay to rest all the shit you stressed
Of boastin' and braggin' about the toes you taggin'
I'm knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door
While every rapper that's simmed is pimped like a whore
You see the talk is eighteen, three quarters past four
When your doctor slaps my ass, hear the lion roar
The record sales soared and the world got toured
You say what happened to my band, I say I just got bored
Now they call me Whitey Ford, and I praise the Lord
Find me breakin' up your crews, catch me singin' the blues
Strummin' and pickin' like I'm BB King
It's Abdul Rakim, now watch me do my thing

CHORUS
Down, down, you go
Down, down, so low
Down, down, till you hit the floor
Keep fallin' down, till you can't get down no more

You go point blank range with the scope he's knockin'
The Psycho might change but there ain't no stoppin'
The mmon's on the rise when the sun start droppin'
And y'all need to quit the bullshit that you be poppin'
'Cause I've been hip hoppin' since BDP
(???), it's Abdul Rakim
And when referring to me you must respect the name
Make a quick double take and double check your game
'Cause you about to get dissed, I'm checkin' my list
When I check it over twice it's like rollin' dice
I hit four, five, six, I'm all up in your mix
I rock good from Hollywood to the city of bricks
And all these fake cats scream they're keepin' it real
While you're makin' your deal we'll be breakin' the seal
You be breakin' your vows like people worshippin' cows
And then I hit ya with the who's, what's, where's and how's
Like Vinny Barbarino, Matt Pachino
I'm with my man Rino with the Brooklyn Lordz
Crashin' the boards with my soul in a hole
I take it back to the future from the days of old
I'm too cold to hold, too hot not to burn ya
Don't stick your nose in businessthat don't concern ya
Might have to trip and flip like I've Turner
You too old for schoolin', boy, when I'm gonna learn ya

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1992

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside

Wanna laugh like a loon

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1997

Take a look down at the madman
Theater kings on silver wings
Fly beyond reason
From the flight of the seagull
Come the spread claws of the eagle
Only fear breaks the silence
As we all kneel pray for guidance

Tread the road cross the abyss
Take a look down at the madness
On the streets of the city
Only specters still have pity
Patient queues for the gallows
Sing the praises of the hallowed

If they take us they will burn us

Keith Emerson,"Lead me from tortured dreams
Childhood themes of nights alone,
Wipe away endless years,
Childhood tears as dry as stone.

From seeds of confusion,
Illusions darks blossoms have grown.
Even now in furrows of sorrow
The dance still is sung.

My life's course is guided
Decided by limits drawn
On charts of my past days
And pathways since I was born.

I carry the dust of a journey
That cannot be shaken away
It lives deep within me
For I breathe it every day.

You and I are yesterday's answers,
The earth of the past came to flesh,
Eroded by Time's rivers
To the shapes we now possess.

Come share of my breath and my substance,
And mingle our stream and our times.
In bright, infinite moments,
Our reasons are lost in our rhymes.

Doubles faces dark defense
Talk too loud but talk no sense
Yeah I see those smiling eyes
Butter us up with smiling lies

Talk to creatures raise the dead
Fate you know sure got fed
Trained apart from houses of stone
Hour of horses pick the bone

Come forth, from love spire
Born in life's fire, 
Born in life's fire. 
Come forth, from love's spire

In the burning, all are yearning,
For life to be.
And the pain will (must) be gain,
New life!

Stirring in, salty streams
And dark hidden seams
Where the fossil sun gleams.

They were, sent from (to) the gates
Ride the tides of fate,
Ride the tides of fate.
They were, sent from (to) the gates

In the burning of our yearning,
For life to be.

Go to the show.

We're gonna find out where you folks really stand.

I wake but I'm not breathing
And I say

Cover me, while I'm sleeping, won't you cover me
Cover me, if I'm bleeding, won't you cover me
Cover me, be my shadow, won't you cover me
Cover me, I will follow, won't you cover me

So won't you take this captured spirit
Now won't you hear my final plea
You got to cut the wire
Release your sympathy
Unspoken words that heal

Up from the grave He rose again!

Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

To a time so long ago
When the sweet Magnolia blossomed
Cotton fields as white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
Who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

Traded for a chestnut mare

Though his load was hard to bear

Keith Green,"Like a foolish dreamer, trying to build a highway to the sky
All my hopes would come tumbling down, and I never knew just why
Until today, when you pulled away the clouds that hung like curtains on my eyes
Well I've been blind all these wasted years and I thought I was so wise
But then you took me by surprise

Like waking up from the longest dream, how real it seemed
Until your love broke through
I've been lost in a fantasy, that blinded me
Until your love broke through

All my life I've been searching for that crazy missing part
And with one touch, you just rolled away the stone that held my heart
And now I see that the answer was as easy, as just asking you in
And I am so sure I could never doubt your gentle touch again
It's like the power of the wind

Like waking up from the longest dream, how real it seemed
Until your love broke through
I've been lost in a fantasy, that blinded me
Until your love, until your love, broke through

Keith Green,"Unexpectedly, you came back to see,
If Id was waiting, like I promised long before.
Your shadow filled the room, the music changed its tune,
When I saw you, you were standing at the door.

Like summer snow, you were an unexpected sight.
A blazing sun, you were shining in the night,
When I really should have known, that youd be coming home.
I waited patiently, but I found it hard to see,

If you were coming, why was there such a long delay.
At times I thought you lied, or else you would have tried,
To let me know that you were coming home today.
Like summer snow, it falls around me in the cold.

I can hear the echoes, of the warnings I was told.
That I should know, that youd be coming home.

With steeples and bells
Or a salesman who will sell you
The things you just want to hear

For his love was such
That he suffered so much
To cause some of us
Just to follow, follow

While the funniest thing that he's done
Is love this whole stubborn rebellious world
While their hate for him just goes on

And love just like that
Will bring him back

By giving us his son,
Who paid the highest cost,
To point us to the cross.

I take one look at me,
Compared to what I'm called to be.

Then to lay down your life for a friend.

But now the only thing that I can believe is gods word, his holy word.

Just when you should be looking straight to the skies.

I was thinking of going, I had to leave right away,
My life is just fading, and oh I felt so alone,
The nearest young maiden was, a full day's ride from home.
My father was reading, the holy books in his room,
My heart was just bleeding, I knew I had to go soon,
He smiled and pointed at an old wooden chair,
I wanted to hold him, but then I just wouldn't dare.

I said, father, there's so much to know,
There's a world of things to see,
And I'm ready to go and make a life for myself
If you give me what is mine,
I will go, if I can have your blessing,
But if you won't bless my journey, I'm gonna leave anyway.

Son, I've always tried my best for you,
And if you must be leaving home, then go with the blessing of god.
Not too many days later, I was well on my way,
I met a traveling stranger, who seemed to have much to say,
He told me tales of the city, and all the women he'd had,
I asked him, wasn't that sinful,
He said, no, it isn't that bad.

And then a few days later, on an old city road,
We were drowning in laughter, and we had women to hold,
And this went on quite a long time, my father gave me a lot,
But when my pockets were empty, my friends all left me to rot.

Then a famine hit and drained the land,
Everywhere I looked I saw starvation, and a job was nowhere to find,
I wandered through the city streets, competing for the food of common beggers,
Until then I'd never known hunger, but now I wasn't too proud.

I finally found some employment, feeding pigs on a farm,
I wasn't treated to kindly, I had to sleep in the barn,
I had to eat with the swine,
The bread I ate was like stone,
It didn't take too much time until, I was dreaming of home.

Oh, the servants there are better fed,
If I could only have what my father gives them,
I would truly need nothing more.
Oh, I will go and say to him,
I'm no longer worthy to be in your family,
Will you take me as your servant, and let me live with them

It didn't take too long to pack my things,
I left with only what I wore,
And I prayed that I still had a home.

I was near home, in site of the house,
My father just stared, dropped open his mouth,
He ran up the road, and fell to my feet, and cried, and cried,
Father I've sinned, heaven ashamed,
I'm no longer worthy to wear your name,
I've learned that my home is right where you are,
Oh father, take me in.

Bring the best robe, put it on my son,
Shoes for his feet, hurry put them on,
This is my son who I thought had died,
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,
I've prayed and prayed, never heard a sound,
My son was lost, oh thank you God he's found,
My son was dead and he's now alive,
Prepare a feast for my son's alive,
My son was dead,
My son was lost,

Keith Hampshire,"Woke up this mornin' feelin' fine
There's somethin' special on my mind
Last night I met a new girl in the neighbourhood, whoa yeah
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')

She's the kind of girl who's not too shy
And I can tell I'm her kind of guy
She danced close to me like I hoped she would
(she danced with me like I hoped she would)
Somethin' tells me I'm into something good
(Somethin' tells me I'm into somethin')

We only danced for a minute or two
But then she stuck close to me the whole night through
Can I be fallin' in love
She's everthing I've been dreamin' of
She's everthing I've been dreamin' of

I walked her home and she held my hand
I knew it couldn't be just a one-night stand
So I asked to see her next week and she told me I could

Keith Harkin,"Gonna take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I?m older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there?s been heartache and pain
I don?t know if I can face it again
Can?t stop now, I?ve travelled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
And I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
I?m gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
'cause I?ve got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there?s been heartache and pain
I don?t know if I can face it again
I can?t stop now, I?ve traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
And I want you to show me

Keith Harkin,"They say the skies of Lebanon are burning
Those mighty cedars bleeding in the heat
They're showing pictures on the television
Women and children dying in the street
And we're still at it in our own place
Still trying to reach the future through the past
Still trying to carve tomorrow from a tombstone

But hey, don't listen to me
This wasn't meant to be no sad song
We've heard too much of that before
Right now I only want to be with you
Till the mornin' dew comes fallin'

And I want to take you to the island
Trace your footprints in the sand
And in the evening when the sun goes down
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean

They're raisin' banners over by the markets
White washing slogans on our ship yard walls
Witch doctors praying for a mighty showdown
No way our holy flag is gonna fall

Up here we sacrifice our children
To feed the worn out dreams of yesterday
And teach them dying will lead us into glory

But hey, don't listen to me.
'Cause this wasn't meant to be no sad song
I've sung too much of that before
Right now I only want to be with you
Till the mornin' dew comes fallin'

I want to take you to the island
Trace your footprints in the sand
And in the evening when there's no one around
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean

Now I know us plain folks don't see all the story
And I know this peace and love's just copping out
And I guess these young boys dyin' in the ditches
Is just what being free is all about
And how this twisted wreckage down main street
Will bring us all together in the end
And we'll go marching down the road to freedom

Keith Harkin,"Oh, Mary, this London's a wonderful sight
The people here are working by day and by night
They don't sow potatoes, nor barley, nor wheat
But there's gangs of them diggin' for gold in the street

At least, when I asked them, that's what I was told
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold
But for all that I've found there I might as well be
In the place where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea

There's beautiful girls here, oh never you mind
Beautiful shapes nature never designed
Lovely complexions of roses and cream
But let me remark with regard to the same

That if at those roses you venture to sip
Colors might fall come away on your lips
So I'll wait for the white rose that's waitin for me
In the place where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea

You remember young Davey McClaren of course
Well sure now he's round here with the rest of the force
I saw him one day as I was crossin the strand
And he stopped the whole street with a wave of his hand

And as we stood talkin of days that are gone
The whole town of London stood there to look on
But for all his great powers he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea

But for all his great powers he's wishful like me
To be back where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea",The Mountains of Mourne,2008

Is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I don't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

And I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeers click

And I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
Everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
And I just want you for my own

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
And the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears

Once bitten, twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby well do you recognize me?
It's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

(Happy Christmas!)

With a note saying ""I love you"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, you'd fool me again

[Chorus]

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, when you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Gave you my heart
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

Was blind but now I see

Though many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
Twas grace that brought me safe thus far

Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you

Keith Harkin,"The Dutchman's not the kind of man
Who keeps his thumb jammed in the dam
That holds his dreams in,
But that's a secret that only Margaret knows.

When Amsterdam is golden in the summer,
Margaret brings him breakfast,
She believes him.
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow.

He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes,
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes.

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.

The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes,
His cap and coat are patched with the love
That Margaret sewed there.
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam.

And he watches the tug-boats down canals
An' calls out to them when he thinks he knows the Captain.
Till Margaret comes
To take him home again

Through unforgiving streets that trip him, though she holds his arm,
Sometimes he thinks he's alone and he calls her name.

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.

The winters whirl the windmills 'round
She winds his muffler tighter
And they sit in the kitchen.
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew.

And he sees her for a moment, calls her name,
She makes the bed up singing some old love song,
A song Margaret learned
When it was very new.

He hums a line or two, they sing together in the dark.
The Dutchman falls asleep and Margaret blows the candle out.

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuiderzee.
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me.",The Dutchman,2011

I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o. Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

[Chorus]

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

[Chorus]

't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney

Keith Harkin,"And if she asks you why, you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of castles in the air.
I've got a dream I want the world to share
And castle walls just lead me to despair.

Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky,
A dream come true, I'll live there till I die.
I'm asking you to say my last goodbye.
The love we knew ain't worth another try.

Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain.

But how can words express the feel of sunlight in the morning,
In the hills, away from city strife.
I need a country woman for my wife;
I'm city born, but I love the country life.

For I cannot be part of this cocktail generation:
Partners waltz, devoid of all romance.
The music plays and everyone must dance.
I'm bowing out. I need a second chance.

Save me from all the trouble and the pain.
I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again.
Tell her the reasons why I can't remain,
Perhaps shell understand if you tell it to her plain.

And if she asks you why, you can tell her that I told you
That I'm tired of castles in the air.
I've got a dream I want the world to share
And castle walls just lead me to despair.

The campfire glows in the autumn breeze, and I am

My mind is drifting to where you are

Remember me, recuerde me. Mi amore.

So long ago, so far away, each night I pray
""volvero los dias passados""

But duty calls, so whate'er befalls

Walkin' in the door with some friends

Wasn't treatin' you right
So we got in a fight

Over you, never has there been such a fool
Never has a heart beat so true
So deep and strong, with love so far beyond love I knew
Before I knew I'll never will be over you

I can't forget that third day of December
I was scared as any man could be
But now that day is so easy to remember
'Cause we turned into a family

I was holdin' your hand, tryin' to be a man
But then our baby breathin'
I was on my knees

Over you, never has there been such a fool
Never has a heart beat so true
So deep and strong, with love so far beyond love I knew
Before I knew I'll never will be over you

And I've done my best to tell you all this time
How I really feel
This love is forever 'cause I know I'll never will be over you

I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one

-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You,1989
Keith Jarrett,"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring

Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Keith Jarrett,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Keith Jarrett,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,2006

And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be

Keith Jarrett,"The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her
But I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry",Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry,2007

Keith Jarrett,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2007
Keith Jarrett,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,

It must go to someone of course

But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away

I always thought our love was strong enough

You can't hide what you feel inside 
And the fire has left your eyes

I can almost hear the song
But the prayers they go unanswered
We both know, we're just hanging on

The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh, it's just a memory

You never see it coming, you just go separate ways

In the album of my memory

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Just you wait.......!

Where god paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together.

I'll search for wood,
So you can cook... while i stand look-in'

Keith Mansfield Orchestra,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2007

Till one dream appears and love is its name

Don't think of the danger or the stranger is gone

Make one dream come true, you only live twice

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Well now to err is something human and forgiving so divine
I'll forgive your trespasses, if you forgive me mine
Life's a deal, you knew it, when you signed the dotted line
They nail you to the paper, put a rope around your neck
And so we sing along, the boy stood on the burning deck!

Move over Ms. L. you know I wish you well
Move over Ms. L. 

Well now momma poppa told me son you better watch your head
Your head is fulla snakes boy, you're better red than dead
They're starving back in China, that's what they always said!
Can't get head in the head shop, yer jeans are fulla crap
You're full of beans, you're in your teens, you lost your momma's road map!

Someone to tell my troubles to

'Cause I'm just passing through

I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
Now I find fortune and fame, lots of people know my name

And one be the lender of love and emotion
That covered the ocean of sadness that kept them together

Love will start with you, it is easy to measure it
Bury a treasure in it it's not an adventure
It's more to be certain that it had to be shared together

Love when it's growing is full of surprises
Its temperature rises from higher to higher
And then turns into fire which has to be shared together

In the middle of a cold  cold night
It was fourteen below and the wind start to blow
There wasn't a boy scout in sight
Pull down the shades cause he's comin'
Turn out the lights cause he's here
Runnin' hard down the street
Through the snow and the sleet
On the coldest night of the year

[Chorus]
Beware  beware  beware of the Naked Man

Old lady head up toward Broad Street
Shufflin' uptown against the wind
She had started to cry-wiped a tear from her eye
And looked back to see where she had been

Old lady stand on the corner
With a purse in her hand
She does not know but in a minute or so
She will be robbed by a naked man

[Chorus]

Old lady lean against a lamppost
Starin' down at the ground on which she stand
She look up and scream
For the lamplight's beam
There stood the famous Naked Man

He say, ""They found out about my sister
And kicked me out of the Navy,
They would have strung me up if they could.
I tried to explain that we were both of us lazy
And were doing the best we could.""

He faked to the left and he faked to the right
And he snatched the purse from your hand

As he faded from sight,

I hope your mail always fails to reach you
Until you want to hear from me
I hope your wristwatch goes berserk

But I'm not angry, I'm just hurt
I hope your phone will never ring & you can never sing
I hope your car doesn't start, cannot move
Until you want to be with me

I hope your brand new dress gets torn
But I'm not angry, just forlorn
I'll make a voodoo dance to fit with bats & owls
We'll haunt your house on rattle chains
We'll hang around until you call my name

And tell me that you want me back again
I hope your records always break, your shoes make your feet ache
I hope your luck will get stuck on black cats
Until you want a kiss from me

And one be the lender of love and emotion
That covered the ocean of sadness that kept them together?

Love when it started was easy to measure:
Each day was a pleasure, each night an adventure,
Each morning was something that had to be shared together.

Love when it's growing is full of surprises
As temperature rises from higher to higher,
Then turns into fire that has to be shared together.

Then came the sadness which follows the laughter
And shortly thereafter the dream had exploded,
A promise was broken, now few words are spoken together.

now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject

Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,

Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby

Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear

The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy 
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while 
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new 
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby everything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, everything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
I'm a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say
I guess her folks brought her up that way
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised 
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
No one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poorman's son
She says give her the things that money can buy 
But I'll never, never make my baby cry
And it's all right, what I can't do
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight

So come get a whip, and a bump, it's rough 
Crews couldn't hold it in handcuffs 
The ordeal is that I'm raw ill on the mic 
Switchin my styles up like a transvestite (word) 
I think of competition as (?) and 
Keith Murray is the vocabulary champ 
Come in against deep notable to breach lines
I'll make you make the same mistake twice three or four times 
And nobody got a style like this 
You could say, I got my thinking cap on backwards 
I'll demolish the retarded smartest rap artists 
Regardless, tryin to scream the hardest 
I fuck your head up like amphetamines with L.O.D. 
Then bend you out of shape like a master Yogi 
I put my head through your chest, just to see 
Who's next in line, just to get wrecked 
I makes contact, bust the interlude 
I take my skills to another level like Qualudes

The active half flippin shit so split 'fore I explode - BOOM! 
So umm, pay attention, before I put you and your crew on suspension 
For being closed minded to my invention 
Yo, I rock on reel when I record oh my lord 
The world full of jackers so I keep my shit stored 
When I rock the microphone I rock it right 
And keep it hardcore and more blacker than Wesley Snipes 
To my crew there's no match 
You want more funk then here's another batch, yo I

Keith Murray is this mic phychosis
I break your best rappers off thousands of pieces
I'm on some other shit splittin' wigs with my penmanship
Kick flows harder then the music so feel in your head and chest
And pass it to the next
They gave me 5 mic checks and all due respect
So please fill it up and check the anitfreeze
Cause this nigga Keith drop mad degrees
I launch tomahawk missles when I talk with permiscuesus
Intelligence like Mr. Romp

I walk MC's like Jesus walked on water
As my airy frequency reigns through the galaxy
I easily gets busy and takes 3
I'm the nicest MC on this side of the peninsula
Stuck in the perimeter like a ninja

I concock some shit that'll bust the sun
I got the stunky funky illest funk flow 
For the glamorous scandalous world of radio
So how you want? Headcreads or ceelo?
I gets root deep like cavity cretes
Rockin' motherfuckers directly to sleep

Supersonic hyperphonic goin' on that ass paragraph
With the million dollar bionic metaphoric lyrical math
Generating off the chronic
By cooling in the dark path and the drug rath of the ath
And the ill shit that I craft
It's labeled as sick logic to the critics of the didicks
But they don't know the half of the half
The apperatus status of a maddisist
I conqure up a new style puffin' ganja, over the hook 
Causin' more trama with my mouth then the stealth bomber
Killing every style in the book
Like it's goin' outta style tomorrow

I drop the dope shit for masses and non-believers
Like spiral passes to butter finger wide receivers

Zonin on cloud nineteen as the Def Squad takes you 
on another eerie place... of a dark side

To show niggaz that my style is superb 
For what it's worth I'm gettin off planet Earth 
but I gotta redefine gravity first 
So I figure  I get my guns and I bust the biggest cap 
from the demand of the trigger 
I'm equipped to dip with a knapsack 
and a survival kit, with blunts n shit (word!) 
I'm in all black, ?with a face? money 
want to double to NASA, to hijack a space shuttle 
More ages than curiosity 
I enter the backdoor with animosity (""Yeah, here's Murray!"")

Determined the time I had to be out 
I saw my prey without a second delay 
Suited up, strapped down, straight and on my way 
For five seconds to liftoff I was in the Hell 
when I escaped from the world 

I escaped from the world (4X) 

So far
I went through a Milky Way of stars 
And landed on my destination, which was Mars (whoa, shit!) 
This planet was foreign and new 
As I'm puffin on a blunt, observin the view 
To my surprise, a spaceship arrived 
Out came a Martian, with six fingers and three eyes 
He spoke a bleeky type of dialect (""Bleek, bleek bleek bleek bleek bleek"") 
but understood my form of intellect 
I said, ""I'm Keith Murray from the planet Earth 
Boy I'm psychosomatic and homicidal with a verse"" 
My hypercritical form of words busts his brains 
and then the whole atmosphere changed (""What the fuck?"")

I was surrounded by some Martians in the hut about to front 
I used my last resort, and pulled out the Blunts 
Lit it, got the whole Martian crew blitted 
So now's my chance to try to get acquitted 
I said, ""I escaped from the planet Earth 
to let my mind untwirl because I'm mad at the world 
And the murder wasn't premeditated 
My language was just mis-interpretated"" 
One acknowledge I'm right and pulled out the peace pipe 
Aight? About to set the vibes right 
He lit it with his finger, I smelled the Martian Buddha linger 
I felt good cause I released some anger 
No sooner than the cease of the herb ignite 
I was headed back to Earth at the speed of light 
Upon my return niggaz thought I was in jail 
Nah kids, I escaped from the world

Keith Murray,"Y'all mythalogical niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming in your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
Come to hit you with this edition, it's all brand New
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who who who
So who, who
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black, with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat up everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world

Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya

Spur of the moment opponents is suspects
Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech-
Niques, I speak my concepts freak
The ichi ni san shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, hoking, scoping
Waitin for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like a organic compound
That's the weight of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound
I represent my clique, like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown
Freaking the funk in any throw down
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya

I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damage an amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger, from the double edged banger
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity
I eternally, get in you

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that

Stored in my attic  for any crazy bastard 
It's all in the mind  when the E drops a rhyme 
My freakin frame is like a pair of Calvin Klein's 
I drop flows through Customs, and get sniffed out 
Like I stole somethin when I'm bustin 
I'm Don of mic with this shit

Erick Sermon got funk for days, for those who want to 
Backstab me in the back, like the O'Jays!

ARRRRRRRRGH! I still rock with My Adidas 
With Run-D.M.C. and Jay, my niggaz packin heaters 
So get off, get off, and if you want the real scoop 
On the E Double, check the sounds!

In my dreams, I'll be gettin away drivin a hearse 
So when I get to hell, I'm stabbin up the devil first 
And leavin the skull decapitate his ass, catchin wreck 
Rip off his head, and shit down his fuckin neck (bitch!) 
From the little voice in my conscious 
I might just leave a crazy-ass unconscious 
And why, is a crooked letter like my alibi 
A psychic couldn't tell the science of my mind 
This man gets the wealth and y'all can all eat shit and die 
Cause I'ma gets mines, bitch!

Keith Murray,"Verse 1:
Cow will burn ya, I'm taken MC's straight under
And you can't see like Stevie Wonder (ha)
Then the black bull blown like style on the microphone
Throwin' your chromosomes like a cyclone
And commercial raps get the gun claps
A wack on the ground of the head with my ill skill raps
I'm a kill me a crazy motherfucker tonight
Step out the light nocturnal to the night (word 'em up)
Your sight will put you in fright (word) and none of you want to fight
Cause my game is mad tight aiight
Yo E this might be my last album son (hell no)
Cause niggas trying to play us like crumbs nobodys 
I'm a fuck around and murder everybody
And get crazy buckwild with the shottie
You couldn't see me if you weighed 500 million karrots
Cause I'm sychosymatic

Hook:
Ooh I might lose my lose (x4)

Verse 2:
I'm from the dirtiest stinkiest part of Long Island 
But in every corner of the world my style be wilding
And I'm dead serious even though I may be smiling
I'm conshadier antagonizing character in back of the hoodie
Coming to get you for your goodies
So if your 2-2-4-5 technozzels think y'all can creep
But Keith Murray ain't losing no sleep
I'll man handle and dismantle your mandel down to your thorax
On wax with a bloody axe
But on the real for the real the real I build on Capital Hill
And ill cause of skill
Breakin' shit up with degrees like a Count Crackula 
In fact the factor is compound fractures (uh)
For every action there's a reaction (yeah) 

Hook (x4)

Verse 3:
We are the world! I'm shakin' and bakin' and takin' 
Niggas down to swirls and twirls
I'm runnin' them off the ball like Earl and Pearl (uh)
This is a basic general classic situation
Can't nobody see me in God's creation
I steps it up from inspiring expectation with funk illustrations
You can thunk justifications 
Perhaps you would like me to make the biscuit callap (pow!)
And make your lungs collapse
You represent he represent I represent
The sick bizarre twist is that I torment in my performance (uh)
Kickin' brain twitchin' (yeah) 
My yobic topics, niggas be like ""Stop it, you got the illiotics!"" (yeah",Sychosymatic,1994
Keith Murray,"You better recognize what. 
Snatchh your fuckin' head from your neck.

Techs to your record son. Shit. 
Fuck that shit. 
Word 'em up that how we're always been.

Yo check it, I feel the vibe like Shanet
Collaborate on niggas brains and bend you ass like a Sinse'
My death sentense is danger
I black out like Joe Ripken niggas hittin' the floor like the chamber
The sick authorist transmits for no repent
And activate the plan the Pentagon inelligents
So listen close like musical chairs
The L.O.D. is deep then the niggas Under The Stairs
I crack million dollar script like an archetict
And execute like the chair when I inflict death
I got the creepiest slang in this galaxy
And wreck the industry so mysteriously
Coming with the funk from beneath I creep straight for juggelars
And twist rap caps for all you motherfuckers
Walk the bloody streets with 19 shots in the lueger
Niggas be scared to face 50 Grand like Medusa
The shit I produce is like gin and juice when it blend
Scenes from Toni Braxton you'll Never Breath Again
I rhyme without ability to reason, niggas is guilty of treason
Who's to blame but the Legion to the Doom

With punk niggas we got beef so
(L.O.D. about to take it to the streets)
On the mic we definatly got beats so
(L.O.D. about to take it to the streets)

Roy Jay go the wickedest mystic magestic flow
From a homicidal clique, Yo E make that psycopathic mix
I hits for the hecks or the shit that causes conflict in the script
Beeotch my style set on fire to touch Venus
My soul seeks the universe while I'm sleepin'
I'm creepin' makin' myself develop with the chronic
Electronic Million Dollar Man the mic bionic
So you can feel it in your nerves when I blast off into the suburbs
Conduct like ? with electrofying words
I freak to them suicidal tracks break backs
Niggas scarred fakin' fuckin' heart atttacks
Oooh when I'm comin' through the crowd
Niggas want static yo I got the gun pazoow, wizoow, word up

Fuck that shit

The moderation incobation of my creation
Is instantaniously with my vocabulation accumulation
Trust me as I bust thee, lyrical homicidal shit from Keith Murray
If I had twenty four hours to live and one wish
I wouldn't wish for no damn lifesavers
I'd start going wild like Larry Davis
The funk speach vigalante from the L.O.D.
Gets funky freakly and freaky fluently
And deep as Greek mythology on level Z
Theres six million ways to die
And eight million stories in the naked city and all them shits are lies
So I keep my wittiest ironist hidious
Psychosis bloodiest flow decitious
Comin' from out this orbit deep space 9's wiggle my shit
Meltin' crew down like synthetic acid

Call four-one-one cause I'm Ghetto Red Hot
Bo bo bo! Funk Doctor Spock catch a bruisin

I come rollin in when I see that low flow
Heckuva foe, heard a gun and settled for a metaphor
I'm naive between the sleeves of the sheets
Murderin, who should ever try to fuck with me
Murray word is bond gets it on
And ready to blow any nigga out the cypher of the sniper hype at dawn
Long live Def to the Squad
And we smokin everybody out there, shit it ain't that hard
I brings classic drama microphone enbalmer
Have your momma beg behind bars for your kidneys tomorrow
My murderous apprentice E Dub
Makes hard funk beats that I become part of

The east to the west 
Up north to the down south 
Live wires connect 
So if you swangin' on thangs 
(Keith Murray, UGK and oh my Lord Jamar) 
Or down to gangbang, or waitin' on the train 
It's still the same thang 

You cut your mind and your body with the rhyme and the shotty 
Go and find me or hidin', with wine and Bacardi 
Get down like John Gotti then I gotta get lost 
I'm gone in the wind 
My momma keep on tellin' me there's Bun in the sin 
I guess I'm hell-bound destined 
To learn my lesson, sess in my chestin' 
It burn but I keep on puffin, no bluffin' 
They don't call me Big Bun for nothin' 
No homeboys you come dead, well put em to rest 
Bumba clocks em all dead, wit two in his chest 
Botty bwoy you come dead, and if in all die 
Will you run dead em again? Well go on buddy let em fly 
That's how it is in my city, and your city 
Sir it gets no prettier just more gritty per capita, all around 
From the five boroughs on down to the mighty Bro town

Now watch this current rock it current for a sentence 
For a triple homicide, cripple any drama that reside in the mind 
Of those livin' outside of my state line 
Let em know we all the same kind 
With the same crimes, catchin' the same time, which translates to hang time 
Organized gangs slangin' dime 
Lord Jamar is black G-zuz, I sees this 
Everywhere I go, brothers hustlin' to make the doe 
Fast or slow, ya want to see your cash grow 
Like grass, but meanwhile take a blast of the el 
And let the smell resonate, never hesitate 
When it comes to puttin' food on your plate 
Devise schemes by all means 
Like a sunrise when it beams, keep your eyes on the cream 
Live wires on the team Connect, get respect for they realness 
I know you feel this 

[Chorus]

Uhh, now who that tryin ta claim they be thumpin' 
That's only when your funky little fake tape be bumpin' 
You can catch a square and get done unfair 
Because aah, I'll be there, I'll be right there 
Cocoa butter, got that, make em all for 
Real life hustler movie maker, I know how y'all feel 
But long as I'm alive I'ma do the right thing 
And block out this stress my past criminal life might bring 
The only way I use to nip it in the bud 
Was ta try and put some bullets in some of you joker's guts 
I got victims, G it ain't about the face you make 
It's all about the place you take between yourself and snakes 
Now everybody open up your arms for the cocoa-

Killer with scrilla, they be missin' me with the bomb breakin' 
'Cause I gets busy like no cornwheat

I'm tryin' ta stack paper, these pigs can't stand me 
It's all about my family, it's all about my candy 
It's all about the crush, all about the feelin' good 
All about the rush, all about us, the first family 
Somethin' that a young fool never really planned to be 
But funny situations, do bring change 
And young fools do out here in this wicked game 
That's how I'm gon' starve when fools eatin' steak 
Man, I can't stop now, too much money out here to make 
Now you could turn your nose up and you can suck your teeth 
But I gotta get this money, ain't nobody gonna get it for me 
And I might have to do shady things 
Stick up kid all out, no shame 
Run your rings, ear ring in change 
Don't make me give it to ya 'cause it ain't no thang 
I do it for the glory man, cuff the thangs 
I gotta let em hang, I'm stuck in '87 tryin' to regain my brain 
Too many undercovers know my name 
A phone line like fire 'cause I'm a live wire

And we bustin' on all you losers 
Ridin' twenty-deep in two black Land Cruisers 
Recognize or get paralyzed with the drum 
Where I'm from they promise you a fair one, then blast you with the gun 
And everybody standin' around like it's funny 
Junior L.O.D pickin' your pockets for your money 
The checkered, I slide off and make a funky record about it 
No more than four minutes and some seconds 
And live wire connected, from my peoples on the street who respect it 
And the jeeps, hoopties, Benz and Lexus 
My squad stretches from New York to Portland to Texas 
Let's see who's next to test this 
Some herbs, ready to get their heads served 
To the hard curb

All ya`ll bummin niggaz will get done in
My Squad comes in all shapes, sizes and colors

All you niggaz seem to hate us but your baby`s mothers love us
I`m the grand royal, hard to wear and tear
Rap specimen, pissin on all you mere peasants

With virtuality, poetry I successfully
Bring crews agony in virtual reality
See, first I puzzle your brain like The Riddler
Then, I catch you in the gut like Jack the Ripper

I`m the hot mustard dipper, money getter, mic gripper
Wack MC get rid of nigga
I take it to the extreme, and overkill like Dramamine
Y`all niggaz is sweet like jellybeans

Plus I knew your punk ass was soft
I see you in the street, you try to talk my fuckin ear off
I`m the high wrecka, mic checka
Wilin out like Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Chorus]

I got def-ly breath control, with sick vocabulary making MC`s nervous.
Boy I`ll do you plenty
Which MC is in my category, if any, not many
See you thought like Nellie, now you shit like jelly

After the surgeon is finished stitchin' up that belly
Niggas want to get ill, I`ll take it to stainless steel
And show em how it feel
You laugin' at Keith? You`re crying at yourself

'Cause beef with Keith is bad for your health
Them bitch ass niggaz tried to catch me for my self
I licked nine shots and jetted off in my Stealth

[Chorus]",Call My Name,1996
Keith Murray,"1000 degrees Hot

Continuously, yeah
Who's that crazy nigga
Drinkin crazy pussy out of crazy straw
Kicking crazy hardcore, crazy metaphors
When I rap competitions perform disappearing acts
Niggas ask why the Squad be on it like that
Cause we stay with the lethal dosage
Click on the Mic MC's run like roaches
Truthfully I think them niggas is gay
Always havin a party with no DJ
I had to hold my head in disbelief
Them short winded niggas tried to smoke the chief
Of the frontal leaf Keith
Knowing damn well they can't win
My style is rougher than army gear and old timb
The east coast say ill
The west coast say ill
My squad is def they don't give a fuck
They say kill
Cause we can all sing together
That's why I pack the black gat up under the leather
And keep it hot

It's 96 degrees in the shade, 1000 degrees

I got nuts like Almond Joy, like Mounds you don't
I say and do a lot of things some fake rappers won't
Now I'm the show shocker plus the show stopper
Down with makin G's and all the block clockers
Down with L.O.D., the motherf-ing cop droppers
Down with Def Squad flying through your hood in choppers
Yeah we done been in more shit in the past year
Than the bloods and crips care to hear
Ear to ear, glock to hand, Mic to mouth, resuscitation
Psychosomatic creation
Killing off the nation of perpetration
Player hating, bringin confrontation
I'll shoot your hips up and make you bogle like Jamaicans
I'm doing my thing, if you feel me do your thing
y'all niggas know my style
I smoke weed on trains and planes
Murderous material submerging from my brain
Chumpin top dollar niggas into small change
And make it hot

It's 96 degrees in the shade, 1000 degrees

I'm the unfuckwitable incredible lyrical individual
Boy your not suitable
I work wonders over the beats
It's no wonder phony MC's pee the bed
Relax your head
accommodations and compliments of the infrared
Theoretically, hypothetically, practically
Actually ain't nobody fucking with me
I'll sell your stupid ass the Brooklyn Bridge
If you think an MC in your camp can fuck with the kid
I want the sun not to shine for six months, to see who fronts
While the Squad light up the sky with blunts
If you catch a nigger dreaming
Thinking he can fuck with my enterprise
Wake him up, smack em, make him apologize
Cause we be on their lemonade type shit
I ain't no faggot but you derelicts can suck my dick
I make it hot

Keith Murray,"Intro: 
If heads only knew!

Verse 1:
I Make music of murder and mayhhem for all of them
And murder ballads for sweet chariots
My second return like a unstoppable bullet
With wings my ears ring your name when you speak of me in vein
Enter the center like a big bread winner
So L.O.D. can eat that ass up for dinner
I come with high potent deadly quotin'
Avenue corrodin' street life shit to get you open
Niggas pullin' stunts like Jackie Chan
Not knowin' that they fuckin' with the demolition man
I'm seen on screens and magazines
Pump, pump (don't sleep) but peace to Queens
I hollar Allah you Akhbar my peeps hold me down
In the roughest pair of Timbs that ever touched the ground
Huhh how's about a broken jaw
It's Keith Murray and I'm comin' in with the raw metaphors

Hook:
When I'm alone in my room
Sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind
I hear my conscience call
Keith Murray 

Redman:
Rock, rock on

Keith Murray:
Original rules, original rules, original rules X2

Verse 2:
Now heere we go again soundin' crazy but it's contagious
The sickest entertainer puttin' your brain though strainers
We smokes the choc', don't be afraid of the dark
Mentals get hit brain cells spark
Pappers swear they got the dopest jam on the shelf
But they don't believe that shit they own goddamn self
Last year I was underrated but I stay dedicated
I'm so dedicated I close my eyes I'm incarerated
Niggas was amazed at the shit you was kickin'
But all you did was adobo the chicken
I""m taking over like the psychic network
I got the drop on all you niggas out there claimin' that you do dirt
But the truth hurts and it kills you to listen
Like the sound of hollow point tip bullets whistlin'
Every little breath you take
Every little gesture you make
Every little jack you fake
I be the expert mic gladiator
Pop shit on records I'll cut your fingers off later

Hook X2

Verse 3:
Pump the new smash platium single the thug star spangled banner
Illustratin' grammer in a hostile manner
Texas chainsaw cuts hard to the core
Makin' sure they don't try to battle me no more
You seem to believe all you need is a rhyme and a dream
To defeat the all time great microphone supreme
But wake up 'cause you playin' with the game of death
I'll smoke your body ashes in a blunt and leave no evidence left
Straight ashes ashes, dust to dust
I got you in my clutch there's nothing further more to discuss
And it's scary though when the eeriest voice on the radio
Is in your hometown doin' the show
With the technique that I'm usin' choosin'
abusin'
Got more flow than D'Angelo crusin'
With poisonous venom Oh my God I get in em'
Turn 'em out give 'em something good to talk about 

Hook",Manifique (Original Rules),1996
Keith Murray,"Verse 1

Now for next to little or nothin' I be rippin' up every function
with scientifical mad man consumptions
with mass productions of mass conjunctions
I display new ways of mc destruction
'cause ain't nothin' better than the shit I got 
makin' niggas jump off the roof and roof-tops
I put the hip in hop and the don't in stop and the clips in glocks 
when I rock box your block
my hypothesis on this is you niggas better come in terms of my vocabulary quick
or get dissed
my brain bleeds mental complex feeds
bring it on kid I got exactly what you need
twisted metaphors to get your shit in star wars
live forever like Bob Marley just because
the mad matador metaphor rips the hard core 
for him and his them and theirs you and yours

chorus:

And it beez like that sometimes
cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
we keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy 
cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
and it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

Verse 2:

the most beautifullest vocabulist
punches phony mc's dead in their esophogaus
my analysis is roughly calloused
you better practice if you want to challenge this
I'm symbolic to the sun moon and stars
you gettin' knocked out the box no matter who you are
the funk phat tracks lures you to listen
as my vocals send your brain up in the fetal position
learn a quick lesson of mic aggression
so when I walk down the street there'll be no second guessing
now you can walk the walk talk the talk
back burnin' all day but your still fireproof like an ashtray
I'm a scientist in the mix like Plyx
turnin' all you fly emcees back into maggots
non prop soil watch me bubble and spoil
punch you Grand Royal as you foam like boil
 
Chorus

verse 3:

I played the many thousand roles of street life 
showed Whodini that the freaks come out in broad daylight
me and my crew be tight like Lavren and Shirley
rollin' through all ya'lls hoods pullin all ya'lls fly girlies
emcee's always bitch, that makes my style all hard
I role with nobody but God and the Squad
me and my troops we knock the shit out the sides of dudes
lettin the OJ juice loose on phat tracks E-d produced

Lookin' like the creature from the Black Lagoon
There's gonna be a 187 real soon
If some niggas don't give me some elbow room
I'm runnin with the Legion of Doom
Like a pack of wolves foamin at the mouth on full moon
I track range between space and time
And push back like receding hair lines
That's the essence of the effervescence
At this melodic dynamic shit progresses
A mic murderer for hire
As I sit back and watch your little gimmick backfire
Under the circumstances in any order of events
I be with sick niggaz rollin' thick
Dissin the system got America mad at me
Like my name was O.J. Simpson

My style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip
So fuck all that sensuous shit
The astronomical is comin through like the flu bombin you

People wonderin' if I'm a start some shit
Prisoner of the media very often
Cause people be blowin shit out proportion
False information and bogus arithmetic
Got everybody stuck on stupid, misinterpreting shit
How could I? Why should I damage my career?
Over a nigga that'll probably bust me out of fear
Don't let your mouth get you into somethin that your ass can't get out

Caution: code red
I could kill you now but instead I'm a put this thought into your head

And laughin at these clown ass niggaz like they funny
The grand imperial with milky material
I be the surprise in the bottom of your cereal.
One thing I gotta say my Squad never lost it
Unlike you corny MC's out there who Farrah Fawcett
Can't rhyme runnin your mouth all the time
While Def Squad sit back and enterprise perfect crimes
Got the Funk Lord squeezin the life out of keyboards
While each MC tear the frame out of mic chords
Yo I was in the bullpen with them niggas pullin heists
Grown ass men crying like little mice, but I'ma bounce true indeed
Cause punk ass only bagged me with two ounces of weed

The Mr. Pictionary
The Mr. quicck to fuck shit up in a hurry
ON the mic I'll squash you little Ms. Philosoophy
With atomic technological atrocity
I find it very ironic that niggas try to rhyme behind me
The supersonic Def Squad MC
Get bird's eye view
And don't miss the crispiest nigga in the nucleus
With futuristic linguistics
Ballistics be twisted like physics (word up) 
Niggas be like how you come up wit this shit
But it's automatic, I'm inorganic
With the ability to travel nine planets
Niggas can't undrstand it, please
I spark the brain of your G's
We could battle for car keys and car titles
House deeds and bank accounts to make it final
I got what you need
The most homicidal words to co9me out of a human being
Mind state sick like Idi Amin

You can do what ya got to 
And say what you may
But niggas gonna come outside wit gun play anyway
So I play the game

Instead dare iz a dark side said by Red
I'm consciously, crusciously coming for your head
I'm from a small coast call stay out my path
And from a big city called foot up in your ass

By the sneakiest, throughout the speakers
Like fist to cuffs
Who the fuck is this paging me?
Oh, it's my creepy, greepy, grimy
Rough rhyme, crimy Reggie, I'm saying 
Fuckwho, went where, when, why and how
Get my shit to me not now but right now
Lucky niggas went platinum
Thinkin' they can see us
We swoop down on crews
Like angels on dust
I'll leave you mental so broke
You can't pay attention
When I get inside your head
And take your brain to another dimension
I'm itching for a scratch
And somebody to try to match
The battle cat constatly be on it like that
The doom has dawned in
We knockin' niggas out without warning
And pissing on them
The configuration is brain cell wastin' 
Renegades of funk
Like Africa Bambatta and the Zulu Nation
You facin' a maniac
Pacing over the track
Constantly bringing drama like Jason
In fact I'm L.O.D.ing it and there go planet Def Squad
Puttin' it down play for play like Ahmad Rashad
For the cause, I""m wiring jaws
Got niggas eating full-course meals out of crazy straws
And if it win't def it ain't shit
I'm taking it to the limit
And killing it each and every minute
Cause Keith Murray takes the beef a major step higher
And peace makers will get causght in the cross fire
Hip Hop's filled with back stabbers
Blunt grabbers, cats with dirty claws, dogs with filthy paws
Then you got rap artists
Claimin' to be the hardest
Bust them in their shit
And they're quick to press charges
Spot rushers, block busters, rockin' diamond clusters
Comin' to stick the rich out you motherfuckers

Keith: On my way to JFK 
Announcer: Final boarding for flight 655 at Gate 14
Keith: I don't want of ya
       I'm on my way to LaGaurdia
       I'm on my way home or away, JFK (2x)

Hey yo, anywhere I go I definitely reo for mine
Cause I'm constantly in a Def Squad state of mind
I went to New Orleans and kept it clean
Spitting, splitting rappers at they seams for the cream
By all means
Although I seen the green wasn't enough
I jumped in the Lexus, went to Texas, pulled a royal flush
Feelin like Tony Atlas, up in Dallas
Rhymacutin with them niggas who be shootin up in Houston
And do remember I get in ya in Virginia
Swept N.C. and S.C freeze the West Indies
Oh and I'm going back to Indiana and Alabama
Did the ink pad bounce through Atlanta
I be rapidly runnin through chocolate cities
Like Philly, D.C., Cincinnati, and M.D.
And Jersey, Lord have mercy
Can't nobody serve me cause my world be free

CHORUS:
Goin around the world, goin around the world
All around the world, goin around the world
Goin around the world cause my world be free
Goin around the world (3x)

Cause my world be free
Then I was touching ground Uptown
As my rings gleamed in Queens
As I cooked it up in Brooklyn for all the friends
Kentucky was lucky I had to much Hennessey
When I was representing love love Tenessee
Kansas City, Missouri can speak upon the glory
St. Louis can even tell the story
Of how I dropp shit thick and cold like the snow in Chicago
A major up in Ohio, I was pack with cactus tactics
Up in Phoenix, Arizona set shit on fire in Oklahoma
Niggas had their ears pinned to the ground listening
When I was stomping through Detroit, Michigan
You hear me sounding crispy looking all scandalous
Swervin in the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles
Don't even ask the question did I visit Africa
Shit I warmed it up in Alaska, smashed Nebraska

CHORUS (3x)

From interstate to tri-state to international
Mr. Keith Murray always keeps it classical
They had me up in England, mic stranglin
Jewels danglin while my single jingle jangling
Number one in my field, never defeated
Went to Sweden demonstrated malicious mic beatings
I was with my right hand man, Redman
When I did the Ichiban crane style in Japan
I transform like Dr. Bruce Banner
Stepped off the plane and blacked out up in Canada
I'm a million dollar man like Lee Majors
Fucked around and hit the jackpot up in Vegas
Yeah handin out vapors like bad news
Yo I be everywhere puttin down y'all
It's Def Squad y'all know my plans",World Be Free,1996

all the issues in my life keep holdin' me back 
can I live up to the standard seems so hard to do

You ask me child do u love me

T-ree F Squad
Muddy Waters
Don't get it twisted nigga

Aiyyo everybody in this motherfucker will get touched
Fuck such and such, I roll tight like handcuffs
Rock that ass to sleep with discrete techniques
I beez that, freak of the week like I made Knee Deep
Hold up! Rotate around the solar, badder than Cobra
Composure never sleeps, my stream pumps Folgers
I'm sauteein MC's with fried rice up in the wok
Without the MSG and chopped celery
See, I made it, my flavor situated
From the nickel plated mic that's hot, to leave your brain inflated
Plus, I'm thick like Quakers on papers
Bodacious MC's get turned to lower cases
Lettering, and the medicine, that I'm swallowin
Get you hollerin, like Marvin Gaye when his father shot him
In the chest, I roll with two stacks of Tecs
And mad niggas in sets that'll roll up in your rest
UHH! Mister Fantastic's crafted off that 50 sack of ass kick
When I'm blasted, my mathematics get drastic
That you can't see with bifocals
Watchin MC's go up and down like stock brokers
I leave your brains on tilt, with ill skills that's milk
That's rougher than jeans that Gloria Vanderbilt
I'm poppin mad shit, plus I can back it
Your man'll be like ""Yo, get that dust off yo' jacket""

It ain't a test or quiz that my Squad can win
Those who know the biz, know we wreck kids, get biz
You'll digest, multiple stab wounds to the chest
Then I copycat, kill the rest
With no method to my madness
Bless the apparatus with the baddest
Determined to be the last man, standin on the planet
You'll get attached, like a blood suckin' leech
When you fall into my rhythm of speech
Your ears get embraced with a touch of the bass
Head get wrapped up, neck get thrown in a neck brace
Rough rhyme mechanical, lyrical at it who?
Will ironically chronically murder you and your crew
My directive, through where I live, is kinda primitive
See I get to the bottom of the problem, and make shit give
Step in the jam, hooded and high, plastered the master
Cast to the masses grabs the mic
Ten dollar rappers is what L.O.D. goes after (Tweek, Tweek)
To my Squad, there's no matches, we bashes
Do photo flashes in all flavor S-classes
Bomb attack on wax, lyrical mini mac to your back
Tie you up, throw you in the Ac'
A public figure, who walks around with a jaded jigger
Cause I gives a fuck about another nigga, word up

Muddy Waters, yo this is the way that my intro should go
Drunk slow funk flow for Reggie Noble
Fuck with me doe, Mally G doe it's not logic
Playin that big shit get broke down microscopic
Bring it back keep the track ringin, with the bassline
It's major when you savor my flavor, can you taste mine
Face the nine I lace your spine with short fat pace
Around and round, avoidin the time to put it down
Now's the time here yeah

Clown where, pick a spot
Neutral grounds or not, we give a fuck, lick a shot

Gangsta, so called killin, cap peelin
Playalistic, I mean is all that shit realistic
Play your cards God, black keep your hand held tight
Night fall might call your life, shit is trife
On these evil streets after dark
Niggas gettin sparked left and outlined in chalk
New day, seriously this whole shit's twisted (is it man)
It's me bombin on these niggas shitlist and Mally G
Open your eyes to see, recognize who be a G
Hopin to rise in thee, industry with E
The villain's had it cause ahead (word up yeah)
Killin my psychosomatic pattern mad (yeah)

Keith Murray,"Taking you to the other terrain, we mash strictly for the cream
Here to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin team
Little 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me
You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us
Def Squad niggaz prophesize like the Perseus
Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back

Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
with a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
you start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
raw water turn sons to grandaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha!  I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter

Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it
And Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)
Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife


Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
a hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back

For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
lineups, on LSD fine fust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerillas

If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!

I bring dat physical front(aha)
Believe it I function the paraplegic
So teach it like if he was playin backgammon
A new sheriff in town and not reggie hammond
I pack a cannon .38 snuff nose
Not for shootin use it for executin
Lames out there callin my name
For fame,change ya plan punk refrain
This tune leaves ya whole crew stuck or stupid
Dumb and dumber all this summer
A newcomer,yeah I take em to check out the avenue
Me and my crew went through
Wooh!ah-ah!word is born!word is born!

I said ""come on!""(come on!),""come on!""(come on!)
We's the posse pair so some niggas can get done on
I'm not the one to funnel,I'm lyrically inclined
Seriously devine,whatever we g is crime
Ha!I take it down,make it clear and in your bare lair
Leaving critical as sang elsewhere
You want to get jig-dafied-what it all means
For such,I tote glocks in akarl jeans
For all means necer-ssary,my blood vessels

Next up I believe that's keith
Why don't ya get on the mic and rock the symphony

Well it's the 16-bar slaughterer,telepathical brain murderer
Comin with the sh-t you never heard
Ask yourself the very same question
Which crew is fuckingg with this squad in this profession
Your mic's in my possession,I crush you with aggression
An' I ain't talkin for niggas that learn a lesson
So why should I sit around and let this fake fuck pass my eye
Fake niggas fuckingg up my eye
Filthy with nasty it's the slog for the job
Forget any clan said ""who squad the mob?""
Tired of beat-down,shot up and robbed
Niggas askin why,it's my motherfuckin job
How many ways can I say ""I just don't give a fuck!""
Runnin niggas over in every truck
But my motto is ""fuck!get the bottle!pass the bottle!""
Bad luck had ya stuck,uh
I crash ya brain and smash ya spine
Yeah another hard one to find

Keith Murray,"It was December 24 on hollis after the dark
My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man
Word up

Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

And the seeds it gets me high to fly, I ain't bullshittin
You can ask Bill Clinton, he could verify that

Yeah, like that y'all/Yeah word up (""I... get lifted"")
Roll/Puff the Phillie and get
Roll/Puff the ziggy and get (""Fire up this funk, fire up this funk"")

Step into this intersection and take this rap
I got a vicious plot but first take me by the weed spot
I do this for my niggaz locked down runnin capers
Smokin herb, and the bible papers
But how does it feel when you got no fire?
And kyant pass fi dutchie pon de leffhand side
What the fuck?  Who the fuck want to fuck
with the six shot shooter, I murder you over buddha
What I discuss'll bust a rhyme style nucleus
And roast them ghostes, puffin hocus pocus
So kid, pass that bomb trom word bond
So I can toke it with more wins than a python
Different Strokes for different folks
He like the chocolate thai
you like to float with the green skunky smoke
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Laid back hypnotized to the funky sound, word

Keith Murray,"Yo  you think them niggas out there impress me? 
Don't none of that shit impress me 
Oh  I'm supposed to listen cause they on the radio? 
Psh  I'm ready 

I got  nothin' to lose in the world to gain 
I leave you slain and make your family relocate and change their names 
Like the West coast say  I'm bout the macolay
Niggas be slippin' when I be flippin' and I'll see you next trip 

Cause revenge is a motherfucker payback is a bitch 
Especially when I'm coin with that Def Squad click 
Can you relate to an intense, motherfucker 
Gridiron mic cuffer, terror to the jugular 
Smother all the others, punk motherfuckers 
But I'ma keep it real, cause me and you is brothers 
It'll happen so fast boy you won't stand a chance 

Cause the L.O.D. put in work like red ants 
And when I walk by Curtis Mayfield'll draft 
And spell the full limp love is just like Shaft 
Shit I craft, is harder than Chinese math 
Plus I lay you down for standing on Dangerous Ground 

[Chorus]
Aye yo you're standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown 
Let's see if you know the bounds 
I said you're standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown 
Let's see if you know the bounds 
Aye yo y'all standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown 
Let's see if you know the bounds 
Yo kid you standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown 
Let's see if you know the bounds 

Let's embark on this mission like Black Indiana Jones 
is eatin' Pookie sandwiches and smokin' chronic bones 
See I kill it a little, then leave it alone 
Let my man 50 G drag it into his zone 

Now 50 Grand's in the room and Legion of Doom 
And if you sayin' Def Squad's the bomb then I'll assume 
It's takes brain splittin' compositions, makin' incisions 
Dranin' the blood up out silly niggas, like morticians 

Now I'ma mack out and pimp the rhythm like Too Short and Dru Down 
And wait for what go around to come around 
And beat it in the head with this, send em off into the unknown 
In and out of consciousness, kind of like 
a hip-hop microphone hypnotic 
Specialist in gettin inside artists, sick word analyst 
World's most foul freestylist 
c'mon man y'all niggaz know y'all can't get with this 

[Chorus]

And kill the noise playboys cause we have no flaws 
We employ hits the whole family can enjoy 
I'll be masterin' the Funk like Flex, mentally 
Etchin' and Sketchin', speakin' with my hands like Terminator X and 
scheme and get choked out like Radio Raheem 
My team'll put you to sleep and let you dream 
I'm not down with the East West coast controversy 
Me say you you say me, across the country makin' millis 
I'll be glad to see a brother get paid for hard work 
But instead y'all steady tryin' to ditch up the dirt 

Yeah niggas still tryin' to toss salt in the game 
And y'all done read my name graffitied in the walls of fame 
Let me explain niggas die for fame in this game my name's 
like a migraine, rappers get banged out the frame 
See some funny style niggas in the house tonight 
With posses too thin to win, and too light to fight 
Think twice 

[Chorus]

I had the last watch and y'all niggas on the corner pumpin' gas 
Nervous like you lyin' to a polygraph 

Come see a real show, cut off your flow, killin' you slow 
One time for L.O., I'm like a thief, in your window 

Or catch us in the streets, herdin' like cattle 
Defeatin' rappers without contracts and battles, swingin' like Mickey Mantle 

Niggas trippin' like they want to be me

I be killin it (why Tash?) cause I be feelin it 
I get money so no need for stealin it 
I work diligent beneath the Earth's soil 

where I write rhymes so fresh it's like I wrapped my styles in foil 
But I sit at home and boil spicy rum when it's freezing 
Cause I from the Likwid crew where we got drinks for every season 
Maybe that's the reason why I live high all July 

And the place I buy my beer is callin in for more supply 
Maybe not, maybe so, maybe yes, maybe no 
Maybe niggaz got some friends that want to battle for some dough 
If you know somebody holla, cause I take those extra dollars 

Split that shit with J and Swift, buy a ninety-six Impala 
and lace it with the deez out my own stack of cheese 
Get a extra flossy floss and toss King Tee the keys 
and say, 'Nigga that's yours, cause you opened up doors 

Before Tha Liks had a deal, you had a nigga on tour 
So God bless ya, never let this rap pressure test ya 
You know who got your back when them other niggaz sweat ya' 
So check uno dos while I roast this coast a toast 

When it comes to beats and rhymes, you know who got the most 
I be killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it) 
Tha Liks rock that shit that have all ya niggaz feelin it

Yo Xzibit (whattup Ro) I got to know 

Do I got that Likwid flow (oh fo' sho') well here I go 
Mida, mida, down the barrel of my heater 
I torch ya, then skeet out in my Porsche two-seater 
I'm from the home of rattlesnakes and golden bears 

And Astro-vans with swivel chairs hoes come in pairs 
Plus, makin money's in my genes 
That's why I got money in my jeans, I got a cravin 
My mind craves the knowledge, my pockets crave the cash 

My mouth craves the brew, and my Johnson craves the ass 
Who's on blast, Tha Liks baby, don't twist it 
Just rock it, got your girl's number in my change pocket 
What's her name Stella, if she's on me kinda hella 

?Voule vou couche vic moir? is what I tell her 
I get freaky like Friday, why dey, try to get loose 
Wack MC's are like ?brown guts?, they have no use 
I just got off the court, where I was whoopin some cats 
In basketball, here's a question that I have to ask y'all 

Who be killin it, is it the ladies? 
Who be killin it, is it the fellas? 
Who be killin it, is it the be	-boys? 
Who be killin it, is it the gangsters? 

Who be killin it, is it the rastas? 
Who be killin it, killin it, killin it, killin it... 

See I be killin it, yeah, when I be feelin it 
This is dedicated to the niggaz that be stealin shit 
Straight from the bottom of my black-ass heart 
The untamed feel no shame, on top of the game 

Mr. Big Bad Insane, black John McClane 
Look listen and learn, you only get what you earn 
So I'ma hustle like fuck regardless, watch my smoke 
Go straight for the throat, we known for rockin the boat 

It's hard to find like the grade A shit, with no cuts 
Tryin to stack like King Tut, and still bang the microphone up 
Demandin, clear lane for crash landin 
If anything I'm guaranteed to be the Last Man Standing 

Pick a number motherfucker whassup? 
The circumstance make you shit in your pants, and we advance 
As an avalanche of soul, and everything that shine ain't gold 
Just cause niggaz got brew don't make em nickel proof 

My record contract reads hit man for hire 
Xzibit showin grace under fire 
Tha Alkaholiks killin it (killin it) killin it (killin it)

Get your back up off the wall 
And you can get it, get it, get it, get it 
(repeat 4X) 
Tash: 
I heard niggaz want to know who flips the most hoes 
The R&B singers or the niggaz with flows 
So what I did was take a poll, like Clinton versus Dole 
(So the fake rappers wouldn't be out of control) 
And the more girls I asked, the more I heard 'em say 
They said they wanted balls, pussy niggaz stay away 
Good choice, 'cause Rico don't be losing his voice and no...(activator 
spraying sound) 
To make my hair look moist 
Just a sack of pommel that I got from John Dale 
'cause this is how I do it but it ain't Montel 
It's the knight in rusty armor, hardcore rap designer 
That be dissin pussy niggaz in scoops of eyeliner 
'cause look at how you dress, you think you lookin fresh 
With your leather vest wrapped around your cutie bird chest 
Keep freezing while I keep easing down the road 
'cause Tash will scoop your girl no matter what y'all niggaz sold 
Gold or double plat 
Catastrophe will have your girl butt-naked laying flat (laying flat) 
Horizontal, while I'm running all up in it 
To the rap jams, you know, that 99 beats a minute 

Party shit 
The R&B singers try to swipe 
That's why they callin me to make they remixes hype 
But I'm the type of cat to go to your show and boo ya 
Black ya, blue ya 
Then throw my tape to ya 

[Chorus:] 

[J-Ro:] 
Who the hell let the dog out the gate? 
Ready or not, here I come to set it straight 
'cause it's a thin line between love and hate 
So emcees bow down and prepare to meet your fate 
'cause these(smiling faces)smiling faces sometimes 
They want to backstab and bite my rhymes 
But I keep a pack skin tight 
You want to pen fight? 
Just give in, 'cause you know you'll never win, right? 
It ain't no sunshine in the midnight hour 
A 3-day shower couldn't wash away my soul power 
(Stop, Look, and Listen)That's the way of the world 
I turn cowboys to girls, lions to squirrels 
Is it just my imagination, or is my generation 
Fascinated by gun play and incarceration 
Peace to the departed, I get it started like A-be	 
see, It ain't nothin like the real thing baby 
I'm taking it to the streets, but the burbs is much cleaner 
(Searching for Mary Jane, man. Have you seen her?) 
Yeah. I found love on a two way street 
Now, I'm bout to roll her up in between these sheets(Say what) 
This is my message to emcees to make 'em quiver 
Signed, sealed, delivered

So, no matter where you turn, everywhere you look 
They say them Alkaholik niggaz is ""off the hook"" 
'cause, we quick to sellin rhymers to the top and pop the cork 
Got love throughout the South, got love throughout New York 
So word to my mama, Tanya, 'cause I'ma bomb ya 
With Off The Wall lyrics that hype you up and calm ya 
Damn! 'cause there's ladies up there smooth 
Pass the 40 to me man, you know the name of my group(Tha Alkaholiks)

How you gonna rhyme with all your teeth missin?(The Likwit Crew party) 
Ain't no need for actin hard 
When we pull your card, you're outta here, rules the bar 
Most rappers sound the same, they foldin too much game 
But I do know, and you know nobody beats Tha Liks 
Well, check it 
How you gonna get the ladies naked 

[Chorus(x12)]

That's that shit though
Get the motherfuckin Squad packed
We got to pull these shoes out like carpet, word is bond
Test the crew with the guns and let's get this shit on

Why, must I be like that?  Why, must I pack the gat?
On my left, niggaz be rollin with the ruckus
Ready to get deep bust rounds upon some suckaz
Heard PPP and LOD is a bunch of crazy motherfuckers
Journey to the land is on
The winner of the spittin bomb marathon
The fuck you up lyrathon, whatever you choose
prepare to lose that title
Turnin vital situations suicidal, my idols, is my Uncles
who started smokin weed outta bibles
Gave me a puff when I bust my first rifle
Men-estration cycles, I give bitches
Bring your craziest nigga, I'll give stitches
Whateva, go crew for crew, blow for blow
Bang your headpiece and sniff the snow off your hoe
I keep it rollin

Ask yourself man
How ugly do you have to be to be a hardcore MC?
Niggaz be fooled by my plaques and my light skin complexture
My whole texture is bombin, destroyin da schools of the wack
From the Land of the Lost, you get tossed
Listen to my veloc(ity), my crew's comin off
Yeah, more sneaky than casino switches
Diggin ditches for all Moskino bitches
Clockin decimal figures, I'm gettin out diggers
Now my choice of truck is a Land
cause a Landcruise much bigger
It pack two to three more niggaz
Damn I hate a golddigger
Yeah, gimme that microphone
I make opponents shit bricks like Tyson's home
I keep the jacked cellular phone blown in three zones
Love seafood and keep my nine millimis chrome
So it can shine up your dome
When I proceed to give you what you need and clear spots like Sea Breeze
Wreckin your ass armaggedeon style
Twenty four seven while
My crew chin check your profile
(Rollin)

I'm the master of disaster, super rhyme maker
Grimy by nature, database maker
Play em out like Sega, Saturn
Blow your blocks in patterns for about nine acres
Testes, crew wearin bulletproof and double S's
Karl Kani down, camoflouge can't hide the sounds
of a fo' pound (boo-yaa)
Givin you Six Flags, bustin merry go rounds
But my crew stay ill with that unreal appeal
I be the raw water, my cheek bones outta have gills
below like the opera
Smooth on the trigger for all you block cockers
I be the key to criminology
Blast and rotate enemies at three buck sixty
Pick me, as your Senator
Take the dove from your battlefield son, fuck Pat Benatar
Run, head for the hills
Back in the day, these niggaz rolled up on me with
the trunk filled with Bomber Brooklyns, sheeps and quartervilles
Aiyyo take that shit, aiyyo Money snap the grill
Body caught chills as he ate this nine mil
Mine kills two but my nine was sign sealed
And ready to deliver, but Money had me too close
to reach for toast, soon as that nigga blink I broke ghost
Dash back to South Orange Ave with dollar bill to smoke dope
I keep em rollin

Fuck hot, I'm lukewarm and still perform like a champ

Yo dial funk if you're mo' stiff than riker's isle bunks 
Get out your seat, e, spit out the beat 
The tracks plow underground concrete out the streets 
From baldies to fades, when I rock mc's wave 
More flags than puerto rican day parade 
And give up, I got the rare footage, of fiends walkin 
Barefooted off my rhyme don't dare cook it 
You might fall in to intervene 

And new jacks and they girl become pookie and that, prom queen 
That bodybag won't fit you tonight 
You want to blow up? Drop the mic, stick to the pipe 
Hand to hand my crew'll cripple your click in a fight 
Take my tapes way down south and triple the price 
Step up on the scene like whazzup? Hey suga' 
Before you cock-tease doc, how that cash put up? 
And only way I stop til your click say when 
They had enough, cause I could bump to six a.M.

Would you kill for your life? (Man listen) 
Can you get busy all night? (Man listen)

My life is a rap, each song is a flashback 
Of antagonizing anxiety attacks 
The beat hits the ground and the earth cracks 
Niggaz be like, ""oh no not them!"" yeah we back 
With rhythmatic articulation, god-forsaken 
Sick manifestations, pump pump in your face then 
The lyrical force that I put in a rhyme 
Will hit you with more power than a molecule enzyme 
No matter who what when where how I'll lay you down 
With a sick illed out fictitious style 

Yo, we all represent the hood -- the only difference 
Between us is that we make the shit look good! 
Programmable annual slammable 
You lyte as a rock and I cram to understand you
So for niggaz on a mission kissin ass and dissin'

We stack so you can spread love like I chose
The lyrical genius with the R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof we sets on fire
But as long as the party is jumpin, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody who was somebody was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year
Yeah, ay yo, come on

Baguettes on the wrist, it's just for shine
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind

You're through, I make the planetarian like Doctor Who (who who?)
So Who! (who?)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kickin rhymes til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy but I'm Back on the Block and not sellin crack
I'm comin in with the fat funk flows and tracks

Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech/niques
I speak my concepts freak
The ich-ni-son-shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, tokin, scopin
Waitin for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like a organic compound
That's the weight of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound?
I represent my clique, Microphone Pound
You better pack your leather, dope, or medication for the shakin
Meditation from the earth-to-quakin shit that we be bakin
Never fakin I gets down for my crown clown

But don't be tryin this shit at home
No matter what race creed colour him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru, and Damage an amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger, from the double edged banger (Banger!)
and turn into the microphone strangler
Stop tryin to see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must ya get bust

Why you are so afraid to fall in love

You know I don't like sweatin' you 
But something 'bout the way you make me feel 
You got me in this fantasy 
And all my friends keep tellin' me 
Shorty's kinda hot  so what's the deal? 

'Cause we been spendin', rollin', livin', showin' 
We got some time for play 
But you've been player hatin', waitin' 
For this rhyme to pass away  

You only get the best with me 
I want to give you everything 
And anything you ask of me I will

Together we could fulfill each other's life dream 
We both Gemini so we got 2 sides 
Our zodiac sign is the perfect sign 
'cause she replied, ""All Gemini's lie"" 
I guess this is what it feels like when doves cry 
Your attitude is deep cover 
Won't give me the number 
Cold play me out like a foul, a bleep or a blunder

You do your thing and I do mine

Stay out the web, 'cause once you get caught up in the web
That's it, you know?
They get you they got you good
Yo do the knowledge, take notice, stay focused
Shit is real, and it's real hard out there, for a black nigga

[Verse 1]
Ayo the way they doin me I can't stand it
Branded as a social bandit, but I'm a man and I'ma handle it
I'm not the first and I won't be the last
Just look how they did Pac and Tyson in the past
Yo at times, sometimes, I feel like I'm cursed
Because my life done went from bad to worse
Through all the stressful moments and all of the worry
I'ma still remain the same Keith Murray
Because I know deep in my heart God is on my side
If I gotta do my time, then I'ma do my time
They label you wrong, when you try to do right
And then they wonder why a con is so uptight
I'm just livin proof, of when you livin the truth
I been goin through bad times, since I was a youth
Now look, they got me locked in jail
People wonderin will I prevail or fail
But only time will tell


My mind, just now and then
Lookin down the corridors and wonders what might have been
It was a bad day

[Verse 2]
Yo, I wouldn't even stand here and lie to you, yeah it's true
All the shit that you hear about I'm goin through
And we good people at heart Jesus knows that we try
So I wonder why we get a break no time
My little sister just died, and the judge let me fry
And now I gotta kiss my lil daughter goodbye
All the pressure, make me want to grab the tech off the dresser
But understand that don't make you a man
So I address the, situation best way that I can
With a letter to the senator, from the lyrical political prisoner
That the system label a sinister
In jail while I confess my sins to the minister
It's enough to make a nigga go A-Wall
But for now I leave it in the hands of the Lord

It's a real situation we all go through
You know, unfortunately, Today was a bad day
Word, recognize, I'm no different from you
You no different from me, you know
It was a bad day

[Verse 3]
No slack for the rapper, no rest for the worried
Now everybody in the world heard of Keith Murray
When the hype dies down and reality sets in
We all goin through the same thing for a friend
And it ain't nothin good in the hood
Your own people will stab you in the back
Set you up and get you good
From the start, I came from the heart
Giuliani got the nerve to oppose the million youth march
They confiscated my passport, though I might of boated
I'm young black and dangerous that's why I got railroaded
And magazines, as if it's been misquoted, let it be noted
They can't break me to the streets I'm forever devoted

Yo
I'm tellin you man, this is life, you gotta live this life
Would you fall, would you make it, you never know
Today was a bad day
Livin proof of the truth, locked the fuck up, on some bullshit
You know, you livin, right or wrong
It was a bad day
But yo keep your shit tight, 'cause when the get you they get you good
I had a bad day
Yeah, I understand you had a bad day",Bad Day,1999

Guzzle it that's when the reaction starts
I split the chalk with the dutch
Had the hash in the greenery, then the L get sparked
Keith Murray's never smokin on babith
Niggas give me dirt and I throw it in the garbage
Actual facts, writin exact, sacks of African Black
I smoke two back to back
I smoke so much I choke out fire alarms
With the towel under the door feel the effect of the bar
Put Visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Looked in the mirror, said to myself yo you high as hell
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
Inahle it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound*, blow it out yo nose

CHORUS: Repeat lines 11-14 2X

Me and the Funk Doctor Spot up top on the hop
Block two big jig hot shots coppin mots
Seasons slice precise, ice 'n' tights
Chickenheads that circle the block twice
If you chokin then pass 'cause it's not a game
Bitches hit my blunts and never feel the same
They start actin strange and kinda erotic
I try to tell her you ain't nothin bout no chronic
Ahh drats I think I'll take a long walk
And light a fat one up for the sargeant general of New York
Who determine gettin lifted kill brain cells maybe
If it wasn't for weed, niggas would be goin crazy
So smell it from afar, comin from the bar
Or rushin out when I open up the car door
Whether home or party in a bag or a jar
Put that lah in the air and represent with a stand form

CHORUS 2X

I'm not sayin I'ma a pothead, 'cause I'm not
I'm just sayin that I smoke a lot
Catch me in V.I.P. smokin with Dennis Scott
Or after the show in the parkin lot
I only buy weed from a selective few
'cause niggas is wicked and they will get you
I ran outta blunts got some paper from your mother
She had extra weed so we rolled another
No doubt, I hear you out
Before I roll my L, I think the cancer part out
I'ma kite 'cause I missed the buddah spot before the flight
And damn we gon be away for like 12 nights
So here I am in Amsterdam gettin high again
You know what, come to think of it, yo, I'd love a Heineken
Inhale it through your mouth, freeze like you froze

Starving' so bad that my stomach touched my back
Anywhere that I went yo I didn't know how to act
Oh his chain is phat 
Fuck that snatch that flash the gat 
When all I really wanted to do was rap (1,2 y'all)
I've been preparing for this moment for years so step back
Cla clack take that catch a heart attack
I am the illest MC on the streets today
But fans say wack rappers shouldn't come my way
But I say
I destroy crews like an AK
Well OK please explain why you talk this way
Cause you can sell a million records and be wack (word up)
You can have mad skills and don't sell jack
It got my brain racin', heart pacin', fightin' incarceration
On the Internet in front of the whole nation
In front of the judge with a grudge and no budge

And it ain't no mystery people know the history behind me
And if you don't ask somebody on the street
But Murray never worry the girls love me very
Make a hit record quick fast in a hurry
Total captivation domination with conversation
That'll be talked about by the younger generation

I'm like the undertaker turning rappers into ghosts
Host and roast MC's like I'm suppose
I can send L.O.D. to bust caps perhaps
Bring E and Red and we can kick some raps
This track is so sickenin' and bouncin'
Make you nod your head so much you need counciling
I flow to a rough kind of mode
Competition run for cover cause I'm droppin' loads
No brainer crossing over in the Range Rover
Insainer pack heat like a super nova
Keith Murray gets it on and poppin'
Shut it down like administrative lockin'
Marble face poetry poverty hard

Little did we know the dirt we did fell back on my mother
But didn't care back then, that's why she left like that
Now my parents became the street, and it's best like that

Some nights I pray to God and ask him to pull my cord
'Cause times is hard like the opposite street'll leave you scarred
Street wise, with no respect for authority and shit
A chronic hustler of crack; a typical bitch
Raised by Madu, who strung out on a glass dick
But every now and then I blessed her with a hit
So she don't have to trick
It's prevalent amongst kids today
Hustle krills, stack dough, and everything's okay

[Chorus]
It's the emancipation proclamation under the self-devised guidelines
Of self preservation and starvation (I gotta live)
It's the emancipation proclamation under the self-devised guidelines
Of self preservation and starvation (and I gotta live)

My life in this world wasn't about diamonds and pearls
It was rough growin' up around the boys and girls
After daddy left, shit was a mess; momma stressed
But I give her an award, 'cause, damn, she tried her best
Holdin' down the household, barely had money to fold
Christmas time, cherished our little shit like gold
I can't front; daddy was still there for me, cared for me
But him and mommy breakin' up was like a nightmare to me

Yo, this is for the younger fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
Success is nothin' if it ain't; if it was with the others
We gotta make the best out of this terrible situation
If not for us, for the younger generation
We gotta break the chain, and deal with the pain
For all our people that was slayed in vain (revenge)
For all our peoples that was falsely framed (revenge)
For all our peoples that's livin' the name

[Chorus]

Let me show; I gotta love L.O.D., they put me under they wing
And then I teamed up with the most beautiful thing
In the world, 'cause L.O.D. we all we got
I'm a fans and my mans keep it, like it or not
I know it hurts havin' to do everyday dirt
Police all over my back; feel like bustin' them jerks
When I'm my road to the riches, I stay away from snitches
And them bitches, and keep my mind on business

Life was tough, so I became aggressive like a pit
The only time I felt relaxed was when the blunt was lit
Thinkin' me and my team can be tight like the Gambino
Muscle in the hustle scene; respected like Leno
It gets deeper than the words of Proverbs
New thoughts emerge as I cop the squat on the curb
Thinkin' the herb; strengthen my brain like spinach
And heavy shine, flooded with ice might; reduce my self-spirits

Stick 'em; my life is so real it hurts
Like when I saw my pops bein' driven off in a hearse
Like when I saw my mother bein' driven off in a hearse
Like you school when the roach crawl out my shirt
Like on thanksgiving when we got free food from the church
Back then it was DJ Red Alert and Cool Herc
Rockin' been stripe knees and latigra shirts
Back then L.O.D. was puttin' in work

From the cradle to the grave
We all in the struggle, we gon' struggle, we gon' strive to stay alive
All my real people know what I'm talkin' about
Watch each other backs

Keith Murray,"""word""- Slick Rick

Intro:
Rock on. All my peoples up top rock on. All my peoples down low rock on. All
my peoples on the left rock on. All my peoples on the right. Word up. Def
Squad rock on.

Verse 1:
Well it's the supersonical ginintonical 
Ask your chronicles splatter crews all you hear is ahh and ouhs
Time to face the music bring you down to Earth like Poppa Smurf
I'm worldwide like on the web in your turf
With full fledge rap pack with anxiety attacks 
For those that thought I wouldn't be back 
With that bone chillin' horror killin' all on goin' drama
Save the rah rah for your mama
Bragadoshis prone to static
Come through the jam and wreck the mic by force of habit
Tantalizin' make you feel good like cryin'
I can't be dissed so you can stop tryin'
And Keith Murray will prevail
So you can eat a shit sandwich and go to hell

Hook:
I got the skunky funky illest funk flow
For the glamorous scandalous world of radio
""now this song is from all of us to all of them""        (x2)

Verse 2:
Yo I throw the beat up in the cobra clutch
Hit it with the Midas touch
Dig up in the mic just like a gold rush
Never ran never felt the need to run
They know not to come cause they all get some
I'm still fabulous still mackadoshis 
My dj still cut it the closest
So who's an error when's a never?
I melt through your butter leather 
And then I splatter through your Gucci sweater
Deep as a river in a ragin' flood 
I come with open arms showin' nothin' but love
Comin' less than zero modern day hero
Deliver hot shit just like Dominos
Keep it movin' or get it on 
Cause money talks and bullshit runs the marathon word is bond 
Non stoppin' mic shockin' bottles poppin'
Word up son you we keep it rockin'

Hook

Verse 3:
I'm like a character and my life is a movie
Groupies step to me 
Do me
Try to sue me 
Because I make a record got money in a car
I'm a star?
Naw naw naw that's bullshit paw
In the black range look ya never ever worry
Parked in the front I hear voices sayin' ""That's Keith Murray""
The name of the game is fame 
You know the price you recognize the God like Christ
Masses of posses packed up schemin' 
Ladies love me they keep on screamin'
Expressin' all the feelin' of the world today
Some might listen to my music and try to say
Nothin' other than ""Yo this shit is dope""
And in the everyday life struggle Murray goes for broke
From day to day month to month year to year
I swear I tear any mic any stage anywhere
I be the standards of which excellence is measured 
So for me to rock all day it'll be my pleasure

Keith Murray,"Ride wit me, yeah yeah 
Ride wit me (Def Squad) 
Roll down your windows and ride wit me (uptown) 

Ride wit us 
Bitch ride wit us 
Ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Lets smoke this Oakland indoe 
Don't roll down the window 
Start the car 
We ain't going too far 

You know that big 'bootied' girl you always fuckin' wit 
She got a sister I really wanna get 
Some Georgia girls from college park 
You already fucked when we get that started off 

Park in the driveway, it won't take long 
Do it like that, it goes on and on 
You know this the kind of shit, I know you want
E made the beat let me show you somethin' 
Quite a few haters want to see us played out
 
But we got the formula to get payed now 
You can't stand in the way of success 
We got the same job but you make much less 
I remember how it used to be, before we had crack 
If you had a few hundred in your pocket that was fat

[Chorus]
If you feel like smokin' then ride wit us 
Hop the train with no token then ride wit us 
And if you don't give a fuck then ride wit us 
Roll down your windows and ride wit us 
And if you got five on it then ride wit us 
And if you ain't fake niggas then ride wit us 
And if your crew pull trigges then ride wit us 
Roll up your windows and ride wit us 

Ah-yo, I lick two shots that's heard all around the world 
Check how a forty and a blunt can take a nigga girl 
Like E.F. hunting, don't say nothin', I'm haunting 
On the microphone, its the eve of destruction
 
As the world goes around like Passion 
You get flattened in an orderly fashion 
You was warned like a coming attraction 
I got playa hated, felt liberated 
Put him on the burner cause the nigga violated 

We scamper like guard dogs through the fog 
If you feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog 
The sergeant general get busy chief 
The fastest way to spell rhyme relief is Keith 

I leave you assed out like a cocaine drought 
Hey yo can I get a witness like Andre Krouch 
Niggas need to stop frontin' 
Bitches need to stop stuntin' 
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production 

[Chorus] 

I got the forty acres without the fuckin' mule 
Doc Ike Turner givin' mics audio abuse 
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her babysitter 
And her lesbian friend, and that nigga wit her
 
I don't give a fuck, I smack blood out a midget 
My tactics make evil D say come on kick it 
A black five wit rims, what you can spot me in 
Wanna die, I snatch you like Doc Kevorkian
 
So turn the beat up 
While NARCs got me on sweep up 
I'm lucky, I usually tote more Guns than Peter 
I fuck you up to where your forehead will cut meat up 
You wanna box, I square more than Matt Asenerina 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this) 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this0

[Chorus]",Ride Wit Us,1999
Keith Murray,"Intro:
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
This is for only certain people (word up)
This is for all my peoples in the struggle
All my peoples in jail
All my peoples dyin' to live

Verse One:
On my way home alone I took the shoertcut through the danger zone
Ran into alligator looking Jerome
I jumped out the truck all drunk
Nuts hanging out the car like ""what?""
Nigga, I gives a fuck
He said ""what up"" I said ""what up""
He said ""I need to be up""
I went in my nuts hit him with a 100 yo
He gave me a glare with sparklin' gold teeth
And said
Yo Keith, your product is always peace
Yo son, you know I just got released
I was on the block and got bagged by pussy police
And they the reason why Calvin is deceased 
The bullshit will never cease but dough is comin' at least
I gave him a pound and a hug
Told him ""hold it down thug""
Peace
I'm a fleece 'cause its hotter than fish grease
We was high as a kite
Feelin' kinda petro
I metroed
My way back to the Montero
Before I even made it to the car door
I was rushed by 2 jakes 
and then 2 more
so here wew are fightin' through all the excitement I ask
What you lockin' me up for?
One said Secret Indictment

Chorus: (2x)
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
The gates are locked 
And you are trapped inside

Verse Two:
Starin' at the face of the judge
With the identical image of a true thug
I shoulda smuggled in a shotty (word up)
'cause they tryin' to treat me like I killed somebody
And what the D.A. had to say
Wasn't justice in no kinda way
Under the doc number 284389
We the people recommend upstate time
I said your honor
I can't even see that far
That's when my lawyer started droppin' the repetoir
He said your honor
These allegations against my client are very undefient
Toward the contrary
The judge said
Mr. Murray didn't I tell you if you in my courtroom again 
Your ass is gone a long time
Then he presumed
Plus your a member
Of the notorius gang
the Legion of Doom
He said look at me
Thought he shook me
I turn around and the bastard 
Through the book at me
I hope this teaches you a lesson
A half a million dollar bail
Boom
This court is in session

Verse Three:
I reach the tear visions of pair
Remind me I'm locked up
So I got no chance but not to give a fuck
Check out my perspective as it dropped
A lock across ya chest
And bust ya snotbox
Technicalites make me want to bust chops and cops
And murder flocks in all actualities
That's a necessity in my recipe
Plus it was a black cop that framed me
And if it ain't one thing
It's another ask my brother
Went in jail for one thing
Stayed in for another
So here I am frustrated
Sittin' in jail
Thinkin' bout all my unfinished business left in the world
I hopped on the jack connect with my connect
Told him what I was up against
Plus they found a Tech
Get the cash together
Put up the car and the house
We on the jail phone
So watch what come out ya mouth
In 24 hours I was out
But the situation's never ended
'cause the case is pended
To be continued",Secret Indictment,1999
Keith Murray,"""Yo  this shit right here  is some shit  some serious shit"" 

Yo  the fact that I'm down wit Def Squad's hard to determine 
Till you see me hoppin out the Coupe wit E Sermon 
Or hoppin out the Keith Murray Suburban 
Or hoppin out the Lex Land wit Redman  wildin and cursin 
My thought process is mysterious like the Lochness 
My furious mindset is complex 
Killin shit like a carnivorous millitant prehistoric monster 
Comin to stomp all over you hip-hop conference 
Landed in an Unidentified Flying Object 
Turn you into an unidentified frying carcus 
The smell of raw flesh make you nauseous 
Acidest arsonist, burnin your bones to carbon and phosphorus 
My metaphors sting like after haircuts when 
The alcohol is applied to the raw skin 
So whoever want to battle get blasted 
Get your teeth enamel shattered, shitted on like Pampers 
You had a bad bitch, I left the back twist 
I stuck my dick in everything from asshole to the nasal passage 
Dug her out all day, then changed my sperm DNA 
Now she got nobody to blame 
I been spittin raw, what the fuck you think I'm livin for 
Throw me in jail, I'll do a prison tour 
For wannabe hard niggaz, insecure niggaz 
Wit they heads to big for they neck to support niggaz 
Three in the Squad plus me equal four members 
An extra addition for any special force mission 
Man listen 

Ain't these niggaz on some shit 
Keith Murray, Canibus ain't no stoppin it uhh 

Let me draw a brief description of what happened 
I was rappin, niggaz got the scrappin, guns got the clappin 
Three-fifty-seven degrees I was separated 
Have bullets deflected metal, bodies decapitated 
GUSH!! a nigga got struck as I look 
I caught the next guy runnin by wit the metal hook (BOO-AHH!!) 
Blew his back open, blood gushed on my face 
A bitch fainted 'cause she seen I enjoyed the taste 
The case is that I split your melon 
And feed it to the jigga-boos wit fried chicken wings 
I'm wildin for Long Island, I turned and took Charles Ferguson 
And open fire on any trains now 
You may never know who's in your shadow 
You punk ass niggaz just best stay shallow 
And hollow, if you want to live to see tomorrow 
'cause ain't no sun comin out tomorrow 
Yo, I might do something y'all niggaz might regret like 
Blast you in your face and disregard your vest 
I'm pissin and dissin off of recognition and niggaz to listen 
Just to let you pussies know how I'm livin 
'cause I Return like the Jedi, wit my dead eye 
Leave niggaz to die, peace to niggaz up in Bed-Stuy 
Oh-ah, this that type of shit that make them niggaz want to wet it 
Word up, got me ready to set it 
 
Seems I steps wit aggression 
To any bitch who think they nice in this profession 
What? what you think your wrecking? 
I break your stlye down to little fragments 
The pain is permanent, so spare yourself the embarrassment 
Buck-fifty 'cross the face 
Followed by knife wounds to the chest for you attempt to retaliate 
I noticed all you bitches flows is based around clothes 
But Deja Vu got something for you stankin hoes 
Studio gangsta bitches I diminish ideas of bringin beef 
Before the thought even finishes 
I want to see red, blood from a chicken head 
'For I wild the FUCK OUT like the Grateful Dead HA 
This wild style must run in my genes 
Because my sister's in the county 
And my brother just came home from Green 
I strike like the black widow, through the underground radio 
Kitto and still stack dirty ditto",Some Shit,1999
Keith Murray,"Verse 1

When I rap competition perform disappearing acts
I jam suckers like smuckers
My squad is funky like a six pack of motherfuckers
With conversation my creations will collider nations into confrontation
Competition couldn't stand a chance
I'll wear you out like if I had one pair of pants
Murray emphasises cadarac poetry meaning you blind bats can't see me
Throughout my career I rip year to year successfully
Dragging debree in my vicinity
My symbol is the sickle like the Grim Reaper
My style is the greatest invention since the speaker
A pyschopath with a knife in my voice 
The lyrical homocidal madman is top choice
The scene I scope it first because I'm homophobic
And then I rope-a-dope it
And dominate the sight of  bloody red
Coming out my head leaving rappers brain dead
I come through like POW! and BAM!
Reppin' like the lyrical version of Shazaam (Damn!....)
When I rap

Chorus(2x)

[L.L. Cool J sample] Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
[DMX sample] Believe what I say!
[Keith Murray] When I rap

Verse 2

When I rap one hand can't clap
So lets squash the beef cook it and we all can get fat
Try to swallow a line and you'll find
I'm one hard act to follow rollow in my vibe
Swallow and your throat will explode
Sending you through schizophrenic episodes
My style is so well off on it's own 
I leave it unattended and go see my dog about a bone
When I'm the microphone ( When I rap )
And biting niggas will leave it alone
I go together with the rhythm like a sentence and some verbs
And herbs so check out every word
I kicked a verse for Father Time
He put the world on pause cause I fucked his head up with a rhyme
Diamond studded rough and rugged fuck it
There's nothing left for you to do now but kick the bucket
Dummy who's ever flipping
It better be a round-off back hand-spring arabian summy
With more concentration then an acrobat
When I rap

Chorus

Verse 3

When I kick the gift of gab and I'm grim and I'll be god damned
If any mortal or immortal man can withstand
And not slam my jams cause I take them on a trip
And flip the script with legit manuscripts
Fogging up the mic with real legit compounds
Mass mic Murray man flurries in the bound
Oh what the fuck you fall and can't get up when I erupt
So pass the buck cause you've been struck
With the will I learn will I burn
Off carbon dioxide cause I'm on the flip side
Word conducter emcee destructer
Millions be saying ""That Murray's a motherfucker!""
I dip and dive punch you in your eye
In a battle if you try to lie in your rhymes when we socialize
I'm beating Mother Nature down to her knees
While making more papers than trees
You can't be serious that's impossible
I leave niggas laid up in the hospital
Bandaged from head to toe and hat
My shit is intact when I rap

Chorus(4x)",When I Rap,1999
Keith Murray,"Yo yo brand new KRS why'all Maximum Strength

We hit em and get em we stick em and jig em
We pick em and kick em

'Cause I'm cold sick of them

Much quicker than them lyrically trickin' and my Tribe
Be on a Quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin' the full clip in em
Splittin' and strippin' em down while spittin' a round

Into them sound clash see winni'n them, just begginin' them
Get rid of every bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them
In the new millennium we killin' them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin' em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin' them
We blaze, fulfillin' them, Keith ?, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, other be stealin' them

Comin out to {fuck} with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go; let's see

This sho' is real, this is the deal, guns I'm runnin

Steppin through the city at night, with the ? and two mic
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs

Who don't give a {fuck} waitin' for crime to pay

Put your money on it, yo we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best {niggaz} that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
{Niggas} comin through will not stand a chance

From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Comin' deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin'
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

We destroy {niggaz}, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Makin about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type, you need a dyke, babygirl I see the light
But sometime why'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny

Tear your face off the planet, leavin' one-third damaged
With you back cracked the earth canvas, leavin' mountains slanted

Puttin' dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws

Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often

Yo y'all niggas will never see my level
Rap so hot I slap box with the devil
Tap a jaw, slap a bitch do what I like
Got a sociology and money like Reverend Ike
Yo here's your rap eviction , get out the jurisdiction
Before I hit that ass with a cross a diction crucifixion
Editorial, news flash, extra, extra
Let this blast wit yo stank ass
Face the ultimate challenge, style's got a lot of knowledge
Come in violence, leave in silence
This beat's a be	, so come on take a swim
MC's can't float don't worry about them
I'ma dupe like Patty, rich like maddie
Slick like a caddy, but not your baby daddie
Girls I got em locked, flavors come assorted
So pop that koochie girl I can double joint it

CHORUS
This is for the thugs in the clubs and the hotties in the party
Who need a drink before you (Slap somebody)
All my cats on the corner who's packed in the shottie
Who need a blunt before you (Slap somebody)
Rewind this jam and let it rock the party before, I
Slap somebody
I speak with more technique than karate 'cause I, will
Slap somebody

Ayo I'm strictly from the street, that's why I get love
Airin dearin niggas out in the back of the club
With the mic in my hand, just got paid
Take these suckers out till I get on stage
When the girls see my face and they all get excited
Dogs in the front row bout to start a riot
Too loud to be quiet, too wired to be tired
Yo E crank this shit up and get it started
Get the crowd funky like the whole place farted
MC's rest in peace like dearly departed
Then it's all in togehther now, let me show you how
I do it rock n roll style, and dive in the crowd
Murray ain't the average MC, I got alotta things
But don't act conceited when you see me on the street
I hang with the rich, keep it real with the poor
Kick hard metaphor, 'cause that's what I'm here for
Catch me east of the sun or west of the moon
Lookin butterfly like a caterpillar just cocooned
Smooth like Thug Passion over the rocks
So sporty they need to put me on a Wheaties box

CHORUS

[Keith Murray]
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today
In a special way to play on baby play
The way you shake that ass girl is somethin drastic
Fabulous , and fantastic
Fly like a be	-52 hot stepper
Got Latinos yellin, ""Wepa, ese loco, da le toto
Pese mi culo, pape chulo""
Whatever, the more the merrier, the longer the weave the scarier
My squad is Def and we ain't hearin ya

Strip down to my wife beater
Baby doll shake what you got, I'm not a playa hater, I just dis a lot
And don't slam the doors of the Mazzarati
Because I, will, slap somebody

CHORUS

Bring me up somethin nice, cool to drink in this bitch before I
Slap somebody
Fix me somethin hot to eat before I have to go outside and
Slap somebody
Throw your hands in the sir from side to side before I
Slap somebody

Keith Murray,"[interlude]

Yeah, yo, Def Squad, Full Cooperation on this one yo, total concentration
Wassup wit these cats out there?, I don't think they figured, son
I don't think they hear you son, ha ha

[Keith Murray]

Now first but not least you will respect Keith, lay a nigga down
Like a doo-rag in some grease, you must be crazy tryin to play me
I been dedicated since King Tut the third baby
Lyrical chemist rhyme minister, diminished you for the benefit
Then continue to kill shit for the fuck of it, I see y'all been writin
Still bitin, still lookin lame, half y'all niggaz still soundin the same
I'm excitin when live on stage, when receiting in lighting, frightening
lightning
Throwin thunder in chain, when i first came, I gave birth to a million MC's
In the game, who should all carry my last name
And I'm Gonna Get You Sucka like Damon Wayans, and fame like Jermaine
Bring pain and novacaine, okay y'all lil monkeys want to play?
My Squadron brings the art of war the correct way (OKAY!)
Chorus 2x

Chorus
I need your full cooperation and total attention
There's a few things I'd like to mention, these rappers out here swear they're
So appealing I, step to your business and hurt your feelings

[Erick Sermon]

Okay, well thinkin it's okay to rhyme that way, you'll be P.O.W., M.I.A.
And I'm seven steps ahead of you, five from eternity
An all that shit you kick just don't concern me, I separate the dead from 
The chump, ask a nigga blunt, ""Yo, how many lumps you want?""
So flavorous you could taste it, so hardcore I wrote this layin on the floor
In the basement, my style ain't no walk in the park, got mainstream MC's
Scared to rhyme after dark, an there Ain't No Half-Steppin
I'm reppin like a nuclear weapon, manifestin the Immaculate Conception
Lyrically I rape an MC like sodomy, add tragedy, to your odessy
For battle reservations call 1-900-SQUAD, frontin on us
Is like frontin on God
Chorus

[Redman]

Now when we take it there, these three niggas in the square
My squad hangs out like fourhundred pounds in braziers
My deathrow allines, bein signed then aligned to electric
So it clear like a chair in Texas, HOT, approach wit extreme caution
No horsin around when my squad abortion a sound
Our crew's like Smokey off sokey, even Little Bo Peep, your style is weak
Guard your Rollie, wit all the ice in it, I snatch the ice out and put a price
out
Cop a Benz, put my mom in it, as long as I'm alive I'mma keep the vibe
24-7, 365

Keith Murray's, comin from the North South East and Left
Rhymin to death, makin a world when I take a deep breath
With a body boom bash, my paragraph a trey-deuce
Human behavior in a psychopath
Ooooh, I might lose my cool, and break fool
and pull out my get busy tools
I write like a mad journalist
to funk, that's deeper than a bottomless spliff (that's my word)
The most beautifulest thing in this world
is my notion, for murderous poetry in motion
And the illiotic shit I come across
form a leash you're trapped in with explosive force
I push your head through the cracks of sanity
and leave your brain doin a bid in purgatory
It's ninety-six degrees in the shade
before I catch blood on my blade
I take my frustration to the stage
and gets open dope and stupid bumblin rumblin tracks
When I rap my jams be packed like a laundromat
My context'll wreck your whole concept
Cause my delivery is so complex
And I'm inter-galactic on plastic
with the super distinguish that I kick
I'm high strung at the top of my lung
with my tongue makin hardcore niggaz want to get dumb
My dialogue comes straight from the slums
Damnage to your medula, cerebrum and cerebellum
if ya got a crew ya better tell em

I retrieve the money, dawg labrador
Ray Charles can see it, and Stacy Lattisaw
You get mashed out, cause your bird is peckin'
Don't be the next vinyl cut to Urban Legend
I can feel where you at, when I pound you up
You out of town coke rhymes, oh you clowns is up
My crew stay in the truck, can't fit in the Porsche
If you bitches ain't happy, then get a divorce
I'ma do what I want, cause my time is now
Grab the whole rap game, and divide it down

If I want to roll a Jeep with a seat out the back
Bitch feet out the back, system beat out the track
Am I wrong for dat? (If that's what you like)
Dawg, am I wrong for dat? (Hey, I guess not)
Yo yo, if I walk into the club with my hand on my snub
Beatin down security cause I don't give a fuck
Am I wrong for dat? (Mmm mmm)

Have his whole body shakin' in fear
Stormtrooper fires throwin' lashin' out flames
A few ashes, when they analyze your remains
I live in the streets, reside with the toolie
I kill you like it's part of my religious duty
Street sweeper thug keeper sweepin' thugs under the rug
Even females who think they thugs
Trigger the release of adrenaline
When I'm gangsta-trippin' like the Bloods'n'Crips'n'them
Unleash the matter of energy, killin' 'em
Why'd you do it? Because I wasn't feelin' them!

with a shabby haircut, pants I wore for days
Am I wrong for dat? (I don't think so)
C'mon bitch, am I wrong for dat? (Say what)
Yo, if I want a fat chick that keep her toes done (uh-huh)
When they playin' my song ass spill out the thong
Am I wrong for dat? (Got that big ass)
Am I wrong for dat? (Tchk, no)

I gotta, bang the boogie to that bang bang pussy
To that bang to the pussy the beat, beat
And if yo', bitch ain't sippin' that Cristal shit
Then she might be leavin' with D, D

I love your music baby (I got my music)
(Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music)
Hey (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music (la-da-da-da-daaaa-dah-dah-dahh) doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Turn on some music (la-da-da-da-daaaa) turn on some music
Just like music..",Music [Remix],2001
