Jess Mills,"I wanna love the one I never dared to
Speak the words I hid away
Wanna say each word how I would say your name
I wanna say the things that I was scared to
Shout them high see where they fall
Let it make no sense but never care at all
My heart is beating to a rhythm
That nobody else can hear
But I can hear it, I can hear it clear

If you can see me now,
Am I who you’d want me to be?

I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
So I’m pushing for a fight
To feel that I’m alive, everyday
I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
Like I’m fighting for my life
Wanna know I did it right
When it’s taken away

I wanna step on to the high wire
100 miles above the ground
To walk the line, but never to look down
So that’s where they can find me
Between the clouds and the sky
That is where I’m gonna watch the world go by

If you can see me now
Am I who you’d want me to be?

I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
So I’m pushing for a fight
To feel that I’m alive, everyday
I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
Like I’m fighting for my life
Wanna know I did it right
When it’s taken away

I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
So I’m pushing for a fight
To feel that I’m alive, everyday
I’m gonna live for what I’d die for
Like I’m fighting for my life
Wanna know I did it right
When it’s taken away",Live for What I'd Die For,2011
Jess Mills,"They’re circling 'round but I need more time
My freedom is priceless and so is my peace of mind
I shouldn’t have to pay for mine
If they were bees 'round my baby I would kill them
But they hover in packs and what a sorry excuse for men
There should be no excusing them

Cause they are dragging my faith out of me
It was not for the taking
Look the vultures are perching
And they are dragging my faith out of me
Everything I believed in
Look out in the waters they’re lurking

Cause they are dragging my faith out of me
It was not for the taking
Look the vultures are perching
And they are dragging my faith out of me
Everything I believed in
Look out in the waters they’re lurking

Quietly violent like a bad dream
They pursue day and night
They never rest like a hunting beast
A shadow in the corner of my eye and at the heels of my feet
Do they see any good in all this somehow?
I could charge them for murder cause they're killing my spirit now
It shouldn’t be allowed

Cause they are dragging my faith out of me
It was not for the taking
Look the vultures are perching
And they are dragging my faith out of me
Everything I believed in
Look out in the waters they’re lurking

Cause they are dragging my faith out of me
It was not for the taking
Look the vultures are perching
And they are dragging my faith out of me
Everything I believed in
Look out in the waters they’re lurking",Vultures,2011

When you get lonely
Make me feel
Like I’m the only one you love
And when I just can't get enough
Hey hey like

Cheap wine and cigarettes
That kind of taste that you don’t forget
You take me high and leave me a mess
Just like cheap wine and cigarettes

I'm over thinking 'bout the day we gonna leave
When we get on our feet
I'm over all the hours in between
I wish you would

Load me up in the front seat of that get away truck that's out there waiting on us
To run chasing sun into the darkness, start this drive me crazy

Jess Roden,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long

I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say

How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part,

Jess Stacy,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,
Jess Stacy,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Jess Stacy,"I don't care what the weatherman says
When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining

When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me

Jess Stacy,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course

But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Jess Stacy,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

To the Riverboat Shuffle!

Jess Stacy,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,

That you'd turn away romance

You know I'm yours for just the taking

And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Jessalyn Gilsig,"In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps
And burning' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag

With the re-run shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing

You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?

Nunca es tarde para comenzar 
No tengas miedo de volver amar 

Lo que quiero es un amor que sepa que no soy alfombra 
Ni escalón, con dignidad y convicción 
Quiero un amor que sepa lo que soy 
Que tenga un corazón, detalles y pudor 
Eso es lo que soy 
Los corazones tontos nunca podrán llegar al cielo 
Aun tengo la esperanza de volver a escuchar te quiero 
Nunca es tarde para comenzar 
No tengo miedo de volver amar 

Lo que quiero es un amor que sepa que no soy alfombra ni escalón

Mi corazón lloraba de un vacío total
Todo lo intenté, por donde quiera te busque
Eras tú mi necesidad

Triste y desolada, ya no pude soportar
Más desesperada, era imposible de estar
Todo lo intenté, por donde quiera te busqué
Eras tú mi necesidad, alce mi rostro y

Llegaste tú, todo cambió
Llegaste tú, la esperanza triunfó
Llegaste tú, volví a nacer

Por tanto tiempo quise encontrar la solución
A ese gran vacío que llevaba en mi interior
Todo lo intenté, por donde quiera te busqué
Eras tú mi necesidad, alce mi rostro y

Misma feria
Y no he dormido nada

Puro taxi ocupado
Miro al cielo esta nublado

Y Murphy me ha burlado

Aquí voy
De malas pero voy
Haciendo malabares pa' pagar la renta de hoy
Que venga mas

De buenas o malas

Tan afinaditos

Olvido el tono
De esta canción?
¿Me querrías todavía o
Cambiarías la estación?

Aunque desubicada

Y si me olvido de la letra
Yo lo arreglo con un

No les gusta su reflejo
Y no les queda nada mas
Que criticar a los demás

Buscamos un poco
De comprensión?

Por lo que resta de este día
No habría discriminación

Cruzamos miradas y como si nada empezaste a cantar
Tus ojos sobre mi boca, mis ojos en otra cosa
Tus manos sobre esa guitarra me llevaron a imaginar
Todo lo que una dama no debe contar

La música fluye, tus ojos me huyen, te quiero amarrar
Caminas al filo de mi precipicio fingiendo saltar
Mis ganas son una roca, las cosas que no se tocan
Seducen al gato a explorar los tejados de tu suspirar
Me deslizo en tus problemas, ni cuenta te das

Ay, ay, mejor doy un paso atrás
Si te quitas los tacones corres mucho más
Ay, ay, aunque me interesa no soy una de esas
Qué tan fácilmente se deja enredar

Mi nombre se acuesta en tus labios te arranca un suspiro de sal
Y no deberías haberme tentado, te gusta jugar

No confundas la dulzura con la temperatura
Pero que yo nunca te imaginé mi estrellita ay así en este plan
Pero yo a ti te conozco y sé por dónde vas
Si no quieres flamenquito, no toques las palmas

Ay, ay, mejor doy un paso atrás

I wish for you out my window

I still hear the sound of your heartbeat

You and I are almost gone
Fading like a broken song
And if I really listen
I hear you in the distance
Baby all we got left of us
Are echoes of love

Picture perfect memories
On my walls, haunting me
I see your smile and I break down
Feel you far away, so close
I'm holding on, but you let go

And it's forty nights since you quit my life
Left without a sound
Left without a sound, I hate this
To feel so helpless

And it's times like this that I miss your kiss
Wish we never met, wish I never let me love you

Turn from blue to yellow, then they fade
They fade, they fade, they fade

Y, aunque a veces no me importe
Sé que el día que la pierda volveré a sufrir 
Por ella, que aparece y que se esconde
Que se marcha y que se queda
Que es pregunta y es respuesta 
Que es mi oscuridad, estrella

Ella me peina el alma y me la enreda 
Va conmigo pero no sé dónde va

Y, a la vez, está tan fuera
Sé que volveré a perderme 
Y la encontraré de nuevo 
Pero con otro rostro y otro nombre diferente y otro cuerpo 
Pero sigue siendo ella, que otra vez me lleva
Nunca me responde si al girar la rueda

Ella se hace fría y se hace eterna 
Un suspiro en la tormenta
A la que tantas veces le cambió la voz 
Gente que va y que viene y siempre es ella 
Que me miente y me lo niega
Que me olvida y me recuerda 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Pero, si mi boca se equivoca 
Y al llamarla nombro a otra 
A veces siente compasión por este loco, ciego y loco corazón 

Sea lo que quiera dios que sea

Que hay quien no tiene corazón 
Y va quemando, va quemándome y me quema, no no

Mi mundo sigue girando sin ti
Los días no han perdido su color
Y sigo viva aunque no estés aquí, pero
Extraño que me desnudes con solamente una mirada
Quiero sentir tu piel junto a la mía de madrugada
Jugar al amor en la habitación, llenos de sudor

Miento cuando sonrío en el espejo
La soledad de mi reflejo
No me perdona que no estés aquí
Siento que sigue congelado el tiempo
Va repitiendo ese momento
En que te fuiste y me olvidaste y te llevaste una parte de mí
Te fuiste y te llevaste una parte de mí
Te fuiste y te llevaste una parte de mí

Llevo noches sin poder dormir, la luna me recuerda a ti
Te sigo soñando de día, me mata ver lo que perdí
Ya no quiero extrañarte así, no es fácil disimular
Sigo con la fantasía de volverte a encontrar
Ignoras mis mensajes y aun así te quiero llamar
El proceso es difícil y tú difícil de olvidar
Extraño cuando sentía tu deseo
Rozar tu piel y prendernos el fuego
Comerte en la intimidad, tú eres mi más grande prioridad

Miento cuando sonrío en el espejo
La soledad de mi reflejo
No me perdona que no estés aquí
Siento que sigue congelado el tiempo
Va repitiendo ese momento
En que te fuiste y me olvidaste y te llevaste una parte de mí

Llevo un par de noches soñándote

Me quedo en casa para evitar tentaciones

Quiero saber qué harías si me tienes en frente
Quiero saber si lo que sientes es tan fuerte
Cómo me haces creer
Quiero saber, saber

Quiero saber, qué pasa por tu mente, cuando me miras tú
Quiero saber, si sabes cómo siento, cómo me dueles tú
Debes saber, es hora que aceptes, que solo eres tú

Kiss the poom-poom, so oochie-walla
Praise the fatha, praise the fatha, praise!
Jeana, Lisa, Frita
Can all just sit in the back of the Bimmer
Puffin' the lala, smokin' the reefer
HB shotgun rollin' the Keisha
I got a camera in, boo, but we lay low
We had our first kiss near the equator
And mama-se mama-sa, mama say so
And this thing may never get a day old
Back in Paris with Alice for dinner
Smokin' the Cuban, boy keep ya chin up
Girl in the blue dress look like a winner

You know I got to show love, show love

Cruise head to Spain, I think I'm Vega
Any flavor, every summer
Me and Brodinski bringin' the numbers
Groovin' the sides so we enter
Hop on the MDMA, feelin' better
Said that her favorite car was a Jetta
Sent me some champagne all with a letter
Made me say musa, musa, musa
I want to go down to St. Lucia
Got Brianna, bought for two

I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born in a wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't tought me good
No one greedy inside my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it
Hold up now wait, take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that ""My Way""
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
With the fuckin' habits of a the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep
'Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker wide awake on the creep
Tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed
Watch 'em grown and then watch 'em lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot

Follow, follow me

I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shot made me been unnoticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Koolaid, gettin' big wig money, that [?]
Look around and see people with no class, like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why

A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it yeah I be pacing
Bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when, now let that shit begin

This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise

This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming ""I knew it!""
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems, understand
This is all I ever wanted, yes I do it for the fans
And I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

Jesse Camp,"Well, this little ditty's for a little heart breaker, foresaker, quaker
Tummyacher girl in the city
I never knew a drop dead beauty like you
I never knew how fast my heart would beat or what to do
You took me out of the park 'cause you were such a heavy hitter

You dressed me up, and then you wore me all around town
We was the latest trash fashion, was the word going down
But like the rag that I was, you broke my heart just
'Cause I was cheap shoppin' on a junk heap

Break it, ah, no, no, no, no
Just break it, ah no, no, no
I know you break it

Look, you break every heart in this town
Oh, you mess us all around

Heartbroken, croakin', lookin' for a kiss
I was turnin' it out but you were just turn 'n' tricks
Left your marks all around
I even heard you was with my guitar player
I'm a seein' her later so

Break it, ah no, no, no, no, no
Just break it, ah no, no, no, no
I know you break it

So now you've been a slummin' it with all us 8th Street Kidz
Going through our garbage cans and flippin' all our lids
But you've been messin' with punks, we'll stink you up like skunks
So go back sweetie and mistreat Cory and Petie
Or whatever else punk you're with

Break it, ah no, no, no
Just break it, ah no, no, no
I know you break it

You're the one I sleep with at night
You take me in and promise me I'll be all right
You're my little angel down from the heavens above
I can't ask for much anymore
But you still smile and give me your love
So if you fall asleep tomorrow
Then I know we can make it through this night
But if you fall asleep as I hold you tight
You'll have moved on
Your love will be gone 

You're my little savior
Hold me close and stare up into the stars
Let me know if you think that there's someone up there
Who still believes in us
After I've lost all their trust
Just need someone to believe us
So please, just fall asleep tomorrow
'Cause, sugar, I know we can make it through the night
'Cause if you fall asleep as I hold you tight
You'll have moved on, your love will be gone

We ain't gonna make it to school this mornin'
We missed the bus
So we better hitch with Stitch's

I know you only get 16 sick days
We're up to 22 just livin' in a daze
I'll get Susie to write us up a note
That'll get us out I know it's gotta float

I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I'll see you around

If things get too tight I'll say
""Yo, teach, I got to go see the school shrink""
I'll act all crazy then you stash them pills
Them that make us think

Grab some condoms too 'cause Susie's gettin' loose
I'd rather neck in the woods than listen to all of you
If the teacher asks where Mr. Camp can be found
Tell her I left class 'cause I was feelin' kinda down then laugh

I'll see you around
So goodbye teachers
I'll see you around
Under the bleachers
I'll see you around

What do ya mean? I'm supposed to be in class
Go back to class, I am in class
No, I did not just join the girls volleyball team
Thank you very much
No, we're just working on our chemistry
It starts with your ups and a little kinetic school

Saying hi to my boys in the bathroom stalls
And my girls smokin' in the halls

",See You Around,1999
Jesse Camp,"We made a pact that we would never look back
We tried to make it down the coast on our own
In a borrowed car between the seats and the stars
We learned some things I wished we'd never ever known

Just another hard luck story on a cold winter night
But you ain't got no coat, so I just hold you tight

So wrap your arms around me, baby
Don't say you wanna turn around and go home
If you stay with me, baby
I'll fulfill all of your wishes with my big ol' sloppy kisses

I know that Daytona is still days away
I know I promised I'd get us there by now
Still we're crashed out in another truck stop parking lot
I swear I'll hustle us a hotel

So our hard luck story lasts another night
Ain't no way you're gonna freeze when I hold you tight

So wrap your arms around me, baby
Don't say you wanna turn around and go home

Jesse Camp,"Don't feel right wearing another man's shoes
Can't get a new pair until I've pad all of my dues
My cowboy boots have gotten too many holes
From getting kicked in the shins and stompin' out

But it's too far to heaven, can't hitch a free ride
Angels don't pick up losers so down on their pride
Still I stick out my thumb and I hope there's a chance
'Cause I can't coast on my looks and fake more romance

'Cause I don't want to take you down
Break you down and shake you down
I don't want to bring you up, just to leave you low
And break you down so down so down

I wasn't born no damaged goods
Just too the wrong road inward to a place all alone
Sure, I can pick out a new name
And I can wear some new clothes
Just can't change the ending of how my story goes

I don't want to take you down
Break you down and shake you down
I don't want to bring you up, just to leave you low and
Break you down so down so down

But things won't get better till I change 'em my own
Admit what I've done, unstitch what I've sewn
But if you travel with me, you'll just see that [unverified]
I'm doomed to go nowhere at the age of 19

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

You are the bird of paradise
On a gale at dawn
Just floating on

You don't know I feel so bad
I can see you, girl
With your eyes like pearls

Come on out and see the sights
You won't be alone tonight
Look at the walls you've built
Look at the time you've killed

There is a price for mystery
There is a world that you never see
There is a seed we sow
With just a weed that grows

These are the plans of yesterday
This is the love that will never go away

Jesse Harris,"Lookin' back I don't remember
Anythin' from last September
But I see your eyes still glowin'
With a pain that kept on flowin'
But lookin' back I don't remember

There are times you seem to be here
In a dream you meet me somewhere
And you say you're fine, don't worry
But you move on in a hurry
And lookin' back I don't remember

When the sun set on the last year
I could see it fallin' like a tear
And it took you down into the sea
With a kind of strange finality
But lookin' back I don't remember",Looking Back,2009
Jesse Harris,"On a day unlike any other day
When you're midway through the sky
And you know more than you've ever known
All you wanted was a lie

Now you sit quietly
Staring down at the sea
You are free to be anybody
Anybody you wanna be

On a night unlike any other night
It is alright to want more
When you see more than you've ever seen
Then you walk right through the door

Now you sit quietly
Staring down at the sea
You are free to be anybody
Anybody you wanna be

You are free to be anybody
Anybody you wanna be
You wanna be, you wanna be
You wanna be",On a Day,2009
Jesse Harris,"Everyone was dancin' or reelin'
And the band was playin' with feelin'
While the rest of the world was rockin'
You and I were sittin' there talkin'

Watchin' all of the people
Watchin' all of the sky fall down

Said that you were always too shy
And everythin' kept passin' you by
While the rest of the world was rockin'
You and I kept sittin' there talkin'

Watchin' all of the people
Watchin' all of the sky fall down

A new year was lightin' the sky
And all you did was sit there and cry
And while the rest of the world was rockin'
You and I kept sittin' there talkin'

Watchin' all of the people
Watchin' all of the sky fall
Watchin' all of the people
Watchin' all of the sky fall down",Watching the Sky,2009
Jesse Harris,"Down you go
And you know it's what you wanted
The day is short
And you got what you wanted

But who can really say
Why you act that way?
Trying to run away
And disappear

But who can really say
Why you act that way?
Trying to run away
And disappear

It seems so strange
You don't change
What you wanted

What you wanted
What you wanted
What you wanted",What You Wanted,2009
Jesse Harris,"No, I would never say
You were not here
Just yesterday
It seems so near

I know we'll never be
Back there again
But can't believe
That it could end

But while we slept
Life changed us
And time went by

And though where we once stood
Is still the same
It does no good
To call your name

'Cause while we slept
Life changed us
And time went by
Time went by

It won't stop now
It won't stop now
It won't stop now
It won't stop now",While We Slept,2009
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"Always seem to get thing wrong
I waited here a bit too long
For you to come along to me

I thought that I would kiss your lips 
But the sky went dark and the moon eclipsed
And what I missed is all that I can see

Now I'm stuck here thinking back
At where I lost the thread
So ashamed here thinking back
At how I lost my head

Way back when the world was young
Long before this song was sung
I know someone must have hurt like me",Always Seem to Get Things Wrong,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"Look at the smoke rise higher
Look at the house go down in the fire
Down in the fire, down in the fire
Down in the fire, down in the fire

The flames are hot so you cannot stay 
Nothing to do now but turn away
Turn away, turn away
Turn away, turn away
And burn burn burn burn burn burn burn burn

Fly through the woods on the wings of desire
You fly from the world but you're down the the wire
Down to the wire, down to the wire
Down to the wire, down to the wire
So burn burn burn burn
Burn burn burn burn 
Burn burn burn burn",Burn,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"I don't need that
I don't need that
Keep it under your hat
I don't know when 
And I don't know how
I don't need that now

The wind has changed 
And turned me round
But didn't make any sound
I've moved ahead 
And closed that door
And I don't need that no more

I took a taste and lost my sight
There in the blinding light
But it broke me down
And turned me out
And I don't need that
I don't need that
I don't need that now",Don't Need That,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"One question I'd ask
Since nothing's gone as planned
Why do I keep running as fast as I can
Down roads that lead to nowhere
I will never understand

I took your warm hand
And led you past fountains
Where men played in string bands
Down from the mountains
We rolled along to nowhere
I will never understand
I will never understand

You long ahain for foreign lands
The lion's den and burning sand

One thing I ask
If I may ask something 
Give love to somebody
While I keep blowing 
Like wind forever nowhere
I will never understand
I will never understand",Forever Nowhere,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"Gone, gone, gone like a wave
Like the time that you gave
Like a bird on the wing
On the first day of spring

So just keep moving on
Cause everything is gone, gone, gone

Like today and tonight 
Like the sun out of sight

So just keep moving on
Cause everything is gone, gone, gone
So just keep moving on
Cause everything is gone, gone, gone",Gone Gone Gone,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"I have no idea, no idea
How you feel, how you feel
But how good just to see you
How good just to feel you

But I have no idea what to do
No idea, only you",I Have No Idea,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"One day you'll find 
I never changed my mind
Just went away with things I didn't say
I'd seen the tides drifting by

Beyond the scenes 
The distant tambourines
The sky
While I stood waiting there to leave

But why am I still waiting here to leave?
Though you stayed behind
I never changed my mind
I never changed my mind
I never changed my mind",I Never Changed My Mind,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"Are you gonna live out there by yourself
Out there by yourself alone?
Are you gonna give to no one but yourself 
No one but yourself alone?

And keep on spinning through an empty hall
Like reflections from a mirror ball
Round and round going nowhere?

Are you gonna stay up there in the clouds
Up there in the clouds so safe?

And keep on moving through and empty sky
Like a jet plane that's just passing by
Round and round landing nowhere?

Round and round going nowhere
Are you gonna stay out there by yourself
Out there by yourself alone, alone, alone?",Mirror Ball,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"Don't cry
I'll wait
Patient

While we pass through something

More than me
Larger than memory

So let go 
You must know
One thing

It's more than you
More than me
Larger than memory",More,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"No matter how long it takes
One day the dam will break
One day the tears will fall
Just like that waterfall

Down, down, falling down
Till the walls are crumbling

How can you be so strong
Tell me I don't belong 
But just like the plans you make
One day the dam will break

Down, down, falling down
Tumbling in the water

There's no place for you to hide
And no need to be so scared
When you know that I care

Think that you'll keep your mind
By leaving me behind
But it's not your mind at stake
And one day the dam will break
One day the dam will break
One day the dam will break",One Day the Dam Will Break,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"Treading lightly on the ground 
Trying not to make a sound 
Tell me which way I should go 
Tell me cause I just don't know 

Walking softly through the air 
Trying so hard not to care 
But I'm failing, failing bad 
Feeling like I've just been had 

What's this silence from within? 
Open the door and let me in 

Running on these rolling wheels 
Trying so hard not to feel 
But the demon seems to know 
Follows everywhere I go 

What's this darkness in the sky? 
Open the ground and let me die 

Sinking in the rolling sea 
Waves are crashing over me 
To another sea below 
Sinking steadily and slow 

There's a current pulling strong 
Open your eyes, and I'll be gone",Open Your Eyes,2004
Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"See you out on the floor
Where the speakers blast
Dancing while the music lasts

Up and above the stars shine
On the nights you've passed
Dancing while the music lasts
Dancing while the music lasts

Teach me I want to know
How you move so fast
Dancing while the music lasts
Dancing while the music lasts

Waking up tomorrow 
This will be the past

Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"Remember feeling so alone?
Remember feeling like going home?
You never meant to be so cold
You never meant to let her go

Wild wild wild wild wild wild
Wild wild wild wild eyes

Remember feeling so alive
Waiting for the sun to rise?

Wild wild wild wild wild wild

Jesse Harris & the Ferdinandos,"Blowing through Indian summer night sky
I'd fly straight to nowhere
But I'm grounded down here in the city
With these faces stern and pretty
And in the station where no one says a word
I wish I was a bird

If I listen to somebody speaking
I can only hear waves breaking
Out at the ocean 
The wind whips every word
I wish I was a bird",Wish I Was a Bird,2004
Jesse James,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

Jesse James,"Scarred beneath my skin 
Reminds me what a mess I'm in 
But I keep holding on 
The walls are caving in 
I'm missing everything
I hope I survive 
What about my pride 
What about my time 
What about the soul I've been searching for 
What about the truth 
What about the lies 
You know I hope you never see me lose my mind 
Running out of line 
Ask too much this time 
These days when nothing's real 
You can take your time 
Getting motion sick and tired 
And find it's all you know 
What about my pride 
What about my time 
What about the soul you've been searching for 
What about the truth 
What about the lies 
You know I hope I never see you lose your mind 
This tastes like higher ground Pushing away the hope you found 
This tastes like higher ground Around and around and around",Higher Ground,2002
Jesse James,"verse 1: 
its not the way you walk., 
its not the way you hold your fork, 
its not the stupid things you say in bed when i come in your face. 
the way you hold a cigarette, 
the way you smile when you're wet, 
the way you make me cups of tea when i stay round at your place.

'bout who you are or who you're not

(Oh wo oh)

Baby, if you would only talk to me
I think you'd know just what was going on
Baby, if you'd open your eyes and see
A broken heart, say now I know what's wrong
(Yes I do)

I tried to do the best I could for you
Gave you everything you could want
For that I lived in violent misery
But no more now since she came along
(Since she came along)

(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist

Baby, if you could only see through me
I think you'd know just how I really feel
Lately, she's more than just a fantasy
My love for her I no longer conceal

Her sexy body makes me lose control
She makes it very hard to keep my cool
She said she'll never leave me out in the cold
I guess you know by now I'm over you
(Over you)

(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist

She's never tried to hurt me, baby
Or tried to fool around
She wants to show me how to party, baby
Come on, girl, ya got to let me scream and shout

(Oh wo oh)
She, I can't resist
(Oh wo oh)

Baby, if you would only dance with me
I think you'd know just what was going on

I play the game even though I go up in flames and I'm burning down tonight.

Passengers sit row to row 
The flight staff served the curry chicken!
And then I heard the turbine go
Yeah...

Out of my window was the sunset, 
On the wing a funny glow, 
Then my seat started rattling, 
Assured that wasn't part of the show, 

So I started to dance, 
Without wearing no seat belt
So I started to dance, 
Without wearing no life vest, 
I started to dance.. 

My plane noise went down, 
I heard the pilot talk regrets, 
But the people didn't panic, 
They just all, stared at me, 

And they started to dance, 
Without wearing no seat belts, 
We all started to dance, 
Without wearing no life vest, 
We all started to dance,

And books we never read
Well I was hoping one day
We might meet again

She was born in June
She danced with strangers and celebrities
Empty stars and the full moon

I was thinking about the universe
For what its worth
Or the one about the Phoenix bird
That died and then returned

Now greatly enjoyed with courage

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places

Fear is a powerful drug
Overcome it and
You think that you can do
Anything

Should I
Save myself
For later
Or generously give

Fear of
Losing
Energy
Is draining

It locks up your chest
Shuts down the heart
Miserly
And stingy
Let's open up, share

When I once was
Fearless
Innocence roared
Still amazes

Untouchable
Innocence
It's still here
But in different places",Russian Roulette,2008
Jesse Malin,"Did you ever wake up to find
A day that broke up your mind?
Destroyed your notion of circular time

It's just that demon life
Got you in its sway
It's just that demon life
Got you in its sway

Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground
For all my friends out in the burial ground
Can't stand this feeling, getting so brought down

It's just that demon life
Got you in its sway
It's just that demon life
Got you in its sway

There must be ways to find out
Love is the way they say
Is really strutting out, oh

One day I woke up to find
Right in the bed next to mine
Someone that broke me up
With a corner of her smile

It's just that demon life
Got me in its sway
It's just that demon life
Got me in its sway

It's just that demon life
It's just that demon life

It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep how do you sleep.

I tried my best at moving on have yet to find a girl like you
I see things that I didn't before and I'm wishing I had more time with you,
How do you stay awake knowing all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about that never will happen again if I could just see you

If I had my way I'll get'cha girl

Around my way where we used to park and did all those things.

Baby all that I hear from my friends again and again (they come and ask about you) (they say)
We saw your girl at the game and dang we gotta say a big mistake by you.
Not only does your body bang but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you couldn't sleep can't think can't eat till I come see you

Eh eh eh

I met this girl down the block from me
Used to tell myself
She was too hot for me
But then I saw her
At the corner store
So I ran on over
Just to grab the door

I got her number
We started chillin'
We started buzzin'
And got addicted
Now I, I'm the one she can't live without
I bet that's her right now

Shorty hitting me up
Says she wanna re-up
Knows I got the best in town
'Cause when she get the shivers
She knows that I deliver
I'm the one who holds her down

She's about to break
Break, break, break, break
And I won't let her wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait

It's gettin' kinda late
Late, late, late, late
And she just want to shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake!

One day she started texting me
Asking if she could borrow that recipe
I told her, loving you is my specialty
She said, well, give it up, up, give it up, up

When she's away, it's such a downer
And I, miss her evey time I'm not around her
'Cause she, she's the one I can't live without
I hope that's her right now

Shorty hitting me up
Says she wanna re-up
Knows I got the best in town
'Cause when she get the shivers
She knows that I deliver

And she just want to shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake!

I'm hooked on her
Must admit it
I'd do, I'd do anything to get her
She's hooked on me
I'm bad habit
She'd do, She'd do anything to have me
When she calls, I know
Exactly what she wants from me
Every time I hear my phone ringing
She wants to shake it with me

Says she wanna re-up
Knows I got the best in town
'Cause when she get the shivers
She knows that I deliver

Can't believe that I'm late again
Put down about a quart of caffeine
To start my pulse and then
I grabbed my jeans off the floor
Then I hit the door

It goes to show
You never know
When everything's about to change

It started out like any other
Just another girl who took my breath away
Then she turned around
She took me down
Just another day that I had the best day of my life

Can't say exactly what it was 
She's not the usual type
She wore a cowboy hat with her red Prada boots
And a Gwen Stefani smile
Then pulled out a pen
And surprised me when
She wrote her number on my hand

Then she was gone
But from now on I'm gonna be a different man

You got the ring that better get off of us
Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice and throw your arms in the air

Cause it's a good life so why y'all trippin'
The good life slippin' away

If you're boss is giving you pressure
Let go, take a breather in the park
You've got to find out what's your pleasure
In time you'll be singing like a lark
Pretty soon your sorry will chime for all
Somebody will heed your call
Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice, throw your arms in the air

Trade in some misery for some tender loving care
Cast aside those cloudy days fuses are all to bear
Make up your mind get a whole new lease on life

Reach out for a comfortable chair
Rejoice throw your arms in the air

Let go, take a breather in the park

In time you'll be singing like a lark
Pretty soon your sorry will chime for all
Somebody will heed your call
Leave all your troubles and pain
And rise like Phoenix from the flame

Jesse McCartney,"She left me hangin' by a thread again
I stood there waiting like a fool for her
I never dreamed that I'd be in this place
But here I am all alone
It's not the first time that she's walked away
Changed all our plans within the blink of an eye
And looking back it's always been the same
But I refused to see it all for what it was

Has anybody ever felt this way
Has anybody been ripped apart
Anybody give everything to the one they love
Am I the only one left behind
Am I the only one who hates goodbyes
God I know this can't go on forever

I wonder if she ever thinks of me
And all the promises she swore to keep
Some nights I lay in bed just burning up
'Cause I know that she's out with someone else

Has anybody ever felt this way
Has anybody been ripped apart
Anybody give everything to the one they love
Am I the only one left behind
Am I the only one who hates goodbyes
God I know this can't go on forever

I was the one who gave up everything for her
When no one would listen I heard every word, oh
It took me so long to see that maybe I am better off alone

Has anybody ever felt this way
Has anybody been ripped apart
Anybody give everything to the one they love
Am I the only one left behind
Am I the only one who hates goodbyes

You go before I get the chance
You know you got me trippin'
Thinkin' about you every day and night
But I can't get to know you
You don't know I'm alive

And you're loading up the car
I see you when I'm at the concert
When the lights go dark
There's something kinda fun if I ever get the chance
There's only three words I wanna ask

What's your name?

Jesse McCartney,"Girl, there's somethin' 'bout me things you ought to know
I've never felt the need to lose control
Always held on back and played it slow, but not this time
Baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything

Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me

Ooh, right where you want me, woah, woah

Girl, I'm gonna let you have your way with me
But when you move like that it's hard to breathe
I never thought that it could be like this, but I was wrong
Baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything

Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy, let's do something maybe, please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me

Can't explain it, how you swept me
Off my feet unexpectedly, in slow motion
My imagination's on me, tryin' to keep my body still
Oh, I can hardly stand the thrill, yeah

Well, baby, don't be gentle, I can handle anything

Baby, take me on a journey, I've been thinkin' lately
I could use a little time alone with you

Jesse McCartney,"Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough, but it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen
But something happened, for the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground, found something true
And everyone's looking round, thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal, is to keep me from falling
But nothings greater, than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me, thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars, for everyone to see

I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein, that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love

So I need to see some hands

All I really need to know

I'll be that good thing that you just can't put down

Get up in my canopy
Bring that over here girl and talk to me
While you're on your back I'ma touch you slowly
Keep you paralyzed so you barely move

Feel like I just struck gold you a fantasy
So tell me what's the business babe
Got me about to pop genie in a bottle
Let's make a toast 'cause I'ma cherish you

Now girl it's your turn to take the reins
Now show me what you're gonna do
'Cause girl I got your remedy

Do it do it do it
Again look at that

Baby your soft skin is every indication to me
That you need me to hold protect you from the cold
And then just sing you to sleep
I got so much left to give but I found a recipient
Yeah I can trust the two of ya
Everything they told me
Right before the sex with me

Now girl it's your turn to take the reins
Now show me what you're gonna do

We've run out of reasons, really why we together?
We both know it's over baby bottom line
It's best we don't even talk at all
Don't call me even if I should cross your mind
Hard enough, I don't need to hear your voice on my messages
Let's just call it quits it's probably better so if I'm not returning your calls it's cause

Cause I'm not coming back I'm closing the door
I used to be trippin' over missin' you but I'm not any more
I got the picture phone baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile every time you dialed

Cause it's over girl you know it's over this time
So when you call I'm pressin' 7 don't wanna hear your messages messages
I'm tryna erase you from my mind
Cause it's over I swear girl it's over this time
So don't keep callin' leavin' messages don't wanna know where you been
Baby cause it's over

I still wake up every morning quarter to ten
Still eat my cereal right at the kitchen table
I can't even remember how long it's been
When your troubles stayed and occupied
Oh, ask about you whenever I come around
I do what I can not to put my business in the streets
Last thing I need is another episode keep conversations short and sweet because

Cause I'm not coming back I'm closing the door
I used to be trippin' over missin' you but I'm not any more
I got the picture phone baby, your picture's gone
Couldn't stand to see your smile every time you dialed

Baby cause it's over

You know that it's over when the burnin' and the yearnin' inside your heart ain't there anymore
And you know that you're through when
She don't do to you and move you like the way she moved you before
And you wanna pull her close, but your heart has froze you kiss her but her eyes don't close
Then she goes out of your heart forever and it hurts you but you know that it's better

You'd say that I had it made and I was all for the commitment
But then she started wantin' more from me
And my mind began to change suddenly I didn't feel the same
I didn't know what I was doing

I was dodging commitment start but don't finish
My aim was always the same girl I know I been trippin'
I'm confessin' I'm confessin' so baby just hear me out
I'm confessin' I'm confessin' so baby just see me off
I wanna show my heart but I don't know where to start

So I keep runnin'

Why am I breakin' away
I keep runnin'
So scared of the heartbreak
So scared of makin' mistakes
I keep runnin'
When all I really need is you
All I really need is you
But I keep on runnin' away

I caught a second wind of happiness when I met this girl
And then we became the best of friends we went
From half full to half empty I took a detour tryin' to find myself
But I'm on this road again want out of this box I'm in
I made it harder to be with me

I was dodging commitment start but don't finish
My aim was always the same girl I know I been trippin'

No I can't keep up runnin' this marathon
No need to rest when I already won
And if I got you by my side girl I already won

It's like lookin' for a treasure when it's already mine
It don't make sense don't make sense
No matter how hard I try to define
I'm comin' face to face with myself
I know I don't need don't need no one else
So can somebody tell me where I'm goin'
So can somebody tell me where I'm goin'

I hate to say it but you know I'm right
Every time you're up you're callin' for me late at night
But now that you ain't got me tell me where you goin' be
Cause I can't take you back no my heart wont let me

Girl you know he can't touch like I do
I don't see you trippin' or flippin' over his moves
Don't take a genius to see he ain't that dude
But you let him back you don't know what you was on
When you said said he was the one
Baby yes you said said you were in love
When you left me you said that you wouldn't be
Comin' back remember that but I never agreed

I hate to say it but I told you so
Told you if you left that you were goin' be miserable
Guess he don't do it like me
Or else you wouldn't be
Runnin' back to the past it was you that left me
I hate to say it but you know I'm right
Every time you're up you're callin' for me late at night
But now that you ain't got me tell me where you goin' be
Cause I can't take you back no my heart wont let me

You fell on hard times it seems but you ain't getting no sympathy
No baby not from me cause I told you you should never leave
See you chose this road so you gotta go it alone
Remember I told you so

I hate to say it but I told you so
Told you if you left that you were goin' be miserable
Guess he don't do it like me
Or else you wouldn't be
Runnin' back to the past it was you that left me
I hate to say it but you know I'm right

Jesse McCartney,"Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know
It you're frozen

But something happened
For the very first time
With you
My heart melts
Into the ground
Found something true
And everyone's
Looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy

But I don't care
What they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know
The truth
My heart's crippled
By the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds
Fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal
Is to keep me from falling

But nothings greater
Than the rush that comes
With your embrace
And in this
World of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks
That I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care
What they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know
The truth
My heart's crippled
By the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

And it's draining all of me
Oh, they find it
Hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see

But I don't care
What they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know
The truth
My heart's crippled
By the vein
That I keep on closing

What's she doing?

She got up out of her seat,
Nowhere to be found (found)
Her girlfriends lookin for her
They don't know we fooling around (round)

She told me she ain't never met no one that made her wanna
And she don't know what it is that has come over her
She giving me signals, like she don't (she don't) fell in love

Jesse McCartney,"Used to be the richest
But I didn't pay attention
Messed around and maxed out of love
So now my hearts empty

I used to wake up daily
In the arms of a blessing
Couldn't see what was right in front of me
It taught me a lesson

Went around here hittin' these clubs
Throwing up money
Picking up girls
Bring 'em back to the house on the hill
Two at a time
Pop 'em like pills
When my prize was sittin' at home
Waiting for me all along
Never thought that one day I'd come home
And she'd be gone

She was the one that got away
The one I regret
My biggest mistake
She was my Mrs. Wife
Miss I can spend my life
It's too late, now she's miss mistake
She should've been my Mrs.
Don't wanna move on but I know that she has
Now every other I compare to her
She was my Mrs. Wife
Miss I can spend my life
It's too late, now she's Ms. mistake
She should've been my Mrs.

I'm not asking for.. what we had before
Took my loss like a man its over now I understand

Oh, I messed up what we had
Oh, could've been the mother of my kids

Oh, I knew just what I did
Now I gotta live with it

You really didn't take that long
The lies got old, the bed got cold
Shut her heart up, closed the door
Told me no, not no more

So I gotta respect her wishes
She deserves more than I've given
And I'll probably be okay if I can get her out of my brain

She was the one that got away
The one I regret
My biggest mistake
She was my Mrs. Wife
Miss I can spend my life
It's too late, now she's miss mistake
She should've been my Mrs.
Don't wanna move on but I know that she has
Now every other I compare to her
She was my Mrs. Wife
Miss I can spend my life
It's too late, now she's Ms. mistake
She should've been my Mrs.

Mrs. Settle down
No more sleepin' around
Mrs. Picket Fence
Mrs. Brand New House

But I screwed it up
I misstepped out of luck
Had a good one
Now she's got a new mister

If there's a brother out there
That understands then help me say yeah, yeah whoa oh oh

Anybody that knows you better go and help say whoa oh oh

She was the one

Oh, oh,oh,oh

She was the one that got away
The one I regret
My biggest mistake
She was my Mrs. Wife

It's too late, now she's miss mistake
She should've been my Mrs.

You walk in and throw your hands up
Screaming at me, you're fucking fed up
I do my best to tryna make up
And calm ya back down

Jesse McCartney,"The selfish part of me needs for you to stay
'Cause girl you keep a smile stretch across my face
And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now
The way your lips move when you say my name
The smell of your hair on my pillow case
And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now
If I'd had it my way I'd never let you walk out the door
And my heart is heavy with something that I just can't ignore

Girl, I'm sitting here wondering what it is that we've done
Baby who am I to be that other guy?
'Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice,
I know what it's like from the other side
So baby who am I to be that other guy?

This could be our home girl, a special place
Something much more than your great escape
Girl I would give anything now if you didn't had everything now
It doesn't have to hear that you feel the same
You tell me that your love for me would never change
Unless you change everything now it doesn't mean anything now
If it's him that you've chosen, then we need to stop closing the door
'Cause while he's at home waiting, we can't pretend there's something more

Dream of me and I'll be dreaming of you

I've been a lot of places but there's just no place like home
And I'm always on my way back to you every minute that I'm gone

Close your eyes and think of me and you can feel me in your heart

And for each mast cut down another sapling is grown 
Then I could believe that I`m bound to find 
A better life than I left behind 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed 
Red, white and blue 
Green, white and gold 

So I had to leave from my country of birth 
As for each child grown tall 
Another lies in the earth 
And for every rail we laid in the loam 
There`s a thousand miles of the long journey home 

But as you ascend the ladder 
Look out below where you tread 
For the colors bled as they overflowed

But your lips deceived me and told me a lie

Are you all alone
With a memory
Now that I am gone
Darling, are you missing me

Out of the clear sky a letter then came
And just like a bolt from the blue
My castles came tumbling a I read it o'er
I still can't believe that it's true

The glitter of gold turns your head
And while I was trying employment to find
You married another instead",Are You Missing Me?,1994
Jesse McReynolds,"Now let me tell a story, I can tell it all
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey, the son, he drove the load
And when his engine roared, they called the highway thunder road

Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis Town
The revenuers, they chased him, but they couldn't run him down
Each time they thought they had him, his engine would explode
He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder road

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

On the first of April, 1954
The federal man sent word, he better make his run no more
He said 200 agents were covering the state
Whichever road he'd try to take, they'd get him sure as fate

“Son”, his daddy told him, “Now make this run your last
Your tank is filled with 100 proof, you're all tuned up and gassed
Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through
I'd rather have you back again than all that mountain dew”

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

Roaring out of Harlan, revving up his mill
He shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed through Maynardville
With G-men on his tail light, roadblocks up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to tread

Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden, there they made the fatal strike
He left the road at ninety, that's all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day

There was thunder, thunder over thunder road
Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his load
There was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst
The law they swore they'd get him, but the devil got him first

",Ballad of Thunder Road,1994
Jesse McReynolds,"I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dance
I heard that old jukebox playing
A song about a truck driving man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that truck driving man

The waitress just brought me some coffee
I thanked her but called her again
I said that old song sure does hit me
'Cause I'm a truck driving man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that truck driving man

I climbed back aboard my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got that old truck wheels rollin'
I'm on my way to San Antone

For it is the best in the land

And play that truck driving man
And play that truck driving man

The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me
You loved someone else
And you asked me if I could forget

That's when I'll stop loving you

You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds

If you're sad and you don't know what to do
And you feel that no one cares about you
I will always be waiting for you

Oh, I can't forget the day that you told me
That you'd love me and be my sweetheart
But it looks like, my dear you've forgotten
For you say now that we have to part

T'was on the day that I first met her
That I told her of her love.

Many a night we'd stroll together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
For I know I'll meet her there.

On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain, I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose, so rich a crown

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live

Like birds over water

Oh, what did I have?

Oh, what did I have then?

Don't say it's over

Of the dreaming dead

Turn off the past
Only in your arms

And could you run the distance
In the time that it takes
Before it all fell apart?

Stole the sheets and burned the maps
Watched the smoke ï¬?y from the stacks
Before it all fell apart

Particles on the fringe
There's a heaviness, this stillness brings
Those twisted palms, oh how they swing
Telling tales, young breathless things

Things that move on
Left wandering where the mystery's gone
We made it 'cross that frozen pond
Before it all fell apart

It needs protection
While it grows

Somebody show me
A place I can go where love's around

No way around this
No way around this troubled soul

I think I feel like dancing the night away

I got me this long legged girl
To help me to spend my dough
Her heart as big as your mama`s stove
And her body like Brigitte Bardot

I`m all ready for some Rock and Roll
With the guitar turned up loud
And the fancy footwork
And the (drunk) down, drugged up crowd

I feel good just like I knew that I would
All on account of that wine that I bought today
I`m smiling so sweet
At every little girl that I meet
Some fools will try to tell you it`s a sin to feel this way

It feels so funny having all of this money
I think I feel like dancing the night away

Who cut off all her hair
The scissors flew among the curls
And curls went everywhere

I gathered up her fallen locks
And carried them away
And put them in silver box
And keep them to this day

And we have all the fun

And I hope that you will stay

Specked with dirty cotton lint, and below the
Field runs a little shady creek, and there you'll
Find the cool green leaves of mint.

I think I smell the honeysuckle vine, 
The heavy sweetness like to make me sick. 
And the dogs, my God, they're hungry all the time 
And the snakes are sleeping where the weeds are thick.

Jesse Winchester,"I'll never forget that dreadful day
When I decided to run away
Little Sister was playin
With a kitten on the floor
Mama was rockin out on the front porch
And Daddy had gone to the grocery store
And Brother had left the day before

Packed my clothes when no one was lookin
Went out the back door and into the bushes
And down the holler and over the creek
Then up the hill and across the field
I jumped the fence and I thumbed a ride
Much too young to realize
That I'd regret all it by and by

And I wish I had the love that was offered to me
When I was just too young and blind to see
There was a whole lot of love in that old house
But I had to leave to find it out
And it seems like it was only yesterday

If I'da known then what I know now
I'da stayed right on my daddy's old farm
Just a young upstart
I thought I was smart
Tried to be a man when I was only a child
But many a time it comes to my mind
To pack my clothes and leave this town
And jump that fence and cross that field
And down the hill and over the creek
An up the holler and through them bushes
And in the back door when no one is lookin'
And accept the love that was offered to me

And I wish I had the love that was offered to me

We don't snuggle up and dance
To sweet old doo-wop tunes
And we don't kiss like Eskimos
And lock the bedroom door

That it would end this way

A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso

Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

That made a wreck out of me, Lord

I'd rather drink myself muddy water
Sleep all night in a hollow log
I'd rather drink a muddy water
Sleep all day and night in a hollow log
Than to hang around and now be put down
And treated like a dirty dog, listen

If you don't want me woman
Just say so ""That's all""
If you don't want me woman
All you gotta do is come around and say so ""That's all""
'Cause I can get myself more women
Than another two men or a passenger train can haul, hit it

There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life
