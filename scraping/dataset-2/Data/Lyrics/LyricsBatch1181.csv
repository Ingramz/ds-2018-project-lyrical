The Suicide Machines,"War for profit can nothing stop it
punish those unloyal war for oil
we dominate we obliterate
world economics and other countries
U.S. policy hands in everything
our intervention ends in destruction
collateral damage the pack is rabid
foaming at the mouth awaiting the feast

[Chorus]
Your Silence 
Your Silence 
Equals your death

War for peace it doesn't fool me
the guise of freedom blindly leading them
foolish sense of pride for the rich you die
media whitewash blood is the cost
the innocent dead use your fucking head
Protest and survive don't believe their lies
A million reasons to believe 'em
A million reasons A million reasons

Equals Your Death 
Equals Your Death 
Equals Your Death 
Equals Your Death

You said politics don't concern me and that's
just fine so sing along to the radio's love song
and when they reinstate the draft you'll be the
first to go you're 23 so when you're in Iraq
staring into the eyes of the man who's the enemy
with skud missles streaming over your head remember
when you said ""Politics don't concern me""
what you gonna do it's either gonna be him or
you what you gonna do you're just a pawn you're
just a tool what you gonna do gonna die at the
age of 23 what you gonna do still say ""It Doesn't
Concern me""

Hey! What went wrong?
Hey! I don't know why
Hey! I might as well try! Buy

Well, I looked around this crazy place and tried to make some sense of it
Robbed a bank and stole a car and tried to put some dents in it
And everybody is playing games
I don't know what to make of it
Don't play your stupid games you know I don't need all that fucked up shit

No one ever told me I was gonna get older
Turned 21 and I thought my life was over
Took a long time to get where I am now
And I'm not gonna sit around wondering how, no!

Well I listen to your fuckin' shit I can't make any sense of it
'Cause what goes in does not come out, you've gotta put two cents in it
You're just a blob of fuckin' jell you're brain is floating in space
And if your brain was worth a quarter I'd get twenty-six cents back in change!

No one told me that the grass would be greener
I've done a lot of things since the last time that I seen her
No one ever told me it would be this way
That's why you can't make any sense out of anything I say!

My world is crumbling and I don't know what to do
It's falling down around me 'cause I'm thinking of you
If we take a look at our world today
Are our morals on decline or have we all gone insane?

Hey! What went wrong?

Hey! I might as well try!",Heyska!,2006
The Suicide Machines,"If you're fucked up on the inside, then you're fucked up on the outside
Doesn't matter what you say or do
Doesn't matter what you think is true
Don't look for peace on the outside man
Just look for peace on the inside
Doesn't matter what the others say cause all those mouths get in the way

You're just too hip, you're just too cool
But everybody knows that you're just a fucking fool
And you'll carry that ""cool"" until the day you die
Cause you're still full of shit and you're turning 25

If you want to know the answers, then you've gotta ask the questions
""Who am I?"" and ""who is she?""
And ""does it matter anyway?""
You've got to look for love on the inside man
Don't look for love on the outside
Doesn't matter what the others say, cause all that shit gets in the way

You can't love me, and you can't love you
Where'd it all go wrong? cause I wish I really knew
That color's all the same through color blind eyes,
And if you think you're so different then you're wasting your time",Inside/Outside (Reprise),2006
The Sultans of Swing,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone

The Summer Obsession,"Tonight

I'm trapped in a world that I can't take
Where everything's unrealistic and fake
I'm hiding out and planning my escape
I hope, I'm not the only one

Please come, rescue me tonight

I just wish that I could disappear
(Disappear)
Someone take me far away from here
(Far from here)
Do you suppose there's more to life out there?

There's no happiness surrounding me
Hate and ugliness is all I see
I wanna leave it all behind

Someone take me far away from here
(Far from here)

I wanna know if there's a purpose to this life
Will I ever find it? I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Trapped in a world that I can't take
Hiding out and planning my escape

So pack it up, let's run away, run away.

I know them bruises ain't from fallin' down,
They seem to show when your drunk Dad's around.
We can go whenever you let go (whenever you let go)

Away together, holding on to one another.
I'll steal the car, steal the credit cards,
We'll run forever, holding on to one another.

This is the day, and tonight, I'll be there.
You know the time, you know the time don't be scared.
Get all your CDs, get all your posters,
Get what you need from their wallets and their purses.

And when we're all alone
With no one there to bother

Imagine if we never tried
To be something we're not
We forgot how it feels
To be tight, to be close, to be real

And I miss you
And I wish you were here
I stopped breathing
When you said, you don't care anymore

You're caught up in your plastic life
(Plastic life)
Changing right before my eyes
A chameleon, I used to know you
Like the back of my mind
Did that part of you die?

And I miss you
And I wish you were here
I stopped breathing
When you said, you don't care anymore

And I'm scared
(Don't, don't leave me alone)
(I'm home having nothing anyway, anyway)
And I'm scared
(Standin' on the corner in the pourin' rain)
(Gotta find a drug that will keep me sane like you)

I watch you from a distance
I remember all of those instances
When you smile, when you laugh, when you crash
When I'm there to catch you when you fall

And I miss you
And I wish you were here
I stopped breathing
When you said, you don't care anymore

So tell me that you're doing fine
(And I miss you)
I still remember every time
(And I wish you were here)
And everyone I know will say
That you are always apart of me

And I miss you like you never knew

Flashes lead her down the runway,
She's my airplane,
Stares at the sun,
Looks down on everyone,
And keeps rocking those shades,her new shades.

I'm a city boy,
Living in the shadows of Times Square,
Praying to go somewhere,
And everyday I turn to gold and rock my shades,

And I will make it through this night alive, alive.
Can you find me,
In the midst of a crowd,
And do you dream of me when the lights go down,
And do you breathe me in the smoke from your cigarettes,
Do you feel me with every breath?

She's my high school sweetheart,
She keeps her red lipstick on,
And every morning she wakes up,
Puts on her make up, and sings my song,

And I will make it through this night alive, alive.
Can you find me,
In the midst of a crowd,
And do you dream of me when the lights go down,
And do you breathe me in the smoke from your cigarettes,
Do you feel me with every breath?

Pinned up by angels,
Can't catch my breath to speak,
Can't keep my monsters outta me

And do you breathe me in the smoke from your cigarettes,

A story about a girl.
No, you don't need to know what her name is,
But I wrote about her before.
I wish that I would figure it
Tucked down deep in her pockets.

Like a circus show.

Making me slur my words.

I'll always love her the same, my love

She swims through the sheets on the mattress.
She sets me on fire through the afterglow

To understand the complete 
Essence of others' minds

Something special for you

Your spontaneity 
Your high capacity 
To keep us at our ease

Every time 
You make me feel better 
Than I was before. 

If I could I would stay 
With you, 
In you,

Is that I'm here 
Not there

Yeah I could do now 
Is to hope and 
Wait for another trip",Spain,2005

Of what there was fine

The Sunny Cowgirls,"Well I'm the daughter of a truckie and since I was five years old 
I've been riding with my old man, I was rasied out on the road 
And I've seen every loney roadhouse for the Top End to the Bight
And I've been across the nullabor at least a dozen times

You think you really want me but there's some thing you should know
If you try to tie me down I'll just get up and go 

And if you're lookin' for me tomorrow morning, I'll be gone
And if you think I wouldn't leave without a warning, you'd be wrong
I'm a girl on the run and I'm running for my life
Don't come looking here if your looking for a wife
'cause I'll be gone

You can pull me on the dance floor you can buy me a rum
But don't look at me that way 'cause I'm not looking for the one
I've met every witless w*nker from the Kimberley to Cairns
And I'd trade a hundred lovers for a dozen ice cold cans

You think you really want me but there's some thing you should know
If you try to tie me down I'll just get up and go

Gone like a beer in a Friday night
Gone like a truckie in the morning light
Off like a rocket on outta sight, I'm gone

Gone like a beer in a Friday night
Gone like a truckie in the morning light
Off like a rocket on outta sight, I'm gone
Gone like your pride at a B&S 
Gone like a young bride's wedding dress
Gone like the Poms at an Ashes Test, I'm gone
Yeah I'll be gone

The Sunnyland Blues Band,"Sometimes life can hit so hard
It can knock you off your feet
Leave you stranded by the side of the road
Livin' on the street

I've been down that path before
From the bottom to the top
I kept pushin' for something more
And I didn't know how to stop

Save me from the madness
Save me from myself
Save me from the sadness
Of losing someone else

[Chorus]
Carry me carry me
Carry me carry me
Carry me home
Carry me home

When I'm down
You lift me up
When I'm out you reel me in
You have come to change my blood
Forgive me for my sins

[Chorus]

Save me from the darkness
Save me from the hardness
Carry me carry me
Carry me home

Just the other night
I saw a haunted man
He had a beautiful raincoat
I felt a pain of terrific sadness for him
Then I realized I was watching myself
Six months down the road

You know God
Only gives you
The things you sort out
Never the big stuff
That way he can make sure
That you stick around until
The end of the party

Save me from the darkness
Save me from the hardness

The ties that bound us
Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Tropical the island breeze

This is where I long to be

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

The Sunset Lounge Orchestra,"Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky

Did-did-did-did-you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did-you hear the falling bombs?
Did-did-did-did-you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Did-did-did-did-you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did-you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on

To make it all right
While sleep has taken you
Where I'm out of sight

I'll make my getaway
Time on my own
Search for a better way
To find my way home
To your smile

Wasting days and days
On this night
Always down and up
Half the night

Hopeless to reminisce
Through the dark hours
We'll only sacrifice
What time will allow us
You're sighing, sighing

All alone
Though you're right here
Now it's time to go
From your sad stare

""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

If you want to go and take a ride with me

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

The Supersonics,"My dream last night was about Ali Baba
With the forty thieves
Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
he was there with me

I rode through the valley with the princess by my side
The Duke and the Duchess was there to meet me with a smile

Alice was there in a Wonderland
Staring far away
The three blind mice was there with me
To tell the Teddybear the tale

The Teddybear came smiling there with a big smile
The little Bo-peep has lost a sheep last night

Aren't you the sovereign God of justice

Guess that we can only wonder why

Makes scores of saints sing praises like mahalia
Vital signs were flat lined in the earth three days time then
He rose again and ascended like sunshine

(chorus)
Who could it be who could it be the person of the trinity
Between one and three j-e-s-you-s see-h-are-I-s-t

Feared on every continent banned by many governments
Raise your voice against him and reveal your own
Incompetence
Many people hate him many people love him
Many far below him but you know there's none above him
Now there is an issue where I must turn my attention
It seems that people wish to serve a christ of their invention
True God true man otherwise you're anathema
Unsaved hell bound with a hellhound after ya

Deity one in three existing from eternity
Humiliated lacerated now reigning in glory
The comeback king of all time
No matter how dark it gets the truth shines
'cause in the heart of every man lies the knowledge of him
Displayed in creation but suppressed in sin
Don't believe me check out romans one to three
Still disagree you best check your theology




",Who Could It Be,2000
The Supertones,"The rain falls on the righteous and the wicked
Mine is not to reason why this is
In this I rest in this I find my refuge
That my thoughts and ways are not His
I spend my life on looking up the answers
It's rare that I can't find a reason why
But reasons fail at children without mothers
His plan is more than I can know

Have you ever held in doubt
What this life is all about
Have you questioned all these things that seem important to us
Do you really wanna know
Or are you a little scared
You're afraid that God is not really exactly what you'd have Him be
What should I hold to and what should I do
How do I know if anything's true
I'm somewhere in-between Canaan and Egypt
A place called the wilderness

I'm not one who always trusts their feelings
I don't believe in what you'd call blind faith
But faith that you can do all that you promised
And you said it all works for good
It's safe to say I don't see the big picture
I can't see the forest for the trees
And if five hundred lives
Were mine to get to know
You all could be spent on just this

God do you really understand what it's like to be a man
Have You ever felt the weight of loving all the things you Hate
Have You struggled have you worried
How can You sympathize

I have spoken too soon put my hand over my mouth
I can't contend with You
Your ways are so much higher
And we pass through the fire that Christ endured before us
When You were in the wilderness

So take my hand and walk this land with me
And walk this lovely land with me

And when we dig there ain't a better thing
Than a tune, than a tune, you can whistle or can croon

Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened
Ooh, and then it happened

Is it real, is it fake, is this game of life a mistake
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine
For certain, suddenly I started hurting
I saw the light too late, when that fickle finger of fate
Yeah came and broke my pretty balloon
I woke up, suddenly I just walked up to the happening

So sure, I felt secure, until love took a detour

You don't take care of, then you better beware of the happening",The Happening [DVD],
The Supremes,"Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time, I see reflections of you and me
Reflections of the way life used to be
Reflections of the love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now, no love to shield me
Trapped in a world that's a distorted reality
Happiness you took from me
And left me alone with only memories

Through the mirror of my mind, through these tears
That I'm crying reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone, I keep holding on
To the happy times, oh when you were mine

As I peer through the window of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays and all the love
I gave all in vain, all the love, all the love
That I've wasted, all the tears, all the tears
That I've tasted all in vain

Through the hollow of my tears, I see a dream
That's lost from the hurt that you have caused
Everywhere I turn, seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put all my faith and trust
Right before my eyes, my world has turned to dust
After all the nights, I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises are all that's left of loving you

Reflections of the love you took from me
In you I put all my faith and trust
Right before my eyes my world has turned to dust",Reflections [DVD],

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Lover, I surrender to my heart

And to resist you I try
But if you didn't continue I would die

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the Zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charmes us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers in the wilds
And starve together, dear in Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny on a roll
In Central Park, we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together
While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet

I'll search for wood
So you can cook
While I stand looking

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people
Who wants people?

When the steeple bell says
Good night, sleep well
We'll thank the small hotel together

That I've tasted

That you have caused

Bringin' you back again, hurtin' more and more.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
'Cause each day that passes by 
You got me never knowin' if I'm comin' or goin'
But I, I love you, this old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do.

These old arms of mine miss havin' you around
Makes these tears inside start fallin' down
Always with half a kiss you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start feelin' cause my head starts spinnin'.

'Cause I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do.

Ooo, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for a day, gone for the week now.

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
I'll tell the world about it.

Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be a run

I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Folly and fun
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right, so right
Thought I could turn emotion, on and off
I was so sure, so sure
But love taught me
Who was, who was, who was the boss

I?d defy
Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control
Whatever moved in my soul

I could tempt, touch, delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing

I was so right, so right
Thought I could turn emotion, on and off

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the Zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charmes us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers in the wilds
And starve together, dear in Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat bologny on a roll
In Central Park, we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street in July
Sweet push carts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wond'rous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

The Supremes,"Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness that was waiting there
You closed the door of your heart and turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked just one way
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh my darling, now you're gone

The Supremes,"Some things you never get used to

It's the same routine of getting up every morning
And putting on a smile
But underneath there's another person
Who can't find a reason to make living worthwhile

Ah, another day to get through
Without the love that once was mine
Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again
Like wanting you and not having you
I'll never get used to

I've gotten used to not listing
For familiar sounds you used to make
Now I'm trying to get out of the habit
Of calling your name first thing when I awake
Look here

It's like a child's first step
I have to learn to walk all, all over again
'Cause you were always there if I should fall
And now there's nobody else that I can call
It's like wanting you and not having you
I'll never get used to

Lost in a cloud
I think I caught a glimpse of you
Blindly I rush to touch your hand, huh
To discover it's my mind
Playing tricks on me again
Tricks on me again

Sometimes I think my heartaches come to an end
And then something brings them all back again

The Supremes,"Mom was cooking bread
She wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low
Rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her

In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train
I married a guy, was livin' high
I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, two years old
I never even showed her

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you are not to blame, Momma, I miss you

Came the telegram
Mom passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best, ah! cookin', cleanin'
Always in the same old dress
Workin' hard down on her knees
Always try'n to please
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me
Momma!  Momma!  Momma, do you hear me

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you've done your best
Momma, I miss you
Won't you forgive me Momma
For all the wrong I've done
I know you have done your best
I know you have done your very best you could
But I never understood

The Supremes,"Hey!  Life, look at me, I can see the reality
'Cause when you shook me, took me outta my world, I woke up
Suddenly I just woke up to the happening
When you find that you left the future behind
'Cause when you got a tender love you don't take care of
Then you better beware of

The happening
One day you're up, when you turn around
You find your world is tumbling down
It happened to me and it can happen to you

I was sure, I felt secure until love took a detour
Yeah!  Riding high on top of the world, it happened
Suddenly it just happened
I saw my dreams torn apart
When love walked away from my heart
And when you lose a precious love you need to guide you
Something happens inside you

The happening
Now I see life for what it is
It's not of dreams, it's not of bliss
It happened to me and it can happen to you
And then it happened
Oo, and then it happened
Oo, and then it happened
Oo, and then it happened

Is it real?  Is it fake?
Is this game of life a mistake?
'Cause when I lost the love I thought was mine for certain
Suddenly it starts hurtin'
I saw the light too late when that fickle finger of fate
Yeah!  It came and broke my pretty balloon

She wore a dirty raggety scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low
Rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate
I was always so ashamed for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown that I would be her

In a college town, away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train
I married a guy, was livin' high
I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, two years old
I never even showed her

I'm livin' in shame, Momma, I miss you
I know you are not to blame, Momma, I miss you

Came the telegram
Mom passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best, ah! cookin', cleanin'
Always in the same old dress
Workin' hard down on her knees

They always find Him there

To see the way we live
He'll always say

Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet.

I lied and said my mom died on a weekend trip to Spain.

I married a guy, was livin' high,
I didn't want him to know her,
She had a grandson, two years old, 
I never even showed her.

Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait how much more can I take
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hanging on
I remember mama said

Can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night
For some tender arms to hold me tight
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no
You just have to wait

Love Child, take a look at me.
 
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum.
My father left, he never even married Mom.
I shared the guilt my mama knew,
So afraid that others knew I had no name.
 
This love we're contemplating, is worth the pain of waiting.
We'll only end up hating the child we may be creating.

I knew the way it was to always live in doubt, 
To be without the simple things,

Don't think I don't want to please you.
No child of mine'll be bearing the name of shame I've been wearin'.

Lingers like a song

But I'll be right someday

Fills my lonely place
I see your face
Spinning through my brain
I know
I miss you so
I still love you
And it drives me insane

I just sleep walk

Walk inside the door

The Supremes,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.

Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating

I knew the way it felt, to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things

Don't think I don't wanna please you

And every day I thank you love
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting, so exciting

A tender melody
Pulling me closer
Closer to your arms

Then suddenly
(I hear a symphony)

A feeling so divine
'Till I leave the past behind

Every time your lips meet mine now, baby

You bring much joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on

Now baby, baby, baby
Those tears that seem my eyes
I cry not for myself
But for those who never felt the joy we felt

Whenever you're near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rap so day of love now

Baby, baby
As you stand holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air

It's another hungry mouth to feed

And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight

A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car,
Tries to run, but he don't get far

Is still hangin' on my frowning wall

Gettin' ready for the same old explosion

About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone to toll my bell

Keep waiting patiently (to fall in line).
You're hanging by a thread, 
So when you come to me.
I promise there'll be better days to see.

You want to make a stand
To make the smallest change, 
Or maybe save the world (I'll understand).
And if you need a hand
I just want you to know that you are not alone.",By a Thread,2005
The Swellers,"I've seen human suffering and I've seen human pain. 
I've seen catastrophe and I've seen people aiding in vain, 
But I can't stop it all so I'll just sit down 
And watch society burn to the ground. 

Watching as the world decays, 
Immunity's on full today. 
It's seems as if our problems are a channel change away. 

I turn off the TV 
'cause I don't care anymore. 
I see it every day. 
I'd rather look away instead of watch things go awry. 

I'd rather die alone than die how all the heroes die. 
Some people say that ignorance is bliss, but I kind of like it like this. 
Watching as the world decays, immunity's on full today. 

It's seems as if our problems are a channel change away. 
I turn off the TV 'cause I don't care anymore. I feel it every day.",Immunity,2005
