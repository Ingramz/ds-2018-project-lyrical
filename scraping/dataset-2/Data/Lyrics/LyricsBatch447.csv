Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Ladies and gentleman
Mr.Y is pleased to present to you
His final surprise of the season
A command performance by Christine Daae
The most heavenly diva of this or any age

But first, for those of you
Whose taste is a little more earth-bound
The sweet-heart of the midway
The Oolala Girl
The incomparable
Meg Giry

I took a little trip to Coney Island
To get away from all the city sprawl
I couldn't bear to choose which bathing suit to use
So goodness me, I guess I brought 'em all

But when at last I got to Coney Island
And found myself a spot upon the sand
I noticed something strange, there was no place to change
Uh, oh
And so I asked my friends to lend a hand

Girls
Aah, ooh
Bathing beauty
Take a look at you

Bathing beauty on the beach
Bathing beauty, say hello
What a cutie, what a peach
Bathing beauty, watch her go

Posing under her parasol
She is what you call a real spectacle
Prim and proper with classic poise
But she's got the boys at the plaque to call

Bathing beauty on the beach
See her practically glow
Wearing the smile and hitting Coney Island
Bathing beauty of a show

Bathing beauty on the beach
Stripes
Ooh, what a cutie, what a peach
Spots

Ooh, bathing beauty, bathing beauty
Checks, checks
Checks, checks, checks, checks
Oops

Bathing beauty on the beach
See her practically glow
Taking the sun and see all the boys are running
Go and unclothe her and get a tan all over

Wearing a smile and hitting Coney Island
The bathing beauty of our show
Bathing beauty, say hello

Ladies and Gentlemen, these were the very, the 'Oohlala Girls'
In just a moment, Christine Daa
The worlds most celebrated
Will be making her American debut her at Phantasma
But first, performing fist, of miraculous, muscular strength
The mighty",Bathing Beauty,2010
Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Who are you, where are you taking me?
I'm Miss Fleck
The Mighty Squelch
Doctor Gangle
At your service
And his

Come along and follow us, come and follow faster
Come along and follow us, come and meet the master
Hurry up and follow us, hurry if you care to
Soon the dark will swallow us, follow if you dare to

Is this where Mr. Y lives?
This is where he works
Step lively, child
He is waiting

What is this place?
This is my realm, illusion's domain
Where music and beauty and art are first rate
Go look around while I finish my work

May I?
Does the young Vicotme play?
What's this?
Just a song I have made
Go on

I think it's beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful notes
Beautiful, beautiful sounds
Don't you agree?
It's beautiful

This boy
So very beautiful
This music
Music that comes on control

He plays like me
Floating and lovely and bold
He's just 10 years old
10 years old

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Have you ever yearned to go
Past the world you think you know?
Been enthralled to the call
Of the beauty underneath?

Have you let it draw you in
Past the place where dreams begin?
Felt the full breathless pull
Of the beauty underneath?

When the dark unfolds its wings
Do you sense the strangest things?
Things no one would ever guess
Things mere words cannot express?

Yes

Do you find yourself beguiled
By the dangerous and wild?
Do you feed on the need
For the beauty underneath?

Have you felt your senses surge
And surrendered to the urge?
Have been hooked as you looked at the
At the beauty underneath?

When you stare behind the night
Can you glimpse its primal might?
Might you hunger to possess
Hunger that you can't repress?

Yes
It seems so beautiful
So strange yet beautiful
Everything's just as you say

And he's so beautiful
Perhaps too beautiful
What I suspect cannot be
And yet somehow, we both see
The very same way

Is the music in your head
Have you followed where it led?
And been graced with a taste
Of the beauty underneath?

Does it fill your every sense
Is it terribly intense?
Tell me you need it too
Need the beauty underneath

When it lifts its voice and sings
Don't you feel amazing things?
Things you know you can't confess
Things you thirst for nonetheless

It all so beautiful
Can it be?
Almost too beautiful
Do you see what I see?

To him it's beautiful
My world is beautiful
How can this be what it seems?
All of my most secret dreams
Somehow set free

You can feel the lift
(Yes)
Come closer
(Yes)
You've no fear of the beauty underneath

You can face it
(Yes)
You can take it
(Yes)
You see through to the beauty underneath

To the splendor
(Splendor)
And the glory
(And the glory)
To the truth of the beauty underneath
(The beauty underneath)

You'll accept it
(Yes)
You'll embrace it
(Yes)
Let me show you the beauty underneath

To the splendor

You'll accept it

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"I should have known that you'd be here
I should have known it all along
This whole arrangement bears your stamp
You're in each measure of that song
How dare you try and claim me now?
How dare you come invade my life?

Oh, Christine, my Christine
In that time when the world thought me dead
My Christine, on that night just before you were wed
Ah, Christine, you came and found where I hid
Don't you deny that you did
That long ago night

That night

Once there was a night beneath a moonless sky
Too dark to see a thing, too dark to even try
I stole to your side to tell you I must go
I couldn't see your face but sensed you even so

And I touched you
And I felt you
And I heard those ravishing refrains
The music of the pulse
The singing in your veins

And I held you
And I touched you
And embraced you
And I felt you

And with every breath and every sigh
I felt no longer scared
I felt no longer shy
At last our feelings bared
Beneath a moonless sky

And blind in the dark, as soul gazed into soul
I looked into your heart and saw you pure and whole
Cloaked under the night with nothing to suppress
A woman and a man, no more and yet no less

And I kissed you
And caressed you
And the world around us fell away
We said things in the dark
We never dared to say

And I caught you
And I kissed you
And I took you
And I begged you

With a need too urgent to deny
And nothing mattered then
Except for you and I
Again and then again
Beneath a moonless sky

And when it was done before the sun could rise
Ashamed of what I was, afraid to see your eyes
I stood while you slept and whispered a goodbye
And slipped into the dark beneath a moonless sky

And I loved you
Yes, I loved you
I'd have followed anywhere you led
I woke to swear my love
And found you gone instead

And I loved you
(How I loved you)
And I left you
(And I loved you)

And I had to, both of us knew why
We both knew why
And yet I won't regret
From now until I die
The night I can't forget
Beneath a moonless sky

And now
How can you talk of now?
For us, there is no now",Beneath A Moonless Sky,2010

Yeah, and her art is payin' off your gamblin' debts

What a cutie, what a peach
Bathing beauty, watch her go
(Alright, Meg, take 5, girls, take it one more time)
Bathing beauty, on the beach

Very nice, Meg
Do you think so, mother, really?
You've come a long way since the beginning of the season
Does he agree?
It's been three months, he never comes to see the show
Even a word from him, just one

You may get more than that
He has been composing again, late at night
Not this cheap Vaudeville trash, something glorious
For, for me?
Continue to work hard
Make yourself useful to him

Mother
Patience, Gustave, first I must find the stage manager
My dressing room, the musical director
Then we'll go look for our friend and go see the island?
I'm sure he'll send for you when he's ready
Well, excuse me, miss, would you mind?

Heaven help me, could it be?
No, it couldn't possibly
Sorry, do I?
Yes, I think you do

Have we?
Go on, take a guess
Wait, it can't be, is it?
Yes
Oh, my God, I can't believe it's you

Look at you, Christine
Regal as a queen and beautiful
Meg, and you as well
I could hardly tell it's you

My dear old friend
Can't believe you're here, old friend
After all this time
So glad you came
You look sublime
You look the same

My sweet old friend
Never thought we'd meet, old friend
Look at you, a star
And you, a wife

And isn't life a splendid thing?
And here we are
To see the sights
And sing

To sing?
And of course, as a treat for my son
Meg, meet Gustave
Who hired you to sing here?

You
It can't be you
Is this a jest?
How can this be?

We've come to work
At whose request?
The contract's here
I want to see

My God, the price
It's rather high
Why, it's absurd
Oh, yes, I know

Inform your boss
That by the by
The fee goes up
Or else we go

My dear old friend
Here's how things appear, old friend
He who pays the bill
Times two or three
Be sure he will
And handsomely

And dear old friend
Now that we are clear, old friend
That's all very well but till you're gone
You'll wait upon my boss' whim
Ah, yes, your boss and who is that?
It's him

Sorry, did I hear you right?
Here to sing
Tomorrow night?
I'm afraid there must be some mistake

You can't be performing
Why?
Mainly, dear 'cause so am I
I'm in fact the star, for heaven's sake

What are you to sing?
Just one little thing, an aria
Please you needn't fret
I'm sure you will get your due

Him?
That's what I said
You work for him?
Now so do you

And my poor wife
We thought him dead
She'll be appalled
Unless she knew

Darling, please, are you alright?
(Tell me now, that music, who was its creator?)
Darling, please don't squeeze so tight
(Something's going on here, I'll deal with you later)

Did you know?
How could I know
Why would they come?
Why won't they go?

My dear old friend
Can't believe you're here, old friend
Speaking as your host
As an artist
What a surprise
To say the least

Yes, dear old friend
That's a happy tear, old friend
I can't conceal, try though I may
The way I feel so I pretend
I'm sure it's clear
To such a dear old friend

You mustn't stay
Why would I leave?
Why are we here?
Don't play naive

What dear old friends
Don't we all live here, old friends?
Nothing has been changed
And never will
Just rearranged
And yet we're still

Such grand old friends
Such devoted and old friends
Words cannot suggest
What's in my heart
And for the rest
Why even start?

My dear old friends
So much longer near, old friends
Back again at last
When everyone
Is doing great
Won't this be fun?

Enjoy your stay

Did you hear the crowd, the way they cheered, I hope you're proud
Did you like the new routine? Was it passable, I mean
I can change a thing or two, what should I do?
No, don't say it, I can guess, but I promise I'll progress

The Phantom: Yes, of course. Whatever you feel is best

Meg: Did the costume look okay? Too revealing, would you say?
People seemed to like the view

Madame Giry: Meg, please...

Meg: I could show a bit more skin, that would sure bring 'em in --

Madame Giry: Meg! Can't you see that the master's at work?
Can't you see that his mind's somewhere else?
Can't you see that obviously he's thinking of things more important than you?

The Phantom: Careful, Madame. You're forgetting yourself.

Madame Giry: Don't you see he forgot what this is?
Opening day, a big deal, what a fuss
Our success means not I guess compared to the things that the Master must do!

The Phantom: That's quite enough!

Madame Giry: Christine! Christine.

Meg: Christine...

Madame Giry: Meg, leave. Now!
In Paris, when the mob surrounded you, who was there? We were there.
Where was she when the low men hounded you? Gone, long gone. We stayed on.
Who concealed you safe away? Smuggled you up to Calet? Found a freighter out of France?

The Phantom: I don't see the problem. This is ancient history.

Madame Giry: And once here, when the side show hired you, who stood by? Meg and I
While they kept you on display, who kept working night and day?
Who gave you their very lives?
And who helped you buy that side show?
Who helped you finance you scheme? Who wouldn't quit 'till your act was a hit?
And your hit could become your dream?
Who played the politicians, lured investors and the press? No, not her
And who stayed with you, helped you and advised you?
We stayed with you, loved and idolized you
She betrayed you, shunned you and despised you!
She chose Raoul, chose his beauty and youth.
It's long past time you faced --

The Phantom: Enough! You'll be repaid as I promised you would. Now, if you've anything else left to say

Oh Christine, my Christine, yes you've fled from my face once before
But Christine, what we shared, even you can't ignore!

Our story had only begun
You chose to turn the page
And I made choices too

Once upon that other time
We did what we thought must be done
And now we have no choice
We do what we must do

We love, we live
We give what we can give
And take what little we deserve

Once upon another time
I knew how our story would end
And maybe I was wrong
But now the moment's gone

Were it still that other time
I'd make time itself somehow bend
But now I'm not that strong

What do you mean?
How could you think I wouldn't know?
Oh, no

Do you have something to confess?
Please don't make me
I want the truth right now, if so

Once upon another time
You went off and left me alone
But that's not all you did
You left me with a son

Ever since that other time
I wished, how I wished you'd have known
I kept the secret hid, the secret my marriage forbid
What else could I have done?

Just live
Our son
Just live
My son
Just give what I could give
And take what little I deserve

My own flesh and blood
And even he recoils in horror from me
Just like his mother

Forgive me, I beg you, if you can
I've brought you nothing but woe
Tomorrow night, I'll sing with all my might
Sing for you again, then we'll go

From out of ugliness, such light
From out of darkness, such a flame
In him, my wrongness is made right
And yet he loathes me just the same

So let him shun me in disgust
Let him flee this cursed face
If I must hide from him, I must
Yet shall he be my saving grace

If it's true, I've no reason to live
Then, Christine, then our boy
Shall have all I can give

Ah, Christine
All I create on this earth
All that I'll never be worth
All shall be his

Ten long years and he casts us aside
Ten whole years, this is how we're repaid
Ten dark years of toil and tears
And now what we've worked for will go to that child

All our hopes were at last in our grasp
All the dreams and the plans that we laid
Everything is vanishing
And we get discarded, rejected, reviled

All of the love that we gave him was worn
All would be ours

Seasons fly
Still you don't walk through the door
And in a haze, I count the silent days
Till I hear you sing once more

And sometimes at nighttime 
I dream that you are there
But wake, holding nothing but the empty air

And years come
And years go
Time runs dry
Still I ache down to the core
My broken soul can't be alive and whole

And music, your music
It teases at my ear
I turn and it fades away and you're not here

Let dreams pass
Let them die

What an awful mistake to have come here
To be on display in that shameless way
For the crude common lower-class scum here
How do they dare to treat us so?

Father dear, come play with me
Come and see this toy I've got

What a snub at most from our so-called host
Did he think sending freaks would be funny?
Could the fool have thought that our pride was bought
By his filthy American money?
What a farce, what an outright slap in the face
It's an utter disgrace

I've got a mind to pack and go
Never you mind the debts we own
Who would believe we've sunk this low?

Father please, come play with me
Please tell the boy the answer's no

Must you make that racket?

It hurts my head

Please, let's not fight, dear
I'm sure that no one intended a slight, dear
Don't you patronize me

I give her sorrow
She asks for honesty
I've none to borrow

She needs my tender kiss
She begs it off me
I give her ugliness
Why does she love me?

She yearns for higher things
Things I can't give her
The rush that music brings
I can't deliver

And even when she sings
And soars above me
I try to clip her wings
Why does she love me?

One more drink, sir
That's what I need
Don't you think, sir?

Do you hear me?
Another drink

She wants the man I was
Husband and father
At least, she thinks she does
She needn't bother

Just horror, shame, despair

Hurry up before I freeze
I'll just take it black

Do you know where you are?
Hell, I imagine

Around here they call it suicide hall
It's where people end up
When they don't know where else to go

The hopeless, the desperate
The good place to step off the side
Of the pier and quietly vanish
You seem to be a regular
Me?
I come here to swim

This town is coarse and cold and mean
It's hard to keep your conscience clean
Faceless in the crowd
Anything's allowed

And so I come at dawn each day
Come to wash it all away
Sink into the sea, blue and cool and kind
Let it set me free, let the past unwind
Leave the hurt behind

You should never have come to America
It's not a place for people like you and Christine
It's too easy to forget who you are and where you belong
That's why Mother says you must leave here
Now, take your wife and the boy and go

Leave?
What about tonight?
The concert, the money?
Am I to just run away from him?

There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue

And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops

Andrew Lloyd Webber,"We have all been blind
And yet the answer is staring us in the face
This could be the chance
To in snare our clever friend

We're listening
Go on

We shall play his game
Perform his work bur remember we hold the ace
For if Miss Daae sings
He is certain to attend

We are certain to close the bars
We are certain the police are there
We are certain they're armed
The curtain falls his reign will end

Raoul, I'm frightened
Don't make me do this
Raoul, he scares me
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire

He'll take me, I know
We'll be parted forever, he won't let me go
What I once used to dream, I now dread
If he finds me it will never end

And he'll always be there
Singing songs in my head
He'll always be there
Singing songs in my head

You said yourself
He was nothing but a man
Yet while he lives
He will haunt us 'till we're dead

Twisted every way
What answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life
To win the chance to live?

Can I betray the man
Who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey
Do I have any choice?

He kills without a thought
He murders all that's good
I know I can't refuse
And yet, I wish I could

Oh God, if I agree
What horrors wait for me?
In this

Time crawls by
Night steals in, pacing the floor
The moments creep,
Yet I can't bear to sleep
Till I hear you sing

And weeks pass, and months pass
Seasons fly
Still you don't walk through the door
And in a haze
I count the silent days
Till I hear you sing once more.

And sometimes at night time
I dream that you are there
But wake holding nothing but the cold night air

And years come, and years go
Time runs dry
Still I ache down to the core
My broken soul
Can't be alive and whole
Till I hear you sing once more

And music, your music
It teases at my ear
I turn and it fades away and you're not here

Let hopes pass, let dreams pass
Let them die
Without you, what are they for?
I'll always feel
No more than halfway real
Till I hear you sing once more",'Til I Hear You Sing,2018

Life hadn’t treated him so well
A heart so gold, and words so blue
In a body home from hell

He said, “If I could tell you one thing, I would tell you this:
There’s only one mistake that I have made
It’s giving up the music in my fingertips
By trying to get to heaven through my veins.”

I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me

Driving beside me yesterday
She turned her head, then I turned mine
And I watched her drive away

I thought, if I could tell her something, I would tell her this
There’s only two mistakes that I have made
It’s running from the people who could love me best
And trying to fix a world that I can’t change

All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me

In the middle of the night, the first light of the morning
My room like a church, voices down the hall
I barely made 'em out, but sometimes you don’t want to know
Now that I’m older, I can tell you this
The mornings I miss, but I don’t really miss the voices
You’ve got a choice, I’ve got the hands
Skeletons and plans, you’ve got to let 'em go

Burn down the mission, the maps in your head
Shot like a bullet, don't know the way
The ricochet, kind of got away from you

Staring out the window with your, with your head on my shoulder
Try to get some sleep, we’ll be driving through a dream
Riding through the heart of the dark that you fought like a soldier
Try to get some sleep, we’ll be driving through a dream

Try to get some sleep, we’ll be driving through a dream

Clinging to your late-night courage
Anything to pass the time
Lying in the back seat trying not to fall apart
Waiting for your life to start

Staring out the window with your, with your head on my shoulder
Try to get some sleep, we’ll be driving through a dream
Riding through the heart of the dark that you fought like a soldier
Try to get some sleep, we’ll be driving through a dream

Try to get some sleep, we’ll be driving through a dream

And the night is long, the road is longer,
You say, you sleep better when I’m awake
I’ll stay awake for you

Checked into the Congress hotel
Met the band in a bar next to the lobby
Looking for another story I could tell

When I left town you were heading for the altar
And I told you I'd be back before too long
I cut my hair and I found me a new girlfriend
Thought a broken heart could write a perfect song
And it did and I was right so now you're gone

You echo in the halls
I feel your shadow on this empty stage
I hear your music through the walls
I see your picture on the blank page, oh
You echo in the halls

Play the show, left another message
Booked a ticket for tomorrow in Tempe
Three AM, I'm doing cartwheels down the hallway
I've been drinking since the day I set you free
But on this airport morning will you wait for me?

And there’s a light left on inside
Think of all the days we spent
Orchestrating accidents
Lights that used to blind us
Somehow they will guide us through the night

Following the outline of your face
I can see your breath move in the dark
Through all the autopilot years
The tears of joy, the face of fear
Now that we’re not hiding
Somehow you’re still riding in my car

Andrew McMahon In the Wilderness,"We were kids, we played with matches
Well we grew up, we started bands
Yeah we skipped school, but played the dances
When we started making fans

We blew off college, toured the country in a van
Sometimes at the grocery store, the people say they knew me back when

We were teenage rockstars
Made our hometown proud
When we were teenage rockstars
We taught ourselves to play
And we played loud

We signed a deal and made some records
Sold out shows and married young
The money came, we started fighting
We partied hard, and had our fun

We blew off deadlines and forgot to call our friends
Sometimes at the shopping mall, the people say they knew me back when

We were teenage rockstars
Made our fathers proud
When we were teenage rockstars
We taught ourselves to play
And we played loud

Now I sit at this piano
I watch my daughter in the yard
I think about those days in high school
My best friend playing his guitar

In my parents' living room, where all of this began
And when I leave the shows these days, the people say they knew me back when

We were teenage rockstars
So young and so strung out
When we were teenage rockstars
We taught ourselves to play
We took the stage

Do you want me down on my knees?
Are you livin' a lie?
Is this some kind of game
Baby, won't you tell me please?

Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Who do you love? What makes you happen
What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love? I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time
Who do you love?

With somebody, somewhere else

After the last child starves and the last girl walks the boulevard
After the last year that's just too hard

There is love
Love, love, love

After the last brutal jab from a poison tongue
After the last dirty politician, after the last meal down at the mission
After the last lonely night in prison

There is love

There is love
Love, love, love
There is love

And in the end, the end is oceans and oceans of love and love again

Were caught in the palms of the Giver of love and the Lover of all
And we'll look back on these tears as old tales

'Cause after the last plan fails, after the last siren wails
After the last young husband sails off to join the war
After the last, this marriage is over
After the last young girl's innocence is stolen
After the last years of silence that won't let a heart open

There is love

And in the end, the end is oceans and oceans of love and love again

Were caught in the palms of the Giver of love and the Lover of all

It's so easy to cash in these chips on my shoulder,
So easy to lose this whole tongue like a tiger.
It's easy to let all this bitterness smolder,
Just to hide it away like a cigarette lighter.
It's easy to curse and to hurt and to hinder.
It's easy to not have the heart to remember 
That I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of God.

I've got voices that scream in my head like a siren,
Fears that I feel in the night when I sleep.
Stupid choices I made when I laid in the mire,
Like a kid in the mud on some dirty, blind street.
I've got sorrow to spare, I've got loneliness too.
I've got blood on these hands that hold on to the truth,
That I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of God.

Well I swore on the bible to not tell a lie, but I've lied and lied.
And I've crossed my heart and I hoped to die, and I've died and died.

But if it's true that you gathered my sin in your hand and you cast it as far as the east from the west,
If it's true that you put on the flesh of a man, and you walked in my shoes through the shadow of death,
If it's true that you dwell in the halls of my heart, then I'm not just a fool with a fancy guitar.

Andrew Peterson,"Do you remember, Jody Baxter
When the whippoorwill sings
How you stole across the pasture
To the little hidden spring?
Where you laid down by the water
On a bed of Spanish moss
And dreamed

When wind was on the prairie
And the fire was in the stove
With the wood you had to carry
From the corner of the grove
And your daddy let you disappear
With all your fishing gear
Into the cove

And it was good, good, good
But now it's gone, gone, gone
And there's a little boy
Who's lost out in the woods
Always looking for the fawn

I remember, Jody Baxter
When I hid out in the corn
How the clouds were moving faster
With the coming of the storm
And I knew that I had broken
Something I could not repair
And I mourned

Because the field was green as Eden
Then it withered into brown
In the middle of my grieving
They came and cut it down
And I was sure that it was all my fault
The day they mowed the garden
To the ground

What was good, good, good
Is gone, gone, gone
And there's a little boy
Who's lost out in the woods
Always looking for the fawn

So come back to me
Please, come back to me
Is there any way that we can
Change the ending of this tragedy?
Or does it have to be this way?

I can see you, Jody Baxter
Now you're broken by the years
As you lie down in the aster
And listen for the deer
And I'm a million miles away
But I still pray the fawn can find me

The sound of the scream and the sight of the blood

In the jaws of the dog as the river ran by
I said, ""Come back soon.""

It's there on the page of the book that I read
The boy grew up and the yearling was dead
He stood at the gate with the angel on guard
And wept for the death of his little boy heart
I say, ""Come back soon.""

We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness

And I can feel in the fall the final exhale
The trees of the field all wring their hands
And the leaves go by like a funeral band

We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls

Then it seems to me that she's an outlaw
'Cause every death is a question mark
At the end of the book of a beating heart
And the answer is scrawled in the silent dark
On the dome of the sky in a billion stars

And we cannot sing with these broken lungs
So we kick in the womb and we beg to be born

Tear across the wilderness

Roaring in the holy cloud
It shook my bedroom window panes

I do not understand now

You've been a mystery since the moment that I met you
You never move but I can never seem to catch you

You said to eat your flesh
Before you broke the bread and blessed it
Before you poured the wine for every man
This is a hard, hard teaching
Can any man accept it?
Can any sage here understand?

You turned the tables over
There in your father's temple
You cracked a whip and raised a shout
My daughter asked me why
I said, ""Love is never simple
It draws 'em in and drives 'em out.""

I saw you there but it was too late to change my course
And I collided with a beautiful immovable force
And so the stone that I rejected
It has become the Cornerstone

But the maps were wrong
The stars spin around
Another sun
All the maps were drawn
But the maps were wrong
The rivers are running from

Written in a script of stars
Dripping from prophets' lips

But still, my thirst is never slaked
I am hounded by a restlessness 
Eaten by this endless ache
But still I will give thanks for this

I can feel it when the horses run
It's howling in the snowy peaks
It's blazing in the midnight sun

Just behind a veil of wind
A million angels waiting in the wings
A swirling storm of cherubim
Making ready for the Reckoning

Oh, how long, how long?
Oh, sing on, sing on

And when the world is new again
And the children of the King
Are ancient in their youth again
Maybe it's a better thing
A better thing

To be more than merely innocent
But to be broken then redeemed by love
Maybe this old world is bent
But it's waking up
And I'm waking up

'Cause I can hear the voice of one
He's crying in the wilderness
""Make ready for the Kingdom Come""

Don't know what to do
You've been lost in the questions
I don't know what to say
I'm sure if I were you
I'd proceed with some caution

But I want you to know
When the joy that you feel
Leaves a terrible ache in your bones 
It's the voice of Jesus
Calling you back home

I know you've got a lot
Spinning in your head
All this emptiness fills you
Maybe you could try
Laying in your bed
To ask the silence to still you

And you might hear a beat
On the door of your heart
When you do, let it open up wide
It's the voice of Jesus
Calling you his bride

Once upon a time there was a little boy
Who wandered the forest, abandoned
And he heard in the leaves
And behind every tree
The sound of a secret companion
Following

So listen, little girl,
Somewhere there's a King
Who will love you forever
And nothing in the world
Could ever come between
You, my love, and this Lover

So when I kiss you at night
And I turn out the light
And I tell you you're never alone

I can see the road that lies ahead

I want to go with you, but I can’t follow

So keep to the old roads
Keep to the old roads
And you’ll find your way

Your first kiss, your first crush
The first time you know you’re not enough
The first time there’s no one there to hold you

The first time you pack it all up
And drive alone across America
Please remember the words that I told you

Keep to the old roads

And I know it'll hurt, 'cause I know what it costs
And I love you so much and it's so hard to watch
But you're gonna grow up and you're gonna get lost
Just go back, go back

Go back, go back to the ancient paths
Lash your heart to the ancient mast
And hold on, boy, whatever you do
To the hope that's taken hold of you
And you'll find your way

Andrew Peterson,"I remember once I broke down in the country
I was sixteen with a broken heart in bloom
And I walked home through the pines
Nobody saw me but the moon

By sunrise I could hear the church bells ringing
I got there as the saints were marching in
I sat down on the back row
And heard the story once again

And the servants of the secret fire
Were gathered there
The embers of the ages
Like a living prayer
And all at once I saw the shadows flee
Shine your light on me, on me
Be a light unto my path
And a lamp unto my feet

They flew us down to Oklahoma City
Yeah, but I could hardly stand there on the stage
So sick I couldn't speak
And the fever wouldn't break

But when I stepped up to the microphone I heard it
It was the voices of the brothers at my side
They were singing out my song
When the song in me had died

Oh, shine your light on me

Somebody come and get me when I'm gone

Two years ago I drove into a darkness
I straightened every curve on Cane Ridge Road
And I could hear the flapping wings
Of every devil I have known

And the inside of my car was like a casket
But then it flooded with a blaze of sacred light
She was calling me back home
And as I pulled into the drive

I knew the servants of the secret fire
Were gathered there
The embers of the ages
Like a living prayer
She was standing on the porch where I could see
Shine your light on me, on me

And a lamp unto my feet",Shine Your Light on Me,2012

When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

The shadow you cast just grows larger than life
How can the past cut two hearts like a knife?

But how can I stay?
Any way I step I lose
My back's to the wall
I stumble and fall
Trying to live my life without you.

So what are these chains
You hold on both of us
You give it your best
But you can't forget
And my love's not strong enough
To put out a fire that someone else lit
Or walk in the footprints that never will fit.

Tenant dans ses doigts, un poisson dans un' cage :

Me glisser cinq ou dix louis. Merci

And then I was ten feet tall,
Oh darlin', Bless You, Bless ev'ry breath that you take, 
Bless ev'ry move that you make so perfectly, 
And bless your little heart for lovin' me.
 
Ev'ry time I faced the world, 
I just had to cry.
I stood alone with no love of my own,
But then you happened by,

Bless ev'ry breath that you take,
Bless ev'ry move that you make so perfectly,
And bless your little heart for lovin' me,

Que te favorecia why te hacia tan mona

Crees que eres la lluvia que chispea why agobia
Piensas que tu vales mas que esta historia

Palabras que no olvido
Cogidos de la mano fuimos poquito a poquito
Veranos de locura inviernos de ternura

Miradas que no ocultan el sentir de mi fortuna
Batallas a deriva que conquista
Mis labios paseos por la playa
Anocheceres de infarto

Y en la primavera
No hay niña más morena, en to' mi reino
Dame un besito de los que llegan al corazón
Dame un abrazo de los que juegan con la ilusión
Dame un besito de los que llegan al corazón
Dame un abrazo de los que juegan con la ilusión

A veces me huyen, a veces se queda
A veces se enfada y no entiendo a mi morena
Digo que la quiero, digo que la odio
Pero siempre al final volvemos juntos, juntos como tontos

Oye, oye morena dame un besito
De los que tu sueltas en la primavera
Pero oye, oye mi niña dame un besito
De los que tu sueltas con la primavera

Pero oye pero que mira oye morena
Ay corazón ay mira niña que tu sabes
Que el amor, oye pero que sabes
Que el amor pero niña no me juegues con mi corazón

De los que llegan de los que faltan
A veces te huyen a veces se quedan
A veces se enfadan y no entiendo a mi morena

Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.
 
We played the games that people play, 
We made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Cause I needed you so desperately.
We were too blind to see, but then,
Most of all, I do love you",Still,2006

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.

Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.

I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.

No puedo aguantar esta soledad

Qué será de mi vida qué será

Día a día voy perdiendo el control

Tú no sabes cómo duele tu adiós

Tengo herida el alma why el corazón

Porque tú no estás


Ay fueron noches de pasión

Cuando le entregué mi corazón

Cuando yo le dí mi vida entera

why bajo la luna pasabamos la noche en vela

Yo te amaba

Llegue a quererte más que a todo más que a nada

Eras tú la que en mis sueños siempre estaba

why de besos mil caricias te colmaba

Por favor regresa


Ay mi amor perdido donde estará

No puedo aguantar esta soledad

Qué será de mi vida qué será

Si tú no estas amor (si tú no estas amor)

Con Luny Tunes why Nefty aquí si too se vale

Esta bachata es pa' que esto se encienda

Con el más que canta (con Andy Aguilera)

Como te alejaste de mi vida

No comprendo

Ahora yo no encuentro una salida

why me atormento pensando en tí

Queriendo tenerte why tu no estas aquí

Parado en mi ventana

Veo como pasan las noches las mañanas

Como se ha quedado vacía mi casa

Reina de mi alma dueña mi cama

Te fuiste why no dijiste nada


Ay mi amor perdido dónde estará

No puedo aguantar esta soledad

Que será de mi vida que será

Peleando con mis ganas por llamarte
Muriendo en el intento y no lo puedo hacer

Vida, me mata la agonía
""Mata la agonía""
Saber que no eres mía
""Saber que no eres mía""

Andy Andy,"Desde aquel día que te fuiste súper
Que eras para mi maldita
Confesarte que te quiero
Que te adoro que eras todo para mí
La razón de mi vida para seguir viviendo

Y hoy te burlas de mí
Que te quiero tu bien sabes
Que te adoro con toda mi alma
Que hasta en sueño te deseo

Eres mi gran obsesión
Fuiste la luz que iluminaste
Mi vida por tanto tiempo
Y hoy tú te burlas de mí

Maldito amor que no le teme a nada
Maldito amor quemas en las miradas
Maldito amor que ha sido mi secreto
Maldito amor que nace del silencio
Maldito amor, maldito amor

En las noches percibo
Tus caricias como un ave perdida
Que persigue a su nido con refugio de amor
Necesito de tus besos tus caricias
Para seguir viviendo y hoy tú te burlas de mí

Maldito amor que no le teme a nada
Maldito amor quemas en las miradas
Maldito amor que ha sido mi secreto
Maldito amor que nace del silencio
Maldito amor maldito amor, amor, amor

Maldito amor que no le teme a nada
Maldito amor quemas en las miradas
Maldito amor que ha sido mi secreto
Maldito amor que nace del silencio
Maldito amor, maldito amor

Andy Anselmo,"""Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina""

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.

Andy Anselmo,"Every time it rains
It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune
Fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me

Andy Anselmo,"The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom
Now when that twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels
When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue, blue as the sky
Since love has gone, I can't get myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
My friend ask me out, but I tell them I'm busy
I've got to get a new alibi
I hang around at home, and ask myself, where is she?
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes
Then somebody says, just forget about her
But I gave that treatment a try
Strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by, oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry",Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry,2002

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night

So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee 
And what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat

When you believe 
You will relieve the only soul

You can go and tell your brother
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

She may search this wide world over

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Thought you would move

Been sifting through the wreckage
For this excuse
We call a life

A DIY quickie slow divorce
Marriage vows broken on the rocks
Mine's a slice with a G&T
And here's to toast that you're leaving me

I will not cry 'til the fat lady sings
I cannot fly 'cause you've clipped my wings
Now you're the picture of my disgrace
So wipe that pretty smile off your face

I wouldn't say we were incomplete
I can't complain you were so discreet
Kept your liaisons to yourself
My soul distraught now I'm getting out

You were delicious
Could never be malicious
Now you hold a knife up
To my throat

Of it's own volition
You took your ammunition
Came rushing through the air
Like a UFO

I cannot say that I learned my lesson well
Mysterious ways got a lot to tell
Sure got a wicked sense of humor
You stick that knife in and twist it round

I've been on the pavement and I've been in the stairwell

Just to get you out of my hair
Dirty weather never flattened my complexion, really

If there was something on your mind

A bitter potion, hard to swallow
You're acting strange

It fills my heart and soul with dread
There's nothing that I can do
I've got that feeling you have gone
And where's the symbol of love?

With your love running deep
Where is the love I can keep?
You blew a hole through my heart
Bruising me right from the start

They say still waters they run deep
Now I'm clinging to the shore
Is there some hope that I can keep?
Will I see you walk through my door?

I got that feeling you would go
Like summer, winter and fall
And there's a side to us that's great
But I find out too late

Will I ever fill the void
The havoc that you left behind?
And will time blur the lines
Heal all the wounds left inside?

Wounds left inside
Heal all the wounds left inside
Heal all the wounds left inside
Heal all the wounds left inside

It tears my heart and soul in two
There's nothing left I can do

I know if you were the one who was sleeping around
I could not keep my feelings to myself
I'd be jealous as hell

Your heart was broken
When I walked in your world
I fear to tread
Where your tears dare to hide

Sugarcane and jealousy
What a scene
Will I burn in hell?
Will I live to see the day?

I try to seize you
And make it happen
On the spur of the moment
It can't be easy to live with me

It was my decision to let you
Know where I was going to
I did it to wind you up

I keep no secrets from you
Everything is out in the open
And who I slept with last night
It makes no difference to us",Jealous [CD-ROM Track],2005

The only difference is the name

If you're alone, whether on Main Street, or on Broadway

Andy Bey,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..",Lush Life,2004

There'd be a thousand hours in the day

Heart beat loud
Heart beating so loud
Heartbeat, are you ready to bring this beat around?
Heartbeat, to pieces down, you make me
Heartbeat, are you ready to bring this beat around?
Heartbeat, to pieces, that's how you make me

Take a little closer, come up to my speed
Your destiny creeping, at the tip on this shoulder
Now got the things down to my seat
I begin with the condolence to carry this over and
Know it hasn't commenced to beat
Through friends and beats, on between frequencies like a drum
All under the waves of this heat
You feat to my deep
It's quiet when I hear your

Heart beat loud
Heart beating so loud
Heartbeat, are you ready to bring this beat around?
Heartbeat, to pieces down, you make me
A stereo sound

Andy Caine,"Love is calling earth
Do you know how much is hurts?
I didn't die overnight
In the wind I had candlelight
I'm controlled by my fear
All the voices in my head
That I can hear

Please don't hurt me

How do I learn
To give and love and be loved in return
If this is heaven I'm falling
I'd rather run and jump away
Than to see it burn
I feel I could die
Before I sleep I kiss your cheek
And say goodbye

I'm so sorry
Please don't hurt me

This is love calling earth
Do you know how much it hurts?
I didn't die overnight
In the wind I had candlelight

I'm controlled by my fear
And all the voices in my head 
That I can hear

I'm so sorry
Please don't hurt me

If you could see me through my mother's eye
Only then would you begin to realise
All the places I have ever been
Have scared me half to death or
somewhere in-between

Andy Caine,"In Tropical climes there are certain times of day
When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultra-violet rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one
But Englishmen detest-a siesta

In the Philippines they have lovely screens to protect you from the glare
In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a 
tree

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth
That they give rise to such hilarity and mirth
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ho=ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
He-he-he-he-he-he-he
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The toughest Burmese bandit can never understand it
In Rangoon the heat of noon is just what the natives shun
They put their Scotch or Rye down and lie down

In a jungle town where the Sun beats down to the rage of man and beast
The English garb of the English Sahib merely gets a bit more creased
In Bangkok at twelve o'clock they foam at the mouth and run
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The smallest Malay rabbit deplores this foolish habit
In Hong Kong they strike a gong and fire off a noonday gun
To reprimand each inmate, who's in late

In the mangrove swamps where the python romps there is peace from 
twelve till two
Even caribous lie around and snooze for there's nothing else to do
In Bengal to move at all is seldom if ever done
But mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday
Out in the midday sun",Mad Dogs and Englishmen,2008

Dine on passion, then let your heart bleed

Andy Duncan,"You drink your coffee, 
I sip my tea, 
And we're sitting here, playing so cool, 
Thinking, 'What will be, will be.' 
And it's getting kind of late now, 
Oh, I wonder if you'll stay now, 
Stay now, stay now, stay now, 
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'? 
I move a little closer to you, 
Not knowing quite what to do and I'm 
Feeling all fingers and thumbs, 
I spill my tea, oh silly me, 
It's getting kind of late now, 
I wonder if you'll stay now, 
Stay now, stay now, stay now, 
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'? 
And then we touch, much too much, 
This moment has been waiting for a long, long time, 
Makes me shiver, 
Makes me quiver, 
This moment I am so unsure, 
This moment I have waited for, 
Well is it something you've been waiting for, 
Waiting for too? 
Take off your eyes, 
Bare your soul, 
Gather me to you and make me whole, 
Tell me your secrets, 
Sing me the song, 
Sing it to me in the silent tongue. 
It's getting kind of late now, 
I wonder if you'll stay now, 
Stay now, stay now, stay now, 
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'?",Will You?,1980

Andy Fairweather Low,"They call you an animal, the Kangchenjunga Demon, Wild Man, Metoh-Kangmi.
Lying in my tent, I can hear your cry echoing round the mountainside.
You sound lonely.
While crossing the Lhakpa-La something jumped down from the rocks.
In the remote Garo Hills by Dipu Marak we found footprints in the snow.

The schoolmaster of Darjeeling said he saw you by the Tengboche Monastery.
You were playing in the snow. You were banging on the doors. 
You got up on the roof, Roof of the World.
You were pulling up the rhodedendrons. Loping down the mountain.
They want to know you. They will hunt you down, then they will kill you.
Run away, run away, run away
While crossing the Lhakpa-La something jumped down from the rocks.
In the remote Garo Hills by Dipu Marak we found footprints in the snow.
We found your footprints in the snow. We brushed them all away...
From the Sherpas of Annapurna to the Rinpoche of Qinghai.
Shepherds from Mount Kailash to Himachal Pradesh found footprints in the snow.

You’re not a langur monkey nor a big brown bear – You’re the Wild Man.
They say they saw you drowned near the Rongbuk Glacier.
They want to hunt you down. You’re not an animal.
The Lamas say you’re not an animal.",Wild Man,2011
Andy Farber,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1998

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,

Andy Fielding,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Andy Fielding,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Andy Findon,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances

In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Andy Findon,"Oh no I see
A spider web it's tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I said
Oh no what's this
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I've done

And I never meant to cause you trouble
And and I never meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no I never meant to do you harm

Oh no I see
A spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble

And I never meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no I never meant to do you harm

Andy Fite,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking

Andy Fite,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Andy Fite,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1992
Andy Fite,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1994
Andy Fite,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Andy Fite,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,1998
Andy Fite,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,1998
Andy Fite,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1998
Andy Fitzpatrick,"I'll see you again
When ever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between
But what has been
is past forgetting
This sweet memory
Across the years
Will come to me
Though my world may go awry
In my heart will ever lie
Just an echo of a sigh
Goodbye

All my life I shall remember knowing you
All the pleasure I have found in showing you
The different ways
That one may phrase
The changing light
And changing shade
Happiness that must die
Melodies that must fly
Memories that must fade
Dusty and forgotten by and by

I'll see you again
When ever spring breaks through again
Time may lie heavy between
But what has been

Andy Forray,"You know kids, I wish every mom and dad would make a speech to their 
teenagers and say kids, be free, be whatever you are, do whatever you 
want to do, just so long as you don't hurt anybody. And remember kids, 
I am your friend. 

I would just like to say that it is my conviction 
That longer hair and other flamboyant affectations 
Of appearance are nothing more 
Than the male's emergence from his drab camoflage 
Into the gaudy plumage 
Which is the birthright of his sex 

There is a peculiar notion that elegant plumage 
And fine feathers are not proper for the male 
When ac------tually 
That is the way things are 
In most species
