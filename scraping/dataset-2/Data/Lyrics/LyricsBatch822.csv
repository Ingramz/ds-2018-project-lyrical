Paul Carrack,"I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pajamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case
I said to my reflection
""Let's get out of this place""

Passed the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
Billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all, I know I will

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

I'm at the car park, the airport
The baggage carousel
(The people keep on grindin')
Ain't wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion
(It's no story I could tell)

At my bedside empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish that it would stop

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

I bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you
But it's not my conscience
That hates to be untrue
I asked of my reflection
Tell me what is there to do?

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered

Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered",Tempted,1994
Paul Carrack,"Take the children and yourself
And hide out in the cellar
By now the fighting will be close at hand
Don't believe the church and state
And everything they tell you
Believe in me, I'm with the high command

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

There's a gun and ammunition
Just inside the doorway
Use it only in emergency
Better you should pray to God
The Father and the Spirit
Will guide you and protect from up here

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?

Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

Swear allegiance to the flag
Whatever flag they offer
Never hint at what you really feel
Teach the children quietly
For some day sons and daughters
Will rise up and fight while we stood still

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

Can you hear me running (can you hear me calling you?)
(Can you hear me) hear me calling you?
(Can you hear me running) hear me running babe?
(Can you hear me running) hear me running?
Calling you, calling you",Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground) [From on Dangerous Ground],1995
Paul Carrack,"You can't see the flip side of the coin 
You can't feel the part where two hearts join 
There was a time I could make your day 
When love was strong; has it gone
Fading far away? 

Don't walk over me 
Don't walk over me 
Lift me up or set me free 
But don't walk over me 

True, there's no reason for me to jump and shout 
Give me love when your loves not around 
I may not have the patience of a saint 
Baby, please don't make me hurry up and wait 

Don't walk over me 
I remember hearing footsteps running up to your door 
They were echoes of my heartbeat 
Nothing could be colder
How can love be over when you're still not sure?

Don't walk over me",Don't Walk over Me,1996
Paul Carrack,"I want to know how does it feel 
Behind those eyes of blue 
You've made your mistakes 
And now your heart aches 
Behind those eyes of blue 

People may say you've had your chance 
And let it slip away 
But hard as they try 
There's a dream that won't die 
Behind those eyes of blue 

Maybe once in a while 
There's a trace of a smile 
Behind those eyes of blue 
But it's painfully clear 
There's a river of tears 
Behind those eyes of blue 

You know life is too short 
For compromising 
Take a hold of your dream 
And realize it 

You know there's nothing left 
To stand in your way 
Except yourself and I know 
Though your hearts full of pain 
That a hope still remains 
Behind those eyes of blue",Eyes of Blue,1996
Paul Carrack,"Since this mornin', I've been thinkin' how
Things have been between the two of us
We've been fallin' through the here and now
It's time for us to reinvest our trust
Can't you see for once in our lives
Now our love has finally come to ground
The flame we have is burnin' so bright
Burnin' forever; now we're back together
For once in our lives
There's no turnin' back
No runnin' away
No coverin' up tracks
For once in our lives
There's no one to blame
And no broken hearts
'Cause we found love again
For once
Once in our lives
You see this mornin' I've been so relieved
There's no more pressure from within
I had this sense that you would get to say
There was no lasting love within
Can't you see for once in our lives
All the things we've wanted have appeared
Now that we have love realized?
Realized forever
For once in our lives
There's no turnin' back
No runnin' away
No coverin' up tracks
For once in our lives
There's no one to blame
And no broken hearts
'Cause we found love again
For once
Once in our lives
Maybe we can't believe
How things can be so wrong
Maybe it's time that we learn
To reach out for feelin' alone
For once in our lives
There's no turnin' back
No runnin' away
No coverin' up tracks
For once in our lives
There's no one to blame
And no broken hearts
Because we found love again
For once in our lives
There's no turnin' back
No runnin' away
No coverin' up tracks
For once in our lives
There's no one to blame
And no broken hearts
Because we found love again
For once
Darling, for once
There's no turnin' back
No more covering up
Covering up
You know there's no...
No one to blame
Because we found love again",For Once in Our Lives,1996
Paul Carrack,"I was standing all alone against the world outside 
You were searching for a place to hide 
Lost and lonely, now you've given me the will to survive 

When we're hungry, love will keep us alive 
Don't you worry, sometimes you've just got to let it ride 
The world is changing right before your eyes 
Now I've found you, there's no more emptiness inside 

When we're hungry, love will keep us alive 
I would die for you, climb the highest mountain 
Baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you 

Now I've found you, there's no more emptiness inside 
When we're hungry, love will keep us alive 

I would die for you",Love Will Keep Us Alive,1996
Paul Carrack,"The same thoughts going through my head
So many things better left unsaid
Well I'm telling you baby, there's no easy way out

Dreams may shatter, tears may fall
So hard to make any sense at all
Well I'm tellin' you darlin' there's no easy way out

All I can do is wait, I don't care how long it takes

Baby I just want to be standing by your side
Whenever you need whatever I can do

Don't worry bout losing face
You know my heart is in the right place
Well I'm telling you baby there's no easy way out
You know it's only a matter of time
Then everything's gonna work out fine
But I'm tellin' you darlin' there's no easy way out

All I can do is wait, I don't care how long it takes

Baby I, just want to be standing by your side
Whenever you need someone to hold you tight

Try to understand that every word I say is true
Tell me what else can I do?
I just want to be
",No Easy Way Out,1996
Paul Carrack,"Outside in the pouring rain
I walked the lonely streets and searched in vain
Every corner of every street
And every doorway where we used to meet
As I turned to walk away I could swear I saw your face

Long into the night I see
Shadows dancing alone with me
I know it must be
Nothing more than a memory

I try to keep my hurt inside
With some resemblance of my broken pride
I've done everything that I can do
I can't face the thought of losing you
And as I turn to walk away
I thought I saw your face again

Long into the night

People say that I'm crazy
I'm being weak when I should be strong
I've got to pull myself back together before too long
",Nothing More Than a Memory,1996
Paul Carrack,"Since you ask me what it takes to love me
Get it straight right from the start
You've got to move me got to get this to me
Keep it coming right from the heart

Then oh oh oh my my my
I will never let you down
Oh oh oh my my my lovers make this world go around
You've got to keep it uncomplicated
If you see my point of view
Plain and simply stated you must do what you must do

A lot of people spend their lifetime searching
Getting more and having less
You and me though
Now we've got this working every move is happiness

Then oh oh oh my my my

Talkers talking, preachers preaching
Making life a misery
If they could feel every night what we feel
They'd wish they were you and me

Then oh oh oh my my my
",Oh Oh Oh My My My,1996
Paul Carrack,"You might think I keep my distance 
You might think I have no plans to stay 
You might think I have no weakness 
But you don't understand a word I say 
I tell you honestly 
You know you mean the world to me 
And if you're ever in need 
I'll tell you where I'm gonna be 

Oh yeah, alright 
Well, I'm only a breath away 
Oh yeah, don't cry 
'Cause I'm only a breath away 
Only a breath away 

Never been a single moment 
Never even been a day gone by 
When I haven't felt your presence 
Deep within my heart and in my mind 

No matter where you are 
I'll be with you constantly 
And when you're feeling alone 
All you have to do is think of me",Only a Breath Away,1996
Paul Carrack,"They say in time all the truth comes to light 
When you can see past the wrong and the right 
There`s a feelin` inside stronger than pride 
Finds me every lonely night 
Well I have searched the past in my mind 
How we failed to see the danger signs 
Well one good reason why we let our love die 
Is something that I`ve failed to find 

Somewhere in your heart 
There`s a lonely part that beats for me 
Somewhere in your broken heart 
There`s a lonely part that beats for me 

Well I have cried till my tears have turned cold 
I`d trade my pride for peace in my soul 
Please don`t make me pay for the rest of my days 
For emotions that ran out of control 
We`ve all but closed the door on our past 
And this one chance may well be our last 
So before you decide one last look inside 
Is all my shattered dreams can ask 

Somewhere in your heart",Somewhere in Your Heart,1996
Paul Carrack,"Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say goodbye
 
Looking back over my shoulder
With an aching deep in my heart
I wish that we were starting over
Oh instead of drifting so far apart
 
Everybody told me you were leaving
Funny I should be the last to know
Baby please tell me that I'm dreaming
I just never want to let you go
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
Turning my heart over and over
I never wanted to say goodbye
 
I don't mind everybody laughing
But it's enough to make a grown man cry
'Cause I can feel you slipping through my fingers
I don't even know the reason why
 
Every day it's a losing battle
Just to smile and hold my head up high
Could it be that we belong together
Baby won't you give me one more try
One more try
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say goodbye
 
Looking back over my shoulder
Oh with an aching feeling inside
Cutting me up, deeper and deeper
Fills me with a sadness that I can't hide
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed no no it could be over
I never wanted to say goodbye
 
Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye",Over My Shoulder [*],1996
Paul Carrack,"Beautiful World, you taught me to remember 
All the feelings, I lost along the way 
I was afraid, alone in my confusion 
Running and hiding `stead of living from day to day 
When we were walking, we touched the summer flowers 
And I saw the wonder, oh in a young child`s eye 
Well I looked around and saw how truly grateful 
That I should be for all the love I`ve found 

Beautiful World well you shook me to my senses 
And opened my eyes to the love inside of me 
It`s up to me, if I can always believe 
In the way I see it now, what a Beautiful World 
It would always be",Beautiful World,1997
Paul Carrack,"Is it just me or does it seem so different tonight? 
Here with you now I feel that everything is right 
Come to me now 
There's no reason to hesitate 
'Cause I don't know, I don't know 
How much longer I can wait 

[Chorus]
Close to me 
Darlin', I want to feel your heart beating next to mine 
Close to me 
'Cause deep inside I know that you're the one I've wanted 
All this time 

Is it just me or can you feel a magic in the air? 
I close my eyes, and I can feel it everywhere 
Come next to me; hear the words that I want to say 
Well, I don't know, I don't know 
How you make me feel this way

[Chorus]",Close to Me,1997
Paul Carrack,"Stop right there and listen
Before you say something you might regret 
I know something's missing 
But I can't begin to accept what you said 
Maybe, you can show me 
Exactly where I'm goin' wrong 
'Cause lately I've been thinking 
Maybe I've been 'round here too long 

[Chorus]
If you'd ever needed someone in your life 
Maybe then you'd know 
Why my heart just wants you to stay 
But my head tells me lo let her go 
If you'd ever needed someone 

One way or another 
Whatever I do, it seems you criticize 
Is there any wonder
The hurt that I feel is so thinly disguised?

I can't help but notice 
Little things that tell me so much 
Is it only a matter of time 
Before I'm missing your tender touch? 

[Chorus] 

If you'd put yourself in my place 
You could never say what's gone is gone 
If you'd ever needed someone",If You'd Ever Needed Someone,1997
Paul Carrack,"I need to hear it, One word from your heart 
All you ever give me, is it goes without saying 
You leave it unspoken, the message is loud and clear 
Here in the silence where it goes without saying 
Well it goes without saying 
I'm feeling like a fool for hanging on 
And if it goes without saying much longer I'm gone 
You take it for granted, as if I can read your mind 
I'm left with a question that never gets answered 
I don't want this feeling of wondering where I stand 
I won't even ask you if you're gonna tell me 
It goes without saying 
How am I supposed to know what's going on 
If it goes without saying much longer I'm gone 
Why should I cry?, Why lie to myself any longer 
If it goes without saying, I'm feeling like a fool 
For hanging on 
When it goes without saying, baby there's no way to know 
What's going on 
If it goes without saying much longer, I don't know how I 
Can say it any stronger if it goes without saying much 
Longer, 
I'm gone",It Goes Without Saying,1997
Paul Carrack,"There's a light that shines on 
Everyone tonight 
But it seems we're just too blind to see 
There's a love that's so deep 
We should never want 
But do we really know what we need? 

[Chorus]
I never thought there would be 
Someone who'd mean so much to me 
In my mind there was no 
Such thing as perfect love 
But now I'm holding you tonight 
And I can see that you were right 
To believe there can be perfect love 

You can live your whole life trying to avoid 
Being hurt, like you've been hurt before 
Then one day you may wake up 
And feel a love so strong 
That you can't hold it back anymore 

[Chorus]

Ever since you called my name 
Nothing's ever been the same 
I want to give my heart to you 
And your perfect love so true 
Oh, your perfect love 
But now you're here with me tonight 
And I can see that you were right 
To believe there can be perfect love",Perfect Love,1997
Paul Carrack,"[Chorus]
I'm still crazy for you
Everything that you do 
Just want to keep you satisfied 
Every trick in the book, girl, by hook or by crook 
Gonna keep you satisfied 

You've become an addiction somehow I can't resist 
Let me make a prediction
Now I know what I've missed 
In my heart there's a whole lot of lovin' 

A feelin' I can't deny 
I can't ignore if I wanted
So, baby, why should I try?

[Chorus]

Well, my heart still pounds like a hammer 
Every time you get close to me 
And my pulse starts to race 
At the thought of your embrace 
And my mind blows naturally 
Don't think I take you for granted 
That's something I'd never do 
Whatever you need to be happy 
Just ask, and I'll give it to you

[Chorus]",Satisfied,1997
Paul Carrack,"Baby you push me a little too hard
Sometimes you pin me down
Catch me off my guard
And when I get outta line
It feels like you squeeze my mind
Baby you twist my words
Like only you know how

My heart can't find a rhythm
It's missing every other beat

Gimme some kinda love baby
Make it like it used to be
Gimme some kinda love baby
I need you right next to me

Sometimes I pushed you
A little too much
Sometimes I crossed that line
And I made you blush
I got a pain I can't nullify
'cause you stop me every single time
We've got to move before it
Becomes too late
You're testing my emotions
Tell me what is there to prove

Gimme some kinda love baby
Make it like it used to be
Gimme some kinda love baby
I ain't so hard to please

Paul Carrack,"Say nothing, I will understand 
I'm on your side; I'm your biggest fan 
You don't need to tell me any precious lies 
'Cause I won't believe them when I look in your eyes

Every kiss from your lips sends a message 
Every touch of your hand tells me so 
In my heart I'm already missing you 
Darlin', I know it's time to let go 

I'm tryin' to convince myself 
When I tell you I will just find somebody else 
'Cause I know inside me, it will only be 
Because I realise you'd truly do the same for me 

[Chorus]

Maybe I just need to get used to it, and I'll be fine 
'Cause I think I recognise 
One by one those tell-tale signs 

Don't worry
You could never hide anything from me
I know you're cryin' deep inside 

[Chorus x 2]",Time to Let Go,1997
Paul Carrack,"I admit it, this time I was wrong 
Anybody can make a mistake 
I overdid it and I can't complain 
If someone's taken my place 
It ain't the first time, it won't be the last 
That I find my life in dissaray 
No use regretting, it's all in the past 
So tell me what can I say 
Is there any point, goin' on about it 
When you know that I can do nothin' right 
I don't know that talkin' it over will change, 
The way I'm feeling tonight 
I used to wake up, jump out of my bed 
With a great big smile on my face 
I was the business, no one could deny 
Now I've fallen from grace 
I just need a chance to forget about it 
Do you really care who was wrong or right 
I don't know that talkin it over will change 
The way I'm feeling tonight 
So if you want your freedom, I won't stand in your way 
Cos I've got my pride, and I won't beg you to stay 
Maybe one day I will write a book about it 
I'll put everything down in black and white 
I don't know that talkin it over will change

Pressed against the window pain,

Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops

I see it all so perfectly

It changes how we live
Changes our direction
From take to give

It changes our perspective
Of how the world should be

See her kind and pretty
See her neat and smart
See her like her mother
With a golden heart

See him tall and handsome
See he has resolved
Believe he's like his father
But without his fathers faults

I know these dreams are fragile
Never work out as you planned
I pray that God will hold them
In the hollow of his hand

I want a perfect child
I see it all
I want a perfect child

With a rhythm of rhyming guitars

Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire

Oh you are the lover I have waited for

Then I am blind, a man without a mind
If there is someone lovelier than you

But no, I'm not blind

Paul Chambers,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [From One Touch of Venus],1959
Paul Chambers,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1960
Paul Chambers,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone,1972
Paul Chambers,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1975
Paul Chambers,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie

Paul Chambers,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996
Paul Chambers,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Paul Chambers,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending

Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends [Take 6],2001

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Paul Chambers,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you

About the latest fads
I admit I was never one
Adored by local lads
Not that I ever try to be a saint
I'm the type that they classify as quaint
I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane
The starry song that April sings
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs holding hands
These my heart understands
I know I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

Paul Chambers,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces that used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again and only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Romance is mush stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

Paul Chambers,"It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'

Let the angels sing,
for your returning.
Till our love is safe and sound.
And old midnight comes around.

really gets bad
