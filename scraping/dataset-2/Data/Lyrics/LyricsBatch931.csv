Ricky Skaggs,"Don't stop gypsy
Don't you give up your ways and settle down you're still young
There's still a lot of life that hasn't been seen
Take the world as it comes and get your rest in between
Chance will never come around again.

Good time highway
With the wind in your hair as you're ridin' to wherever you please
You can take your guitar and play your songs to the stars
While they twinkle above your head
And who cares what tomorrow brings.

Don't you tangle with romance cause it'll leave you alone
And crying in the end
The life that you lead must be simple and free
It's not your fault my friend
Don't stop gypsy.

Don't stop gypsy
Don't you give up your ways and settle down you're still young
There's still a lot of life that hasn't been seen
Take the world as it comes and get your rest in between
Chance will never come around again",Don't Stop Gypsy,1986
Ricky Skaggs,"I won't need you to want me just the way I wanted you
And I feel pretty foolish when you've found somebody new
I think it's fair to warn you girl, you can't treat love that way
Love's gonna get you someday

Love's gonna get you someday
And pay you back for all the times you left it in disgrace
And when you least expect it, love will put you in your place
Love's gonna get you someday

I know mine's not the first love to be put up on the shelf
In fact it's not the first one that you put up there yourself
I'm only sorry I won't be around to see your face
Love's gonna get you someday

Love's gonna get you someday
And pay you back for all the times you left it in disgrace
And when you least expect it, love will put you in your place
Love's gonna get you someday

When I think of all the hearts that I do find to hurt
I guess it's only fair now that the tables have been turned
Speaking from experience, I think it's safe to say
Love's gonna get you someday

Love's gonna get you someday
And pay you back for all the times you left it in disgrace
And when you least expect it, love will put you in your place

Ricky Skaggs,"I wonder if I care as much as I did before
Last night I cried myself to sleep for the one that makes me weep
I dried my eyes to greet the day and wondered why I had to pay
The tears that I have shed by day give relief and wash away
The memory of the night before I wonder if I'll suffer more
I wonder if I care as much as I did before

My pride is made to say forgive and take the blame for what you did
It's your mistake I'm thinking of I wonder if I'm still in love
My heart can't thrive on misery my life it has no destiny
When things get more than I can bear I ask myself do I still care
I wonder if I care as much as I did before",I Wonder If I Care as Much,1986
Ricky Skaggs,"I'd grown so used to you I took for granted
Fire of love we built would always burn
And now I stand alone among the ashes
And losin' was the hardest way to learn.

When I think what I've lost it drives me crazy
Lately I've been crazy all the time
Things I do are starting to amaze me
'Cause I can't seem to get you off my mind.

By my side where I need you
By my side no one else
I need you always beside me
'Cause without you I'm beside myself.

I need you always beside me
'Cause without you I'm beside myself.
Now without you I'm beside myself",I'm Beside Myself,1986
Ricky Skaggs,"Lookin' at you I can see what I missed
Love can't ever get better than this
I never knew there was so much in a kiss
Love can't ever get better than this

I knew this ol' world like the back of my hand
I'd known a lot of boys but I never knew a man
You were somethin' darlin I just couldn't resist
Oh love can't ever get better than this

Love can't ever get better than this
You took a country boy and gave his life a new twist
Love can't ever get better than this
I'm tellin' everyone you're at the top of my list

Love can't ever get better than this
I made a lot of money but it didn't buy me dreams
Thought that I was rich but I was only in between
You were somethin' darling I just couldn't resist

Ricky Skaggs,"They didn't own a house, no crib no toys were waiting
Still they had their love for the child they were anticipating
He was born one winter night on a road between two towns
They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

He worried how to feed him on the trade that was all he knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still
",New Star Shining,1986
Ricky Skaggs,"Oh John, oh John, now what did you say?
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
I'll meet you there at the break of day
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John

I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready, Lord

I want to be ready",Walking in Jerusalem,1986
Ricky Skaggs,"I was driving down a lonely road one dark and stormy night
When a little girl by the roadside showed up in my headlights
I stopped and she got in back and in a shaky tone
She said: My name is Mary, please won't you take me home?

She must have been so frightened all alone there in the night
There was something strange about her, for her face was deathly white
She sat so pale and quiet in the back seat all alone
I'll never will forget that night I took Mary home

I pulled into the driveway where she told me to go
Got out to help her from the car and opened up the door
But I just could not believe my eyes 'cause the back seat was bare
I looked all around the car but Mary wasn't there

A light shone from the porch, someone opened up the door
I asked about the little girl that I was looking for
Then a lady gently smiled and brushed a tear away
She said: It sure was nice of you to go out of your way

But thirteen years ago today a wreck just down the road
Our darling Mary lost her life and we miss her so
Thank you for your trouble and the kindness you have shone
You're the thirteenth one who's been here bringing Mary home",Bringing Mary Home,1987

Heartaches
My loving you meant only heartaches
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me

What does it matter how my heart breaks?
I should be happy with someone new
But my heart aches for you",Heartaches,1987
Ricky Skaggs,"I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
There's such an ache in this old heart now I ain't talkin'
The little hand that held mine tight just waved goodbye tonight
I've got her sweet love on my mind that's why I'm walkin'.

With an old love on your mind life's not worth livin'

Ricky Skaggs,"I've traveled every highway
Down every dusty road
Beneath the silver moonlight
I counted every star that shone.

I've seen all special places
Everybody wants to see
But there's no magic in the place dear
If you're not there with me.

Home is wherever you are
Home is here in your arms
With you love is safe and warm
Home is wherever you are.

I've sung most every love song
Even wrote some of my own
I was born to be a dreamer
And played this guitar till I'm gone.

But of all that I'm still learning
One thing I know is true
If home is where your heart is
Then my home's here with you.

Home is wherever you are
Home is here in your arms
With you love is safe and warm
Home is wherever you are.

Ricky Skaggs,"Standin' on the corner of a busy street
Lookin' for your face in every crowd I meet
Searchin' every honky tonk in this town
Tryin' to find the places where you hang around
Oh Lord I'm tired tired of living this a way
Well I've been searchin' for you baby night and day
Wonderin' if your love will ever come my way
But time is runnin' out and I'm a slowin' down
Tired of bein' just another hang around
Oh Lord I'm tired tired of living this a way
There ain't no happiness in anything I do
I found myself so lonely when I'm not with you
What makes you just a kinda girl a guy will love
You've got so many others that you're thinking of

Ricky Skaggs,"Lord, she sure is good at lovin' me.

Lord, I know I prayed you'd take away the loneliness I knew
My wildest dreams could not conceive the works your hands can do
It feels so good to fall asleep in her arms every night
Leave it up to you to do things right.

Lord, she sure is good at lovin' me
I know you had a hand in this cause it's so plain to see
That I've been blessed with the very best that love will ever be
Lord, she sure is good at lovin' me.

The gift of love you gave to me by sending her my way

But I'll do the best I can to make love last.

Ricky Skaggs,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart

It ain't made of cheese and it don't have a thing to do with me and you

Like cherry wine sugar and honey dew
But honey when you tell me that you love me true
I believe in you and ooh, your love makes everything come true.

Makes a heart break and makes a tear roll

Are causin' me to cry these bitter tears
The only time they do is when I get the blues

I've walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I've been gone
And I'd love to see the lights of home

Wasted time and money too
Squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I had to lose
Lord above I've paid my dues
Got the Highway 40 blues

The highway called when I was young
Told me lies of things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead!
That's what the billboard lights had said

Shattered dreams my mind is numb
My money's gone stick out my thumb
My eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord I ain't been home in years
Got the Highway 40 blues

You know I've rambled all around

Ricky Skaggs,"There's a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday
Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
Where an ol' fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way
For what few coins the congregation could afford
Dressed in all our Sunday best, we sat on pews of solid oak
And I remember how our voices filled the air
How Mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
And ""When the Roll is Called Up Yonder I'll Be There""
Looking back now that little mountain church house
Has become my life's cornerstone
It was there in that little mountain church house
I first heard the words I based my life upon
At the all day Sunday singing, with dinner on the ground
Many were the souls that were revived
While the brothers and the sisters who've gone on to Gloryland
Slept in peace in the maple grove nearby",Little Mountain Church House,1990

On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
To carry mother away

Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by?
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

I said to the undertaker
""Undertaker, please drive slow
For this lady, you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go""

I will follow close behind her
Try to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in her grave

Went back home and home was lonesome
Since my mother, she had gone
Found my brothers, sisters crying

And I found myself in jail at twenty-five

Battered by raging storm of strife
Caught in a whirlwind of heartbreak and pain
And blinded by it's driving rain

Has witnessed his young world being torn apart
He can't understand why mom and dad
Have forsaken the family they had

So he whispers his prayer every evening
As he kneels by his bedside alone
""Put mommy and daddy together again
And give us a happy home
Please give us a happy home""

The anger rang clearly through his bedroom wall
He silently listened, tucked snug in his bed
To each bitter word they said

Now he and mom each have a room of their own
He sees dad on weekends and they talk on the phone
His questions need answers but all they will say
Is ""You'll understand why someday""

In the hill beside this river rest my mother's gentle bones

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

And their father had run away

When around the curve came a speedin' car
With a drunk man at the wheel

And hooted a drunkard sound
""Get out of the road, you little fools""
And the car had brought them down

To see what he had done
His heart sank within him
When he saw his dyin' on

He then picked up his little one
And carried him to his car
Then leanin' on the runnin' board
He prayed a drunkard's prayer

For this awful crime I've done""

To the words of his dyin' son

When the car had knocked us down""

That everything created here on earth all had voices singing
Every rock and every blade of grass even the ivy that was clinging
Every leaf and every drop of rain all had voices singing.

It brought the angels down in my dream so clear
Then the Lord sat down so that he could hear
The sea and waves were rushing to the shore
With the joy that they were bringing
A sound so perfect that it made me cry to hear their voices singing.

Struggling to find the words you face the task

Of alcohol and blackened lung
But how to bury seven of these
Appalachian miners sons.
Who stormed the beaches wave on wave,
And sailed home to these rocky graves
In family plots that bared their names.

Tomorrow I'll walk up, seven hillsides
Tremble before my flock on seven hillsides
Seven sorrows, seven sons, seven mothers and every one
Will turn to me for the word of God, what does this mean?
And there I'll stand good book in hand,
A shepherd to these precious lambs
What will I say, what will I say, what can I say?

To tell the truth I'd never thought much
About the will of God before.
Called to preach at seventeen
I was in love with fiery words and not much more.
The time has come to keep the faith
For others shattered by their loss.
Remind them of the loving God
Whose son like theirs paid the cost.
To save a sad and wicked world
Through sacrifice our love is heard
And pray that I believe those words.

You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Honey won't you open that door
This is your sweet daddy don't you love me no more?
It's cold outside let me sleep on the floor
Honey won't you open that door

Got in a poker game

Finally got back home
I'd have been better off where I was

Just a little way's with me.
An' as we walked,
Then we would talk
All about our wedding day.

""Darlin', say that you'll be mine;
In our home we'll happy be,
Down beside where the waters flow,
On the banks of the Ohio.""

I led her down the banks of sand,
I plunged her in
Where she would drown,
An' watched her as she floated down.

Returnin' home between twelve and one,
Thinkin', Lord, what a deed I've done;
I'd killed the girl
I love, you see,
Because she would not marry me.

The sheriff walked right to my door;
He says, ""Young man,
Don't try to run.

He wasted not his time away
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the things avail
But trusted one who never fails
Oh, Daniel prayed
Each morning, noon, and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night

They locked him in the lions' den
Because he could not honor men
But he prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
The jaws were locked; it made him shout
And God soon brought him safely out
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon, and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God
While upon the earth he trod
He prayed to God each morning, noon, and night
He cared not for the king's decrees
But trusted God to set him free
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night

Now, brother, let us watch and pray
Like Daniel did from day to day
He prayed to God
Every morning, noon, and night
We, too, can gladly dare and do
And pray to God he'll see us through
Oh, Daniel prayed
Every morning, noon, and night

Oh, Daniel served his living God

When you see that lantern swingin' yonder
Comin' up the Holler Road
Them dogs'll get to barkin'
Ought to tie 'em all up with a rope

Now, you boys better get in tune
Sis' Draper's gonna be here soon
Don't shoot no dice nor get too tight
If you're gonna pick with Sis' tonight

There was lightnin' in the air

Magnolias in her hair

She'll play all night if she feels like it
Drink some fruit punch if you spike it
Sis' don't care who don't like it
See, ol' Sis has got a heck of a bow arm on her

She stepped right up and sawed one off
And uncle Cleve dropped his jaw
Said she's the best I ever saw
She must be from Arkansas

Now, I think grandpa used to date her
Grandma said she still hates her
All the fellas stand up straighter
In the presence of Sis' Draper

Sis' Draper is her daddy's daughter
Plays the fiddle that he bought her
Plays it like her mamy taught her
She's a travelin' Arkansawyer

She put her fiddle in the box
And said it's getting awful late
She's on her way to Little Rock
And Little Rock can't wait

So, we all stood there in the yard
Hands full of watermelon
Watched her leave and watched her go
Wishin' we was in that wagon

Plays the fiddle that he bought her
Plays it like her mamy taught her
She's a travelin' Arkansawyer

Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you got till you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

A cool evening dance
Listening to the bluegrass band takes the chill
From the air till they play the last song
I'll do my time
Keeping you off my mind but there's moments
That I find, I'm not feeling so strong

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

Running down by the lake shore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

The boat's steaming in
I watch the side wheel spin and I
Think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
I knew all the time that she'd go

Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll

Well they ran into some city boys that didn't walk just right

Where they rack up the balls for the games
And reputations are made
There's a green forest full of oaks and pines
Where they cleared a cleared a space in the middle
Where secret scores are settled
And the claim was made round the table that night
And they rode off through the trees

And how one man fell to his knees

Will you seek Him while He stile may be found?
Are you afraid to die?

Are you unsaved?

Would you to Gods' bosom fly?
Soon He's comin' like a thief in the night

For my sweetheart she is gone

That I told her of her love

When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

O may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Has a wondrous attraction for me;

I've got the radio blastin'
I've got the windows rolled down
And I'm cruisin' these backroads
On the outskirts of town
I can feel the wind a-blowin'
Hear the big engines whine
When I'm cruisin' these backroads
All my troubles are behind

Well when I woke up this morning
Well I took me a look outside
It was plain to see it was one of those days
Tailor-made for taking a ride
So I went downstairs and cleared my head
With coffee and cigarettes
And when it hit me right there
Then my mind was set

Well I phoned work and told'em
They're going to be a man short today
I got the sunny day blues, there's only one thing
That's gonna make them go away
So I went out and I climbed in to my big ol' Chevrolet
And with a turn of the key and a cloud of dust
I was on my way

Well maybe I did maybe I didn't
Go and lose my job today
But you can take my cares, take my worries
And blow them all away
For there comes a time in any man's life
When he's got to break free
I got four good wheels and an endless road
Stretched out in front of me

I thought she'd
Come back again

Drivin' that hot pink rag top Lincoln car
Hair flyin' back just like a movie star
She pulls off the road and the door flys open wide
She says 'hey boy looks like you need a ride'.

Like drowning in honey
Being beaten with a velvet glove
Shot with a golden bullet
Still you can't get enough of Lola's love.
No you can't get enough of Lola.

Late one night you'll be on the lawn starin' up at Lola's room
While the red hot blues flow out of her radio
You're gonna wind up in her bed sure as there's a moon above
And son that feelin' ain't never gonna let you go

Like drowning in honey
Being beaten with a velvet glove
Shot with a golden bullet
Still you can't get enough of Lola's love.
No you can't get enough of Lola.

Can't get enough of Lola.

Ricky Van Shelton,"Well, I think I get the message I'm not deaf and I'm not blind
But the signals that I'm getting have caught me by surprise
It seems that you've decided to just get up and go
But if the reasons here are oh so clear there's one thing I've got to know.

Where was I, I wish I knew
You say it's all over baby I'm confused
Wasn't that you in my bed it must've been all in my head
When love finally said goodbye where was I.

I didn't hear the train a comin'
I didn't see the boat I missed
I didn't see the stop sign on the corner
And I'm sure that I didn't see this.

Ricky Van Shelton,"I don't know how she stole it I don't even know when
I'm not sayin' there was fore thought or malicious intent
But with it in her possession she disappeared in the dark
But wherever she is she still has my heart
It might be in Oklahoma that's where she called from last
Could be Denver could be Dallas she's been known to move fast
Now and then I hear rumors that she's back in these parts
But wherever she is she stil has my heart
She had deep blue eyes I thought I could trust
Tennessee drawl and an innocent face
I had no ideal she was dangerous
Till I gave her my heart she just walked away

Ricky Van Shelton,"I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play
And mild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had roll'd along th' unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

And in despair I bow'd my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong, and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead, nor doth He sleep
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
With peace on earth, good will to men.

The world revolved from night to day
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime

Here to stay is a new bird

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married, we'll say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town.

As we dream by the fire

We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way

Ricky Van Shelton,"I should have noticed this when
You started turning up in sad songs
It should have hit me when
You began to sing along
I should have realized when
There were tears in your eyes
Every time a song was through
It was more than the music
I was losing you

I should have seen it when
You started watchin' those late, late movies
And you'd sleep on the couch
Instead of sleeping next to me
When I'd wake up in the night
Sometimes I'd hear you cry
But, baby, I never knew
It was more than the movies
I was losing you

I wish you had screamed
And yelled out the things you held deep inside
'Cause I never dreamed
That our love was dyin' right before my eyes

But I should have felt it on
Those too few nights I held you
Oh, I should have known
All those whispers weren't true
There was a reason why you never looked in my eyes

Ricky Wilson,"The hammering from the pit and the pounding of guns grew louder. My fear rose at the sound of someone creeping into the house. Then I saw it was a young artilleryman, weary, streaked with blood and dirt.

      Artilleryman: Anyone here?
      Journalist: Come in. Here, drink this.
      Artilleryman: Thank you.
      Journalist: What's happened?
      Artilleryman: They wiped us out. Hundreds dead, maybe thousands.
      Journalist: The heat ray?
      Artilleryman: The Martians. They were inside the hoods of machines they'd made, massive metal things on legs. Giant machines that walked. They attacked us. They wiped us out.
      Journalist: Machines?
      Artilleryman: Fighting machines, picking up men and bashing them against trees. Just hunks of metal, but they knew exactly what they were doing.
      Journalist: Hmm. There was another cylinder came last night.
      Artilleryman: Yes. Yes, it looked bound for London.

London! Carrie! I hadn't dreamed there could be danger to Carrie and her father, so many miles away.

      Journalist: I must go to London at once.
      Artilleryman: And me, got to report to headquarters, if there's anything left of it.

At Byfleet, we came upon an inn, but it was deserted.

      Artilleryman: Is everybody dead?
      Journalist: Not everybody, look... 

Six cannons with gunners standing by.

      Artilleryman: Bows and arrows against the lightning.
      Journalist: Hmm.
      Artilleryman: They haven't seen the heat ray yet. 

We hurried along the road to Weybridge. Suddenly, there was a heavy explosion and gusts of smoke erupted into the air.

      Artilleryman: Look! There they are! What did I tell you!

Quickly, one after the other, four of the fighting machines appeared. Monstrous tripods, higher than the tallest steeple, striding over the pine trees and smashing them, walking tripods of glittering metal. Each carried a huge funnel and I realized with horror that I'd seen this awful thing before.
A fifth machine appeared on the far bank. It raised itself to full height, flourished the funnel high in the air, and the ghostly terrible heat ray struck the town.
As it struck, all five fighting machines exulted, emitting deafening howls which roared like thunder:

      Martians: Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla! Ulla!

The six guns we had seen now fired simultaneously, decapitating a fighting machine. The Martian inside the hood was slain, splashed to the four winds, and the body, nothing now but an intricate device of metal, went whirling to destruction. As the other monsters advanced, people ran away blindly, the artilleryman among them, but I jumped into the water and hid until forced up to breathe. Now the guns spoke again, but this time the heat ray sent them to oblivion.
With a white flash the heat ray swept across the river. Scalded, half blinded and agonized, I staggered through leaping, hissing water towards the shore. I fell in full sight of the Martians, expecting nothing but death. The foot of a fighting machine came down close to my head, then lifted again as the four Martians carried away the debris of their fallen comrade, and I realized that by a miracle, I had escaped.

Ricky Wilson,"Artilleryman: We're gonna build a whole new world for ourselves. Look, they clap eyes on us and we're dead, right? So, we gotta make a new life where they'll never find us. You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP!

      Now our domination of the earth is fading fast,

      To build a better future from the ashes of the past,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      Look, man is born in freedom, but he soon becomes a slave,
      In cages of convention from the cradle to the grave,
      The weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be saved,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,
      We'll start all over again!

      I'm not trying to tell you what to be,

      And imagine the destruction of all that you despise,
      Slowly from the ashes the phoenix will arise,
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men
      We'll start all over again!

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

      Take a look around you at the world you've loved so well,
      And bid the aging empire of man a last farewell
      It may not sound like heaven but at least it isn't hell
      It's a brave new world with just a handful of men,
      We'll start, we'll start all over again!
      All over again! All over again! All over again!
      I'VE GOT A PLAN!

      Artilleryman: Can't you just see it? Civilization starting all over again! A second chance! Heh- we'll even build a railway and tunnel to the coast, go there for our holidays! Nothing can stop men like us! I've made a start already. Come on down here and have a look.

In the cellar there was a tunnel scarcely ten yards long. It had taken him a week to dig. I could have dug that much in a day, and I suddenly had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his power.

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Rico,"I want you to sit back, close your eyes
And think about all those wonderful times that we used to have here
Now I know things aren't the way they use to be right now
But they are going to get better some day
And I know that

Ever since I was about 12 that's when they documented me
A gang member let me tell you my autobiography
Ay I can't let it to be frenetic, it must have been genetic
To get in trouble with the law take when I break
I'm strapped from the balls that's what I use to do
Smoking a joint or two Lil' Rob getting a little blaze
Welcome to my concrete maze, remember the days
I remember going to school, we meet by the track smoking a sack
With the vato I sold it too, get him stoned
Then I jack it back, remember the guero use to look at us all
Funny and strange, cause my pants was bigger then theirs
But now they all wear them the same
I used to get jealous, wondering why I didn't have the same rights
Is it because I'm running up and down, eating Menudo, frijoles and rice?
Someone explain to me, all of this insanity
I'm not understanding you, never understanding me
When a minority, gets their priorities straight
We become the majority, inflate
Incredible rate, controlling our fate
Controlling our states, and I can't wait
Remember you told me I would never amount to anything
That I'll probably be on the streets sellin mota or methamphetamines
So what? It made me an extra buck when I was shit outta my life
You'd do the same thing homie if you were stuck

And I remember, when times was easy
That's what everybody says
But not me, wicked ass times on S.D. streets
But I still loved them (But I still love them)
And had to have them. (And had to have them)

And I remember!
Remembering the things we used to do
The places we used to go

And I remember kicking under the street lamps, smokin a J
Hearing my Homie say, Homie pass the joint this way
And this was everyday and every night was the same
We didn't call each other by our first or last, but by nicknames
Dreamer, Peewee, Oso Negro to name a few
One passed away, rest in peace
The others locked away in prison blues
One of the things we use to do
Can't nobody take it away from us
We used to live life dangerous, time flew away like angel dust
Never known as presentado levas
Stay away from metiches, and chepas
Talking mentiras, cause they can't beat us
Mira Lil' Rob on his lowrider bicicleta
Looking for muñecas, beautiful like aztecas
But when it comes to love, before the agony for the ecstacy
What comes around goes around
So baby don't mess with me don't be testing me
Cause Lil' Rob be one of a kind original individual
Unforgettable memorable indelible incredible inferable

And I remember, when times was easy
That's what everybody says
But not me, wicked ass times on S.D. streets
But I still loved them (But I still love them)
And had to have them. (And had to have them)

And I remember!
Remembering the things we used to do
The places we used to go

Give all of my love to mi madre padre brother and sister
And all of my sangre
Enemies? Chale me vale verga estas afuera mirando padentro
You wanna come in but you can't
Cause we're not in love with no mensos
Figuring it out like a pencil
Treat one like a stencil
Just when you think you've got a grip on life
That's when you let go, ready set go
It's a race to the finish and only the best gonna win this
And I'm prepared to take it to outer limits or until it's finished business
What is this? Gente becoming witnesses
I don't know nothing, I don't hear nothing, I don't see nothing
Something I learned as a kid
Along with respect those who respect you
Forget about the ones that will forget about you
My recollection is a collection of a big section of mi vida
Memories I need ya, like a junky needs his chiba
I wish that I could go back and do it all over again
But I know that that ain't happening, so I sit remembering 

And I remember, when times was easy
That's what everybody says
But not me, wicked ass times on S.D. streets
But I still loved them (But I still love them)
And had to have them. (And had to have them)

Rico,"„Yo, alles klar, Dicka? Lange nicht gesehen! 
Läuft bei dir – rennt, fliegt, Dicka! 
Läuft, machst du gut, ja! Was'n eigentlich mit mir, he?“

Nein, nein, nein! Nein, nein!

Alles okay, hundertmal besser als die letzten Jahre
Mucke läuft gut, ja, du hast recht, das ist ein schöner Wagen
Keine Ahnung, wie teuer die Kette ist, sie war ein Geschenk
Wie nett, dass du mir gönnst, doch deine Augen sagen, dass du anders denkst
„Warum ich nicht, wenn sein Erfolg doch auch sicher durch mich ist?“
Glaube mir, Neid ist eine Schlange und jeder Biss von ihr vergiftet dich
Ich hab' für jeden Cent geblutet in diesem Haifischbeckenbusiness
Wenn du dann nur ein kleiner Fisch bist, kommt ein nächster an und frisst dich
Genug für all, doch jeder will vor dich an die Spitze
Nach dir kommen eine Millionen mit mehr Hunger als du und jeder davon will es wissen
Doch sei ihnen gegönnt, denn ich weiß, wie schwer der Weg ist
Nur wer sich hochkämpft versteht es

Dicka, bau dich auf, stapel dein Brot, Homie
Doch nimm die Hände weg! Hände weg!
Hände weg von meinem!
Fokussier dein Ziel und lass nicht los
Doch nimm die Hände weg! Hände weg!
Hände weg von meinem!
Fahr deinen Weg vollgas, auch über Rot
Doch nimm die Hände weg! Hände weg!
Hände weg von meinem!
Und egal, was du machst, Dicka, mach es groß
Aber nimm die Hände weg!
Viel schneller als dir lieb ist sind wir tot
Aber nimm die Hände weg von meinem

Hass ist Neid und Neid ist Ruhm
Hass mich so stark du nur kannst, alles cool!
Hass ist Neid und Neid ist Ruhm
Jetzt, wo es läuft, wollen sie connecten, doch ich hab' leider viel zu tun

Alles Teil der Nahrungskette, jeder frisst sich hoch
Und kommen wir fett genug da oben an, dann frisst uns der Tod
Aus einem Fahrrad wird ein Auto, nach dem Auto Haus und „Buff!“
Aus einem Cent eine Millionen, aber dein Nachbar hat ein Boot
Nie genug, nie genug – ist der Kreislauf dieses Lebens
Denn wenn man nix hat, dann ist wenig viel, doch wenn man zu viel hat, ist viel zu wenig
Wieso ihm gönnen, wenn er was kann, was sie nicht können?
So schnell auseinandergelebt, weil sie nur stehen, während man rennt
Doch es ist schwach, wenn man ihn hasst, anstatt, dass man selber rennt
Denn andre beneiden das Sich-zu-der-eigenen-Unterlegenheit-Bekennen
Und ich will kein Teil von diesem Kreis sein, jubel' dir zu, wenn du vor mir auf dem Weg bist
Nur wer sich hochkämpft versteht es

Dicka, bau dich auf, stapel dein Brot, Homie
Doch nimm die Hände weg! Hände weg!

Fokussier dein Ziel und lass nicht los
Doch nimm die Hände weg! Hände weg!

Und egal, was du machst, Dicka, mach es groß
Aber nimm die Hände weg!
Viel schneller als dir lieb ist sind wir tot
Aber nimm die Hände weg von meinem

Auch wenn die Zeiten hart sind – Herz aus Eis, kein Gefühl
Der Kopf aus Stein, Blicke alt, das Gute lang nicht hier
Nehm' dir die Augen aus deinem Rücken
Denn ich gönne ihnen von Herzen, sogar wenn sie nicht mehr teilen

Rico,"Dunkle Tage, lange Nächte
Jeder Streit wird gleich ein Krieg
Fame spendet Rampenlicht, aber leider keine Energie
Ein Klumpen Eis in meiner Brust
Ein kaltes Herz kann nicht mehr fühlen
Fast keine Liebe mehr für Menschen
Nur noch der Schmerz ist intensiv
So viel Hass in meinem Bauch
Ich will schreien, doch es kommt nix raus
Ball die Finger zu 'ner Faust
Und zerschlag dein Bild meines Lebens
So viele vermeintliche Brüder
Sie klauten guten Leuten den Platz
Kopf durch die Wand, doch dahinter kam nur Regen
Leere Worte sind wie Luft
Ohne Sauerstoff, wir ersticken
Warum haben Schlechte profitiert
Und die Guten bei mir gelitten
Schnelles Geld sieht süß aus
Doch schmeckt hinterher immer bitter
Ich bin hier, die Hände blutig
Und puzzle mit tausend Splittern

Doch irgendwie geht es schon weiter
Die letzten Meter ins Ziel
Lass' ich mich tragen vom Wind
Was soll schon groß schief gehen
Wenn man das Ende schon kennt
Ich bau dir aus den Scherben meines Lebens ein Bild

Ich bau' ein Mosaik
Ich greife rein in das Splittermeer, das vor mir liegt
Ich bau' ein Mosaik
Setz' alle Scherben zusammen, bis es ein Bild ergibt
Ich bau' ein Mosaik
Ich greife rein in das Splittermeer, das vor mir liegt
Ich bau' ein Mosaik
Setz' alle Scherben zusammen, bis es ein Bild ergibt

Blick' durch ein goldenes Gitter
Vor mir nur Splitter
Dieses Leben schmeckt bitter
Folgemäßig verdient
Doch dafür hat's nur nicht gereicht
Habe bis heute nix erreicht
Weil ich abgelenkt durch Schlägereien und Polizei war
Für meine Mutter nur ein Nichtsnutz, Rumtreiber
So ging's nicht weiter
Scherben - mein Mosaik
Auch wenn alles zerbricht
Und du nicht mehr willst
Komm, ich sing' dir ein Lied davon
Und auch wenn ich mal nicht mehr weiter weiß
Wird jede Scherbe zu einem Puzzleteil
Ich ertrinke nicht in Selbstmitleid
Und bau' mir ein Mosaik

The more I understand the ride, the more I slide
The more you put me back in line, the more I tried
The more you looked into my eyes, the more you lied

I come back crazier, but feel much better
You come back crazier, you'll feel better

The more I disregard the signs, the more I fly
The more I walk across the lines, the more I glide

You come back crazier, but feel much better
You come back crazier, you'll feel better

Rico,"Mein Business im Griff alles lief wie am Schnürchen
Hatte das Koks in den Kapseln und das Weed in den Tütchen
Ich war drauf, ich wollt hustlen
Ich wollt raus in die Gassen, eintausend Gramm pro Tag war doch keine große Sache
Damals, war ich gierig, ich wollt mehr von dem Scheiß
Hielt immer das Angebot niedrig und verschärfte den Preis
Denn, zu viele Opfas, die dir meist Honig ums Maul schmiern
Denn der ganze Ott macht kommt mir so nicht ins Haus, hier
Läuft das anders, als Vollbluthustler ist man nun mal vorbelastet, Standard, Drogen ticken, ganztags
Mich auf mein Leben feiern, täglich, ballern alles war so leicht, es
Ging auf Herz fernab von Karriereleitern
Aus dem Nichts standen acht Wichser vor der Tür
Ich hatte Glück und wurde nicht dem Haftrichter vorgeführt
Alles ging zu schnell, plötzlich ist man vorbestraft
Mein Leben war gefickt und das Business im Arsch

Vorbestraft, vorbelastet, die Reue kommt, wenn du im Knast bist
Doch ich hol mir was ich brauch, mach dein Portemonnaie jetzt auf, ein Herz für Drogen, Junge, kauf

Harte Zeiten durchlebt, falsche Menschen verdrängt
Teil der Seele verloren, meine Geschichte bleibt verschreckt
Doch ich geh fixiert, doch mein Ziel zu, Tunnelblick
Scheuklappen auf der Straße, sieh mich, doch du kennst mich nicht
Opfer sagen viele Dinge, weil wir fighten und
Doch immerhin bleibt ein Wort und bei Nacht komm ich dich holen
Toter Blick, kalter Stahl, manche haben keine Wahl
Messer zücken, in den Rücken, nur weil ihr keine Eier habt
Packt die Klingen ein, Wichser was, na komm Einzelkampf
Deine Freunde ficken, bis ich Chicko von der Leine lass
Schön, du bist vorbestraft, was für ein harter Mann
Trotzdem kackst du ab wenn du ein Tag von meinem Stress hast
Vorbelastet, von falschen Taten und Dingen
An Tagen wie diesen, die mich zu all dem Bösen zwingen
Zu tief drin bist du nur wenn du es willst
Lässt, du dich ficken, dann passiert es auch, dass man dich fickt

Vorbestraft, Vorbelastet, die Reue kommt, wenn du im Knast bist
Doch wir haben keine andere Wahl, müssen Rechnungen bezahln Herzog, Kontra K

Ich komm in die Hood mit drei, vier Kilos Gras, oder Peace in der Sporttasche, mieseste Mordslage
Kreuzberg, Neukölln, Marktstraße, Gneisenau
Weiß-Grünes, doch, hin und wieder weißes auch
Teil es auf unter Brüdern, rauch das Kraut mit den Führern
Vollbluthustler, DPK, es sind Herzog, Kontra K
Mukke pumpen, Drogen pushen, überschwemm den Markt
Dieser Staat will uns ficken, doch beim Ticken bleib ich hart
Ich sondiere, reguliere, wovon zahl ich meine Miete?
Mukke bringt kaum cash, deshalb hustle ich mit Wiese
Doch die Bullen kennen mein Gesicht und meine Fingerabdrücke
Das hindert mich nicht daran, dass ich ein paar Dinger abwickel

Now how you gonna fuck my boy
That's why I don't love them hoes
You can't trust these dog ass hoes

Verse: 1

I was in love like a motherfucker with this bitch
But uhh, I wasn't doing nothing but making her rich (shit)
But damn, she used to played it so cooled
I guess she must take see for a fool
I swear the sex had my motherfucking mind gone
And I was tweeking like a fiend for that heroin
And when I put it in, the way that she moaned,
made me never ever wanted to leave her alone
The back rubs in the hot tubs, watching videos
It made me crawl when she took it all down her throat
Surprise, shit I hit her with a five karat
And later on we can talk about marriage (huh)
Ya name tatted on my chest, fuck them other broads
We hold hands when we walking through the shopping malls
My brother told me V charge it to the game
But uhh, listen up, cause it's a motherfucking shame

Verse: 2

I used to page this girl about ten times a day
But after 9, she was hard to find
One-of-a-kind, huh, so I was blind with the problems we had
Found a number in her purse, said it was her dad
I got a phone call from my nigga Jubilee
He told me, he saw my girl in the movies
With another nigga, nut it wasn't me
I said man, you must be tripping, nigga it couldn't be
I thought it was love, but I guess the love was gone
So then I put up the phone and then I went home
Park the car, walked in the door, walked up the stairs
And I damn near slipped on her underwear
Opened the bedroom door, seen a ho,
with a nigga ro, bout to grab my fo-fo, hold
Damn, bitch I thought we loved each other
Nasty bitch gonna fuck my brother

Bitch, get the fuck out my house,
pick up your dirty ass draws, get that cum off your chest, 
and wipe your motherfucking mouth, and get the fuck out, biatch!
Fuck you gonna fuck my motherfucking boy

Listen up motherfuckers I got a story to tell
All you niggas out there holding hands with these motherfuckers street
Them motherfuckers behind doors holding meat
You might be holding a nasty ass

Chorus (2x):

Nasty bitch, gonna fuck my boy
Now how you gonna fuck my boy
That's why I don't love them hoes
You can't trust these dog ass hoes

Verse: 1

I was in love like a motherfucker with this bitch
But uhh, I wasn't doing nothing but making her rich (shit)
But damn, she used to played it so cooled
I guess she must take see for a fool
I swear the sex had my motherfucking mind gone
And I was tweeking like a fiend for that heroin
And when I put it in, the way that she moaned,
made me never ever wanted to leave her alone
The back rubs in the hot tubs, watching videos
It made me crawl when she took it all down her throat
Surprise, shit I hit her with a five karat
And later on we can talk about marriage (huh)
Ya name tatted on my chest, fuck them other broads
We hold hands when we walking through the shopping malls
My brother told me V charge it to the game
But uhh, listen up, cause it's a motherfucking shame

Chorus (2x)

Verse: 2

I used to page this girl about ten times a day
But after 9, she was hard to find
One-of-a-kind, huh, so I was blind with the problems we had
Found a number in her purse, said it was her dad
I got a phone call from my nigga Jubilee
He told me, he saw my girl in the movies
With another nigga, nut it wasn't me
I said man, you must be tripping, nigga it couldn't be
I thought it was love, but I guess the love was gone
So then I put up the phone and then I went home
Park the car, walked in the door, walked up the stairs
And I damn near slipped on her underwear
Opened the bedroom door, seen a ho,
with a nigga ro, bout to grab my fo-fo, hold
Damn, bitch I thought we loved each other
Nasty bitch gonna fuck my brother

Bitch, get the fuck out my house,
pick up your dirty ass draws, get that cum off your chest, 
and wipe your motherfucking mouth, and get the fuck out, biatch!
Fuck you gonna fuck my motherfucking boy
Ol' cheesy ass ho
I didn't like you anyway
Biatch
I catch you in the club, I'ma sneak your ass
Fuck, nasty bitch

Rico J. Puno,"I believe that children are our future;
Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

I'm on the grind all day until the sun go down, 
Puttin' paper in my pockets grindin' all year round' 
I'm on the block with the gangstas stayin' two toes down I'm on the grind.
I'm on the grind all night until the sun come up, 
Countin' cash up in the cut tryin' to make me a buck, 
I'm making moves stacking paper cause I'm handelin' ya, I'm on my grind.

Check it out baby.
I got money on my mind, big frank on my brain, 
Intoxicated by visions of chains and diamond rings, 
One thing here to obtain is fortune forget the fame 
Been ballin' since back in the game been changin the strings, 
These lames tend to complain its a goddamn shame 
You think you flier than a plain but you washed up in the drain, 
Baby paint the picture frame its all work no play, 
My hustle schedule is simpley all night all day, 
I'm snapping like paparazzi I'm plotting on Maserati 
Been grinding since lotty dotty 
Trying to earn that pay collecting that green paper 
I'm scheming and pulling capers 
I'm giving these brouds the vapers 
From the fold to the tray.
I'm on the grind

[Chorus]

My hustle is Godzilla, my muscle is king kong,
My mind is Einstein, my flow is off the dome, 
My grind is dope feen addicted to counting green, 
My money is bill gates my ballin' is yow ming, 
I'm not impressed with bling I'm more conserned with ching, 
Grinding since I was a teen, money over everything, 
See I'm all about that paper stacks and bank rolls 
The lack on fo's with drank cold and dank roll.
Hustle is my hobby inspired by johnny gotti call me, 
Give me the wallet because its time to collect, 
V-S up in the johnny watch shining so clear 
The face look like a mirror call it time to reflect.

Your pussy so good
I wanna put alarm on it
Like baby food, I wanna put my tongue on it
If you’s a stripper baby
I’d put the ones on it
I love getting on that liquor
And going dumb on it
I want it off the market
Put it in the freezer
And when I slide through
You can unfreeze it
You got flowers in
You got that good seed
Like being in the rain
You get wet easy

I swear the pussy so good
I might fuck around and put something on it
She said what you got on it?
I said anything that you want girl
But if I buy them bags, buy them shoes, buy them purse
Then nobody better not be getting that pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
And if I paid them bills every month on the first
Then nobody better not be getting my pussy
(Long as that pussy faithful, whatever she want is paid for)
I swear you do it so good

You won’t get the voicemail
I answer you first call
Even if your light red
We still talk

I give it to you straight raw
And I’m breaking bread, you the first off
You like Florida to me, you stay warm
I’m the real Energizer bunny
But the hood version I keep going
We start off with kisses
You hear me snoring
I show off your finesse
Then I hit you with bam bam bam

When it come to get it in, you versatile
When it come to the threads, got your own style
When it come to me, though
Make you throw in the towel

My ex was good, but you even better
Need to run for office, the White House
If it’s bout how good your sex is, you gon' win hands down

How you’re in a lab with a jump showing off a Benz
Not even knowing you can ...
I’ll be courtside at the lake show
And I bet she know who all the niggas is!
Saying that’s her bro or her bestie
Bitch prolly' fucked half for the SPs.
And I bet she got two phones
You’ll be like, “do you smile like that when you text me?”
Head super cold, unemployed
But always be a allstar, week in the super-bowl
Super hoe, she living large
Staying underneath was clothes, always in a different car.
I can never be mad at her grind
Do your thing, love! The head shine
But if you kill a nigga over her
Shit, I hope you do a whole lot of time!

Pre-Chorus:
Holler at me, I can tell you, what is hidden, foe
Everybody in the club got her info
She a freak, she a whop, she a nimpho
So make sure you don’t get sentimental!

Up in the gentleman's club getting tipsy
Damn I miss white chocolate
Anybody seen Sugar?
If I was having money back then
Swear to God I'd have took her
Nah nah, Irene the dream
I see them turn rich niggas into fiends
I hit boy toy when I was 20
She told a young nigga
Whole lot of themes
Made a nigga wanna get rich
And on nights like this
I sit in my hotel room

O-5, pounds in the Laredo, they gotta get there today though
Ain’t no time for tryna lay low, bay bro, if you can’t do it all you gotta do is say no
I’ll take it from there, Asians on gram ready to work it, displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge, behind the van, in the cab, I made the drop off
Thanks Einstein that nothing popped off, since I was young,
handled lots of foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that bad thing, I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in, of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music, thinking how I’m gonna do this

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
God have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

I’m from a place called the jungle where they live in this rough
It had me low for a while now I’m picking it up
Holding the spot straight sticking it ripping it up
I dropped 99 problems, switching not giving a fuck
So what you what you want? got your bitch nigga gripping the butt
I ran my dick, taking pics nigga flicking it up
My clique is a circle, fuck you want?
You’ll end up dumped jumped party in a truck in New York
There’s no ducking me, the Bada$$ time, there’s no fuckery
Won’t find a chick who got a diamond, or take a single buck from me
These hoes be loving me, I keep it so G
Respecting where I be nigga check your OG
My back flow will mirror your fat flows
Well here it go my, visage is lineal when I’m ripping the video
It’s a lyrical miracle when I enter your stereo
The rarest breeds, sick like venereal diseases

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me

Dying for nothing
Killing to live, fighting for something
To bad we don’t know what it is
What you think all of this cash for?
Trying to put stamps on my passport
Man I’m just scheming on new homes
I already forgot about my last broad

Uh, temptations real

Building up defenses
Making up rules by which we play

Staking our positions
But stupid superstitions
Only give fools too heavy a load

Her body's bruised but her soul's not battered
The fireman tried but the hose was frozen
The cupboard's bare but the door needs closing

From being where we want to
And seeing who it's fun to
Not blaming ourselves for our mistakes

We spend half a dream away
Just looking out of windows
Waiting for a signal
Waiting for night to return to day

The milk turned sour but my thirst needs quenching
The meat was dead and I need me feeding
The room was cold but the night was freezing

A dog runs wild and the brakes are screaming
A church on fire is struck by lightning

The princess frowned at her lovers mistress

A teacher's drowned and a child is laughing

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

I felt adrenaline pump
The split second that i saw you walk in
A little voice inside
Said ""better hold on tight
Get ready set go you're gonna fall again""

[Chorus]
How fast is a speeding bullet
How fast can superman fly
How fast does a shooting star
Race across the sky
How fast can a dream come true
All i know is one look at you
And i fell in the blink of an eye.

I felt my temperature burn
I felt the whole world turn

Like gravity was pulling your heart to mine
When you looked at me like that
Quicker than a finger snap
I saw you and me forever in record time

It's never too late, no matter how long
We're never that far
We are connected at the heart

I know God's listening to me
Sometimes I have to work a little on my faith

But I don't have to see Him to believe
Isn't that a little bit like you and me?

Juste pour dire que le meilleur reste à venir
Et que la raison est dans chaque homme en devenir
Puis viennent le doute et la souffrance
Très vite le rêve devient espoir
Puis viennent la peur et le cauchemar
Et tous ces hommes qui en ont marre

Allo, allo répondez-moi ! Ici la Terre, y a-t-il quelqu'un là-haut ?
Allo, allo répondez-moi ! Ici la Terre, il fait trop chaud en bas


Il fait trop chaud en bas…

Et si demain était la fin
Quelle expérience devrais-je tirer de tout ça
Sans doute que la vie n'est qu'un moyen
Pour se rendre compte que nous sommes rien
D'autres que les mêmes truffés d'amour
D'autres que les mêmes truffés d'amour
Et de tant de haine

Allo, allo répondez-moi ! Ici la Terre, y a-t-il quelqu'un là-haut ?
Allo, allo répondez-moi ! Ici la Terre, il fait trop chaud en bas


Il fait si froid en bas…",Répondez-Moi,2009
Ridan,"T'es une star du petit écran
Tous tes amis te l'ont dit
On dit de toi, le garçon dans le vent
Tu as déjà ce petit don
Que les gens appellent talent
Vu que tu chantes, depuis bientôt un an
T'as fait tes classes à la Starnac'
Du coup t'as quitté tes parents
Pour le triomphe et pour son bel Arc
Et pour percer le grand mystère
De la réussite sur terre
D'être une star, minute
Mais t'en sais rien

Tu es né pour être une star mon grand
Pour faire briller les yeux de tous ces gens
T'arriverais même à faire chialer les chiens
T'es une star minute, une star minute
Mais t'en sais rien

Faudrait que t'écoutes tes professeurs
Les conseillers seront les payeurs
D'ailleurs bien plus, je pense tes détracteurs
N'oublie jamais que t'es qu'un amateur
Bien observé par ces matteurs
Enfermé par ce drôle d'animateur
Au vu de l'audience de ce vendredi
Que penserai-tu de te travestir
En jeune dandy, bellâtre de la rive gauche
Ou en rocker un peu rebelle
À la chevelure couleur débauche
Tu seras une star, minute
Mais t'en sais rien

Tu es né pour être une star mon grand
Pour faire briller les yeux de tous ces gens
T'arriverais même à faire chialer les chiens
T'es une star minute, une star minute
Mais t'en sais rien

Cela fait cinq ans que t'as pris l'eau
Que racontent-ils ces beaux salauds
À ce qui paraît, t'aurais pris le melon
Et qu'entre deux rayons de légumes
On trouve toujours de bons navets
Pour faire une soupe, un peu trop populaire
N'oublie jamais de remercier ton bel ami patibulaire
Qu'a fait de toi un bon bouc émissaire
C'est vraiment con pour les Artistes
Tu sais, tous ceux qu'on dit « les vrais »
Qui se donnent du mal…
Mais qu'on écoute jamais

I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these narcs
Be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
Busta, you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckerss since I lost my momma
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky, G, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

Without no doubt I ain't no slouch and it ain't time to back down
So I jumps in and try to stop-a and watch-a
Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know, or ever knew
Was born with 7 flows and only heaven knew
For beat the boot sex, the news breaks, the you shakes
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a 2-fake
Yoo-hoo to you crew and you too so you knew
I'm from Jersey and I'm a teen so your block more than you do
Whose the new crew?
Show me your neck brotha, and here's another
Smack your mother's mamma's mother
In the first mob of all those other crack lovers
Back was bitch-ass, trick ass, cluk-clow-cluk-clow
How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it
The same thing minus ""P"" hangin possies like an exponent
Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it
It makes no sense to smell like shit
If old ass George could be Washing-tons

Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks, just buckin the shots
And packin the Glocks
And dodgin the cops, and takin over niggas spots
Poppin after poppin the fools be droppin, the hoes be hoppin
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together
So what's up? We can do whatever
Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
Then through to the Pac I brings the Glock I wets up
You fuckin body, I'm like, Oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him
So I got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me, a place to lays my head low
I lives doin my rap, but I dies for my hood row

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride

Riders in the Sky,"Pecos Bill was quite a cowboy down in Texas
The Western Superman to say the least
He was the roughest, toughest critter
Never known to be a quitter
'Cause he never had no fear of man, nor beast

So yippee-I-ay-I-ya, yippee-I-o
He's the toughest critter west of the Alamo

Pecos roped through raging cyclone out of nowhere
He saddled it and straddled it with ease
While that cyclone bucked and flitted
Pecos rolled a smoke and lit it
And he tamed that ordinary wind down to a breeze

So yippee-I-ay-I-ya, yippee-I-o
He's the toughest critter west of the Alamo

Pecos lost his way while traveling on the desert
(Water, water, water)
It was ninety miles across the burning sand
(Water, water, water)
He knew he'd never reach the border
If he didn't get some water
So he got a stick and dug the Rio Grande

While a tribe of painted Indians did a war dance
Pecos started shooting up their little game
He gave those redskins such a shakeup
That they jumped out of their makeup
That's how the Painted Desert got it's name

While reclining on a cloud, high over Texas
With his guns he made the stars evaporate
As he watched them all declining
He left one brightly shining
As the emblem of the Lone Star Texas State

Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I

Riders in the Sky,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot, Rod, Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,2005

Wide awake, I open up my eyes
Tell me what this life, it really means?

Take it or leave it
You’re like a sickness

Darker days have taken up my time
A little change is all I really need
Take me down a road, I’ve never been

Sooner or later
You’ll be the shadow
Crawling in my head

Take it or leave it
You’re like a sickness
I am infected

When everything is going wrong
Turn around and carry on
Just the pain of saying goodbye
You can leave this world tonight

You were meant to feel the sun
Burn away from everyone
When you feel so far from hope
Close you eyes 'cuz

Sooner or later
You’ll be the shadow
Crawling in my head

You’re like a sickness

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Je t'avais dit que je te laisserai jamais.
Mais je ne te supporte pas.
Tu m'as tellement donné d'amour.
Et je t'ai rien rendu en retour.
Et fais toi une raison mais c'est quoi cette fille.
Je crie ""Au secours"".
J'ai pas envie de venir vivre chez tes parents.
Et toi quand tu pleurais.
Beh moi je trouvais ça marrant.
J'comprends que c'est fini aujourd'hui plus que jamais.
Comme Gainsbourg, je suis venu te dire que je m'en vais.
Gauche, droite, quel est la bonne direction?
Oh, pas notre relation est en flexion.
Tu veux une situation, moi un peu de réflexion.
J'oublie les bons moments.
Je ne retiens que nos frictions.
Pourquoi le fait de te parler me fais partir au quart de tour?
Pourquoi quand on se balade j'ai l'impression de faire Paris-Tour?
Pourquoi j'ai plus envie de toi?
Plus envie d'y croire?
Plus envie de voir nos deux visage dans le miroir?
Je sais que c'est pas de ta faute j'aimerais pouvoir changer les choses.
Si notre histoire est un poème je veux changer des proses.
Pourquoi je ne vois plus cette lumière qui scintille dans tes yeux?
Cette nuit j'ai fait un rêve et je crois qu'on était deux.

J't'en pris reste cool.

Merci, c'est tout.

Riem De Wolff,"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Where the mountains high
Seem to kiss the sky
Someone is out yonder, o'er the hills
Waiting patiently, Waiting just for me
 
Ramona, I hear the mission bells above

I press you, caress you, and bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember the rambling rose you wear in your hair

Ramona, we'll meet beside the water fall
I dread the dawn when I awake to find you gone
Ramona I need you my own

By a babbling brook
Where we'll find a nook
To build our own love nest, o'er the hills

Riemann,"I heard she drove the silvery sports car
Along the empty streets last night
Hanging around
With hair-dos like mine

Just like a harpsichordist she moves
And back upstairs at half past two
With a paper folded outside the loo

Dim all the lights and
Cry coloured tears again

Softened beautiful face with the puzzle piece lineup

Understand who you are, they told us to be patient
But it’s pointless like the use of emojis in conversation
Question mark face
What does it mean?
It means stay up on your life, focus on them sixteens
But they want that fifteen like Sharkeisha and Terio

If you don't slow down and
Realize what you're doing
You might lose everything

'Cause time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop
I said time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop

Sometimes I feel, feel like my time has passed
Like I'm an hourglass, and the sand is moving fast (moving too fast)
In this life I live, my dad is my best friend
But it seems like I only call him, when I need some money
The people around me, I mean the ones that I do have
It's like they're here today, they'll probably be gone tomorrow
When its raining hard, and my car breaks down
I got no one to call on, except triple-A

'Cause time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop
I said time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop

Here we go again, in my life all alone again
I got no wife, I got no kids
No one to come home to, no one to cook for me
And when I'm sick, its a catastrophe
My days are slow, and my nights are cold
And when I go to sleep, I gotta keep the TV on
My ex gal still call me private, she asks if I'm doing fine
But she has a daughter (how am I gonna be fine?)
And the baby ain't mine

'Cause time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop
I said time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop

Do all my time up on this earth they told what I couldn't make (what I couldn't make)
And I gotta put it in their face (put it in their face)
Was on my grind just a waste of time?
I think that they're hearing me, but they don't wanna really deal with me
Through all these years, from what I've seen
I've had friends steal from me, the same ones who lived with me
When I got grown and dropped out of school
Nobody was broke with me, but now they all wanna roll with me

'Cause time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop
I said time goes by
It goes on
And it don't stop",Time,2014

Every treasure on earth to be young at heart

Look at all you'll derive out of bein' alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start

When troubles call, and your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned, that wall could fall

Once there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram, scram
He kept buttin' that dam

'Cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes
He had high apple pie, in the sky hopes

'stead of feelin' sad

Riga Recording Studio Orchestra,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows 
And did it my way",My Way,1998

Turn it up it's my favourite song... sha laa laa

We are having it away and the weekend starts today

Righteous Child,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
'Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like ooh
Ooh too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance

When I was your man
Do all those things I should have done

Eso no es para que tú te preocupes, 
Que tu traes otros colgando es lo que supe, 
Se me hace que contigo ya no puedo, 
Prefiero tener nada mejor solo yo me quedo, 
Por que no buscas a alguien más para hacer menso 
Y así, esto yo ya no lo pienso 
Cada vez al preguntarle, me sale con cada excusa 
Y yo imaginándome otra cosa más sabrosa 
Es difícil, pero con ella me comporto, 
A veces pienso, no será que tiene otro 
Que la anda enamorando y conquistando como yo, 
Pues un poco mas cuidado si la neta tiene novio 
Y si no, pues a ver como le haré

Tú llegaste a mi vida como nunca espere
Tú llegaste a mi vida como no imaginé
Tú llenaste el vacío de puro amor
Tú llenaste el vacío de puro amor

Como un regalo de rosas así es mi Dios
Cuida su novia como la niña de sus ojos
Como serenata visita mi alma
Y mi corazón enamorado sale al balcón",Corazon Enamorado,2004

",Psychotherapy,1991
Rigor Mortis,"We are instruments of evil we come straight from hell
We're the legions of the demons that are haunting for the kill
Cathedrals are now cemeteries doom is all you see
We have come to take the world and give you misery
We are pestilent and contaminate the world
And make tombs of your cities
We come bursting through your bodies, rape your helpless soul
Transform you into a creature merciless and cold
We force you to kill your brother eat his blood and brain
Shredding flesh and sucking bone 'till everyone's insane
We are pestilent and contaminate the world
Demonic legions prevail
We are pestilent and contaminate the world
And make tombs of your cities
Demons!
",Demons,1995
Rihanna,"Here we lay face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be to first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to could-have-beens and we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away 
As your lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
Say I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but
We're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million
Miles away

Was it me, or was it you that broke away? 
For what we were is like a season love is change and every
Time I think about it, it tears me up inside. 
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.

It feels like you're a million miles away 
As your lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
Say I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but
We're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million
Miles away

We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note we
Both know for sure that it's time to close that door

It feels like you're a million miles away 
As your lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
Say I can find a way to make it right

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Uh
Anymore 

And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why

Like some medicine to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelin' deep inside

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then
My heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sunshine through the rain
And I realize it's happenin'
Baby, here I go again

Here I go again

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep comin' back
Didn't think that you could make me loose control like that

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't life just a crazy game
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then (baby)
My heart remembers when (my heart remembers when)
And I realize I've never gotten over you (oh I never)
Every time I hear your name (every time)
It's like the sunshine through the rain (the rain, no no)
And I realize it's happenin'

Oh

Oh

Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss dem days when we used to chill (used to chill)
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Nigril (West Nigril)

Rihanna,"Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do boy, its' sad but it's true

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear

Rihanna,"Took a chance
Rolled the dice of me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby can't you see
It’s the way it’s gotta be

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong you gotta let it go
Now I know

I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone, only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train
The way he said my name
The brother had a lot a game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
Cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you
I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now till forever
I know its the real thing, if you don't, whatever
And I know its meant to be

Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to ""could have been""s and we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away, away

Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
For what we were is like the season's love is change
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry

It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending and I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away, away

We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door

It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight

Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother, how's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line

Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or somethin' on the TV

I get that same ol' feeling

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer

I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside

And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it

And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out we your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid

That we spent and
I see it in my mind
Playing over and over again

Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating (yeah)
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it
Quite like I do

And my loving
But ain't nobody
Better than us

It's not that easy
To let go
Of everything (everything) that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it

This is where the game ends now

When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me

You made me

Just fade away

You know I'm gonna be right there (right there)

When your friends start to trip
And your loosin' your grip
And u cant find your way back home
When your world falls apart
And you're lost in the dark

When you just can deal, and you need something real

Rihanna,"Another day, another reminder that your not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories 
The time we tried to build a snowman
The time we tried to count the stars 
Its crazy how we didn't know then
That we'd ever be apart

I can hear the music playing 
See the lights upon the tree 
I can feel the joy in every soul 
But for me it's incomplete
And I try my best to play the part, but no matter what I do
No, it just don't feel like Christmas without you, you 

Another tear, another regret boy, that you're so far away 
Can it be that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day
Remember when we took the sleigh ride 
Remember singing by the fire
There's to much that's in the daylight
I keep reliving you and I

I can hear the music playing

Rihanna,"Story of my life 
Searching for the right 
But it keeps avoiding me 
Sorrow in my soul

Cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company 
He's more than a man 
And this is more than love 

The reason that the sky is blue 
The clouds are rollin' in 
Because I'm gone again 
And to him I just can't be true 

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful 
And it kills him inside 
To know that I am happy with some other guy 
I can see him dying 

[Chorus]
I don't want to do this anymore 
I don't want to be the reason why 
Every time I walk out the door 
I see him die a little more inside 
I don't want to hurt him anymore 
I don't want to take away his life 
I don't want to be a murderer 

I feel it in the air 
As I'm doin' my hair 
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek 

As he reluctantly 
Asks if I'm gonna be out late 
I say ""I won't be long. 
Just hangin' with the girls."" 
A lie I didn't have to tell 

Because we both know 
Where I'm about to go 
And we know it very well 

Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful 
And it kills him inside 
To know that I am happy with some other guy 
I can see him dying 

[Chorus]

Our love 
His trust 
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head 
Get it over with 

I don't want to do this 
Anymore 
Whoa-oh 
Anymore

It's til the day we die
When we ride we ride
It's til the day we die

'Bout a quarter to one

We become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to scratch this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw the pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinkin'
You were out we your friends
I'm so foolish
Treat me like I'm stupid
Cuz I thought it was just you and I (oh)

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and
I see it in my mind
Playing over and over again
Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me thangs
That'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Make me feel like I'm floating (yeah)
You think I'm playing
When you now its the truth
Nobody else can do it
Quite like I do
All my kisses
And my lovin'
But ain't nobody
Better than us

Now I look back on the time

I guess its over
And definitely
But you and I know
Its not that easy
To let go
Of everything (everything) that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself cuz you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby
This is where the game ends now somehow
Might not believe you and me
We can figure it out

[Chorus]

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything its on me
(when we ride we ride it's til the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises
You made me
And now we'll let the memories
Just fade away
But I remember
What you used to say

I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel

Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you

What you wearin' got me starin' like you butt-naked, boo
It may seem like I don't even reckon you

Style is impeccable, smile is incredible
Ain't nothin' like ya, and, baby, I done met a few you
The way I feel - it's almost like crush (crush)
My heart beats faster - it's almost like a rush (rush)
And that's just when you enter in a room

After a week or two I usually start eliminatin'
But we got through the convo on the phone 
Now we finally chillin' on a condo all alone 
I tried to be expressive without bein' aggressive
Just bein' suggestive, a lil' more impressive 
And I'm a good player: I listen to the coach 
He show me the play book, and said this is the approach
If you ever wanna score, 'cause some players rush they shots
And that's why they never on the floor

The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame
Comin' down at the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-a-fella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day
Rain man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the world has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
(Come into me)
(There's no distance in between our love)
So I'm gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

When the sun shines, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
