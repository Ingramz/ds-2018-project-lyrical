Josh Groban,"Galileo fell in love
As a Galilean would
And he wondered what in Heaven,
Who invented such a joy?

But the question got the better of his scientific mind
And to his blind and dying days he looked up high and often sighed
And sometimes cried:

Who puts the rainbow in the sky?
Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine,
Someone like you and made them mine?

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then
But just remember the alternatives
For I remember when I was lonely,
And unhappy and my lips were cold as ice
But you kissed me and good Heavens,
Now I'm here in paradise

So if I'm ever not kissing you or looking in your eyes
I won't be blind and I won't cry
I'll look up high and gladly sigh

And thank the guy
Who puts the rainbow in the sky
Who lights the stars at night
Who dreamt up someone so divine,
Someone like you and made them mine
Someone like you and made them mine",Galileo,2010
Josh Groban,"Over mountains and sky blue seas
On great circles will you watch for me?
The sweetest feeling I've got inside
I just can't wait to get lost in your eyes
And all these words that you meant to say
Held in silence day after day
Words of kindness that our poor hearts crave
Please don't keep them
Hidden away

Sing it out so I can finally breathe
And I can take in all you say
Holding out for something I believe in
All I really need today
I want to free your heart
I want to see your heart
Please don't keep your heart
Hidden away

You're a wonder, how bright you shine
A flickered candle in a short lifetime
A secret dreamer that never shows
If no one sees you then nobody knows
And all these words you were meant to say

Held in silence day after day
Words of kindness that our poor hearts crave
Please don't keep them
Hidden away

Sing it out so I can finally breathe
And I can take in all you say
Reaching out for someone I believe in
All I really need today
I want to feel your love
Will you reveal your love
Please don't keep your love
Hidden away

I want to free your heart
I want to see your heart
Please don't keep your heart
Hidden away

You",Hidden Away,2010
Josh Groban,"For all the times I tried for this
And every chance at you I missed
I've been known to go my way, but I confess
It made me miss you more

I drew my line across the sand
And set my flag in no man's land
But here I am the one man band
With a song that's meant for two

And there is a light, from a higher window
Shining down on you tonight
And the music floats on the breeze
Bringing an easier time
And all of our cards are on the table
Tell me what you want to do
Just don't tell me that it's too late
For me to love you

How perfect we were meant to be
Our warm and silent symmetry
It's times like these when all, all we need
Is to be reminded

And I have flown a thousand miles
To empty rooms and crowded isles
And we went from cathedral bells
To show and tell and wish you wells
And I, I still look at you and I am blinded I am blinded

Because there is a light, from a higher window
Shining down on us tonight
And the music floats on the breeze
From an easier time

And all of our cards are on the table
Tell me what you want to do
Just don't tell me that it's too late
Don't tell me that it's too late now
Just don't tell me that it's too late
For me to love you",Higher Window,2010
Josh Groban,"Lately, I've been the quiet one
Waiting searching the lines of the songs you played for me
Sailing into the misty air
Fading bound for I don't know where
When I'm there I'll see

And If I walk away
Please follow me
If I walk away
Please follow me

Weightless drifting through stars I got
Faithless woke in the dark and I made this from my dream
Play me all your sweet rhymes
Recreate me, now comes the time when I'll need your truth to see

And if I walk away
Please follow me
If I walk away
Please follow me

Walk away
Let the fear fall away
Into the fire you made
Scarlet and gold
Walk away
Head for the light of day
Follow a brighter way
Out of the cold and dark
Down to the one bright spark
Futures that all might start
Someday

So if I walk away
Please follow me
If I walk away
Please follow me

Fragments shells of a long ago lifetime
Faces that once were mine
Thrown down by the sea

If I walk away
Please follow me
If I walk away
Would you please follow me",If I Walk Away,2010

porteat ad pacem aeternam.",London Hymn,2010
Josh Groban,"I've tried to hold this back so long
And we're always such a good thing when it's gone
Would it be alright, if we just left our heads tonight

Take me away from this old game
Of saying that we're both too much the same

Would it be alright, if I just stayed with you tonight
And before I go, will I ever see you again
She said love only knows

Love only knows
If we'll give into fear and chose life undercover
She said love only knows
If it's special enough then we'll chose one another
We'll chose each other

You were the secret I loved to keep
The name I would only sing in my sleep
Would it be alright, if we just lose ourselves tonight
And if you let go, will you reach out again
She said love only knows

Love only knows, if we'll give into fear and chose life undercover
She said love only knows, if it's special enough then we'll chose one another
We'll choose each other

And I can't breathe without you and I don't
And I can't live without love and I won't
And I won't

Love only knows
If we'll give into fear and choose life undercover
She said love only knows if it's special enough then we'll choose one another
Love only knows, how your arms pull me in like the tide pulls me under
She said love only knows just how long we can run before we lose each other
And we need each other

And I can't live without you and I won't",Love Only Knows,2010
Josh Groban,"Vim amar você até o final
Da chuva que navega nosso corpo tropical
Espero amar você ate durar
A lua que esclarece esse sol sem descansar jamais

Amar o quanto precisar que ame
E então recuse a escuridão te amo
Pra que chorar
Chorar é fim

Você existe em mim
Vim servir amor e aterrissar
Os anjos dos meus versos
Pra você não me deixar de amar

Será que em Deus os versos nascem assim
Como em toda primavera nascem flores
Pra mimar jardim
Amar o quanto precisar que ame

E então recuse a escuridão te amo
Pra que chorar
Chorar é fim
Você existe em mim

A areia lambe o sal
Já passou o temporal e a solução só você e eu
A alma bebe o mar que vazou do coração
E você me faz me fazer feliz

O quanto precisar que ame
E então recuse a escuridão te amo
Pra que chorar
Chorar é fim
Você existe em mim",Voce Existe Em Mim,2010
Josh Groban,"Fallen brother, he's a fallen husband
He's about to be woken in his hospital bed
He doesn't want to rest
He just wants to run
And he's tired of being told that he's the lucky one

Caped crusader, she's a newborn leader
But you should see her when her daughter's on the phone
And she wipes the tears away
And she laces up because there's still hell to pay
And it sure feels like hell today, today

And she says
You see these hands they're bruised and brown
They're yours alone
Hold on love we're still going down
Hold on love we're still fighting at home
The war at home

Innocence behind his broken expression
He's a child of mercy he's our unlearned lesson
And he's trying to wake up
From this wilderness his world has now become
He's reaching out to those he's running from

And he says
You see these hands they're bruised and brown
They're yours alone
Hold on now we're still going down
Hold on now we're still fighting 

And it's (one step forward and two steps back)
This is all who are marching
(One step forward two steps back)
This is young and old
(One step forward two steps back)
Through the void of silence
You are not alone

You see these hands they're a million strong
They are yours now
Hold on now we're all going down
Hold on now we're all fighting at home
The war at home",War At Home,2010
Josh Groban,"When I am down, and, oh, my soul, so weary
When troubles come, and my heart burdened be
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit awhile with me

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

There is no life, no life without its hunger
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly
But then you come, and I am filled with wonder
Sometimes I think I glimpse eternity

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

You raise me up to more than I can be",You Raise Me Up,2010
Josh Groban,"As I approach the prime of my life
I find I have the time of my life
Learning to enjoy at my leisure
All the simple pleasures
And so I happily concede
That this is all I ask
This is all I need

Beautiful girls, walk a little slower when you walk by me
Lingering sunsets, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere, when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange, enchanted land grown-ups seldom understand

Wandering rainbows, leave a bit of color for my heart to own
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true before the night has flown
And let the music play as long as there's a song to sing
And I will stay younger than Spring",This Is All I Ask,2011
Josh Groban,"Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide awake just watchin' you sleep
And I promise you you're gonna have
More than just the things that you need
We ain't got much now; we're just starting out
But I know somehow Paradise is coming

[Chorus]
Someday, baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine
Someday, baby
You and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on, we're headed for a better life

Oh, now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But, baby, someday we're gonna fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters

[Chorus]

So hold on, hold on
C'mon, baby, hold on
Yeah, we're gonna have it all, and oh

[Chorus: x2]

A better life now, oh ho, a better life
Hey, we're gonna leave this all behind us, baby, wait and see
We're headed for a better life, you and me
We're gonna break the chains that bind and finally we'll be free
We're gonna be the ones that have it all, you and me
Just hold on tight now, baby, whoa",Better Life,2011
Josh Groban,"A beautiful and blinding morning
The world outside begins to breathe
See clouds arriving without warning
I need you here to shelter me

And I know that only time will tell us how
To carry on without each other

So keep me awake to memorize you
Give me more time to feel this way
We can't stay like this forever
But I can have you next to me today

If I could make these moments endless
If I could stop the winds of change
If we just keep our eyes wide open
Then everything would stay the same

And I know that only time will tell me how
We'll carry on without each other

So keep me awake for every moment
Give us more time to be this way
We can't stay like this forever
But I can have you next to me today

We'll let tomorrow wait, you're here, right now, with me
All my fears just fall away, when you are all I see

We can't stay like this forever
But I have you here today

And I will remember
Oh I will remember
Remember all the love we shared today",Awake [Live],2011
Josh Groban,"Sólo sé que ojo por ojo lo ves
Que lo que siembre lo cosecharé
Si doy recibiré 
Porque amar es un acto de fe
No prives al mundo de amor
Sin sol y lluvia no crece la flor
El milagro está en ti
No lo dejes morir

Un alma más y al fin marcharán ejércitos de esperanza
Unámonos y al fin se oirán los gritos de los que callan
Uno más y otro más probándonos que
Amar es un acto de fe

Si te guardas la luz para ti
Te cegarás de egoísmo y así
Por las sombras irás
Y un día te olvidarás de reír
Hay tantos hombres llorando dolor
Buscando un mañana mejor
Ve y abrázalos
Y aprenderás a sentir

Un alma más y al fin marcharán ejércitos de esperanza
Unámonos y al fin se oirán los gritos de los que callan

When you stand up and hold out your hand
In the face of what I don’t understand

And erase me

And warred yourself
It's time that you won

Have you cut the mast-sail free?

Josh Groban,"The sun is setting in your quiet eyes
You take for granted what we've always seen inside
You run in circles
And you don't know how
You got to this place
But you sure do live there now

And I won't blame you if you fall
And I won't ask you to believe that life won't hurt at all
When the tears stream down your face
And you've given all your light away
I'd like to be the safest place
Your hideaway

The fear keeps coming back to you in waves
When you catch the wrong side of the same mistakes you've made
You're tuning out because it hurts too much to try
You're giving up before you've had your chance to fly

And I won't blame you if you fall
And I won’t ask you to believe that life won't hurt at all
When the tears stream down your face
And you've given all your light away I'd like to be the safest place
Your hideaway, your hideaway
And here comes the rain

When you've given all your light away I'd like to be the safest place
I will close the doors and lock the gates
And give to you my safest place

Finishing the hat
How you have to finish the hat
How you watch the rest of the world
From a window
While you finish the hat

Mapping out a sky
What you feel like, planning a sky
How you feel when voices that come
Through the window, go
Until they distance and die
Until there's nothing but sky

And how you're always turning back too late
From the grass or the stick
Or the dog or the light
How the kind of woman willing to wait
Not the kind that you want to find waiting
To return you to the night
Dizzy from the height
Coming from the hat, studying the hat
Entering the world of the hat
Reaching through the world of the hat
Like a window
Back to this one from that

Studying a face
Stepping back to look at a face
Leaves a little space in the way like a window
But to see, it's the only way to see

And when the woman that you wanted goes
You can say to yourself, well, I give what I give
But the woman who won't wait for you knows
That however you live
There's a part of you always standing by
Mapping out the sky

Y verás que al final nuestra lucha es igual

Vamos juntos a pintar el azul del cielo
Ven de mi mano a volar
Olvidémonos del mal
No hay fronteras que cruzar, somos fuego y hielo

Yo seré tu hogar
Estas lágrimas que lloro te van a curar

Hacia donde con mis sueños te quiero llevar

A thousand miles away and I am missing you

And we move so fast, the words get lost

Standing by my side

I'm out here chasing the dream
Living up to all that I'm supposed to be
Missing out on the one
Who means the most to me 'cause

It's in every note I sing
It's in every word I write

Josh Hedley,"Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

There's a dark moon in the clouds
Misty fog in the swamp
Crickets chirpin' outside my window
The water it thumps in the bathroom sink down the hall
The lights flicker sometimes
The wind is howling, the dogs are growling way deep in the pines
A passin' car on the distant road, the only thing running
Nightmares in my sleep, the Sandman is coming
I see the ghost in the red cloak, the shadows are taking shape
The sound of a faint voice, lost and full of hate
Dry leaves crumble under the feet of the reaper
The limbs tap on my window, like the nails of a creature
Tales of goblins and fairies, a sacrifice on the prairie
A murderer that escaped, I'm disillusioned and weary
Lightning strikes on the hill, illuminating the cabin
The old man on the porch, evil and quietly laughing
Surrounded by demons
I'm an angel and they all want me
And to this day

Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

Cigarette buds, and oil stains on the dying grass
The smell of the liquor, rising up from the broken glass
The crowds of black leather, the heat from the engines
Motorcycles and goons, bearded men and loud women
The cracklin' paint, the old shack with the swingin' light
The heroin needles passin', open in plain sight
Ozzy and Black Sabbath, the vinyl is skippin'
From the fight in the kitchen
Blood screamin' and kickin'
Smoke fills up the sky, gasoline on the trash heap
The mattress is burnin', I hear it poppin' and snapping
The rain soaked teddy bear, so heavy I can't lift it
The flask full of moonshine, I watch as they all sip it
The Halloween pumpkin candle, lit with a Pentagram
The Grandfather clock, with a broken minute hand
Surrounded by thieves, killers, thugs and some junkies
And to this day

Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

I throw on my leather jacket, a collection of biker patches
One of them says Savage, the other one Black Sabbath
Heavily tatted, barely any skin left,
Whiskey bent after twelve, I'm always playing with death
Bullet shells in my yard, loaded gun on the shelf
Run the roads like a wolf, through the whole Bible Belt
Rattlesnake skin boots, toes up on the chopper
Fifty Harleys behind me, they all ready to slaughter
Drunk in front of my sons, drunk in front of my daughter
Spit, cuss, and I yell, it's like a one-sided quarter
'Cause I'm only heads up, no matter which way you flip it
No brake lights in my life, I'm either rich or evicted
Committed to my convictions, committed crimes with the quitters
Connected to my religion, the religion of sinners,
Send a prayer to God, exhaling smoke off the meth pipe
Like puddles reflecting the ripples echo to next life
So here I am standing just like the ashes that fell from the fire
A seed that fell off that poisonous and forgotten flower
Became my own nightmare, but now I think it's charming
Especially when

Memories of shadows haunt me
From the years when I was young
Things that used to terrify me
Are the things, that I've become

Trust the stage and take over the podium and catch this crowd off-guard
And in the silence, it wouldn't bother me if the audience caught it's breath
I clear my throat and adjust the microphone and laugh myself to death

And I think sometimes it's dangerous
That we take ourselves so serious
But I think you're beautiful
I think your beautiful

With the life, comes the issues and everyone must obey
We wait for fate to come and greet us and walk us through our day

And I think sometimes it's dangerous
That we take ourselves so serious
But I think you're beautiful
I think your beautiful

For every department store clerk who's ever followed me to make sure that I
Don't steal
And every folk singer that's gawked at the sight of me
Reality is my real
I think your beautiful

Wake me up after the aftermath, but don't tell me what's going on
Cause sometimes I would rather sleep than give into my alarm

And I think sometimes it's dangerous
That we take ourselves so serious
But I think you're beautiful
I think your beautiful

Of what is left to the soul
From where it starts to where it catches

A plea from one who must be kept like
Some vacant thought
We fear to find
You can't regret
And you have become
In the instant you believe you have
Our memories our aftermath

And dreams are not lost

Of what is left to the soul

And I keep thinking about you
Eyes tired and the night is impatient
It takes me under and I change the station

The stars that dance in space

And I know that I'll never go back
To the Christmas colored neighborhood as thoughtful as a card
With a plastic baby Jesus in the yard

It was all, and it was nothing at all
It was all, and it was nothing at all

What we didn't know we didn't think to ask
The world was just a globe they used in class
Where the gym teacher was always mad, and as far as we could tell
He only exercised his right to yell

It was all, and it was nothing at all
It was all, and it was nothing at all

As the kings of boredom we ruled as we knew how
Or at least as long as our curfews would allow
Couple skates, love-sick songs, in moments without pause
As Johnny Cougar amplified our cause

It was all, and it was nothing at all
It was all, and it was nothing at all

We were the great believers that dreams came with stars
And freedom just depended on the car
Until one day the sky fell in and freedom lost control
And ran off the road and hit a pole

It was all, and it was nothing at all

It was not of who I am

Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew.
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it burn as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing gets better

Watched it burn as I touched your face,

'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

And I threw us into the flames

And so was I

For Chicago
She is on the other side

Well I was almost honest, I was almost honest

Been a long time
Since I lay with you in bed
Conversations full of words you never said
I got your message
But I didn't hear the ringing bell
I gave into the loneliness but I didn't give her nothing else
Which direction down this highway that I ride
To Atlanta, she is on the other side

Write a letter to my love

I would kiss the sweet lips through the longest night
But it ain't all, oooh it ain't always so easy baby
I've grown weary of the way she acts
Always whining, crying and talking back
Oh, why don't you go,
That's why I wrote this song 'cause I couldn't tell you

And if it ain't there, it's forever gone
Ain't no reason to keep holding on
To this heartache, heartache
Oooh, I wish you'd never, ever come back to me

Oh mercy, Lord, take her,
'Cause she's never gone (never gone)
Oh she's never gone (never gone)
Lord, give me some peace, puh-lease

'Cause all I got left is this heartache, heartache, oooh
Now all I (heartache)
Got left is (heartache)
Heartache
Heartache, heartache, whoooa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, here we go on now babe
I said my heartache, heartache
Said my heart is gone
Heartache, heartache, whoooa, I guess I better get, better get outta town
Better get outta town, gonna get out of town (heartache)
This heartache, heartache, mmmmm
Whoa! I wish you never, never, never, never
I wish you never come back to meeeeeeeee.

You drive me completely crazy
Completely crazy, completely crazy

You know how far I'm prepared to go
I will be a boat and row

If that's okay with you

I hope you don't mind
If I get lost inside your eyes
Please excuse me if I don't imply
But I've just gotta let you know that

You drive me completely crazy

Sit thinking while awake
And barely blinking
What have we been drinking

It's time to take it to the next step
With sweet quiet kisses
From sunset lover tonight

You drive me completely

For you the angels cry

Despite a love bound and broken from the start
Goodnight, my beautiful, goodbye

Our beginning is the end of a love
That never had a chance to dance with you

And wish for more to say than

I'd rather them chase after me

I put my choices in a hat
Picked a few and threw the bad ones out

So if you want me
You better knock me down

Sittin' at a breakfast table
Talking 'bout the way things used to be

Able looked at Cain and said
""All that shit was in your head""
I'd like to think that Cain was hard to please
Well, I know now

So if you want me
You better knock me down

Over there on the bed

And I?d always forgive her

She?d sit out on the dock and put her feet in
She was skipping rocks
And she was skipping school again

She stole my only cigarettes
She smoked the whole pack one by one
Light 'em up and put 'em to her lips

And I?d always forgive her
But the Mississippi river never did

She was always running away
No matter how hard I tried, she would never stay
And I wish that she would run to me
Like the Mississippi river is running towards the sea

Spinning around like a devil from horns to toes

I didn't see you coming but I, I love you anyway

There's not a second that you don't think about her
But she don't even think one single thought of you

Making your heart see something that's just not there
Why does love got to be so unkind?
Making you hurt so bad, no, it's just not right
Why does love got to be so unfair?
Oh, why does love got to be so unfair, baby?

It's such a sad affair when you give your heart
And the one you give it to just goes and tears it all apart
You wish you didn't care, didn't care at all
But all you do is care too much

It's not a single night you don't dream about her
When you're the very last thing she'll be dreaming of

Why does love got to be so unfair?
Making your heart see something that's just not there
Why does love got to be so unkind?
Making you hurt so bad, no, it's just not right

Oh, it's a sad fact, it's the cold hard truth
Sometimes you're gonna learn that love is cruel
Sometimes you're gonna find out
Gonna find the one you love just don't love you, oh

Shaking, the urge to put my hands

Swishing out smoke from my lips and just reminisce this
Moments to the legendary sound mystifying like magic
Sits in your mind to marinate
Heaven it's just a time serenade
You off this tape late 
At night you alone getting zoned
To the S, the you, the N, SPOT
Lighting shine from Oakland caught in a world of
Imagination can't be wastin' time
Drama can't be facin' climb on your honor
Don't lock me away I'm a gona
Cut that shit like benihana 'cause I ain't no chicken
Or no shrimp, I'm a large piranha 
With my ? steak
No matter what's on the menu, lasagna
Ain't gonna be comin' out my side
Runnin' from a homicide
If you want to ride why you still talking
Caught up in your pocket shit when you should be walkin
Yo back ain't worth my life
If you caught up in the hype
Livin' life with a genocide knife
You trippin'

Put a smile on your face don't be a chump and diss
It's such a pretty picture when everybody's with ya
Hit you like you're born again
Now sound the horn again it's on
The song to make you move on
Groovin' on some free shit
Some look at me shit, I'm raw
A chance to shine is what I saw
Be a shrine on stage with everyone and all
Why'all, you got to loosen the fuck up
We boostin' the sound comin' from the town
Runnin' round, everywhere that they missed

Never stopping when they talking 'cause
They la la
We the kings of this hill I 
Say why why

Into the microphone I speak
At this moment and time I flow
At this moment and time I fly
Don't ask questions don't ask why
Don't inquire about my life
Say what I need I'll be greed
Been to this place many times
Can't be shy won't be discrete
I'm the guy with open eyes, open ears and a open mind
Can't stay outside open the blind
Use your retina focus in
Live for the moment open it
Hopin' folks will leave the feelin' vocally
I mostly expose foes when they're phony

So many things on my mind
Women and rhymes
Master both I'm one at a time old school
You think every word out my mouth is a lie
Cause you out too much
When a real man climb in the picture you rush
Showin' signs like you heard it before
But for sure you'll drink my wallet dry
Then roll your eyes when I'm broke
That's why nope I got a girl now
You shall never be in my world like that no more
Get in war runnin' after runnin' 'cause you stop
Poundin' your business to hit the shores of the freak show

Everybody rhyme now
Throw in the towel
You rhyme like a battle movement
I growl to move them

So learn where's Vern 
Who cares who stares
That's the payoff so layoff the shit talk

I can do anything

Were all scholars 'cause I said so, shit

When you have no clarity
Maneuver passes carefully
One dead a time faithfully
Acin' a ho, successful
Watch where all the rest go
When its really time let go
They gotta keep it goin' strong

Josh Martinez,"Sitting in the park with a walkman on nodding my neck hard
And pardon me I didn't see you there.
Thank god for the gift of midriff driftin by,
Catch a whiff and get high, on a spliff, yes I…

I'm talking better than dope and I really like dope
And so it must be good, could it get any better?
Shoulda set the sun off with a nice cool breeze,
To ease the sweet smell of sweat run off, so please come off.

You feel me like a breeze blowing, sitting under trees writing,
Liking looking out at the seas and fallen leaves,
And breathing in the change of season, I don't even need a reason
To be boozing when I'm cruising, as long as shit is pleasing.

I love seeing the sun coming into my cave,
And still crave the haze and find so many ways to misbehave.
See the josh did done that, and still caught the sunset
Drunk as fuck screaming “are we having fun yet?”

See the josh did done that,
And still caught the sunset,
Drunk as fuck screaming
“Are we having fun yet?”

Chorus:
Another Day, Another Dollar
Wanna Play? Give me a holler.
Let's get faded on the bottle
And forget about tomorrow
Let's create a song of sorrow
How we always need to borrow
Loot to get loose,
Who gives a fuck about tomorrow?

Verse 2:
Look out on the water and watch the sun setting
You can smell the rum and coke and you can see that some forgetting,
Come the summer ends in smoke soaking up all them rays
It'll end in autumn leaves, smoking trees on rainy days.

The greens of today are the browns of tomorrow
And yesterday's sorrow is the legacy we follow
In the yesteryears, the X amount of beers we quenched our fears with,
Were forgotten like so many friends we went and spilled our tears with.

To me the seas are calling, see I've fallen into love
With ska, dub and the dope dancehall.
It seized me by the collar and it hollered you've been mollycoddled long enough.
Are you man enough? Are you strong enough?

The world is yours but your divorced from it.
So close to the top and you haven't seen the summit.
Been talking and dreaming for so long and ain't done it.
When the prey becomes the predator, the dream becomes the hunted.


Chorus:
Another Day, Another Dollar
Wanna Play? Give me a holler.
Let's get faded on the bottle
And forget about tomorrow

Verse 3
Man I'm missing sitting kissing, talking shit, and pissing wine.
Getting sunk feeling, remember reeling drunk and drooling time
ON life I'm buzzing nicely, maybe it might be caused
By laws that aren't likely to have teeth, let alone jaws

Each and every leech that has a cause is always preaching
A one-sided thesis that comes from flawed teaching.
Smoking pot to pass the time, what a crock I'm past my prime.
But where's the clock that's telling time, when I'm the rock that time forgot.

Not ready to go steady, not into the petty.
The pity parties and confetti…I been there already.
I can be your man if you'd only understand
That I can't be held down by nothing just yet.

I don't care about the money, shit, I wanna live right too.
But one plus one equals none left for me to like you.
If you want it, you got it, you break it you bought it.
You thought it would be cool to play the fool, you've been spotted.

If you want it, you got it,
You break it you bought it.

Hoping that it'll give him somethin that he can box with

Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box

Song and the symphony
That we had yesterday.
Oh, free, free were these city roads
But now I feel so over grown
And hard to escape
But deep beyond the surface lies 
Before it’s so unjustified but still you carry on
You’re a soldier, oh you’re a fighter
Don’t go an waste another day just take what comes your way, oh

If you know what you want to feel an how high
Do you want to feel it,
If you know what you want to say oh I wanna hear you say it.
If you know where you wanna go an how far, do you wanna take it
‘Cause no matter what mistakes you’ve made
These are your redemption days.

No white flag outside your door
We’ll navigate them for the sure for an easy get away
You’re mind looking out for circumstance
Is really gonna make the difference
To know the right game to play
And voices tell to be hold
Upon the wreckage lies soul
That knows the path to fields of gold,
It’s where you wanna reach.

The day come when you choose your destination

So we can sing Bob Marley songs of redemption
You a believer or non-believer, there's no exception
I walk through the ashes when the Lord burn the sinners
Bare footed, all draped out in linens
Repentended, I lived though sacrifice
And now I wait my eternal residence in paradise
I walk the righteous path through the garden of eden with the enlightened mind I got from the knowledge of readin'
Hard to believe I achieve through the devine intervention
I’m a soldier I’ll be standing on the day of redemption

Not the top, not the bottom, but the middle
And I still remember where I cracked my head
In the vacant lot, there's a row of tiny houses there now 
And we used to light fires in the gutters
And I could cool my head on the concrete steps
But the girl down the street hit my sister on the head
With a stick and we hid behind my father
As he knocked on the parents' door
To tell the them what she did
But the parents were drunk so they really didn't give a shit

And the girl down the street said a dog couldn't bark
'Cause a man with an axe cut its voicebox out
But my older sister told me that it prob'ly wasn't true
And I believe what she said 'cause she took me by the hand
One time when a coupla men drove down the hill in a white van
Said there was a phone box filled with money 'round the corner
And I woulda gone along but she took me by the hand
To the house in the middle of the hill
In the middle of the hill, in the middle of the hill

And my mother knew the words to a lot of different songs
And we'd always sing the harmonies, yeah we'd sing along
She had cold, cold hands when the fever hit
And then the noises that the trains made sounded like people in my head
And the stories that the ceiling told 
Through the pictures and the grains in the pine-wood boards
And let me stay outside 'til the sky went red

Josh Pyke,"Sunday's always holding a promise
Monday's always letting it go
If I could write a sad song every day of the week
I'd be the happiest person I know
So I held my hands up to the city
Turns out the city, she was holding me back
And no one wants a lover, no one wants a lover like that

I think I needed to feel a distraction
I'd never seen the January snow
Sometimes it's good to be lost, and it's good to feel alone
Being half-drunk swaying to a band you don't know
When you know all the streets like the lines on your face
You may discover you feel you have nothing to say
And no one wants a lover, no one wants a lover like that

No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover like that

So now I'm leaving just to keep the connection
It's stiff and static down a digital line
And if it's raining in the gully we'd be rushing by now
Won't sully this rush with a privileged whine.
Cause when it gets to the point where it's never enough
And every standard you drop, you pick another one up
And no one wants a lover, no one wants a lover like that

No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover like that

No one wants a lover who's holding them back
No one wants a lover like that

So I held my hands up to the city
And I turned my face up to the sky
And I've been wishing the same wish, on the first star
No stars are coming out tonight
And it's hard to see stars in the city
Wishing is never a waste of your time

Josh Ralph,"It's like I'm walking through this kingdom of time
This far I've done lost my mind
Only to find the other side

Is where the world opens wide
To descend these city streets late at night
I've been searching for my bite
They say I inspired, but I'm still looking for my fire
These lies have got me tired
I'm free falling, I'm done stalling
I'm done crawling up this mountain top
I won't stop till I manifest my craft
The top is close
I'm sky scraping
They stay chasing
I'm like racing in the Sun, I'm running from depths
They're done, I'm going gray
I'm still young having mystic visions
Of the one, I hear the hum, the melody comes
Rushing in like some wind
Cuts close like a knife
All I got is my life
All I got I got I got

Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high

Now the rain is falling drizzle dropping on the street
Cleaning off the dirt beneath my feet
I got the speed on repeat
While I'm riding subway trains on a fact
Over tracks to go crack, my heart's black
But intact I've come to take the music back
I'm moving forward this time you can't ignore it
Put the pedal to the floor
Let's take you off
Through the time that has come
The time has come I launch orbit
I'm tight rope
Walking over fire with flames, yeah hot coals
I'm like water for you trolls
I pay no tolls
Speak to ghosts
Time to go high
The cross that you walk by
Got my eye into
I'll magic fly off on the broom
Which is true,
I'm at the crossroads, but I'll give my soul
It's already old

Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high

I'm a slave to the throne
The chariot, the flames, it's my home
I'm in a class of my own
Lights out, you're all alone, with your heart of stone

Up here in the crows nest I am swimming through the breeze

One last memory from the sun as it is sinking by degrees

And high above the albatrosses, on the wing is light

And I will sing to her as she flies by

On this beautiful night


Ahead is the horizon, always changing, it stands fast

Far behind me are the desert islands, shipwrecks Of the past

And I have seen the cannons sounding in the early morning light

But I have left my battles for the day

On this beautiful night


Below me, all the sailors, they're on this journey too

And each of us must make our unknown way upon the blue

So tonight we cast our worries,

Float Jetsam on the tide

And we'll watch them echo far away

On this beautiful night


Flat earth may end

We may sail off the edge

And not be seen again

So I sing and hope my song will form

A rope of golden chords

So that I can rescue someone else

Should they fall overboard


Because some of us are pirates and some of us are damned

But all of us, need all of us to ever find the land

And though the passage of good hope may seem

Like a needles eye

We're floating on tranquility

On this Beautiful night


Up here in the crows nest

I am swimming through the breeze

One last memory from the sun

Josh Ritter,"There's one thing, mama, 
I think you should know:
It is not love 
That makes the flowers grow,
But a complex electron transfer process 
Known as photosynthesis when chlorophyll 
Reacts with the light of day.
Since you're gone,
The light has gone away.

There's another thing, mama,
I think that you'll find:
It is not love
That makes the stars shine,
But the spontaneous combustion 
Of superheated super condensed gases 
And the process known as fusion 
That creates new elements when the time is right.
Since you're gone,
The stars don't shine so bright.

Oh, there's another thing, mama,
I think I should confide:
It is not love
That'll turn the tide,
But the net difference in the gravitational pull 
Between the Earth and the Moon as it is acted out upon the waves.
Since you're gone,
I feel washed away.

I could have been a planetician, studied rockets for a living,
Would have worked out better in the end.
But to get more specific, I'd break every law of physics
To bring you back to me again

But there's one more thing, mama,
I'll tell you if I can:
It is not love
That makes a non-stick frying pan,
But a top secret, trademarked, conglomerated,
Most likely carcinogenic polyurethane compound 
Spread in a micro-thin substance over 
A negatively charged layer of aluminum,
Copper, iron, lead, 
V-H-S, F-Y-I, apple pie, F-B-I, 
And some other elements too.
Since you're gone,
I wish I'd stuck to you.",Horrible Qualities/Stuck to You,2000

You can see that No Vacancy sign from the window of room 39
Monday morning at half past eight, everybody's gone, they left no trace. 
I sit alone as the day grows late, wait to see your friendly face

Why you chose my hotel I'm not real qualified to tell, 
It's just your face I remember well, when you asked if I had a room to sell
Maybe you liked just what you saw, 
The cable TV and the indoor spa or maybe it was the low low price? twenty-seven bucks a night

Say the highway is for lovers, but he ain?t no friend of mine, 
Because every time I find my heart, I lose it to that long yellow line

You checked in, I checked you out, you smiled from the corners of your mouth
I turned on the no-vacancy sign as you checked in to room 39
I saw the light from your TV, you were watching channel 23, the night was long, the dark was deep, I kinda cried myself to sleep

Say the highway is for lovers, but he ain?t no friend of mine, because every time I find my heart, I lose it to that long yellow line

Morning broke itself at last, you got your continental breakfast, 
Dropped off the key and said goodbye, I think I thought I heard you sigh

You have chosen dawn to leave

Don't bother me while I am sleeping

Life continues and though you go out

I'll sleep another hour or so

Though you think that I am fragile

I'm a river and I'll travel on whether you are here or not

You're not the only thing I've got


So turn the light off when you leave

Don't forget to leave the key

You know I'm going to miss your touch

You say that you can't help that much

But I would have loved to see you try


It's not that we committed sins

We wouldn't know where to begin

We just love different things in our lives

I love you and you loved time

Now that my time has gone

You have risen like the dawn

And you kissed me as if once we part

I might die of a broken heart


(chorus)


Though I will not try to change your mind

Believing what you left behind

is a child who is lost confused

as a consequnce of loving you

I will not try to call your bluff

The truth would hurt you far too much

I'm sorry I got left behind

But now you're gone I feel fine


",Last Ditch Effort,2000
Josh Ritter,"

I met you at a party or on a crowded street

A silent singularity when glances chanced to meet

You looked into my glasses, said you'd seen a ghost

I tried my best to make you smile as we calypsoed close

I have been to Cleveland and you have been to jail

You seem to be recovering but I felt a little pale

Our house it was on seventeenth above a hardware store

And there we lived with seven cats all named for seven dwarves


But like leaves and kings, all things must fall

No diamond ring's gonna cut through it all


You were working as a graverobber, you could do your job at night

I was living hand to mouth just looking for a fight

The reason why we parted it ain't that hard to find

I was always busy, and you never had the time

well the reason why we parted it ain't that hard to see

But I was never sure if I left you or you left me


(chorus)


And when it was all over I lost myself in work

You got married to a lawyer painting murals in New York

(You got married to a dentist building bridges in New York)

And though it seems a million miles ago since I saw the light

The hours flowed by nervously like warships in the night

Many times I've been corrupted but I've never been in love

I began to realise that that's just where I was

So I packed up my possessions and caught an east-bound train

met you in Ohio sleeping in the rain


(chorus)


So now we're going back again to start where we began

With rules and regulations but no real kind of plan

I've learned my lesson well with no mistakes at all

Once you find yourself true love you just keep holding on


Like leaves and kings, all things must fall

No diamond ring's gonna cut through it all


But now out of the dark, out of the blue,

like leaves and kings I've fallen in love with you

Pictures on my wall,

Fifteen different colours,

Starting with vermillion-

The first flower of the summer,

And don't think I'll be finished

Till I've begun to understand this,

With you stretched out in the sunlight,

As your laughter fills my canvas

The sun falls in my fingers,

On your back against the blinds,

It's tracing out your hollows

It is filling in your lines,

There your curl finds your spiral

As you silhouette the window,

When my brush forgives itself

Spills lines upon your pillow,

Finds you standing in the middle

Of the lines you've laid down before

Try to trace my picture into yours

Let me paint you in the corner,

As your shoulders trap the light

See the sunset feeling golden

On the wineskins of the night

I have seen your eyes in paintings

As Cathedrals cried Hosanna

Let me paint your face in frescos

Hang your hair like Angelabra

See you standing in the middle

Of lines you laid down before,

Try to paint my picture into yours

In the morning let me find you

As I call to you by name,

Your body warm beside me

Not imprisoned in a frame

I could never find the colours

Or the light that finely paints you

With those roses in your hair

Smell of wine, immortal perfume

As you're standing in the middle

Of lines you laid down before

Tryin' to paint my picture into yours

Josh Ritter,"This is it my dear old friend
Our paths it seems are at an end for now
Though in time we floated free
We're are pulled by separate gravities to ground

But it's clear in the way we part
With our hearts together but our hands apart
And it seems so hard to begin
Best friends we'll always be
Though your road don't follow me
I know our paths will cross again

Time has turned her face from me
And spin spirals fancy free I flew
With nothing but the dawn to see
And now I've got my memories of you

Well the road is windi' and road is hard
And there's no telling just how far
Or how many letters I might send
One day you'll walk with me
Against all probability
I know our paths with cross again

Time is like this fast freight train
You gotta ride, you can't remain behind
And all your friends are on separate tracks
And some of them and some of them they won't look back to find

The one place we all have known
The one place we can call a home
The place where each of us began
Sure as that day rolls around
When the road back home is finally found
I know our paths will cross again

Now my home is in a far off land
Where love and time have made their stand against me
And that's probably where I'm gonna stay
It's probably where they'll marry me some day

But after all is come and gone
And after every songs been sung there
Comes a thought I won't defend
Sure stones are left unturned
And on the streets where home fires burn
I know our paths will cross again
Yes I, know our paths will cross again

Trying to stay ahead a morning as time came running with us
And she beat us to the finish as we ran through the fields
You were born in the city and you didn't recognize me

Your beauty unexpected like a flower in the concrete
Some gods far below the worlds undiscovered
Set you up to ruin temples to find me on the streets
I'm an alias of who I am a counterfeited fake

In the picture I am kneeling like a dying saint Jerome
Hurling rocks at the demons who tried to come too near
Till you came in and possessed me now I feel at home

I remember the time I walked for seven hours
And thought about the people I had known for so long
All the castles I had built of of fine and precious sand
Till you came in like the tide now I don't care that they are gone

As we floated up the river I translated the verses
That were written on memorials for the ships that had sank
And I thought about the people that traded sinking for uncertainty
And drowned because of loneliness before they reached the banks

On a beach near Barcelona the young girls cry for Mary
And they bury earthen vessels in the rocks by the sea
I am sending out a bottle with a prayer upon the waves
That you'll find inside my picture and your memory will unfold me
We were talking about a trip that I had taken to the canyons

And you told me of a river that had cut through time
Leaving only the pictures of long dead sons and daughters
And you told that the paintings looked a lot like mine
I try and watch myself to see what I am saying

But my heart is on my collar and I'm asking you to take it
I don't want to go back to the way things were before
Before the dawn turns into morning I want you there to break it
And a thousand years from now when our names are just a memory
And poets have recorded what happened in the past

Lovers loving in the night will find our forms in constellations
Seekers seeking for salvation will find our stories in the stained glass

As he's running arm in arm with you through the fields
Will be caught unexpected by a flower in the concrete

Josh Ritter,"Anne walks alone 
Past the Domino sugar factory 
She's as easy to know 
As a broken mystery 
Conversations are slow 
With herself in dead parking lots

End up tying everything in knots

And she's lonely

Josh Ritter,"Romero got married on the fifth of July 
In our Lady of Immaculate Dawn 
Could have got married in the revival man's tent 
But there ain't no reviving what's gone 
Slipped like a shadow from the family he made 
In a little white house by the woods 
Dropped the kids at the mission, with a rose for the virgin 
She knew he was gone for good 

It's a long way to Heaven, it's closer to Harrisburg 
And that's still a long way from the place where we are 
And if evil exists its a pair of train tracks 
And the devil is a railroad car 

Could have stayed somewhere but the train tracks kept going 
And it seems like they always left soon 
and the wolves that he ran with they moaned low and painful 
sang sad misery's to the moon 

Rose at the altar withered and wilted 
Romero sank into a dream 
He didn't make Heaven, he didn't make Harrisburg 
He died in a hole in between

Others say God's a drunkard for pain

But I can't leave this world behind
Debts are not like prison where there's hope of getting free
And I can't leave this world behind

I've been from here to Lawrence, Kansas
Trying to leave my state of mind
Trying to leave this awful sadness
But I can't leave this world behind

South of Delia there's a patch out back by the willow trees
And I can't leave this world behind
It's a fenced in piece of nothing where I hear voices on my knees
And I can't leave this world behind

Some prophecies are self-fulfilling
But I've had to work for all of mine
Better times will come to me, God willing
Cause I can't leave this world behind

This world must be frightening everybody's on the run
And I can't leave this world behind
And my house is a wooden one and its built on a wooden one
Seems I can't leave this world behind

Out behind the palisades park 
Fireflies remembered to do 
Exactly what they were supposed to 

And memories were like coins that tumbled 
Somersaulting through the deep 
Down every well we threw them in 
Until they came to the top again 

And out like the sun 
In your hair, in your hair 

Every month that ends its spin 
Is picked up by the moon for keeping 
Clean and safe from accidents 
Sheltered from the elements 
But June is like an echo 
Of the sounds we never made 
I swear they find me in my waking hours 
Thirty days like poison flowers 

The wind in your hair 
Like a sigh, like a sigh 

With intermittent rain and shine 
The sky re-started six or seven times 
It's blue because it sees 
All our infidelities

If it's big it won't be hard to find
If it's real it stains your hands like wine

Josh Ritter,"Just where it now lies I can no longer say
I found it on a cold and November day
In the roots of a sycamore tree where it had hid so long
In a box made out of myrtle lay the bone of song

The bone of song was a jawbone old and bruised
And worn out in the service of the muse
And along its sides and teeth were written words
I ran my palm along them and I heard

Lucky are you who finds me in the wilderness
I am the only unquiet ghost that does not seek rest
The words on the bone of song were close and small
And though their tongues were dead I found I knew them all

In the hieroglyphs of quills and quatrain lines
Osiris the fall of Troy Auld Lang Syne
Kathleen Mauvoreen Magnificat Your Cheatin' Heart
The chords of a covenant king singing for the Ark
Then I saw on a white space that was left
A blessing written older than the rest

It said leave me here I care not for wealth or fame
I'll remember your song but I'll forget your name
The words that I sang blew off like the leaves in the wind
And perched like birds in the branches before landing on the bone again

Then the bone was quiet it said no more to me
So I wrapped it in the ribbons of a sycamore tree
And as night had come I turned around and headed home
With a lightness in my step and a song in my bones
Lucky are you who finds me in the wilderness
I am the only unquiet ghost that does not seek rest",Bone of Song,2003

To the edge of the reservation-to Cataldo Mission
Where the saints and all the martyrs look down on dying converts
What makes the water holy she says is that that it's the closest thing to rain

I stole a mule from Anthony I helped Anne up upon it
And we rode to Coeur d'Alene-through Harrison and Wallace
They were blasting out the tunnels-making way for the light of learning
When Jesus comes a'calling she said he's coming round the mountain on a train

It's my home-last night I dreamt that I grew wings
I found a place where they could hear me when I sing
We floated on to Hanford on a lumber boat up river
Past the fisheries and the mill-towns like a stretch of future graveyards
She was driven to distraction-said I wonder what will happen
When they find out they're mistaken and the land is too changed to ever change

We waded through the marketplace-someone's ship had come in
There was silver and begonias-dynamite and cattle
There were hearts as big as apples and apples in the shape of Mary's heart
I said inside this gilded cage a songbird always looks so plain
It's my home-last night I dreamt that I grew wings
I found a place where they could hear me when I sing.

And so they came with cameras-breaking through the morning mist
Press and businessmen-tycoons-Episcopal philanthropists
Lost in their appraisal of the body of a woman
But all we saw were lowlands-clouds clung to mountains without strings

And at last we saw some people huddled up against
The rain that was descending like railroad spikes and hammers
They were headed for the border-walking and then running
Then they were gone into the fog but Anne said underneath their jackets she saw wings",Wings,2003

I'm trying hard to love you, you don't make it easy Babe
I'm trying hard to love you, I'm looking for an easy way

With the cheap romance novels with their spines battered down
Oh the heart has no bones you say so it won't break
But the purpose of loving is the pounding it takes

The ropes that have bound me leave no marks by their knots
And though they're your hair that don't mean I'm not caught
I know the song of the handcuffs as they scrape across the floor

Josh Ritter,"She's a bad actress- but hey
You give her the big lines anyway
Though her eyes are big as Canada
And the hips are South Australia
And the shoulder blade is Africa
Looking out on South America

I'm out here on the sea
And her heart ain't where it oughta be
She's a bad actress- but hey
She's got a big part in your play
Now my apartment lies awake at night

It tosses every time she sighs
Tries to take it easy on her eyes
But I can feel it giving up the fight
My whole building's on its last floors

Her heart's not in it anymore
She said she gave her heart to you
If it was precious why'd you lose it
But if it was golden it'd shine

If it's big it won't be hard to find
If it's real it stains your hands like wine
You can look but there is no use trying
Cause no matter what she said the truth
Is that she never gave her heart to you
She's a bad actress

Makes you look like you are one of the boys
Out on a Saturday night, meanwhile on the outskirts of the dance hall

On the outside of Memphis all the building look big
And the white picket fences all dare to charge around the lawn
And hold their heads up high when my headlights find them out

Get out if we go right now?

But I'm singing for the love of it have mercy on the man who sings to be adored

Josh Ritter,"Once I knew a girl in the hard hard times 
She made me a shirt out of fives and dimes 
Now she's gone but when I wear it she crosses my mind 
And if the best is for the best then the best is unkind

I realized that Illinois was more than I could stand 
They say working's best cause poverty is hell on a man 
Now I ride a lazy river through the Mississippi fan 
And if the best is for the best then the best can be damned

I spent a few years on the Queen of Spain 
She was a leaky little boat that went up in flames 
When the boiler blew some people started naming names 
But if the best is for the best I guess the best is to blame

I spent a few more as the Cairo Crown 
A heavyweight wrestler in the Midwest towns 
But I was lonesome for a girl who could pin me down 
They say the best is for the best but that's not what I've found

Now I listen to my sweetheart and I listen to my thirst 
I don't spend time listening to other people's words 
Sometimes they're right most times the reverse 
They say the best is for the best when the best?s for the worse

Once I knew a girl in the hard hard times 
She made me a shirt out of fives and dimes 
Now she's gone but when I wear it she crosses my mind

In the darker caves 
We had a lot of love 
We thought would light the way

We saw the ghosts of angels                                
That spoke of falls from tremendous heights

[Chorus]
Don't you leave us in the dark [Repeat: x4]

We saw your old flames 
And some were burning yet 
It made us smile to see 
Just how well tended each was kept 
But other fires were burning too 
And I saw the battlefields 
The dying Light Brigade 
Stretched out upon the wheel

[Chorus]

Every heart is much the same 
We tell ourselves down here 
The same chambers fed by veins 
The same maze of love and fear 
We thought you were a saint 
But the halo was an eye 
It's hard to see how there could be 
So much dark inside the light

Like the bottle was on fire or the boiler was about to blow 
She was up on the table when we hit Missouri 
Dancing with a movie man he was holding her a little too close

La didi da da da da da da da!

He made her the star of the silent movies 
But all she did was mouth the words all she did was mouth the words, ""Oh no!"" 
And he cast me as the villain as the sheriff's worst enemy 
I practiced falling off of buildings and out windows

La didi da da da da da da da!

The last time I saw she was tied to the train tracks 
I was back there with the extras riding on a tiger roan 
The villain on the left with the studio mustache 
Winking at Lillian blowing kisses from the second row

Josh Ritter,"Radio waves are coming miles and miles 
Bringing only empty boats 
Whatever feeling they had when they sailed 
Somehow slipped out between the notes 

Out on the desert now and feeling lost 
The bonnet wears a wire albatross 
Monster ballads and the stations of the cross
Sighing just a little bit 
Sighing just a little bit

Thinking about what Katy did

You turn it off but then a still small voice 
Comes in blazing from some vast horizon

I was thinking about me and Jim 
Passing Cairo on a getaway 
With every steamboat like a hymn

Josh Ritter,"I became a thin blue flame
Polished on a mountain range
And over hills and fields I flew
Wrapped up in a royal blue
I flew over Royal City last night
A bullfighter on the horns of a new moon's light
Caesar's ghost I saw the war-time tides
The prince of Denmark's father's still and quiet
And the whole world was looking to get drowned
Trees were a fist shaking themselves at the clouds
I looked over curtains and it was then that I knew
Only a full house gonna make it through

I became a thin blue wire
That held the world above the fire
And so it was I saw behind
Heaven's just a thin blue line
If God's up there he's in a cold dark room
The heavenly host are just the cold dark moons
He bent down and made the world in seven days
And ever since he's been a'walking away
Mixing with nitrogen in lonely holes
Where neither seraphim or raindrops go
I see an old man wandering the halls alone
Only a full house gonna make a home

I became a thin blue stream
The smoke between asleep and dreams
And in that clear blue undertow
I saw Royal City far below
Borders soft with refugees
Streets a'swimming with amputees 
It's a Bible or a bullet they put over your heart
It's getting harder and harder to tell them apart
Days are nights and the nights are long
Beating hearts blossom into walking bombs
And those still looking in the clear blue sky for a sign
Get missiles from so high they might as well be divine
Now the wolves are howling at our door
Singing bout vengeance like it's the joy of the Lord
Bringing justice to the enemies not the other way round
They're guilty when killed and they're killed where they're found
If what's loosed on earth will be loosed up on high
It's a Hell of a Heaven we must go to when we die
Where even Laurel begs Hardy for vengeance please
The fat man is crying on his hands and his knees
Back in the peacetime he caught roses on the stage
Now he twists indecision takes bourbon for rage
Lead pellets peppering aluminum
Halcyon, laudanum and Opium 
Sings kiss thee hardy this poisoned cup
His winding sheet is busy winding up 
In darkness he looks for the light that has died
But you need faith for the same reasons that it's so hard to find
And this whole thing is headed for a terrible wreck
And like good tragedy that's what we expect
At night I make plans for a city laid down
Like the hips of a girl on the spring covered ground
Spirals and capitals like the twist of a script
Streets named for heroes that could almost exist
The fruit trees of Eden and the gardens that seem
To float like the smoke from a lithium dream
Cedar trees growing in the cool of the squares
The young women walking in the portals of prayer
And the future glass buildings and the past an address
And the weddings in pollen and the wine bottomless
And all wrongs forgotten and all vengeance made right
The suffering verbs put to sleep in the night
The future descending like a bright chandelier
And the world just beginning and the guests in good cheer
In Royal City I fell into a trance
Oh it's hell to believe there ain't a hell of a chance

I woke beneath a clear blue sky
The sun a shout the breeze a sigh 
My old hometown and the streets I knew
Were wrapped up in a royal blue 
I heard my friends laughing out across the fields
The girls in the gloaming and the birds on the wheel
The raw smell of horses and the warm smell of hay
Cicadas electric in the heat of the day
A run of Three Sisters and the flush of the land
And the lake was a diamond in the valley's hand
The straight of the highway and the scattered out hearts
They were coming together they pulling apart
And angels everywhere were in my midst
In the ones that I loved in the ones that I kissed
I wondered what it was I'd been looking for up above
Heaven is so big there ain't no need to look up
So I stopped looking for royal cities in the air
Only a full house gonna have a prayer",Thin Blue Flame,2006
Josh Ritter,"I still remember that time when we were dancing 
We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words

I heard their songs when I looked in the mirror 
In the howls and the moons round my eyes

So long, so high
So long, so high
So long

Then winter came and there was little left between us

We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words

Then one day I just woke up 
And the wolves were all there 
Wolves in the piano 
Wolves underneath the stairs 
Wolves inside the hinges 
Circling round my door 
At night inside the bedsprings
Clicking cross the floor 
I don't know how they found me 
I'll never know quite how 
I still can't believe they heard me 
That I was howling out that loud

At times in the frozen nights I go roaming 
In the bed she used to share with me 
I wake in the fields with the cold and the lonesome 
The moon's the only face that I see

We were dancing to a song that I'd heard 
Your face was simple and your hands were naked 
I was singing without knowing the words

What else can a poor man make? 
So I gave up a life of crime 
I gave it to a friend of mine 
Something else was on my mind 
The only ghost I¹m haunted by

Ain¹t no wolf can sing like me 
And if it could then I suppose 
He belongs in Idaho

It made us smile to see 
Just how well tended each was kept 
But other fires were burning too 
And I saw the battlefields 
The dying Light Brigade 
Stretched out upon the wheel 

Don't you leave us in the dark
Don't you leave us in the dark
Don't you leave us in the dark
Don't you leave us in the dark

We tell ourselves down here 
The same chambers fed by veins 
The same maze of love and fear

So much dark inside the light

Josh Ritter,"If this was the Cold War we could keep each other warm
I said on the first occasion that I met Marie
We were crawling through the hatch that was the missile silo door
And I don't think that she really thought that much of me

I never had to learn to love her like I learned to love the Bomb
She just came along and started to ignore me
But as we waited for the Big One
I started singing her my songs
And I think she started feeling something for me

We passed the time with crosswords that she thought to bring inside
What five letters spell ""apocalypse"" she asked me
I won her over saying ""W.W.I.I.I.""
She smiled and we both knew that she'd misjudged me

Oh Marie it was so easy to fall in love with you
It felt almost like a home of sorts or something
And you would keep the warhead missile silo good as new
And I'd watch you with my thumb above the button

Then one night you found me in my army issue cot
And you told me of your flash of inspiration
You said fusion was the broken heart that's lonely's only thought
And all night long you drove me wild with your equations

Oh Marie do you remember all the time we used to take
We'd make our love and then ransack the rations
I think about you leaving now and the avalanche cascades
And my eyes get washed away in chain reactions

Oh Marie if you would stay then we could stick pins in the map
Of all the places where you thought that love would be found
But I would only need one pin to show where my heart's at
In a top secret location three hundred feet under the ground

We could hold each other close and stay up every night
Looking up into the dark like it's the night sky
And pretend this giant missile is an old oak tree instead
And carve our name in hearts into the warhead

Oh Marie there's something tells me things just won't work out above
That our love would live a half-life on the surface
So at night while you are sleeping
I hold you closer just because
As our time grows short I get a little nervous

I think about the Big One, W.W.I.I.I.
Would we ever really care the world had ended
You could hold me here forever like you're holding me tonight

Down with the deep blue jail around her
Running her hands through the ribs of the dark

She makes the most of her time by loving me plenty

In a cakewalk she came through the dead and the lame

I was in between the apples and the chloroform

A boat that can love the rocks or the shore
The love of the iceberg reaching out for a wreck
Can you love me like the crosses love the nape of the neck?

Was it Casey Jones or Casey at the Bat
Who died out of pride and got famous for that
Killed by a swerve laid low by the curve
Do you ever think they ever thought they got what they deserved

Who both are like the barrel going over the falls

And the windows feel no pane

As the throttle on a funeral train

Josh Ritter,"The leading light of the age all wondered amongst
Themselves what I would do next
After all that I'd found in my travels around
The world was there anything else left?
""Gentlemen"", I said, ""I've studied the maps""
""And if what I'm thinking is right""
""There's another new world at the top of the world""
""For whoever can break through the ice""

I looked round the room in that way I once had
And I saw that they wanted belief
So I said ""All I've got are my guts and my God""
Then I paused,""and the Annabelle Lee""
Oh the Annabelle Lee, I saw their eyes shine
The most beautiful ship in the sea
My Nina, My Pinta, My Santa Maria
My beautiful Annabelle Lee

That spring we set sail as the crowd waved from shore
And on board the crew waved their hats
But I never had family just the Annabelle Lee
So I didn't have cause to look back
I just set the course north and I studied the charts
And toward dark I drifted toward sleep
And I dreamed of the fine deep harbor I'd find
Past the ice for my Annabelle Lee

After that it got colder the world got quiet
It was never quite day or quite night
And the sea turned the color of sky turned the color
Of sea turned the color of ice
'Til at last all around us was fastness
One vast glassy desert of arsenic white
And the waves that once lifted us
Sifted instead into drifts against Annabelle's sides

The crew gathered closer at first for the comfort
But each morning would bring a new set
Of the tracks in the snow leading over the edge
Of the world 'til I was the only one left
After that it gets cloudy but it feels like I lay there
For days maybe for months
But Annabelle held me the two of us happy
Just to think back on all we had done

We talked of the other worlds we'd discover
As she gave up her body to me
And as I chopped up her mainsail for timber
I told her of all that we still had to see
As the frost turned her moorings to nine-tail
And the wind lashed her sides in the cold
I burned her to keep me alive every night
In the lover's embrace of her hold

I won't call it rescue what brought me here back to
The old world to drink and decline
And to pretend that the search for another new world
Was well-worth the burning of mine
But sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing
Of some known tropical bird
And I smile in my sleep thinking Annabelle Lee
Has finally made it to another new world",Another New World,2010

I dream't that I was swimming
And the stars up above
Directionless and drifting

Were the sirens and the thunder
And around me as I swam
The drifters who'd gone under

Time, love
Time, love
Time, love
It's only a change of time

I had a dream last night
And rusting far below me
Battered hulls and broken hardships
Leviathan and Lonely
I was thirsty so I drank
And though it was salt water
There was something 'bout the way
It tasted so familiar

The black clouds I'm hanging
This anchor I'm dragging
The sails of memory rip open in silence
We cut through the lowlands
All hands through the salt lands
The white caps of memory
Confusing and violent

I had a dream last night
And when I opened my eyes
Your shoulder blade, your spine
Were shorelines in the moon light

New lands for the living
I could make it if I tried
I closed my eyes I kept on swimming

With the girl in the doorway
What beautiful lines, how full of life
After thousands of years what a face to wake up to

He holds back a sigh as she touches his arm
She dusts off the bed where till now he's been sleeping
Under miles of stone, the dried fig of his heart
Under scarab and bone starts back to its beating

She carries him home in a beautiful boat
He watches the sea from a porthole in stowage
He can hear all she says as she sits by his bed
Then one day his lips answer her in her own language

The days quickly pass, he loves making her laugh
The first time he moves it's her hair that he touches
She asks ""Are you cursed?"" He says ""I think that I'm cured""
Then he talks of the Nile and the girls in bull rushes

In New York he is laid in a glass-covered case
He pretends he is dead, people crowd round to see him
But each night she comes round, and the two wander down
The halls of the tomb that she calls a museum

Often he stops to rest, but then less and less
Then it's her that looks tired, staying up asking questions
He learns how to read from the papers that she 
Is writing about him and he makes corrections

It's his face on her book and more and more come to look
Families from Iowa, upper West-siders
Then one day it's too much, he decides to get up
And as chaos ensues, he walks outside to find her

She's using a cane, and her face looks too pale
But she's happy to see him, as they walk he supports her
She asks ""Are you cursed?"" but his answer's obscured
In a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters

Such reanimation, the two tour the nation
He gets out of limos, he meets other women
He speaks of her fondly, their nights in the museum
But she's just one more rag now he's dragging behind him

She stops going out, she just lies there in bed
In hotels in whatever towns they are speaking
Then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold
And one day the dry fig of her heart stops its beating

Long ago on the ship, she asked ""Why pyramids?""
He said ""Think of them as an immense invitation""
She asks ""Are you cursed?"" He says ""I think that I'm cured"" 
Then he kissed her and hoped that she'd forget that question",The Curse,2010
Josh Ritter,"Louis Collins took a trip out west
When he returned, little Delia had gone to rest
The angels laid her away

Louis said to Delia 
""That's the sad thing with life,
There's people always leavin' just as other folks arrive""
The angels laid her away

When the people heard Delia was dead
All of them gentlemen they dressed in red
The angels laid her away

Angels laid her away
Laid her six feet under the clay

Louis went downtown for a new suit of clothes
He's gonna dress up for Delia like a fine red rose
The angels laid him away

He brought a ten-gallon Stetson
It was ox blood red
Stacker Lee shot Louis in the back of the head
The angels laid him away

Oh Stacker Lee said to Louis, 
'Oh now don't you grieve. I'm sending you to Delia, you won't ever have to leave.'

Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay

Well the judge was a mean one
His name was Hangin' Billy Lyons
He said ""You've always been a bad man, Stack, you gonna hang this time.
The angels lay you away.""

And the jailer said to Stacker Lee 'What's the problem with you?"" 
'Aw jailer, Louis Collins' ghost brought Delia's with him, too.""
The angels laid them away

Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
The angels laid him away

Well they buried little Delia 
In the church yard deep
With Louis Collins at her head
Stacker Lee at her feet
The angels laid them away

And out of Delia's bed came briars
Out of Louis's bed a rose
Out of Stacker Lee's came Stacker Lee's cold lonely little ghost
Angels laid them away

And I'm hoping that it ain't true
That the same God looks out for them Looks out for me and you

Be the light of my lantern, the light of my lantern, tonight
Be the light of my lantern, the light of my lantern, be the light
I need light in my lantern, light in my lantern, tonight

It's a hungry world out there
Even the wind will take a bite
I can feel the world circling
Sniffing round me in the night
And the lost sheep grow teeth
Forsake the lambs and lie with the lions

And the living is desperate
Precarious and mean
And getting by is so hard
That even the rocks are picked clean
And the bones of small contention
Are the only food the hungry find

I'll need light for my lantern, light for my lantern tonight
Light in my lantern, light in my lantern tonight

Where the thistles eat the thorns
And the roses have no chance
And it ain't no wonder that the babies
Come out crying in advance
And the children look for shelter
In the hollow of some lonesome cheek

And the sky's so cold and clear
The stars might stick you where you stand
And you're only glad it's dark 'cause
You might see the master's hand
You might cast around forever
And never find the peace you seek

I need light for my lantern, light for my lantern tonight
Be the light in my lantern, the light of my lantern tonight

Be content inside your questions
Minotaurs inside a maze
Tell me what's the point of light
That you have to strike a match to find?

So throw away those lamentations
We both know them all too well
If there's a book of Jubilations
We'll have to write it for ourselves
So come and lie beside me darling
And let's write it while we still got time

So if you got a light, hold it high for me
I need it bad tonight, hold it high for me
Cause I'm face to face, hold it high for me
In that lonesome place, hold it high for me
With all the hurt that I've done, hold it high for me
That can't be undone, hold it high for me
Light and guide me through, hold it high for me
I'll do the same for you, hold it high for me

I'll hold it high for you, 'cause I know you've got
I'll hold it high for you, your own valley to walk
I'll hold it high for you, though it's dark as death
I'll hold it high for you, and then gets darker yet
I'll hold it high for you, though your path seems lost
I'll hold it high for you, through the thieves and rocks
I'll hold it high for you, keep you safe from harm
I'll hold it high for you, until you're back in my arms

That went to make up everything
Was wrapped up tight inside a grain
Of great insistence
Then someone gave the great command
All things paired off for the dance
The great to small the small to grand
Down to this instant
Ooh!

The hawk around the field mouse
The love around a lover's mouth
I find my mind is settling down
In circuits round you
The angels round their crowded pins
The amber-waved electrons spin
In planetary transits
Round the ones they're bound to

Who do you circle round
Who is it circles round you
Is it circles round you?
Who is it circles round you
Do you circle round who
Is it circles round you?

The ghost around the one it haunts
The want around the thing it wants
The way the mind just wanders off and then returns to
The thought around the second thought
Love or gravity or law
Whatever name it's got it's got me
Circling round you
The guess around the second guess
The hornet round the hornet's nest
The wheel time the wheel fate
The light that bends itself through space
The light that with it carries time
Which also bends in the same line
Relative to point of view

Ain't nothing new about the world
That I ain't learned from just watching you go by

Separate themselves from love
By building walls a hundred thousand miles high

Ain't neither one of them so bad
You can understand the reason why

Are your eyes as empty as they look?

But you were just stealin' it, now I want it back

Up through the blue I knew the star were tumbling

I know who you are old man keep running
I tracked you down by the look in the eyes
Of a thousand gone faces pressed against their windows 
Horses hiding in the willows til the storm passed by
And a fine gray dust seemed to settle on the future
A fine gray dust seemed to settle in between 
Your hat and the dapple of my appaloosa
The only living things that I could see
And up through the blue I knew that stars were tumbling

I know who you are old man keep running

Your boat and did you know that when you landed I was watching
As the sky turned dark as the eyes of a foal
And I'll know you by the shift of the wind in the cobwebs
The sawdust swirls in the fins of the bullheads
The craters that you made when you lay down dreaming
Strange constellations that you gave new meaning
By the teeth marks you made on bones from the ice age
Then smell of the cinder burning slow in your rib cage
Listen in the distance and you'll hear my shadow
Footsteps soft as the tread of an echo
And up through the blue I knew the stars were tumbling
Up through the blue I knew the stars were tumbling

And the ground will open out into a mouth below us
And the mouth will open out into the empty sky
And the whistle as we hurtle through the halls of onyx
The only sound around us as we go by

And I'll follow you out through the wells of charcoal
Moonlit stones around the cones of a black hole
Through the fields where grow the ever and forever
The tessellated blooms with the voids at their centers
Through the million rooms in a bead of luminescence
The filaments on the looms of dimension

The pillars of creation where they make the planets
The billion tiny teeth that tear the charge from your atoms
In a trillion tiny bites they'll eat the meat from the pearl
And throw your soul away a cold gray little world

Josh Ritter,"The Angel of the Holy Grail saw Galahad come riding,
So he took the Holy Grail off the shelf.
And inside the Holy Chapel made for Holy Grail hiding,
The Angel could be seen to smile to himself.

If you're the Great Sir Galahad from now on, said the Angel, 
May all angels call me blessed of my race.
If you're not the Great Sir Galahad I warn you, keep on riding,
And if you are I pray you'll let me see your face.

Galahad removed his helmet, said, Good Angel, look upon me,
Fear not for I bring tidings of great joy.
For long years the Grail you've guarded now you get to let me drink it,
How happy must be angels thus employed.

All the favours that you shower upon me, a simple angel,
Said the Angel, Your benevolence abounds.
Take your boots off, Great Sir Galahad; for by your astounding beauty
Whatever ground you stand on turns to holy ground.

Galahad took off his boots and he watched the ground quite closely
And the Angel smiled to himself again.
He said, I can't believe I'm asking, but Sir Galahad please tell me -
What is it that makes you want to go to Heaven?

In Heaven there's no lamb chops, Queen Guineveres for hand jobs,
Marijuana, Kenny Rogers or ecstasy.
No pillaging, no rape, perhaps you've come by some mistake to me,
This seems more error than knight errantry.

Now what about the stable boys, I know you think they're handsome,
And some of them they think you're awful handsome too.
And sitting up in Heaven you'll still think about them often,
When you're an angel thinking's all that you can do.

At this Sir Galahad got angry, Angel, he said, don't you tempt me,
I wish to go to Heaven and not to Hell.
So when stable boys look lonesome, when the women call me handsome,
I'll hold my virtue very firmly by myself.

I guarantee you'll hold it often, said the Angel, oh one more thing -
Before you drink the cup please take your armour off.
I gotta carry you to heaven and despite what you'd imagine
I have trouble bearing heavy things aloft.

Sir Galahad stood naked and a pile of his armor,
His boots and helmet scattered all around.
His perfect lips they sipped the Grail, his perfect heart commenced to fail,
His perfect body fell upon the ground.

The Angel smoked a cigarette, when he was sure Galahad was dead
He picked all of his clothes up off the floor.
Then I put on his boots and armor, I laid his body on the altar,
Put his helmet on then I headed for the door.",Galahad,2011

The kind of lover that one rarely finds
And I'm happy for the first time, in a long time

Came along and opened up the door
And though I know I've been in love before
Oh I feel it, so much more, than the last time

And she only looks like you
In a certain kind of light
When she holds her head just right

Its been winter, for a while
The north winds wail cut like a baby child
It was hard to think or smile
That brings springtime

But it did and now it is
The green green grass
Is come up green and its
Feeling just the way it did
The very first time

And she only looks like you
In a certain kind of light
When she holds her head just right

Gonna meet me a black haired girl
Who smells of smoke and caraway

Have always longed to wander wild and free
Among the slender and the peace of mind
Grow mountainsides of my own heart's ease.

I've been with beauties and I've been with some
That even speaking of them would be like
Using the moonlight to describe the sun
The fairest one is my own heart's ease.

The unknown country and the far-flung isles
The shores of faraway and fare thee well.
There's nowhere else like my own heart's ease.

Josh Ritter,"Supposedly it was a wise wise man 
Who said it’s better to have loved and lost 
Than never to have loved at all, never to have loved. 
How many times does the truth that you take to be true 
Is just truth falling apart at the same speed as you
Until it all comes away in a million degrees 
And you’re just a few pieces of fallin’ debris

And she’s hopeful. hopeful. for me.
I’m coming out of the dark clouds

She went away and she packed all her lovin’
I could not believe it how little there was 
I stood in the cold kitchen with nothin’ to say 
Who’d keep the whole world spinning when she went away yeah?

She kept telling me about the good things I deserve 
That I wanted somebody I’d mistaken for her
But one look in my eyes and she’d know she was wrong 
So she wouldn’t look back at me until she was gone 

How many times did you give all your love 
And find out it was so far from far from enough? 
I followed her out into the street in the rain 
And the whole world stopped spinning and just went up in flames 

And she’s hopeful. hopeful, for me. 
I’m coming out of the dark clouds
She’s hopeful. hopeful, for me.
She says it to me often

The sunlight corroded and the days started to fail 
The rocks in the road sharpened shadows to nails 
The fencepost were empty and so were the trees 
Had the bluebird of use on its’ last tune for me 

I’ve seen her around now with someone new I don’t know 
She likes greed-eyed boys who are haloed in hope 
But I know the look in his eyes and I know all the old signs 
Just a couple more curves before his own road unwinds 

These days I’m feelin’ better about the man that I am
There’s some things I can change and there’s others I can’t 
I met someone new now I know I deserve 
I never met someone who loves the world more than her 

She has been through her own share of hard times as well
And she has learned how to tear out the heaven from hell 
Most nights I’m alright still all rocks roll down hill
But she says I’ll get better, she knows that I will 

And she’s hopeful. hopeful, for me
I’m coming out of the dark clouds
She’s hopeful. hopeful, for me

There are times I cannot speak your name for the catchin' in my throat, 
There are things I will not sing for the sting of sour notes.

I feel like a miser, I feel low and mean 
For accusing you of stealin' what I offered you for free. 
Still it baffles the belief sometimes what thieves we lovers be.

I don't know who you're with these days, might be with someone new 
And if you are, I hope he treats you like a lover ought to do. 
But whoever makes you happy, it don't really matter who

Praise the fonder, that still grows on the absent heart and fields

Perhaps the fault was mine 
Perhaps I just ignored who you're always gonna be, 
Instead of who I took you for. 
I've been treated worse it's true, still I expected more.

But I will not chase your shadow as you go from room to room, 
Droppin' handkerchiefs and daggers, smokin' guns and other clues 
For what someone did with someone and who did what to who. 
I've got a new lover now, I hope you've got a lover too.

I've got a new lover now, I know that she's not mine,
I only want to hold her, I don't need to read her mind,

I got a new lover now, she knows just what I need. 
When I wake up in the night, she can read me back my dreams, 
And she loves them,  though she never needs to tell me what they mean.

I hope you've got a lover now, hope you've got somebody who 
Can give you what you need like I couldn't seem to do.

Josh Ritter,"I know where the nightmares sleep
On what fodder do they feed
For two long weeks I stayed awake
Until I saw one cross your face

I knew that you had been untrue
I didn't know how but I knew
The who you spoke to in your dreams
Was never how you spoke to me
I know where the nightmares sleep
On what fodder do they feed
I followed them back down to hell
And I spent some time down there myself.

Nightmares have their dreams, as well.
And when they sleep they go to hell
And they drink their fill on lakes of blood
Canter 'cross the skull-paved
And nurse their little colts on flies
Their coltish teeth like kitchen knives
And look down from abysmal cliffs
Their dead hair by the lead wind riffed
On denizens too deep to see
Whose own dreams nightmares' nightmares be.
I know where the nightmares sleep
On what fodder do they feed
I'd been awake so long by then
They thought that I was one of them.

Nightmares cannot be rib caged
Midnight's just a steeplechase
Down silver needles half will go
And pin your navel to your soul
The other half will go instead
A' gallop 'cross the kicked-up bed
And find the one who's sleeping sound
And drag him down, oh drag him down
Drag him down, oh drag him down
Drag him down, oh drag him down
Drag him down, oh drag him down

Drag him down where I got took
And through he may not want to look
I'll sift hell for an equal pain.
Shard-born beetles boiling rain
I'll prop his eyes and down them feed
The same hell you both fed to me.

Was the feeling of something bad coming true
One day I was happy
One day I was laughing
And then somewhere a chain snapped
Like that I was loose

Why don't anything feel as real as it once was?

Dreams a keep a comin', but the dream done gone
It was a summer night when I found my religion
I was under the tent, I was struck by the palm
And The Holy Spirit rained down upon me a vision
I felt better a little while, but then it was gone, I
Went to the mountain, and I went to the cabin, I
Washed myself in the river, and I waited on love
But I was lonely and dark as the moons around Saturn
Yeah, darkness for miles was all that there was
It was after the Lord and me parted ways that I found her
She was taking pictures of people coming into the mall
And she took my portrait as well as she could do
With someone who seemed to be not there at all, I
Stayed with her a while and I called myself happy, I
Clung to her hands and her hair and her mouth
But like every man who finds out he is drowning
I held onto her heart until I just wore her out",Dreams,2017

Of your oft electric laughter and your charms
How you came out of Montana with a wolf pup at your heels
And a snow white rabbit huddled in your arms

In the darkness, in the darkness
In the darkness

Remember, hey, those Gold Rush days are the gold dust in the mud
From Main St. leading all the way to Alder
With sunset turned the color of a lover's throated blush
And with moonrise, blazed some new and silver river

In the darkness, in the darkness
In the darkness

The minister was bloodless and the preachers were on fire
And mahātmās sang their love songs in nasturtiums
But if he, or they, or any of their masters called my name
I was in your holy temple and never heard them

In the darkness, in the darkness
In the darkness

Remember, hey, those Gold Rush days, some last chance ghost saloon
And you, and I, and all the miners watching
As shadows danced across a screen as quiet as the moon
Without sound if you're resignifying all things

The whole town was alive that night as we floated down the street
Through fist fights, cowboy police, parlor women
And the light from the projector seemed to grow within your soul
Like an old bull-throated songbird in its prison

In the darkness, in the darkness
In the darkness

They're tearing down the movies now, not a stone upon a stone
All dust is dust no matter how celestial
But I, who tasted hornet juice and honey on the rose
Would you survive for all their cold memorials?

Still every now and then sometimes when the night sky gets so bright
And no Bethlehem of stars could match its burning
I go out into the fields until I can feel you by my side
And my memory is a book of gold thrown open

And you rode a white horse, the queen of the harvest kissed your cheek
The boys all took one look and found that they could no longer speak

I pray it rains just a little more on me
'Cause I’m the guy who never cries
And I gotta keep my reputation clean
And here’s a helpful tip the rain
Administered in raindrops may
Help to hide the tears a little more
Which is why a guy who never cries
Looks up at the sky with hopeful eyes
Hoping when it finally rains it pours

I’m just a showboat
Won’t catch me crying, no
Won’t catch me showing any hurt

Pretending I'm not sinking over her

I pray the sunlight takes the sound as well
'Cause I’m the guy who never cries
And I gotta keep the pain all to myself

No sound to hear me breaking
No sound to hear the teardrops hit the floor

Stays up all night with hopeful eyes
Hoping when it finally rains it pours

Won’t catch me crying, no
Won’t catch me showing any hurt
I’m just a showboat

Pretending I'm not sinking over her

I wonder if she ever thinks of me
Out all night and running wild

With laughter, lights and drinking
Trying hard to keep from thinking
And seeking for what he is searching for
Which is why a guy who never cries
Looks up at the sky with desperate eyes
Hoping when it finally rains it pours

Mister le bon temps rouler
The only dog in every fight
The only guy who Dyna might
The only guy who never cries
He’s never lonesome all the time
See him dancing up on tables
Shawnas, Lisas, Ethels, Mabels
Though he looks a little tired
One eye always pointed skyward
Waiting for a drop of rain
To fall and help to hide the pain
To fall and help to lift the boat
So he can think he’s still afloat

Pretending he ain’t sinking over her
Pretending he ain’t sinking over her",Showboat,2017

Bye bye
Sorry look in your eye
Doesn't mean a thing

Ugly stories
And no one can deny
They were true

And while I was away
You were working
Every day

Everyone placed bets
On odds I couldn't see

Trust in anyone

Next time
You're in town
Don't bother coming round
You're not welcome anymore

So unkind

On such a silly dream

Steal your soul
When the cornfields won't grow

It only ended up the same way

Of how I got my attitude
When I moved to Manhattan
I hadn't even finished school

I was working so hard
Just to pay those bills and stay there
I have my own chamber
No one even merely cared

Time goes running out
I had to make a move
So I picked up the bass guitar
And I played it cool, I played it cool

Then a couple of years later
I'm living in Paris banks
Hanging out with DJs
Following the latest bands

I was working so hard
Just to figure out the close in the hand
Tried so hard not to show it
I walked with my nose in the air

The French didn't want me around
They didn't like my groove
So I my packed up my bass guitar
I moved to Hollywood, I moved to Hollywood

I had one last chance
It was all there waiting for me
Honey, so sunny, Hollywood

Let me tell you little secret
I'll tell you a little secret now
Let me tell you little secret
I'll tell you little story now

Time was running out
I had to make a move
So I picked up my bass guitar
And I played it cool

The French didn't want me around

Outside the wind was talking
Of how I felt for you.

I didn't wanted it at first, then II said alright
He said, you live each day like the very last one
So I took that line and I wrote this song
He said

It's all in the air
It's a lot like magic
We make due with the best that we have
You sit still or you roam and
Some things bound to happen
So I just shook his hand
Forgot about my plan.

So I rode my bike up to Sycamore Hill
I thought hard, I thought long
on the right way to live
I had a lot of fun with a long legged girl
And we threw our arms round this hum drum world.

It's all in the air,
It's a lot, lot of magic,
We make due with the best that we have.
You sit still or you roam and
Some things bound to happen
Forget about those plans

Well, the days turn to months
and the months into years
My children have grown and I'm still standing here
I still live each day like the very last one

Of which she's in the middle

I feel so unconvincing

With a rose and Chardonnay,

And make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl
Would you accompany me to the edge of the sea
Let me know if you're really a dream
I love you so, so would you go with me

Would you go with me if we rode the clouds together
Could you not look down forever
If you were lighter than a feather
Oh, and if I set you free, would you go with me

If I gave you my hand would you take it
And make me the happiest man in the world
If I told you my heart couldn't beat one more minute without you, girl

I'm married to the woman of my dreams
Got a good truck that gets me down the highway
Everything is perfect or so it seems
Momma and daddy come by sometimes
And everything is fine
My old dog does a little singing
Late at night when the moon gets bright
Sunday morning hear the church bells ringing
Let us go and see who's getting baptized
We gonna take us a Sunday drive
Cause everything is fine

Everything is fine, fine, fine
Through the sunshine and the rain
I got a peace of mind
You know I can't complain
I make it a point to thank the Lord
When I got Him on the line
I'm feeling good and everything is fine

Got the same job down at the warehouse
Ain't never been rich but I sleep at night
Got a little girl that looks like her mamma
She likes it when her daddy tucks her in real tight
One night this week we're gonna have a fish fry

Cause everything is fine, fine, fine

When I look in her eyes
It ain't no surprise
Sparks start a flyin like the 4th of July

She gets me so hot, my heart starts a poppin'
When we get to kissin, there ain't no stoppin'

When it comes to love
She ain't no slacker
My little darlin is a firecracker

When I light the fuse
I gotta get back quick
You gotta be careful with a dynamite stick

Son of a gun she fun to handle
And she packs a punch like a roman candle
She a pack of black cats in a red paper wrapper
My little darlin' is a firecracker

We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
Were a match made in heaven
And it ain't no joke.
But id sure I hate to see it go up in smoke

We got a good thing going
And it feels so right
Shes a firecracker
Shes the light of my life.

She goes off with a great big bang
Boys I tell ya its a beautiful thing
She takes off you better hang on tight

Shes a blonde bottle rocket
In the middle of the night
When she makes love shes a heart attacker

Maybe catch a movie when my arm goes numb
Wrap it around her when the good part comes

Take this job and shove it son
I keep it to myself 'cause I've gotta get paid

To sit behind the wheel
Of a brand new automobile
I love the way
A song can start to play
And take you back to younger days

But girl tonight
Holding you,
I realize that I've never known
This kind of love

Sometimes its hard
To let down your guard
And trust somebody with your heart
I know how
It feels when they walk out
And leave it in pieces on the ground

Oh I've known that kind of love
You feel it for awhile and then its gone
But girl tonight
Holding you
I realize that I've never known

I hear a song of long ago
About the fathers son
I love all the holidays
But not as much as this one

Why I love Christmas
It's a special time of year
Why I love Christmas
Bringing hope and lots of cheer
The child born on that morning brought the gift of salvation to us
That's why I love Christmas

The children are excited
Cause now it's Christmas ever
They're anticipating what Santa Claus will leave
When I see all the presents and boxes and pretty bows
I picture baby Jesus wrapped in swaddling clothes

Why I love Christmas
It's a special time of year
Why I love Christmas
Bringing hope and lots of cheer
The child born on that morning brought the gift of salvation to us
That's why I love Christmas

The child born on that morning brought the gift of salvation to us
That's why I love Christmas

To keep his thumb jammed in a dam that holds his dreams in. 
But that's a secret only Margaret knows. 
When Amsterdam is golden 
In the morning Margaret brings him breakfast. She believes him. 
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow.
He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes. 
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes. 
Chorus:
Let us go to the banks of the ocean, 
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee. 
Long a-go, I used to be a young man. 
Now dear Margaret re-members that for me. 
The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes.
His hat and coat are patched with the love that Margaret sewed him.
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam.
He watches tugboats down canals
And calls out to them when he thinks he knows the captain,
'til Margaret comes to take him home again,
Through unforgiving streets that trip him though he holds her arm.
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone and calls her name. 
Chorus
The windmills whirl the winter wind.
She winds his muffler tighter. 
They sit in the kitchen.
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew.
He sees her for a moment. 
He calls her name out. 
She makes the bed up, humming some old love song.
She learned the tune when it was very new.
He hums a line or two. 
They hum together in the dark.
The Dutchman falls asleep & Margaret blows the candle out.

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down

Get yourself a bride, and bring your children down to the river side

I had a goal in my younger days, I nearly wrote my will

Harvest moon shinin' down from the sky, a weary sign for all
I'm gonna leave this one horse town, had to stall till the fall
Now I'm gonna crawl, across The Great Divide

Josh Wilson,"I tried to write a song and keep it 3 minutes long
Get in, get out, nobody gets hurt
And I tried a thousand times to fit God between the lines
But I'm finding out that doesn't really work

I just don't have the words to say 'cause words only get in my way
I must apologize, I have the hardest time
Finding something to define a God that I can't define
And even if I could, it would take way too long
If all I've got's a 3 minute song

I've got a hundred metaphors and if I had a million more
I could never ever seem to sum this up
Besides how can some melody communicate eternity
It's like trying to fit the ocean in a cup

I never find the words to say 'cause words only get in my way
I must apologize, I have the hardest time
Finding something to define a God that I can't define
And even if I could, it would take way too long
If all I've got's a 3 minute song

I would like to dumb this down to 3 chords or maybe 4
But I've tried and I can't and I won't 'cause there will always be more
So I apologize, I can't seem to get it right

I must apologize, I have the hardest time
Finding something to define a God I just can't define

Josh Winiberg,"As I look into your eyes I see the sunrise
The light behind your face helps me realize

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all
It should be me, it could be me
Forever

Wandering through life will love come home to you
And the love you want forever, will they be true to you

Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Love's indescribable
It should be me, it could be me
Forever

Easy, ready, willing, over time
Where does it stop where do you dare me to draw the line
You've got the body now you want my soul
Don't even think about it say no go",Sunrise,2004

Josh Wink,"I know I should have told you 
I was so afraid you'd leave 
And now there's nothing left to say 
Well nothing that you'd believe 
  
I never meant to hurt you 
With the things i couldn't say 
I'd promise you tomorrow 
While denying you today 
  
These words have torn my world apart 

A darkness grows inside me 
In shading fades of gray 
All the colours of the world 
Are slowly sucked away 
  
I'm sinking ever deeper 
To a place that's cold and black 
I can't believe i lost you 
And you're never coming back 

These words have torn my world apart 
  
Soon the night will take me 
And save me from my pain 
Cloak me in cold darkness 
And help me lose your name 

These words have torn my world apart

Three long years now, since she left his angry place

And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given
Even the pain

Cold, tired and hungry, now she's movin' with the wind
And all I do is worry about the pain she must be in
If only I could see you, tell me why you didn't write?
Now there's no one there to defend you and I can't sleep at night

And we're all gonna ride this river
And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given
Even the pain

And we see the light before us
Through the darkness and the shame
But it all breaks down, it all breaks down
Even the pain

So roll on mighty river
Take us down to the sea
Wash away the muddy waters
Set us free

And we're all gonna ride this river
And we're all gonna feel the rain
And we all take what we're given

Josh Zuckerman,"The devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold
Against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said, ""my name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard 
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

He played Fire on the Mountain run boys, run

Chicken in a bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No child, no

Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet

Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back
If you ever want to try again
I done told you once you son of a bitch
I'm the best that's ever been""

It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

Joshua Bell,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1989

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

It was where you were going
How far you could walk

Do you remember?
Do you remember?

Do you remember
The scent of the summer so sweet?
As the the stars would watch over
Our souls through the weeds

And the hounds in their fences
Would bark at the breeze
While we d scream out confessions
Of love through the trees

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
'Cause I do

It was the year 93
If my mind does recall
Seems so long and so distant
Not distant at all

I sang songs to you crying
Till something did change
It was time, it pushed us older
Till we didn't even say hello

Hello
Hello
Hello

It?s been four long years
Since I've seen your face
Your voice will still resonate inside my bones
When the breeze runs by
And whispers that old song, I do

Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
I do

Joshua James,"I heard about, I heard about your daddy got sick
Drove down to the river to die alone
Seven days, seven days till they found him all
Wrapped up in a blanket on the boat

So we put him in the ground
Down, down, down
Your momma said, ""Stay strong, don't cry""
So that is what you did

Years later, years down
Later down the road
On a bus with your FM Radio, half drunk
A cigarette hanging out

What happened to your lonely soul?
Crying out
What happened to your lonely soul?
Screaming out

You said try and lose
You said try and lose

Everything you've known
Everything you've seen
Everything you've loved
Everything you've been

And everywhere you walk
Every song you sing
Every time you wake
It haunts you once again

One to move your feet onto
I'll sing a real life tune

So you say you want a love song
One to play your girlfriend with
I hope my little number will do
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, mmm, mmm

Let's stop our busy lives awhile
And think of the many many people
Across the many miles of earth
That have no clothes, no food to eat

And what about the air we breathe
To the food we eat are filled with things that kill
Our deaths are closer than we think

Well another silly love song could make me sick
About a heart broke emo rocker and his messed up chick
Are we so deaf dumb and blind we can't see the candlestick
Burnin' down?

Wakes up on her Monday morn
It's just another cup of coffee
In her run down place called home
She makes her way out to the car

The radio blares to drown
All the many many faces in her head
That at one time cared
But they have all moved and gone

Now to work she goes
Removing all her clothes
For all the perverse older men in our sickly generation
But they don't give a damn

Well another silly love song could make me sick
About a heart broke emo rocker and his messed up chick
Are we so deaf dumb and blind we can't see the candlestick
Burnin' down?

Open your souls, open your minds
There's a lot of wonderful people in the world outside
Open your souls, open your minds
There's a lot of wonderful people in the world outside

Well another silly love song could make me sick
About a heart broke emo rocker and his messed up chick
Are we so deaf dumb and blind we can't see the candlestick
Burnin' down?

Another silly love song could make me sick
I could say hello but I want a conversation
I could love till I'm dead but how long will I live
Till I'm down, we're burnin' down, ooh ooh oh oh oh oh

Joshua James,"Apologies never sounded insincere than when calling up a mother
Her bloody child on the battle field of war
While the pretty politicians lay their babies down to sleep
Not a chance in hell will that boy taste the blood

And the triumphant view of liberty stands firmly in New York
While the color of our ocean's painted red
Well president, I hope you found what you went over looking for
Or is your plan to send us all until we're dead?

Because one by one we will watch them die
In shallow graves our soldiers lay
Well NBC show us the blood on the country side
God bless, God bless the U.S.A.

If the document of freedom keeps us safely in our homes
Then it's fine to sacrifice our brothers blood
'cause it ain't my son that's fighting in the war across the seas
Give 'em hell boys point and shoot their time has come

Because father, son we will watch them die
Manifest destiny you paved the way
NBC show us the blood on the country side
God bless, God bless the U.S.A.

Line us up, give us guns we're trained to kill
The time has come, let this war drain all our brothers blood
Line us up, give us guns we're trained to kill
The time has come, let this war drain all our brothers blood

Joshua James,"I dream of dusty roads
Paved with gold that lead me in your eyes
The marmaladed paintings
Sing a song that not the crows will try

The Piano screams a sound inside your lips
I have found something I could never save
The current pulls me down into your river deeper now
Than I had ever planned to sink, planned to sink

Scattered winds blow me cross the ocean
Turns and spins, leaves me breathless
But with no sense of my direction
Or where the main land sits, where I find my soul

The battles fought and fight inside these walls
The blood still stains my dress
Through we spoke, my broken bones
The chandelier means more you said

The thunder screamed a light into the thick black painted night
But not a muscle did you move for me
The rapids growing taller than I ever do recall
Dragging my soul to sea, my soul to sea

And I said, ""Lord, what have I done?""
And I said, ""Lord, what have I done?""

Scattered winds blow me cross the ocean
Turns and spins, leaves me breathless
But with no sense of my direction
Or where the main land sits, where I find my soul

Could you take it on faith one more time?

I know I promised to you before
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you no more.
If I could take it all back and start again... take it all back, well maybe
then,
I could tell you that I love you. I could lay back down beside you.
I could tell you that I love you, lay back down beside you.
If I told you that I love, could I lay back down beside you?
Could you take me on faith one more time?

Joshua Kadison,"Waiting in green velvet 
With a suitcase in her hand,
Standing down a ways from 
The bus stop sign,
Looking at the sky, 
Like she was bound for 
The promised land,
Checkin' out her watch 
Like she was losing time.
She was checkin' out her watch 
Like she was losing time.

Chorus:
Thought I heard her talkin' somethin' 'bout
Rainbow lights, a psychedelic sight, 
It'll be here soon,
Comin' down to fly us all away.
Can't you hear the roar of 
The distant engines from a far-off moon?
Are you packed and ready for Judgement Day? 

So I just sat there on 
The bus stop bench awhile
And watched her stare into the sun.
Reminded me what 
My grandma said 
When I was just a child,
That'll hurt your eyes, dear little one,
That'll hurt your eyes, dear little one. 

Chorus

The bus pulled up and I got in 
But the girl didn't even move.
This was not the ride she was waiting for.
The bus driver just shook his head 
Cause there's nothing in the world to do
And I waved good-bye through 
The slowly closing door.
I just waved good-bye 
Through the slowly closing door.

in this crazy world.
Your're everything I've tried to find,
your love is a pearl.

You're my Mona Lisa, you're my rainbow skies,
and my only prayer, is that you realize,
you'll always be beautiful, in my eyes.

The world will turn,
and the seasons will change.
And all the lessons we will learn,
will be beautiful and strange.

We'll have our fill of tears, our share of sighs.
My only prayer, is that you realize.
You'll always be beautiful, in my eyes.

You will always be, beautiful in my eyes.
And the passing years will show,
that you will always grow,
evermore beautiful, in my eyes.

And there are lines upon my face,
from a lifetime of smiles.
But when the time comes to embrace.
for one long last while.

We can laugh about it, how time really flies.
We won't say goodbye, 'cause true-love never dies.
You'll always be beautiful, in my eyes.

You will always be, beautiful in my eyes.
And the passing years will show,
that you will always grow,
evermore beautiful, in my eyes.

that you will always grow,

Joshua Kadison,"Going back to a tender age
So full of confusion and rage
Daddy says, ""Boys, your Mama's gone.""
There's a hand on your shoulder as you're throwing dirt
Someone says, ""Time heals the hurt
Little man you got to keep on keepin' on.""

But all you want is Mama's arms.

You ride back home in a limousine
The saddest car that you've ever seen
Your brother cannot look you in the eye
Lightning stikes and thunder roars
An early winter in that heart of yours
But you swear you won't let them see you cry
 
'Cause all you want is Mama's arms

The nieghbors come and bring you pies
Endless words and futile sighs
And you run up to your room and lock the door
And there you are in your Sunday best
The way your Mama would have had you dressed
And you realize it doesn't matter anymore

'Cause all you want is Mama's arms

'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
The seasons change the young boy grows
To understand it's all part of some plan
You used to wonder what it's all about
Now those are questions you can do without
You laugh them off and do the best you can

But all you want is Mama's arms.
 
All you want in Mama's arms.

Joshua Kadison,"Outside of Albuquerque, ""Bout an hour north of there
She's got a house full of three little Indians
In the middle of nowhere
You wonder where her man went, you wonder if she minds
They've got smiles and healthy tummies
So you guess they're doing fine
She sells jewelry by the roadside, silver beads and things
She can weave a spell upon you with any song she sings

Oh, she's a desert flowers, growing free and wild
Her beauty seems so fragile, fragile as a child
And you wanna take her with you
But you know she must remain
So you leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain
Turn yourself into the rain, turn yourself into the rain
You leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain

Her kids were playing leapfrog, jumping in the sand
I pulled my car off the road and parked beside her stand
She asked where I was going so fast and far alone
I told her how love was something
I wasn't sure I'd ever known
She said, ""Maybe you never heard the desert
Sing her song at night
Or maybe you just been trying much too hard to get it right""

Oh, she's a desert flowers, and growing free and wild
Her beauty seems so fragile, fragile as a child
And you wanna take her with you
But you know she must remain
So you leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain
Turn yourself into the rain, turn yourself into the rain
You leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain

(Turn yourself into the rain, turn yourself into the rain)
(You leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain)

I'm wavin' in my rear-view mirror
Then the next thing that I know
Are the broken lines on a black highway off to another show

Oh, she's a desert flowers, and growing free and wild
Her beauty seems so fragile, fragile as a child
And you wanna take her with you
But you know she must remain
So you leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain
Turn yourself into the rain, turn yourself into the rain
You leave her wishing you could turn yourself into the rain

Like all those cherry lipstick ""love-you-baby""s
You scribbled on faded motel mirrors

Now, I'm Greyhound bound for anywhere
I told the man, ""The next bus'll do""
They're callin' the Twelve-twenty for Tupelo
Just one thing before I go
Tell me, is he good to you

I talked it over with Hadley
He's still out there off of Highway 10
If anybody could explain it
I figured good old Hadley can
His wrinkled hands upon the table
He said, ""I hate to break the news
But sometimes there ain't no explaining""

Evidence of God's embrace
And I can almost see mercy's face
Pressed against the veil
Looking down with longing eyes
Mercy must have realized
That once His blood was sacrificed
Freedom would prevail
And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

[Chorus:]
Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid
Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away
I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when I felt like giving in

Sometimes I still feel so far
So far from where I really should be

Just to remind me

A massive entourage

Breaking records
Breaking hearts

Even thought we're
Playing in out garage
Soon we'll have
A massive entourage
Going triple-platinum
You'll just watch us
Climbing up the

Breaking records
Breaking hearts

Josie and the Pussycats
Long tails and ears for hats
We know just where it's at
East, west, north, or south
Guaranteed to rock the house
