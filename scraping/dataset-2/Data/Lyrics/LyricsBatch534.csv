Kay Starr,"You always hurt the one you love
The one you shouldn't hurt at all
You always take the sweetest rose
And crush it till the petals fall
You always break the kindest heart
With a hasty word you can't recall 
So If I broke your heart last night, 
It's because I love you most of all",You Always Hurt the One You Love,1997
Kay Starr,"You got a gal you love on Sunday
Then you get another for Monday

Ain't nobody's business but my own

You say you're always home alone
How come I can't get you on the phone

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business

All night long your playin' poker
Tell me what's the name of that joker

Ain't nobody's business but my own

I come over, say ""Here I am!""
Then I hear the back door slam

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

Nobody's business

You tell me you're in bed by seven
But your light's on past eleven

Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own

Now you ain't so smart and you ain't good lookin'
How come you got so much cookin'

Ain't nobody's business but my own

Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own
Nobody's business
Nobody's business
Nobody's business but my own

And you wear the prettiest ties and collars
Whereabouts do you get those dollars

Ain't nobody's business but my own

You always talk about settlin' down
When I bring a ring, you're not around

Well, I'll be there the next time that you call

Well let's not fuss and let's not fight

I'm sick and tired of sayin' ""Goodnight""

Well, let's make up and hold each other tight

We both know we're birds of a feather
Let's go into business together
We can start a business of our own

Kay Starr,"We were waltzin' together to a dreamy melody
When they called out ""Change partners""
And you waltzed away from me
Now my arms feel so empty as I gaze around the floor
And I'll keep on changing partners
Till I hold you once more

Though we danced for one moment and too soon we had to part
In that wonderful moment somethin' happened to my heart

Oh, my darlin' I will never change partners again

Kay Starr,"I don't know why, I made you cry
I'm sorry sweetheart and yet
Though you shouldn't be lenient with me
I hope you'll forgive and forget
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear

Kay Starr,"In this cloudy sky overhead now
There's no guiding star I can see
And I would be lost by each wild tempest tossed
Oh, if I didn't know of a place we two can go

There's a little cabin in the sky, Mister
For me and for you
I feel that it's true somehow

Can't you see that cabin in the sky, Mister
An acre or two of heavenly blue to plow

We will be oh so gay
Eat fried chicken every day
As the angels go sailing by

And that is why my heart is flyin' high, Mister
'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky

We will be oh so gay

Kay Starr,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

You suddenly find
The clouds are silver lined
When the sun breaks through.
It's a great feelin',
You walk down the street
And see the folks you meet
Smilin' back at you.

As long as I've got someone to embrace,

You say come and lay by your side
If this is just another ride you're taking me on,

I've enjoyed as much as this, as I can stand
So, love me or leave me alone

Love me or leave me alone
Love me or, baby,
Believe me, I'm gone

Kay Starr,"There goes the girl I dreamed all through school about, 
There goes the girl I'll now be a fool about 
Ring down the curtain, I'm certain at present 
My future just passed. 

Don't even know if she has been spoken for. 
If she is tied, the ties must be broken, for 
Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me 
My future just passed. 

Stars in the blue, tho' you're at a distance 
You can at least do this, 
Sometimes a boy encounters resistance 
Help me to win this miss.

Kay Starr,"I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let her go",I've Got the World on a String,1998
Kay Starr,"Day after day I'm waited patiently
And when the salty wind is blowin' from the sea
I pretend that it's breeze that's fillin' the sails 
That's movin' the ship that's bringin' my honey back to me

I always keep my window open wide
I like to let the friendly breeze come right inside
And pretend that it's breeze that's fillin' the sails 
That's movin' the ship that's bringin' my honey back to me

[Chorus]
Mr wind keep blowin' stronger because I must have that guy of mine
Well every day seems so much longer
Now don't forget each daylights savin' time
I get so lonesome waitin' days and weeks
When every breath of air that lingers on my cheek
Seems to whisper it's the breeze that's fillin' the sails 
That's movin' the ship that's bringin' my honey back to me

Day after day I'm awaitin' cause
The wind is a-blowin' from the sea
Well it's the sea the breeze the ship the sail that's bringin' my honey to me

I keep my window open wide
I like to let that breeze come right inside
Well it's the sea the breeze the ship the sail that's that's bringin my honey to me

Kay Starr,"I'm waiting for ships that never come in
I wonder where they can be

Life is only a game of poker
And ""happiness"" is the pot
Fate deals you five cards in the cradle
And you play, whether you like it or not

Some get a pat hand to start with
And the game doesn't seem on the square
When you look at your hand and discover
You were born without even a pair

But there's no use in kicking or squawking
Just pick up your cards and begin
To figure and plan and puzzle
While Fate looks on with a grin

Some take a chance at bluffing
And stake everything they've got
On a dinky little four-flush
And, sometimes, it wins the pot

Others will break up openers
To draw for a middle straight
They know what a chance they're taking
And they learn their mistake too late

Some can't help playing crooked
Against all good advice
But they seldom get away with it
And in the end, they'll pay the price

The most of us play straight poker
But I tell you, boys, it's hard
When you're there with both ends open
And you can't draw the winning card

Now I've always been a loser
It seems that I never can win
And I'm just a dreamer who's
Waiting for ships that never come in

I wonder where they can be",I'm Waiting for Ships That Never Come In,1998
Kay Starr,"Someday, sweetheart,

Tell me, do you love me too?

But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

Saying ""can't we still be friends""

I've grown accustomed to his face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
his smiles, his frowns,
his ups, his downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to his look,
Accustomed to his voice,
Accustomed to his face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see his now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see his now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught his,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for his bread and water,
While his husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in his cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take his in or hurl his to the walls?
Give his kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take his back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take his back
If she were even crawling on his knees.
Let his promise to atone,
Let his shiver, let his moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, HA!

But I'm so used to hear his day,
""Good morning"" every day.
his joys, his woes,
his highs, his lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, like a habit

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

There are fountains of them

Can you ever forgive me?

Yes, Colin
Colin, look at you

It was Ben that kept the garden alive, father, until
I knew it was against your orders sir, but I
And it was Dickon, who taught us how
Yes, I can imagine
Dickon, if there is ever anything we can do

Sir, what is to become of our Mary?
Why, Mary, I'd nearly forgotten you in all this
It's hard to remember everybody sir

No, it isn't
Three isn't very many people at all
I should be able to remember three people quite easily
Would I be one of them?

For as long as you will have us, we are yours
Colin and I, and this is your home
And this, my lovely child is your garden

Come to my garden, nestled in the hill
There I'll keep you safe beside me
Come to my garden, rest there in my arms
There I'll see you safely grown

And on your way, stay here in the garden
As days grow long and mild
Come to the garden
Come, sweet child

Kay Weber,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Kay Weber,"Whispers in the dark
Two shadows in the night
So gentle and so tender that every little word
Is like a song of sweet delight

Whispers in the dark
How heavenly they seem
When lips and arms surrender and ev'ry little kiss
Is like a dream within a dream

But soon the breezes whisper to the trees
That dawn is near,
So soon their little paradise of love will disappear
Whispers in the dark

While stars are in the blue
Upon a night like this perhaps I'll hear
A little whisper in the dark from you",Whispers in the Dark,2000
Kay-Gee's,"Wassup?
Hahaaa
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?
I was in the streets the other day, I had a homie come through and he ask me
Say ""Yo! Everybody listen to you, everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?""
I told him ""Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty""
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go

I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy
From the city where them young niggas die skinny
Keep work on deck if you need any
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready
Feels like I was born for this
If not, at least I'll die for it
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it
The big question is what can I do for the youth?
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth

""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I'm a hustler!""

Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds
Fresh out, right back chasin bread
My life's so hard, so concrete
I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street
Take me for instance
My life is not about you, think me for instance
I did the impossible, I made it out
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on
Stuntin in traffic like ""This my car""
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things
Lovin every minute of it, still breakin chains

""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I'm a hustler!""

Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture
Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional
Same picture, see it one of three ways
Let it marinate, it might take a few days
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence
So I shouldn't say nothin? Get a moment of silence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense
Words to live by, took it out of context
They say your past is your present and your present is your cash
So I look forward to the future
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have
Partly cloudy so I need a forecast
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin tell him

""I'm a hustler!"" So, one man, one stage, one mic
One song, one chance to get it right
Real or fake y'all, we gon' see tonight
And I think I know the way, follow me
""I got hustle!"" One man, one stage, one mic

To chase the golden sword
All that time I held it here, in my very hands
Till someone cut the cord

I ruled the oceans, taking ships in reverse
Having no peace of mind
Stealing all I could find
As I crossed the earth

I've had my residences all over space
Bridging lightyears each day
Only one dream away

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

On a one-horse open sleigh,

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride

Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;

Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

In my arms again

Kaye Tuckerman,"You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""what's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The black freighter
With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! what's wrong with you! earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody
Nobody!

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say, ""who's that kicking up a row?""
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say, ""what's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The black freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The black freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them now, or later?""
Askin' me!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""right now.
Right now!""

Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

And the ship
The black freighter
Disappears out to sea
And
On
It
Is

Kayla Parker,"(Background vocals) Whoa oo oa oa oa ooooa
Trusting in someone who?s made of flesh and blood
Such a frightful situation
Continual emotional intensive care
Is from too high expectations
So like a flower depends on rainfall
And like true lovers depend on phone calls
Like a song needs a tune
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

Some folks build their life only on wealth and fame
Or if they get high place employment
Not knowing they?re building hopes and dreams on sand
They soon are disappointed (disappointed)
So like a good day (good day) depends on sunshine (on sunshine)
And like the harvest depends on the time
Like the tide needs the moon
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

On Your Holy Word I am standing
For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You
Like a comedian needs to be funny
And like a banker depends on money
Like a bride needs a groom
My heart depends on you (My heart depends on you)
Ooo oo oooo ooooo

On Your Holy Word I am standing
For every word is true
That?s why I?m trusting in You
I trust You

Just like a good day depends on blue skies

Depends on money
Just like a bride
Needs a groom

Only man I ever think of with regret

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good

And forgettin' me on this side of Jordan.

Dare a man to change the given order.
Though they smile and tell us all of us are brothers,
Never was it true this side of Jordan.

Nailed to some garden gate or boardin'.

On est trop lié, rap de tôlier, la tu carbure au hydrocarbures, l'album un pétrolier. 
Qu’alimente les super-tankers, provoque le choc, suffoque, voila tous ce que supporte ton cœur. 
Je te fou le vertige, des gisements de rimes de prestige,
Explose les charts en ruines, vos carrières en vestige. 
Avant je pissais dans l’ascenseur, fessais des choses insensés, 
Maintenant j'trouve ca sans service, vendu, comme du sang, c'est
C'est toute la ville qui deal et qui vole, qui est au bout du rouleau, 
Touche a la famille, c'est bénévole pour faire le sale boulot.

Chaque jour on se lève comme si y avait tout a refaire.

Pour pas me rouiller, m'enrayer je suis sorti du holster. 
Je suis en major, je fais ce que je veux, je suis comme en indé, 
Je lève mon majeur, j'compte sur mon indexe, j'ai pas besoin d'aide.

Je suis dans la dream team sur le terrain on est plus que onze. 
Bosser dans la braque pour une retraitre en zonz,
Avec une plaque de fer, des vis plus une balle de 11 
C'est le désastre, j'authentifie le hardcore,

Cané se réfugier dans les canettes de bières
J'aperçois Mélanie, tous les jaloux qui veulent sa mort
Hier j'ai vu un mec chelou près de sa porte
Je vois tous ces rappeurs, rapper tout haut se qu'ils pensaient tout bas
Vendre ma mort comme si j'étais Tupac

Moi je vois l'pont mais de l'au-delà 
Les mots me prennent à la gorge 
J'pourrais remplir des sots de larmes 
On m'a poussé à la faute 
De tout là haut j'me sens si seule si mal si loin des autres. 

J'ai remarqué que pour certains je n'étais pas irremplaçable 
Je suis mort mais ils ne parlent que de la taille de mon plasma 
Tous ces chiens que j'aimais tant que j'ai abrité de mon toit 
Se battent pour obtenir la garde pas de ma gosse mais de mon quad, 
De tout là haut je vois le maire manigancer 
J'ai vu comment ces buldozers avaient cassé l'bâtiment C 
Karim, j'étais présent à ton mariage, à titre postum 
De tout là haut j'avais enfilé l'costume 
Moi ma femme n'y arrive pas les rel'vés sont mensuels
J'deviens ouf hier j'ai vu son frère levé la main sur elle
Certains fans me regrettent j'en ai vu un s'couper la veine
J'fume une clope regardant mes res-frè tourner à Fresnes
Tous les matins à la même heure j'revois ma mère aller en course
T'imagine pas comment j'ai mal quand je l'entend chialer en douce
Mon père si courageux, toute une vie de sacrifice
J'ai tricar que son visage, en 2 piges en a pris 10
T'inquiète mon argent t'es reversé
Nabil, j'aimerais tant que tu m'entendes j'ai pas eu l'temps d'te remercier
J'ai tout vu de tout là haut les jaloux, jeter des yeux
Mais dans ma tête je restais jeune j'aime toujours jeter des œufs
Ignorant que mon regard venait des cieux
J'ai bien vu rue des Bergères que des enfants vendaient des xeus
VIP j'ai vu la juge faire du pied à Devillepin
Condamné on voyait Pix dans les promenades de Villepinte
Wesh mon vieux, ça fait un bail elles sont bizarres nos trajectoires
Te voilà seul et depuis peu ton frère Nasser est avec moi
Tous les jours ont r'fait le monde discutant regard au loin
T'es au courant malheureusement Bénaïssa nous a rejoint
Regretté je pense qu'eux même les plus lâche n'ont plus l'age
Solidaires alors ont traîne de nuages en nuages
De tout là haut, mes espoirs sont mes vœux
N'oubli pas que je vois tout que les étoiles sont mes yeux

Moi je vois l'pont mais de l'au-delà

Il portait un sourire à en faire envier un ange
Le premier à donner quand nos cœurs faisaient la manche
Il avait les mots qui savaient éponger nos larmes
Il dessinait un nez rouge sur le visage de son drame
Lui qui n'a connu que l’hôpital et les urgences
Il a dû, pour son rêve, aménager sa souffrance
Ce rêve de chanter devant des milliers de personnes
Dieu merci il l'a vécu avant que son heure sonne
Mais pour ça, il en a bouffer des castings
Pas facile avec les antibiotiques de chanter comme Sting
Mais quand résonnait sa voix
La détresse de ce terrien ressuscitait Balavoine
Beaucoup se battent malgré leur handicap
Je rends hommage à tous ces héros sans cape
Même si la mort a toujours le dernier mot
La vie est une bataille et t'es parti en héros

Pour mieux sortir du ventre en temps de guerre
D'où je viens on naît en martyr
Pour s'en sortir faut du courage
Ici, c'est impossible de dormir
Veiller sur les miens à chaque seconde
Je cache ma peur dans ma joie de vivre
Quand mes nuits sont des jours éclairés par les bombes
On dit qu'on vit d'amour et d'eau fraîche
Moi je vis dans la crainte de plus avoir d'oxygène
Chaque jour est un combat pour trouver la brèche
ÉTeins-moi ça frangin, n'allume pas la mèche
J'aurais la chance de m'en sortir
Grandir, et faire des prouesses
Malheureusement ici, on meurt en martyr
Veillez sur les miens, S.O.S.

Il a rien demandé, c'est le produit de l'amour
Au début c'est tout rose, au début c'est pour toujours
Il a ses deux parents, situation normale
Le père c'est le modèle et la mère c'est le moral
Les années défilent, le foyer bat de l'aile
Lui il comprend pas, son papa n'est plus ponctuel
Il l'amenait à l'école, lui faisait prendre son bain
Il lui faisait le lait quand il regardait Franklin
Mais tous sa c'est loin, il entendait sa maman pleurer
Il l'a autant consolé qu'il a aidé
Malgré son jeune âge c’était l'homme de la maison
Il se permettait d'engueuler sa sœur aînée
Yeah, est-il ou pas perturbé?
Mais est-ce qu'il aura les armes pour combattre ou se tuer?
Beaucoup sont dans son cas dont je tiens à rendre hommage

Qui m'a appris a marcher

Lasse-moi au moins porter ta croix
Pour remettre des étoiles dans tes yeux
Oui, ces étoiles qui ont fait de moi

Ce sont tes rêves qui m'ont mis au monde
Et tes douleurs qui m'ont appris à parler
Ton timbre de voix m'a donné mon nom
Et tes combats m'ont appris à marcher
C'est ta vision du monde qui m'a donné la vue
C'est en suivant tes colombes que j'ai trouvé la paix
Mais aujourd'hui, tu sais, je n'te reconnais plus
Je te sens abandonnée
T'as tellement fait de concessions pour me faire connaitre
Qu'aujourd'hui tu es épuisée et perdue
Des vautours ont picorés le cœur que t'as sur la main
Et aujourd'hui tu vis au royaume des déçus
Oui je vois bien que t'as perdu la foi
Que tu n'crois plus à nos premiers combats
Mais combien rêves que tu remettes ton treillis?

Ou t'es passé? Je te perds
Qui t'habites? Qui t'as tant fait changer?
Qui mange ton bon cœur pour te laisser que le mauvais?
Tu veux te droguer? Être sôulard
Traiter ta femme de pute et traîner au bar
Fais ton choix, mais n'oublie pas, je suis artiste
C'est toi qui as fait ce que je suis à travers mes disques
Je ne suis que le reflet de ta personne
Tu m'as appelé Alonzo et m'a présenté Akhenaton
J'ai trop mal de te regarder toucher l'fond
Tu tires tes enfants avec toi, sans bouteille, sans harpon
Khey, tu étais plus mature à 17 qu'à 30
N'essaye pas de rattraper ce que t'as pu éviter par chance

T'es la mienne Ilias, amis ou ennemis
Tu verras bien qu'c'est sur moi qu'il faudra qu'tu comptes
L'argent ça vient, ça part comme avec certain amis
Ton imagination? (Non!) Je suis bien réel
Les gens parlent de nous au singulier, jamais au pluriel
Je sais qu'j'suis exposé, je suis qu't'es réservé
J'te mets dans des histoires qu'ta mère n'arrive pas à encaisser (Ilias!)
Tu vis à travers moi, oui je t'ai remplacé
Je suis le virus dans ton couple quand tu dors dans l'canapé
Je suis le pourquoi du comment quand t'as du mal à t'confesser
Le reflet du miroir que t'as du mal à casser, mais
Toi et moi on n'fait qu'un, je n'trouve plus d'mots
Laisse-moi te porter vers le haut car

Tu sais que j't'attendais pour manger?
Non, à quoi sert ton portable?
Qu'à liker sur Instagram
Bébé j'ai pas vu l'temps passer
Après le match on a passé deux heures à jacasser
Sur la route c'était bouché un mec s'est fracassé
Et la batterie d'mon téléphone fait le Ramadan toute l'année
À croire qu'à tes potes t'es fiancé
À quand le faire-part et le bébé?
J'vous souhaite un beau mariage
Moi, j'serai plus ta femme de ménage
Ah, tu vas pas commencer il est deux heures du mat'
Mets-moi ton carton rouge que je quitte ce match
En plus j'suis défoncé et chaque fois qu'tu parles
J'ai l'impression d'entendre Brad Pitt dans Snatch

J'vais t'envoyer recommandé
C'est comme ça tous les soirs

Faut qu'je décompresse un peu bébé, j'vais au sport
Habille-toi comme une princesse à mon retour je te jure on sort
Heureusement que pour ça je n'compte pas sur toi
Ton dernier cadeau date de la préhistoire
Y en a que pour tes paires de Air Max
Moi j'veux des vacances à Djerba
Écoute, t'habites un magasin Zara
Et ta salle de bain est un rayon de Sephora

C'est pour toi que ma CB fume plus que Wiz Khalifa

Obligée de te pister comme un condé

Attends, toi qu'a souvent la mémoire de Jason Bourne

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2007

I will be searching for my love
I will, but I will be there for you

With a love so strong to break my heart
This is your heart that's beating
Forget about fuss and all misleading

Love is wishing that we had it all

Always smelling good, que pasa, u wanna

Listen Coolio, plus we can listen to my demo
Baby front as usual but u know, it's aight
When we was together, used to run into fights
But now I'm into something else, my musical mystics
Only thing my interest's my melodies and rythmics
Till the day I wake up, my life I gotta set up
Everything I got that's the fuel helps me get up

Producer, beatmaker, now, I'd say at the moment, probably Kaytranada
I think he's, he's on that exact sort of thing that we like
You know, the musicality meeting the beats
You know, from the chords and the basslines, and the rhythms
You know, it's, and I mean, you probably agree, you know, he's (shout to Kaytranada anytime)

Hey yo  niggas always talkin' bout there shit is real 
""I gotta flex with a Lex in my video"" 
That's what half of these rappers be thinking in every city, yo 

[Kazi] 
Yeah, you want to fight don't ya, you want to bite don't ya? 
The involvement of a new coast is here 
To take your soul, rearrange it with flows 
You're unknown, come across our line, you get blown 
Too many bids, ain't no puttin' together 
Restorin' your body parts, leaving the rest for whatever 

[Madlib] 
You talking bout you want to freestyle, you want to flow 
But your flow be like oil and water, it don't mix 
And you don't even know you're waiting for your rhyme fix 
But my mind sticks, my rhyme hits, your mind gets 
Amputated, 'cause your style ain't even Hip Hop related 

[Kazi] 
This be the Kazi, my niggas call me Kaz 
How does it feel to be mixed up and lost? 
First of all, you shouldn't have bit the next rapper 
Now your mind's confused, you lose, talkin' bout you paid dues 

[Madlib] 
Slay crews, when you ain't even at phase two 
Talking about take two? You only get one take 
Yo, my boys just run fakes, run ya out of my estates 
Plus they just might take ya papes, plus you won't remember no plates 
So don't have no mistakes, steppin' over this way 

[Kazi] 
Second to last, but not least, hey yo, Kazi's here to rip it 
I'll take MC's, tie 'em up, and then split 
It's like this, yo I'm up on some bliz 
Total techniques for the hip hop kids

Yo we puttin' the lid on ya, if you're wack you're a goner

Keep this hip hop real, innovatin' new styles 
Takin' out wack MC's by the piles, for real

I have no strings to hold me down
Beware of the Tupperware 
It's the limited edition, prime series hum via tell a sport brain 
Who came complete with all terrain capabilities 
Track trail blazing a path of traveling freely 
Beyond the vanity of border impedance hindering 
Progress intending to enhance those plagued with 
Recessive styles, relying on primal rage 
Disengaged pushing trivial, unimportant material 
Virtually there, but still visually impaired 
Point of views defusing the output of ya outlook 
Confusing ya confidence, 'cause you dwell on surface knowledge 
Dig deeper into my speech or the only way you'll learn 
Is to have a translator explain my rhymes in layman's terms 
We now have confirmation, pure order has swarmed 
Like locusts consuming all vegetation 
Into waste land fills fresh water wells seeping 
Poisonous corrosion as a business proposition 
Exposing flesh in nuclear explosions 
Forming glowing boils at the point of contact of deforming 
The surviving population as mass rotations 
Resulting from advanced hip hop experimentation's 
On the island of Madlib Monroe 
CDP pouring beats down your throat that dissolve your vital organs 


Episode #3: Declaime 

I'm cool with who I be, Lyric slanger from CDP 
Got shit locked up like slaves out at sea 
Ya lost to the way I come across at all costs, I must get mine 
Suck up all the sun rays and then outshine 
Till I blind all eye sights all over the planet 
When I rhyme right, I out stand it 
Cool with my ways, so chilled that most can't stand it 
y'all knows me, the rhyme wise who stays high 
With forty's in my lap bust that old school boom bap 
All over this map, for I be that down ass, South Cali poet, 
Ya know it to be The D-E-see-L-A-I-M-E, 
Doing my thing in this ring 
Knockin' niggas down with what I bring 
Crazy chaos your way off 
So swing ya partners are around 
Do the hump to my sound 
Fuck it, all panties down to ya ankles 
Bending back ass over microphone entangles 
Strangles all ya got chokes like chronic smoke 
I'll take a toke and pass it to all my niggas, 
to all my niggas, take two and pass

Situations got your mind in control, that's how you roll 
But don't step to M-E-D, because your rhymes will be fold

So rappin' imitators get peeled back when I'm in combat 
I got them rhymes to make ya shake the spot when Medaphoar's near 

My rhyme's been set to blow up different spots so MC's stand clear 
I fear no MC's alive because my dangerous rhyme 
Survives battles worldwide, until my cities recognize 
For every rhyme that's built to self destruct three seconds after the buck 
Niggas better duck, or take that risk to get stuck 
It's this do or die mentality that keeps ya mouth frying 
Sippin on the E&J and smoking blunts stuffed with Hawaiian Chronic 
For my homey Shack in SB, rhymes on the shiesty 
Niggas on the run when Medaphoar is on the gun 
MC's out to get me from all of the battles I won 
Med, comin from the west, so represents where I'm from 
Lyrically I got your block locked when I drop this hip hop 
Fresh out the west to twist you up because the rhyme don't stop 

[Chorus]

[Oh No]
In this game, I ain't trying to see that wack rhyme bacteria 
That's some next shit, material starts external 
But also interior when y'all frauds claim imperial 
Breaking down your inferior while you listen to your superior 
Some niggas know me as ""Oh No"" 
But in reverse in ya in the middle, I'm ""on ya ho"" 
So slow your roll because I fold emcees like rheumatism 
Syndrome and break 'em down like compression when I be up in 'em 
I skip more MC's than scratch compilations CD's 
To have your speech in verbal poetical lyrical oddities 
The heart's cold to make hell freeze, slash hot like a flame 
I spread like dead grass up in the hills so run for your ass 
I'm known as assassin from the west livin' it up 
Kaliwild shakin up the best, messing 'em up 
This nigga's known as metaphor and I be the disrupt 
Vocally tearing you up from the ground up 
 

Episode #5: Wild Child 

[Chorus: Wild Child]
When you bust that rhythmic freestyle flow to be that abstract 
You bust back flips, lyrically you'll get asked that 
Is y'all crew rally all that when you bump that 
Track by Lootpack, ya like ""They off the hook, cat"" 

[Wild Child] 
Focus, Wild Child representative of hip hop, top 10 niggas get mopped 10 times 
My rhymes will transform into 30 thin lines 'cause I feep I'm 
The responsible obstacle 
For you non-freestyling MC's kickin' lots of bull 
I rock shit till the Eucalyptus 
Flaunt it like, haunt ya mic to the point ya mic tells you, 
""You can't rip this"" I'll get it exited and, get the crowd hyped and 
Slap you up with my right hand and 
Find out you're a little white man with a slight tan 
Wild Child'll take ya ass out like lightning 
Fresh in the flesh, steadily enlightening this mic 
The fact that you lack the respect, got the mad knack of incompetence 
Step to Jack and get smacked to lower your whole lack of confidence 
Ya bro's out there know you have no composure 
You unnoticibly slide to the back of thee 
Open mic session with ya little wack faculty 
Thirty minutes, prior to getting there, claiming you had the knack to be 
The dopest MC, that was the most inactively 
Statement you ever said to Jack, you see 
The day you took hip hop into ya hands was an act of lunacy 
So, if ya feel me, yo if ya feel me, party people say it 
""La La La La"", come on, come on, come on, come on... 
my people say ""La La La La""

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2003

Kazumi Watanabe,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2004

With the four on the floor
Deuce coupe coming at you 
Avoiding the capture
Fall from stop and drop
Than we ready to rock
And city of steel 
Catch me cruisin down the block
Whenever days are difficult
I'm out on my own
Driving an '86 Jetta
Hoping that I could do better
But my car keeps me humble
In the concrete jungle
Despite the wear and tear
It seems to always get me there

Rebuilt the motor because
She decided to blow
And what do you know 
Someone stole my stereo, when it's
Time to go I put my foot on the floor
Let the diesel do the work
I ain't complaining no more
Highways and straightaways
Off roads and open roads
No matter what we will

And life treats you good
It's not what's on the outside 
It's what's under the hood

It's like you drive what you got
Discipline you can win
Just let the tire spin
And begin
The journey of life with each ride
Can you help me at the side 
On what we want to ride
Sometimes we can live
With the back up plan
And in with the program
Who I am, Doesn't reflect material
My vehicle approaches

They ain't never healed the sick, they ain't never raised the dead
They ain't fed five thousand with two fish and five loaves of bread

Why don't y'all un-lead, gas up, burn?

I'm so guilty (Open the door!)
And God might let it go (Open the door!)
But I'll never forgive me (Jason!)
Why not? (I care, I care about you)
The Army never trained me to care
You don't know the horror of living in a war zone
Then coming back to civilian affairs
I made my bed, the tables were set
My wife moved out, I don't see my kids
Everything that gave me meaning is gone
The grief stays seeded and bleeds to the bone
I want out!

Suicide, suicide, suicide
Got one in the chamber
It's waitin' to take you right out tonight
Don't roll the dice, roll the dice, roll the dice
It's all on the table, it's all for the takin'
But what's the odds?

I ain't have a word, not a story not a verse
But the silence, I'm trying not to make this worse
I pray and I googled a search
Nothing from school that will work
But I grew up in the church, so what do I do?
Just fell to my knees and I started to blurt
I don't understand this, I don't understand this
But you been looking to the weed and them dancers
Don't be conned by the Ye
Nobody in the West got the answers
Let's get established, your life isn't yours to demand it
You can't do what you please
Jason, I love you, but the next step is God homie
You ain't escaping a thing
You know Jesus he wanted to die in that garden
Acquainted to man up his sorrows
But he kept up the fight
'Cause he knew joy, it was coming tomorrow
You haven't squeezed that revolver
'Cause you know that there's hope at the end of the tunnel
Embrace it, don't matter how faint it
God is not silent, please hear what he's

Jason!
911 what's your emergency?
Yes, uh I-I gotta friend, and uh, he's locked himself in the bathroom
And I just heard a gun go off and I don't know
Okay, calm down sir, are you able to get inside the room?
Yeah, he, he's got me locked out (I see you)
Okay, can you try to get inside the room? (I hear you)
Hold on, I'mma try to
Sir? (Oh, who's calling you?)

Okay, he's, he's not shot, he dropped the gun but he's passed out (I see you, I hear you)

Won't break, I will not fold
Cancel my tour, not my soul
I'll go blindfold in and out of time zones
I'm in my zone, put it up in your iPhone
Leaving your mind blown, looking for his arrival
I can see Him ridin' down all of them white halls
Looking like O.J. in a bronco
And I'm learning when I've flown
Flights make my respect just stronger
The higher that I go in grace, everything below is smaller
I'mma steward this well
He holds my airways, I breathe with a heavy flow
Forevermore, yes I'm willing and able
Like I'm sittin' in an exit row
I gotta make an exit though
What will they remember though?
How I was born, how 'bout my metaphors?
Standin' in truth and I was serving strong
Bring it, they can throw violence
I'm in the back grinnin' like Joe Biden
He rose the ocean, Poseidon
To be frank, no ocean I won't dive in

Me and KB-J in the back y'all when I get back
Then we back to the back car, when I’m back to the start
Hold up, I remember
That empty fridge apartment with no power in it
Still to God, we will turn power steering
Your money’s too cheap to fund my joy
We had that work you can’t employ
I roll in

We had that work you can’t employ

Boy we got treasure, we’ll be rich forever
Look they can have it all
Let that money fall
But when it’s all said and done
We’ll still be countin' (We’ll still be countin')

Aye, I know a girl down on Wall Street, climbing to the top
She said Christ came and broke her
You know he a beast with the stocks
When you still making knots
And you’re not gonna flaunt
How they not gonna not
But she don’t care about what they’re about, she coulda got a yacht
But she stay giving her money to the mission on the block
Now that’s amazing!
Gave His life, so we gave up ours, Daylight savings
Silver and Gold
It’s good so we tried to make it
Since our treasure’s in heaven
We cheerfully gave it
No envy, that’s Vegas
Content G, with out savings
We got everything in our Savior
And the New Earth is waiting
We just children raising our babies
Tryna win the city, Chicago
Better get what I'm on
You are not what you bring home
Be rich in good works
'Cause that’s what you bring home
In the face of heaven’s gates
Mr. Gates estate's debase and break the paper plates
I'm down, talk about this offer
Till we got a bigger house but the same sized coffin
People at the top feeling like they at the bottom
And that’s probably why the rich are more likely suicidal
Silver and gold’s too low for the soul
They want a Jesus piece when he died for the whole
What is this love and mercy, grace, forgiveness?
We'll be in eternity still counting our riches

We had that work you can’t employ
We roll in
We had that work
Boy we got treasure, we’ll be rich forever
Look they can have it all
Let that money fall

Yes it all goes on
And it all goes on
In America
In America

In the streets of America
Back in the summer of '85
I met a young girl, her heart was in flames
Jenny bowen was her name
She was a California girl
War had changed her whole world
Her daddy died in Vietnam
She lost her husband in Lebanon
She was drivin' back to Washington
To get a medal for the job they'd done
From the president of the united fuckin' states of America

And she saw hungry people in the streets
Young mothers who could not eat
Oh i remember American dreams
We've all talked of American dreams

And it all goes on
Yes the dreams go on
And it all goes on
In America
In America
In America
In America

Something's happening in America
Can you feel it? can you feel it comin'?
It's like the green party in Germany
Young people with visions and dreams
In Nicaragua n' Chile, Poland and South Africa
Freedom brewing, it's an uphill dream

Don't be afraid of anything
Don't be afraid of anyone

Young men are dreaming and
Young girls believing
And asking questions like

Where are the frontiers?
How do i get there?
There are no maps, there are no roads
Just you and me on these streets of gold

And it all goes on
Yes it all goes on
And it all goes on
And on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on
Streets of America
Streets of America go on",America,2014

By telling me that you don't care
Or you don't want to be around
No I can't go for that, no way, oh
No, I'm not a fool
Tell me what you want
'Cause I don't understand what to do

I don't know what to do
Thinking about you girl
And it's driving me crazy
Wondering if you care
So please won't you tell me	
What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do
With my love

Now if you look inside of my heart
Then you will see there is pain
Now I would do anything that you want me to do
Just say you love me, oh

You need a man who can work it out
(Girl I love you so)
And I feel that I can love you without a doubt

Stop trying to run game
Ain't nothing new
It's all the same
Fornicating in vain

Blinded by fame, forgetting names
Seems strange, I feel it seems
I'm snitchin' or lies
When it rains it pours

Don't be jealous 'cause I'm fly
Throwing fits but I fit scripts like transfer film

Sippin' on Dom, chill

In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids

No football hero or smooth Don Juan

KC & the Sunshine Band,"It's The Same Old Song
The Supremes
(Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Edward Holland, Jr.) 

You're sweet as a honey bee
But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

A sentimental fool am I
to hear a old love song
And want to cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch my heart
Saying together forever
Breaking up never

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

Precious memories keep a lingering on
Everytime I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce
The happiness we spent
We used to dance on the music
Make romance through the music

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

KC Rebell,"Anhörung des angeklagten Hüseyin Köksecen.
Sie verzichten auf einen Anwalt und vertreten sich selber.
Nun, Sie haben das Recht zu schweigen.
Alles was Sie sagen, kann und wird vor Gericht gegen sie verwendet werden.
Möchten Sie aussagen?

Ich sage aus!

Wir haben einige Anklagepunkte
Und Tatvorwürfe, zu denen ich sie gerne befragen würde.

Zu viele Körperverletzungsdelikte, zu geringe Hemmschwelle.

Da wo ich herkomme, nennen wir das Respektschelle
Zu viele Pisser machen hier einen auf Babo
Ziehen einen Gramm Koks und fühlen sich wie Rambo
Sie lernten nichts von Respekt in ihrem Leben
Ich gehe allem aus dem weg, doch schau nicht weg wenn ich es seh'
Ich hab wirklich kein Interesse, doch leistest du kein Widerstand
Verwechseln diese Menschen Höflichkeit mit schwäche

Zu Ihren vorstrafen gehört auch schwerer Raub

Was man nicht macht in der Jugend wenn man Knete braucht
Und obendrein fehlte die Anerkennung in der Drecksgegend
Aber andern Menschen ihr Brot wegnehmen ist beschämend
Ich war ein Haufen Scheiße, heute begreif' ich's
Als mein Vater zu mir meinte, mit dem alter kommt die Reife

Ihr Umfeld ist gefährlich, die Gesichter kennt man

Ja, das sind Gangster, auch Sie könn' das nicht ändern
Die sind nicht wie Sie, ihr Leben ist verdammt schwer
Trotzdem sollte man nicht alle über einen Kamm scheren

Man sagt Sie seien schwulenfeindlich, es wird so geredet.

Ich nehm' kein Hintereingang, wenn es auch von vorne geht
Ist mir egal, sollen sie's machen wie sie meinen
Aber Reb-Rebell ist 100 Prozent Schwanz, in die Scheide

Äußern Sie sich bitte zu der Frauenfeindlichkeit.

Ich bin dominant, aber frauenfeindlich, nein!
Das Problem ist, Mann und Frau spielen heutzutage Rollentausch
Zu viele Männer haben an Frauen ihren stolz verkauft
Das macht kein Sinn, das ist Dreck und ist Gelaber
Zum Beispiel ist nichts so groß wie der Respekt vor meiner Mama
Ihr Wort ist mein Gesetz, ihr Lächeln ist mein Sieg
Ihr Leben heißt Frieden, ihre tränen heißen Krieg

Stimmt das, man sagt Sie vergiften die Jugend?

Klischee, ich nehm' lediglich den Stift und ich blute
Ich fress' es in mich rein, diese Krisen in mein Bauch
Ich öffne nur per Mukke mein Ventil und lass es raus
Sie lieben mich und denken, dieser Typ ist so wie wir

Anscheinend können sich die Kids mit ihnen identifizieren.

Ja richtig, eure Kinder kacken auf ihr Abi
Zeigen nur auf mich und sagen „das ist unser Abi!“
Sie hören nur auf mich und hören nicht auf euch
Sie schreien Reb-Rebell, als wär' es Hitlerdeutsch

Und das finden Sie gut? Was ist daran lobenswert?

Warum nicht? Ich bin kein krimineller Drogenkerl
Und auch kein Junkie so wie Sido, der sie fehl-leitet
Nur ab und zu wütend, denn auch mir geht's scheiße
Ich hab auch Probleme, ich hab' auch Familie
Meine Ex ist 'ne Fotze, ich hab' auch mal Krisen

Und warum tun sie Rapper namentlich zu Brei machen?

Sorry, doch die andern Rapper machen es mir einfach
Leben in 'ner Kleinstadt, erzählen was von Ghettos
Reden respektlos, ihr Leben sei gesetzlos
Alles monoton, reden so ein Straßendeutsch

Das stimmt und was war mit dem Moneyboy?

Hä was ich mit Moneyboy tat, ist was wo Meinungen sich scheiden
Doch auf irgendeine Weise war die Scheiße meiner Meinung
Peinlichkeit in Form von Millionen von Klicks
Für kurzen Augenblick war meine Vision so gefickt
Ich fühlte mich im Namen von Rap so beleidigt
Musste den Leuten zeigen, dieser Dreck ist so peinlich
Mein Song schickte ihn back an sein Hobbymic
Das hier ist Rap, auf dem Stempel ist ein Copyright

In Wien haben Sie gestichelt, haben da was erzählt.

Ja, ich war auf der Bühne und schrie, Raf Camora lebt!

Sie sind anti-alles und schwimmen gegen das System an.

Ich sterbe, doch verkaufe meine Seele nicht dem Sheytan
Widerstand, lieber blut' ich jeden Tag
Anstatt 'ne Marionette zu sein und tun was man mir sagt
Ich leugne mich nicht selber, das wär' ehrenlos
Ich bin Rebell, ich bin der Gegenpol
Und wenn ich ab morgen keine Platte mehr verkaufe, ist das schade
Doch kann vor meinem Spiegelbild behaupten, ich war grade!

Protokoll beendet, Sie als Bürger haben Rechte
Und genauso haben Sie auch ihre grenzen und Gesetze
Die sollten Sie lieber respektieren und auch schätzen
Das war's soweit es sei denn Sie wollen irgendwas ergänzen
Möchten Sie eventuell noch irgendwas berichten?

Ja! fick den Richter, nur Gott kann mich richten!",Anhörung,2013

KC Rebell,"Ich weiß nicht, was ich will, vielleicht will ich dich auch nicht
Weil du ein Alptraum und zugleich ein Traum bist
Endlich ist es raus, diese Worte tun gut
Ich bin unentschlossen, du geschlossenes Buch
Entweder bist du die große Liebe meines Lebens
Oder das Ungeziefer meiner Seele
Entweder gehört nur dir mein Herz bis auf ewig
Oder du plus ich gleich Schmerz als Ergebnis
Ich denke, ich kenne nur deine Fassade
Das was wir haben ist nicht das Wahre
Ich weiß nicht, wird aus einer uns beide?
Ich kann mich einfach nicht entscheiden

Es tut mir leid, ich bin mir nicht sicher
Vielleicht heiraten wir, kriegen dann Kinder
Es tut mir leid, ich bin mir nicht sicher, vielleicht
Lassen wir es und sehen uns danach nie wieder und ich sag

Ich bin nicht Schuld, dazu gehören zwei
Ich nehm's in Kauf, aber nicht um jeden Preis

Warum kann ich mich nicht mehr entscheiden?
Vielleicht steht die Antwort zwischen den Zeilen
Sind wir wirklich füreinander geschaffen
Oder fühlen wir uns nur von keinem Verstanden?
Haben all die Zeichen, dass ich mir nicht sicher bin
Vielleicht zu sagen, dass diese Beziehung einfach nix mehr bringt
Oder soll das heißen, wir müssen mir 'ner Geh-

Pausenlos schrieb ich meine Zeilen auf dem Pausenhof
Wusste eines Tages werde ich einmal da draußen groß
Und die Lehrer sagten stetig
Du endest als Verbrecher hinterm Käfig, Rapper wirst du eh nicht
Lächelten nur hämisch. Keiner von ihn' glaubte dran
Ich auch nicht, doch war in meinem Traum gefangen
Früher wollte ich um jeden Preis Auto fahren
Ich dachte wirklich Freiheit wär' Autobahn
Ich musste betteln um ins Studio zu gehen
Hatte nur noch Rap im Kopf, konnte die Schule nicht mehr sehen
Mich hat nichts interessiert, ich war fest fokussiert
Ich fing an Rap zu studieren um Stress zu ignorieren
Und langsam fingen mich an die Hater zu lieben
Und auf meine Songs zu ejakulieren
Ich musste Gas geben ums ans Ziel zu schaffen
Niemals unterkriegen lassen, guck wie es bei mir war

Erst hassten sie, danach liebten sie
Viele meckerten rum seit ich anfing dieses Spiel zu spielen
Ich habe sie von meiner Mucke überzeugt und das ohne Major
Nun seh' ich nur noch Fans, guck ich brauche neue Hater
Oh aio aio aio, aio aio aio
Die alten sind Fans, ich brauche neue Hater

Prototyp, Photoshoot, Promomove
Mein Leben zieht an mir vorbei, Turboboost
Videodreh, Jetset, Turbos
Hotel Check-Ins rund um den Globus
Früher gab es für das rappen keine Pennys
Heute sag ich „Farid, komm wir jetten nach Miami“
ICE First Class, denn Autobahn ist Knast
Oder ich nehme den Flieger, denn ich brauche meinen Platz
Ab ins Studio, Joshi produziert
Ich bringe meine Zeilen aus dem Kopf auf das Papier
Danach rapp' ich meine Zeilen ein und checke dann wie gut das klingt
Wenn ich meine Mucke hör, bin ich wie jemand der sich Mut antrinkt
Wieder fangen mich an die Hater zu lieben
Und auf meine Songs zu ejakulieren
Während ich auf der Stage meine Konzerte oben gebe
Seh' ich andere Menschen von Konservendosen leben
Doch von nichts kommt nichts. Nichts kommt von allein
Hits, Songs und Punchlines. Hip Hop ist Krankheit
Ich musste Gas geben ums ans Ziel zu schaffen

Und du siehst mein Drama.
Es tut mir leid Mutter, es tut mir leid Baba
Wie viele Schanden hab ich schon über dein Haup gebracht.
Hab auf euch nie aufgepasst und hing' immer draußen ab.
Ich schäme mich so sehr, mir tut so viel leid.
Jede Träne, jeder Brief von der Polizei,
Ich schmiss die Schule hin und wurde kriminell,
Ich brauch gar nicht zu erwähnen was ein Kurde davon hält.
Was ich nicht alles auf der Straße so gedreht habe,
Es tut mir leid für jeden Tag in der PG Mama.
Tut mir leid auch wenn ihr heute nicht mehr böse seid,
Eines Tages bau ich euch dafür ein Königreich.
ÖNal tut mir leid, du bist der beste Mensch, es sind nur wir zwei
Gegen den Rest der Welt !
Kann sein, dass du dich nicht erinnerst jetzt,
Ich wollte so oft nicht hören, doch am Ende hast du immer Recht 
Heute weiß ich, dass du für mich nur das Beste willst,
Es tut mir leid, denn mein Leben war ein Actionfilm.
Ich würd' für jeden von euch mein letztes Blut lassen,
Denn alles was ich heute will ist Wiedergutmachung 

Es tut mir leid für jedes meiner Taten, für die Fehler, die ich tat
Und die Seele voller Narben, ich bereu' nichts 
Gestern war gestern, aber hätte ich die Wahl würd' ich es ändern.
Es tut mir leid, ich lass mir nichts mehr zu Schulden kommen,
Es tut mir leid, das ist die Entschuldigung.
Ich will abhacken und wieder Fuß fassen,
Alles was ich heute will ist Wiedergutmachung 

Es tut mir leid, mein Schatz, ich hab dich sehr geliebt,
Ich musste so lange warten, bis dieser Schmerz verzieht,
Ich wollte, dass du's einsiehst und deinen Weg gehst,
Doch an manchen Tagen tut es noch extrem Weh 
Was ich wollte war der Frieden für uns zwei,
Doch beim besten Willen Schatz, ich kann dir nie wieder verzeihen.
Es tut mir leid, doch ich bereu es kein Meter.
Es tut mir leid, ich war zu Stolz für deine Fehler,
Ich hab einmal geliebt, war seit dem kein mal verliebt.
Ich hab geschworen ich heirate nie.
Tut mir leid, canim, tut mir leid ich bin zu hart im Kopf.
Es tut mir leid, dass dieser Junge von der Straße kommt.
Wir wissen beide, dass nicht jeder alles richtig macht,
Bruder tut mir leid ich habe öfter nur an mich gedacht
Hab mir meine Welt gebaut, denn ich hatte selbst ein Traum,
Aber ruf mich an, egal wie viel Geld du brauchst.
Ich bin dein Rücken, glaub mir ich bin hinter dir,
Keiner meiner Brüder soll nur eine Nacht im Winter frieren.
Ich bin hier und würde das niemals zulassen,

In den eigenen Reihen sind die meisten deiner Feinde
(Gestern noch warst du meine beste Freundin
Heute weiß ich, dass nicht alles, was glänzt, auch Gold ist)

Ich hab früh gemerkt, dass man nicht jedem Menschen trauen kann
Freunde werden Feinde und entpuppen sich als V-Mann
Menschen, die dir was bedeuten, kehren dir den Rücken
Und versuchen, dein Leben lediglich zu ficken
Bruder, du musst aufpassen, wem du deine Hand gibst
Achte drauf, wer in die Augen schaut und wer dich anschielt
Vertrau bitte nie auf das Lächeln des Gegenübers
Ich kenne zu viele Lügner, die Messer ziehen auf die Brüder
Falsche Brüder lassen dich allein auf deinen Wegen
Doch wahre Freunde leiden mit und weinen deine Tränen
Bei all den guten Zeiten hast du 100 an der Seite
Doch sollt es dir mal schlecht gehen, hungerst du alleine
Hast du was erreicht, siehst du den Neid dieser Wesen
Sie legen Feuer und reden dich klein bei dem Nächsten
Ich red von falschen Brüdern, sie kennen den Respekt nicht
Das Lachen dieser Menschen wird zum Lästern, wenn du weg bist

Auf Partys zusammen auf Puff Daddy tanzen
Mit Sky Wodka Flaschen und Hazeys zum Paffen
Gegenseitig uns're Namen tätowieren
Durch die Welt reisen und dann mit Geld schmeißen
Mit mir auf Tour gehen, im Studio chillen
Dann hab ich 3 Fragen, die deine Illusion killen
Frage 1, sag mir, wirst du mich nie verraten?
Auch wenn du sonst in den Knast musst für viele Jahre?
Frage 2, was ist, wenn ich Flus brauche?
Würdest du mich supporten und deinen Schmuck verkaufen?
Frage 3, erträgst du für Schwesta Schmerzen?
Würdest du für Schwesta schießen, für Schwesta sterben?

Wände die mich einengen, ich putze meine Kugeln. 
Ich suche Zuflucht in der Kaputze von meinem Hoodie, Brudi.
Yeah, ein Alptraum ich will raus davon.
Ich lauf davon. Hautfarbe: Grau, Beton. 
Wir werden groß geredet, aber klein gehalten. 
Umgeben von 'ner Menschenmasse fühlen wir uns allein gelassen.
Was für 'ne Welt. Man fragt nicht man nimmt. 
Man zahlt nicht, man klaut. Man redet nicht, man schlägt. 
Für's Leben viel zu spät, doch für's Sterben zu früh.
Ich bin Gefühlskrank, mein Herz ist ein Kühlschrank.

Street-Phobie, weil die kriminelle Energie nie verzieht.
In dieser Grauzone negativ gefangen, Bruder. 
Jeden Tag erneut wenn dir dein Leben aus der Hand rudert. 
Wir schieben Krisen, 24 Stunden, 7 ohne Liebe, 
Weil die Tiefe des Krieges zuviel Intrigen bietet.
Jeder zweite lebt hier auf THC, B-Block-Giro, 
Gib dir dieses Kopfkino und du hängst am EKG.

Du wirst wach in der Nacht, schweißgebadet und Nass. (Okay)
Halte die Augen offen, deine Feinde sind hier weit verbreitet. 
Keine Zweifel, dass sich dieser Neid verbreitet

Ohne Beat, gar nichts oder was? Ja, einfach mal anfang'. 
Ja, gut, dann rapp' ich einfach und
lad du dir die, eh, Instrumental rein. 
Und, eh, Dann, 
Dann spiel einfach was dazu die ganze Zeit. 
Okay, machen ma' so. Ehem, yeah, okay.

Okay, los geht's, scheiß drauf, ich lasse den Wörtern freien lauf
Ich picke kein' Beat
Denn während ich gerade rappe, kann Juh-Dee ein' bauen
Fangen wir mal an, zuerst kommt der Satz
Den ich in meinem Kopf kreier', danach folgt der Bass
Genau der Juh-Dee, Brudi, der Bass ist okay
Genau den will ich, so muss er sein, lass ihn so stehen
Das ist was anderes, mein Freund, kein Ghetto-Lied
Was wir jetzt brauchen, ist noch irgendeine Melodie
Spiel was ein, ja, Mann, der Sinthy kommt gerade so super
Ich fühle mich auf diesem Beat, als hätte ich gerade die Nase gepudert
Wo ist die Kick? Genau, ja, ich will, dass sie sitzt
Bombe, und jetzt die Snare, Brudi, ohne geht nix
Juh-Dee, lass uns durchdrehen, mach mir 'n Bombenbeat
Ich zeige den Leuten heute die Bedeutung von dem Wort ""produktiv""
Dieses Ding wär auf eurem Album ein Hit-Movie
Aber auf meinem Album ist es nur ein Skit, Brudi
Gib mir die Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, weiter so
Ich kicke parallel meinen 1A-Flow
Die Stimme ist fresh und die Rhymes sind dope
Battlerap und kein G im Ghetto, ich könnte dich übertrieben wegflowen
Komm schon, gib mir die Dupstep-Elemente rein in diesen Beat und let's go
Locke der Boss, poppe dein' Kopf, komm in dein' Block
Boxe dich Schrott, zerleg' kein Wort, lauf lieber fort, ab in dein Dorf
Ich bin enorm, heut voller Zorn, komme hervor
Gebe dir Missgeburt heute noch Folter und Mord

KC Rebell,"Weißt du noch, unser aller erstes Treffen?
Ich erinnere mich so gut an dein zuckersüßes Lächeln
Von dem Moment an wollte ich immer nur noch bei dir sein,
Ich war so eifersüchtig, bei jeder Kleinigkeit
Ich erinnere mich, an die alten Tage Babe,
Ich habe in jedem Typen, eine Gefahr gesehen
Ich hatte Angst vor einer Zeit in der du nicht mehr da bist,
Heute bist du nicht mehr da, es treibt mich in den Wahnsinn
Weißt du noch, als ich zum ersten mal deine Hand nahm?
Und dir sagte, „du brauchst von nichts und niemanden Angst haben?“
Weißt du, dass ich wusste, das du dich da sicher fühlst,
Ich kann es dir nicht mal erklären, ich habe es gespürt
Weißt du noch? unser aller erster Streit?
Ich fing' an zu schreien und du hast sofort geweint
Mein Engel, dein Blick war mit Schmerzen verziert,
Als ich mich umdrehte und ging tat es mir mehr weh als dir 

Mein Engel, ich trage Risse in meinem Herz 
ich vermisse dich so sehr
Es tut mir so leid
Ich will die Zeit zurück drehen, bis zum letzten Tag, 
denn Heute weiß ich das, die Zeit mit dir die beste war
Zurück drehen, und so vieles ungeschehen machen,
Ich würde dich nie wieder gehen lassen 
Ich will die Zeit wieder zurück drehen 
Ich will die Zeit wieder zurück drehen 
Und nur ein Teil von meinem Glück sehen

Weißt du noch, meine aller erste Rose?
Unser aller erstes Foto, und die aller erste Pose?
Ich machte dir Geschenke, Ich wollte dich glücklich sehen
Du meintest „Schatz, ich würd' mit unter der Brücke leben“
Ab dem Moment wusste ich genau das du das Wahre bist,
Du warst mein Sonnenschein, du warst mein Tageslicht
Du kamst nicht klar auf die ganzen Weiber die mir schrieben,
Ich meinte hab vertrauen denn du weißt das ich dich liebe 
Weißt du noch, unser aller erstes Date?
Du bist gegangen, denn ich kam 5 Minuten zu spät
Du wolltest das ich dein Wert schätze, dich für Voll nehme,
Was du nicht weißt, du warst von Anfang an mein Goldmädchen
Weißt du noch, unser aller erster Kuss?
Ich spürte deinen Herzschlag, tief aus deiner Brust !
Und, weisst du noch? Unsere aller erste Trennung ?
Aus Sturheit und Stolz ,Wir beide wussten das geht schnell um

Mein Engel, ich trage Risse in meinem Herz 
ich vermisse dich so sehr
Es tut mir so leid
Ich will die Zeit zurück drehen, bis zum letzten Tag,

KC Rebell,"Ich wollte grade bleiben auf meinem Weg hier raus
Jetzt, wo ich fast am Ziel bin, merk ich, es geht nicht auf
Wenn das 'ne Prüfung ist, ich nehm's in Kauf
Ich seh wie diese Menschen Hass kriegen, nur durch den Mercedes-Sound
Mein Plan war's irgendwann hier raus zu schaffen
Jetzt wollen sie Auge machen
auf dem Weg zu 100.000 Platten
Zehn Millionen Klicks und die Probleme beginnen jetzt
Ignorieren ist der Weg, raus aus diesem Spinnennetz
Es sind die eigenen Komplexe, die sie scharf machen
So, als hätt' ich Mord begang', Erfolg war meine Tatwaffe
Gnadenlos, allesamt nur schadenfroh
Doch stehen diese Menschen ganz alleine vor mir war das alles gar nicht so
Ich behalte den Fokus und lass mich nicht mehr bremsen
Die Macht in meinen Händen, in der Stadt eine Legende
Rebell solang ich kämpfe
auch wenn sie mich zutiefst hassen
Wollt es nur ans Ziel schaffen und meine Musik machen
Jetzt wollen sie glücklich werden durch meine Vernichtung
Verhasst in jede Richtung, geblendet von der Missgunst
Schreibe mit Feuer und hab deshalb an der Hand Verbrennung'
Redet was ihr wollt, euer Neid ist meine Anerkennung

Wenn ihr mich kämpfen seht, betet, dass ich falle
Und wenn ich bis zum Ende steh, betet, dass ich falle
Rebellizzy Nummer Eins, betet, dass ich falle
Für euch bleib ich unerreicht, betet, dass ich falle

Mit jedem Kippenzug denke ich an alte Träume
Jede Glut, die ich wegasche, sind falsche Freunde
Yeah, ich mach mich frei auf meinem Weg
Und entferne mich von jeglicher Negativität

Riech den Neid in der Luft, dir bleibt nur noch Frust
Weil sich auf der weiten Welt kein Schwein für dich juckt
Ich bin oben angekommen und das bereit dir Druck
Doch in Wahrheit macht dich dein eigenes Leid nur kaputt, Bruder
Deine Denkweise, guck, sie macht voll keinen Sinn
Du kriegst das Kotzen, wenn du hörst, dass ich erfolgreich bin
Jetzt ist es offiziell, KC ist der Überflieger
Je höher ich komme, fällst du in deiner Psyche tiefer
Seitdem ich auf der Zwei war, seh ich so viel Neid
Ungerechtigkeit macht sich breit auf dem Weg zur Eins
Wenn Blicke töten könnten, würd' ich jetzt im Grab liegen
Sie würden gerne den Plan schmieden und scharf schießen
Sie wollen dich runterreißen, von der Karriereleiter
Wegbegleiter, die sich wünschen, dass du in dei'm Leben scheiterst
Was willst du machen, wenn sich Neid in deiner Gegend breit macht?
Ich bet für alle meine Feinde an jedem Freitag
Du bist besessen, in dein' Träumen siehst du mich verrecken
Doch ich bin Rebell, ich bin hart, ich bin nicht zu brechen
Und wenn es sein muss, schieß' ich mit der Smith & Wesson
Ich fick den Richter, weil nur Gott richtet, und das dürft ihr nicht vergessen

Wenn ihr mich kämpfen seht, betet, dass ich falle
Und wenn ich bis zum Ende steh, betet, dass ich falle
Rebellizzy Nummer Eins, betet, dass ich falle
Für euch bleib ich unerreicht, betet, dass ich falle

Mit jedem Kippenzug denke ich an alte Träume
Jede Glut, die ich wegasche, sind falsche Freunde
Yeah, ich mach mich frei auf meinem Weg
Und entferne mich von jeglicher Negativität",Auge,2014
KC Rebell,"Bist du da? Sag ein Wort, damit ich's glaube
Deine Stille wär ein Dorn in meinem Auge
An meiner Seite ist der Ort, wo ich dich brauche
Also tu mir ein' gefall'n, lauf nicht mehr fort, komm doch nach Hause
Bist du da? Dann merkst du, dass ich Wärme brauche
Kälte wäre wie barfuß über Scherben laufen
Falls du kommst, zeig mir kurz deine Nähe
Dein Rücken wäre jetzt der Sturz in die Leere
Bist du da? Gib mir ein' Funken an Achtung
Ignoranz wäre wie im Dunkeln zu tappen
Falls du kommst, bist du Licht in der Dunkelheit
Kaum bist du weg, erlischt meine Munterkeit

Schweigen wäre jetzt der Stoß von der Klippe, aber
Wenn du redest, solltest du dringend zu deinen Worten stehn'
Und solltest wissen, keiner zwingt dich wieder, fortzugehn'
Denn bist du da, dann gibt es mir Ehre
Deine Nähe ist das Gift, das ich nehme
Ohne dich ist jeder Schritt, den ich gehe, ein
Blick in das Leere, ein Stich in die Seele
Bist du da? Dann zeig es mir vom Herzen
Deine Abwesenheit wär meine Reise ins Verderben
Falls du kommst, solltest du leise sein und merken
Jedes Wort aus deinem Mund ist wie mit 'nem Stein auf mich zu werfen
Bist du da? Dann sag ich wäre Schuld dran
Jeder Satz, auch wenn er schlecht ist, nimmt Last von meinen Schultern
Falls du kommst, solltest du eigentlich so fair sein
Und alles in die Fresse sagen, damit ich weiß, dass du es ernst meinst

Ist es eigentlich schlimm, darf ich Arme wie Beine haben?
Denn wir trainieren keine Beine, du siehst meinen Brustkorb wachsen

Wir schieben Welle wie der Ozean, baller Cameron Diaz
Während du einen Schwulen am Telefon hast, so wie Domian

Von wegen du wirst niemand

Du bist niemand, man vergisst dich heut Nacht
Du bist niemand, über dich wird gelacht
Der Schmerz sticht dein Herz

Von wegen du wirst niemand
Man vergisst dich heut Nacht
Man vergisst dich heut Nacht

Wer bist du schon, du brauchst meine Lieder
Wer bist du schon, außer ein Niemand
Wer bist du schon, was hast du auf dieser Welt geleistet
Jeden scheiß Tag dieselbe Scheiße
Kopf ist gefickt kein Geld und Pleite
Du fällst so schnell und bist schwer gezeichnet
Wackelig über beide Beine
Kein Bock keine Kraft schottest dich ab
Fort von der Stadt, du kleiner Feigling
Hast große Träume und dafür hart geackert
Doch die Lehre einfach so abgebrochen
Auf dieser Welt ist keiner draußen
Zum Millionär über Nacht geworden und
Wenn einmal dein Geld nicht reicht
Versinkst du direkt in Selbstmitleid
Tu doch was wenn du selbst nichts machst
Hilft dir auf dieser Welt kein Schwein
Alter heb dein Arsch hoch, noch paar Jahre so und du lebst am Bahnhof
Du hast gechillt, dann musst alles, was du versäumt hast eben nachholen
Gib dir selber Kraft red dir Mut ein
Habe bitte keine Angst zu Versagen
Kleine Schritte du musst Handeln und Wagen und an manchen Tagen auch danke sagen
Sei rebellisch wann wehrst du dich
Hör auf zu träumen warum kämpfst du nicht
Fang bitte heute noch an mein Freund
Bevor man dich auf dieser Welt vergisst

So grau wie das Klima, deine Aussicht fällt tiefer
Wer bist du schon, außer ein Niemand, ich weiß es nicht
Jeden Tag fällst du aus deinem Gleichgewicht
Bitte schweige nicht denn so reißt du nichts
Du bist immer nur auf der Suche nach Feinden
Gepeinigt vom Neid einsam allein
Immer reif für den Feind, bitte bleib nicht dabei
So erreichst du ein scheiß junge zeig mir Geist
Ich will Stärke sehen weil dir die Werte fehlen
Das kommt mir so vor als wäre dein Herz gelähmt
Bruder schwer zu verstehen
Doch um etwas zu sein musst du Schmerzen erleben, Berge bewegen
Wird Zeit deinen Arsch hochzuheben
Träumst du auch von Millionbeträgen
Auf dieser Welt ist alles möglich, aber bitte hör auf nur groß zu reden
Du hängst mit den Jungs und machst draußen auf Per
Aber ich chill am Strand mit ner Aussicht aufs Meer
Glaub mir du kannst auch etwas werden
Bleib stramm jag deinen Traum hinterher
Auch wenn dich alte Tage einholen
Leg dein IPhone mal kurz beiseite bro
Psyco alle schlagen ihre Zeit tot
Aber für dich geht jetzt die Reise los
Sei rebellisch wann wehrst du dich
Hör auf zu Träumen warum kämpfst du nicht

Sähen alle aus wie ich, dann wäre Photoshop pleite

Das tut mir wirklich Leid für dich
Ich habe grade keinen Grund zu lieben
Denn der Schnee ist geschmolzen, ich erkenn dein Gesicht
Zwischen dir und mir gibt es ein paar Unterschiede
Keine Kompatibilität mit deinem zweiten Ich
Du willst mir ständig meinen Mund verbieten
Ich fühl mich wie in lebenslanger Schweigepflicht

Irgendwie hab ich die Vermutung, du willst nicht mehr
Dann geh doch, kein Bock auf dieses Hin und Her
Du weißt nicht, ob du lieben oder hassen sollst
Und bist der Ansicht, dass du's lieber lassen sollst

Hoffentlich komme ich hier lebend raus
Ich glaub, du hältst dich für was Besseres
Du zählst mir ständig meine Fehler auf
Mein Kopf platzt, weil du nur am Meckern bist
Du hast 'ne Schraube locker, du bist eh gestört
Deine Argumentation ist so lächerlich
Du solltest dich mal selber reden hör'n

Du versuchst mit deiner Art und deinen Wörtern
Mich manipulativ reinzuwaschen
Das Ziel von jedem Wort, was du sagst
Ist mich indirekt bei allem kleinzumachen
Ich glaub, jetzt ist die Zeit gekommen,
Um Stopp zu drücken und einmal Halt zu machen
Zurückzublicken, gut nachzudenken,
Und gegebenenfalls hier alles sein zu lassen
Oh, was passiert hier? Am Anfang war der Streit so klein
Mittlerweile keine Kleinigkeiten mehr,
Weitaus mehr als keine Reibereien
Ja am Anfang sind die Menschen blind und reden groß
Ja und wie, kein Jahr verfliegt
Und der Partner bildet auf einmal den Gegenpol
Anstatt zu reden, den Kampf annehmen,
Den ander'n seh'n und sich anzupassen
Scheinen wir uns damit abzufinden,
Nicht sonderlich super zusamm'nzupassen
Es macht alles keinen Sinn mehr,
Bitte versteh's doch, ich seh's doch
Habe dich aufgefordert zu geh'n,
Aber du stehst noch, bitte geh doch

Schwarzer Anzug, Lackschuhe, Tennissocken
Auf der Bühne Stehen und einfach in die Menge Rotzen
Mit Veganern ins Steakhaus geh'n
Händchen halten mit Groupies, die nach AIDS aussehen
Auf der Verlobung deiner Ex besoffen unterwegs
Und sie unauffällig Fragen, was am Wochenende geht
Ey, mein nächstes Album einfach „Detox“ nennen
Den Mund voller Essen haben und Beatboxen
Mal eine Cheesy ohne Käse bestellen
Dir ins Ohr Flüstern, dass mir dein Mädel gefällt
High Five sagen und direkt danach die Hand senken
Kool Savas zum Geburtstag einen Kamm schenken
Bei schönem Wetter einfach draußen Kacken
Mesut Özil bitten, er solle kein Auge machen
Geld Scheffeln, aber Second Hand tragen
Bei der Krankengymnastik nach Happy End Fragen

Wer sagt, das Leben wäre einfach?
Viel zu viele Pläne sind gescheitert
Scheißegal, ich gehe immer weiter
Augen zu und benehmen wie ein Hayvan

Oh oh
Oh oh

Bei DSDS schreien „Drecks Dieter Bohlen“
Auf der Autobahn links Blinken, rechts Überholen
'Ne Flasche Gin Trinken, gegen den Wind pinkeln
Auch mal ein Witz Bringen über Sillas Blickwinkel
Einmal nein Sagen können zu den Eltern
Auto ohne Lappen und Motorrad ohne Helm Fahren
Ferris MC sagen, er wär schön
Bei Todesstille Furzen, in der Badewanne Fön'
Schlampen taufen, an der Tanke rauchen
Maskiert und bewaffnet in die Bank zu laufen
Nutten Schlagen, einmal Rucksack tragen
Den Löffel Wegschmeißen und die Suppe Gabeln
Besoffen einen Joint Kiffen
Und dann die Freundin von 'nem Freund Ficken
Und vielleicht sogar den Freund Ficken
Schwören und die Finger dabei Kreuzen

Ich steh auf, ich geh raus
Heute hab ich Power für mindestens zehn Frauen
Yeah, heute wird gefickt in meinem Benz, in meinem
Batmobil, ich nutz den Rücksitz als Bett
Yeah, ich ficke deine Frau
Sie nimmt ihn in den Mund und massiert hart
Lutscht und kassiert Bar
Die dreckige kleine Fotze kriegt Stellungsbefehle
Als hätte sie was verbrochen
(Gettin' head in a bed with another man's wife)
Hut ab, denn sie is' ne treue Seele
Für mich macht sie die Beine breit wie beim Kreuzheben
Bruder glaub es, ich bin unglaublich
Ich ficke alles, was bei drei nicht auf dem Baum ist
Eins, zwei, drei und ich nehm' alles mit was geht

Ich war der Typ, der mit elf die besten Pornos schon bekommen hat
Also kam ich mir in Sexkunde vor wie Doktor Sommer

Raprebell gibt ihr deep rein wie Lexington Steel
Ich spann sie dir aus und starte die Fiesta
Und sie gibt dir den Laufpass wie dieser Iniesta
Ha! Ja, sie möchte blasen beim Rapboss
Und wirft sich dafür in Schale wie Kellogg's
Sie redet von Emanzipation, is klar
Ihre Fotze zähl ich zu meinen engsten wie den Tod
(Gettin' head in a bed with another man's wife)
Sie will bös' meinen Schwanz nuckeln
Klöten und Sack lutschen und
Schön vögeln als krönenden Abschluss, Punkt
Am Anfang noch war ihr Loch so klein
Aber mein Schwanz macht wie Anabol Fotzen breit
Sie will noch mehr Sex, auf dem Trockner Sex
Sie ist scharf aufm Tisch wie beim Opferfest
Sie scheißt auf Kondome, will mein Schwanz lose
Ich mach es wie die Joghurtmarke dann ohne

Ich hab's gehört heut ist dein Hochzeitstag
Dein Neuer tut mir jetzt schon Leid
Dass das so schnell nach mir kam lässt mich kalt
Mir geht's tip top 1a und Klasse
Dein Macker soll ein Spießer sein, scheint ja zu passen
Ich würd's gern sehen nur noch einmal deine Fresse jetzt
Wenn ich dir sage du kannst bleiben wo der Pfeffer wächst
Ich schaute oft genug weg bei deinen Fehlern
Doch du fingst an mir jeden Tag Dreck zu erzählen
Hattest Streit mit mir, doch musstest mit deinem Ex drüber reden
Wenn ich's mir recht überlege musst ich mich echt übergeben
Du bist ein Eisbrocken, Unmensch, ein heftiges Wesen
Ich mach alles für dich und trotzdem lässt du mich stehen
Verpiss' dich, das Maß ist jetzt voll, ich habe genug
Ich schwöre ich werd' nie wieder kommen wenn du rufst

„Hallo?“

Es tut mir Leid für gestern Schatz, ich war die ganze Nacht verwirrt
Und bei den Mailbox Nachrichten alkoholisiert
Ich bin ein Feigling, ich trau mich nur in das Diktiergerät
Egal was ich gesagt hab Schatz, ich hab für dich gelebt
Damals noch war ich ein armer kleiner Bandit
Der vieles versucht hat, aber kein Para in der Hand hielt
Für all mein Geld dank ich dir heut, Schatzi
Denn ich wollt es nur dir beweisen, mein allergrößter Antrieb
Ich liebe dich noch genau so wie am Tag eins
Manchmal erkennt man den wahren Wert im Nachhinein
Ich dachte ich bin, über dich hinweg
Und das ich eine Neue habe hat nicht gestimmt
Sorry das war eher so 'n taktisches Ding
Denn die Beziehung mit deinem neuen Macker machte mich blind
Ach ja, apropos dein Macker, lass den mal weg
Ich weiß, dass dieser Bastard meinen Platz nicht ersetzt
Und ich weiß dass ich oft Mist baute, und dir misstraute
Du mir die Wahrheit gesagt hast, aber ich nichts glaubte
So viele Fehler, doch hab Nachsicht
Deine zerkratzte Motorhaube an deinem Auto, das war ich
Ich weiß ich bin ein Depp und bei weitem nicht perfekt
Doch solange ich noch atme nimmt keiner dich mir weg
Es tut mir Leid, mein Kopf ist so gestört
Entweder du oder der Tod, weil dir mein Herzblut gehört

Du
Hast mein Herzblut
Noch immer seh' ich dich

Ein echter Gee mit Sexappeal, du triffst mich auf der Fashion Week
Vorrausgesetzt das es dort kugelsichre Westen gibt. (Players)
Und du hast keine Zukunft Fotze
Es sei denn Ärzte können deine Blutungen stoppen
B-Tight rappte früher über Mamas und Geld
Heute siehst du wie er für die Juice die Kamera hält
Farid Bang, Clubber Lang ist zu hart für dich
Ich habe nur Blümchensex wenn ich Jasmin Wagner fick
Sie wird abgefüllt und bei DSDS
Fick ich eine 17-jährige zum achtzenten
Aus dem Benz Hurensohn, eine Gang mit Niveau

Ich frage dich, he wie gehts und fick dich
Mein Babyface im Blitzlicht
Schore für die Pennas, und Koka für die Rich Kids
Du bist des öfteren auf Gras, Flex und Schore
Und lutscht jetzt an lutschfesten Latex-Kondomen
Summer, Summer feuert Schüsse aus dem Benz raus
Du suchst deinen Flow, ich die Schlüssel zu den Penthouse
Der, auf den die Chicks stehen, denn schon mit 17
Wollten alle Nutten mein Sipp sehen
Nimm sie runter deine Hände wenn du redest
Immer noch der allerflächste Kanax in der Playlist
Schöne Grüße gehen raus an meine Ex, Susi

KC Rebell,"Steh auf, das Wasser ist längst eingefroren
Draußen ist das Leben schon an dir vorbeigezogen
Die Falten deiner Ma werden immer mehr
Hoffentlich hat sie sich noch nicht dem Sterbebett genähert
Deine Taschen sind voll, doch im Herzen bist du leer
Jedes weitere Versäumnis wäre so verkehrt
Sie zerfallen Tag für Tag zu Staub, die alten Tage
Dein Vater hat mittlerweile nur noch grauweiße Haare
Du bist auf Reisen mit Freunden, denn draußen bist du frei
Aber sag mir bitte, wann bist du zu Hause mal allein?
Wann hast du das letzte Mal dein' Neffen in den Park gebracht?
Mit ihm ein' Tag verbracht, wann war das mal?
Immer lachst du, als wäre das so leicht
Wann hast du das letzte Mal unter der Bettdecke geweint?
Das Einzige, was dir noch fehlt, ist die Einsicht
Aber merk dir eins, es ist erst zu spät, wenn es vorbei ist

Your heart is broken up, ey
Several relationships, you're runnin' away
So tell me where you wanna go?
A life without hope
'Cause you are here
Swimmin' in an ocean of broken dreams
If we are here (ey)
Save you from the misery
And we sing, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Du bist down, steh auf, ich weiß, du fühlst dich unten
Draußen hat das Leben dich schon überrundet
Seitdem du 18 bist, streunst du rum und machst nur Mist
Hoffst, dass Gott dir alles vergibt, aber was, wenn nicht?
Ich glaub es dir, bei dir ist jeder Tag stressig
Aber meinst du nicht, du hast dein' Glauben zu vernachlässigt?
Dein Leben bis heute solltest du eigentlich stornier'n
Ein kleines bisschen formier'n, du hast zwei Drittel noch vor dir
Du bist erst 25, aber denkst, du bist der King
Eine Frage, wann warst du das letzte Mal ein Kind?
Du denkst, du bist ein Player mit dein' One Night Stands
Dabei fehlt dir eine Frau, die dich liebt und dich schätzt
Die loyal zu dir steht, deinen Nachnamen trägt
Wach auf, vielleicht ist es in paar Jahr'n zu spät
Und du musst so vieles im Leben noch erreichen
Merk dir eins, es ist erst zu spät, wenn es vorbei ist

Your heart is broken up, ey
Several relationships, you're runnin' away

And we sing, yeah yeah

Du hast vieles für dein Traum aufgegeben
Genau an diesem Punkt hast du aufgehört zu Leben
Du bist dir viel zu oft zu edel und zu eitel
Genau an solchen Punkten ist dein Leben doch gescheitert

KC Rebell,"Meine Kette glänzt in weis-silber
Aber was mich wirklich zufriedenstellt, ich hab kein' Schimmer
Meine Konten machen Luftsprünge
Aber meine Seele lebt sei 2 Jahren unter Brücken
Hab' Augenringe, weil ich Tagelang nur wach bin
Ich kauf' mir eine Villa, aber schlafe auf Matratzen
Bin öfter in Hotels und bin draußen
Das Geld schick' ich nach Hause
Doch bekomme meine Eltern nicht zu Augen
Jetset-Life, aber innerlich leer
Egal wie oft ich fliege, ich komme dem Himmel nicht näher
Mein nagelneuer Benz C63 AMG
Fährt 300 KM/h, aber zeigt mir nicht den Weg
Anstatt Schmetterlinge
Habe ich Steine in meinem Bauch
Ein tausend Bitches, aber keine echte Frau

Ich hasse mein Schicksal
Musik nahm mir alles was ich hatte
Und gab mir was ich nicht bekam

Wenn du denkst, dass du alles besitzt
Liegst du falsch du hast alles und nichts, nix
Auch wenn unwichtige Dinge dir so rar erschein'
Hat alles seinen wahren Preis und du bist

Jeden Tag auf's neue nur ein Verlierer
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du auch Sieger
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du Verlierer
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du auch Sieger

Meine Seele ist ein Stein mit jedem Lächeln im Gesicht
Fress' ich Tränen in mich rein, ich bin müde
Mir fehlt die Kraft, ich bin schlapp
Und der 5 Sterne Kaviar macht mich nicht satt
Mein Schuh Louboutin in creme-beige Elfenbein
Geht den Weg nicht von alleine
Und hält mich nicht auf Bein'
Die Uhr in meiner Hand, sie glänzt und ist am Scheinen
Doch verändert einen Scheiß', sie schenkt mir keine Zeit
Kurt Cobain, am besten eine Kugel setzen
Doch diese Kugel würde ebenso meine Mutter treffen
Geld stinkt, diese Scheine machen arm
Denn hast du deine Taschen voll, behandelt keiner dich normal
Bist du was, wird hinter'm Rücken dreckiges gesagt
Aber drehst du dich mal um, dann lecken sie dein' Arsch

Ich hasse mein Schicksal
Musik nahm mir alles was ich hatte
Und gab mir was ich nicht bekam

Wenn du denkst, dass du alles besitzt
Liegst du falsch du hast alles und nichts, nix
Auch wenn unwichtige Dinge dir so rar erschein'
Hat alles seinen wahren Preis und du bist

Jeden Tag auf's neue nur ein Verlierer
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du auch Sieger
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du Verlierer
Jeden Tag auf's neue bist du auch Sieger

Ich habe soviel Sonne gesehen
Doch die Wärme nie gespürt
Egal wie gern' ich das auch würd'
Ich hab' die Sterne nie berührt
Es ist die Frau, die ich nicht habe
Oder der Benz der mich 'von ablenkt
Sind das alles gute Freunde? Oder Menschen die am' Sack hängen?
Außen kalt, doch tief in mir brennt's
Ich hab Frieden mit jedem, doch Krieg mit mir selbst
Keine Zugehörigkeit, ich bin überwiegend draußen
Ich bin überall, doch fühl' mich nirgendwo zuhause
Ein vierundzwanzigstundenlanger Winter der mich plagt
Der Pulli von Versace hält mich irgendwie nicht warm

Ich hasse mein Schicksal
Musik nahm mir alles was ich hatte
Und gab mir was ich nicht bekam

Wenn du denkst, dass du alles besitzt
Liegst du falsch du hast alles und nichts, nix
Auch wenn unwichtige Dinge dir so rar erschein'

Ich hab euch so vieles zu erzählen über meine Wunden
Deshalb brennt die Stimme so wie Dynamit in meiner Lunge
Ihr seht zwar diesen Typen posen in sein' Gucci-Schuhen
Aber nur, weil er nix hatte, vielleicht ist das meine Genugtuung
Und du denkst, ich hab Fuß gefasst in der Rolle eines Superstars?
Mich selbst verwirklicht und mein Hobby zum Beruf gemacht?
Das stimmt nicht, ich hab meine heile Welt eingetauscht
Um Hype und Geld, Mamas Wolldecke gegen feinen Pelz

Ich hab euch so vieles zu erzählen über meine Wunden

Vielleicht hab´ ich dir kein Enkelkind geschenkt, Baba
Aber wie auch, wenn es in mir brennt, Baba?
Du hielst mich für einen vernünftigeren Weg bestimmt
Auf meinen Schritten ins Verderben warst du Gegenwind
Vielleicht ist das, was ich mache nicht was du wolltest
Aber heute seh´ ich deine Augen glitzern weil du stolz bist
Bin oft weg, doch du bleibst in meim´ Gedächtnis
Ich sterbe beim Gedanken, das die Zeit mit dir begrenzt ist
Du bist der Kopf und die Art wie ich so denke
Die Beine die mich tragen und die Arme die mich lenken
Ich beschütze dich vor allem, meine Schwester
Du bist mein Leib meine Seele und der Herzschlag
Ich werde immer bei dir stehen, ich bleib´ für immer
Meine Nichten und Neffen sind auch meine Kinder
Es gibt keinen der mich auf Beinen wie meine Schwester hält
Und mein Bruder, wir drei gegen den Rest der Welt
Bruder, du hast es am schwierigsten von allen
Doch trägst in dir die größte Liebe von uns allen
Ich würd´ mein Lachen eintauschen gegen dein Leid
Mein Feind ist dein Feind, und dein Feind ist mein Feind
Deinen Platz bei mir, den kann dir keiner nehmen
Ich würd´ auf Knopfdruck sterben, damit du weiterlebst
Alles Hunde, alles Strolche
Doch wir sind Ehrenmänner, wir sind zwei Wölfe
Wir wissen beide nicht, wohin der Wind uns weht
Doch werden mit uns gehen, egal wohin wir gehen
Und jetzt du, du bist das Schönste auf der Welt
Du bist meine Königin der Welt
Meine Mutter, das Blut das durch die Adern fließt
Unter deinen Füßen liegt das Paradies
Du bist das Herzstück, hast mich immer verstanden
Ich weiß, ich bin immer mit dir in Gedanken
Ich muss irgendwo ans Mic und muss live rappen
Doch weiß meine Mama weint, weil ich weit weg bin
Allah, du bist die Luft die ich atme
Du bist der einzige Schutz den ich habe
Du bist die Hoffnung für alles wenn ich Krisen schieb´
Der einzige vor dem ich niederknie´

Denn tief in sich trägt er einen Fleck, der uns nicht mag
Sie finden unsere Bauchtänzer saugeil, essen unser Essen
Aber wollen heimlich Ausländer raus! Schreien

Jedes Glück, jede Träne, jeder Stolz macht uns gleich
Jede Wut, jeder Trost, jeder Frust macht uns gleich

Vielleicht bin ich nicht wie du
Und pass' dir nicht als Moslem
Vielleicht kränkt mich deine Meinung

In' Spiegel schaut, sich selber nicht erkennt, so wie du
Vor seinen eigenen Problemen weg rennt, so wie du
Innerlich hasserfüllt brennt, so wie du
Sein wahres Potenzial so verschenkt, so wie du
Bin ich am Ende des Tages auch nur ein Mensch, so wie du

Also differenzier' nie wieder
Egal, ob schwarz, weiß, arm, reich, hart, weich, dir egal
Es ist ganz egal, welchen Mensch du zur Seite hast
Der Respekt bleibt der gleiche, Mann

Auch, wenn du dich umguckst und du Menschen siehst, die rumspinnen
Solltest du besser in deinen eigenen Problemen schwimmen

KC Rebell, a.k.a. Jason Statham
Ich komm' zum Schuss wie David Beckham

Immer diese Kahbas, hilfe ich bin am Arsch
Ich muss ein´ Dampfen, ich will ein bisschen Abstand
Endlich ist es Abend, ich gehe in die Rebell-Lounge
Und sag´ ich will den allerbesten Tabak hier im Haus

Ich will Hasso!

Backstage auf Tour, deine Olle wird gefickt
Ganz unscheinbar, wie die Sonnenfinsternis
Ich weiß, dass sie Klöten will, mit mir vögeln will
Und danach schlürfen möchte an der Löwenmilch
Denn wenn es um Ficken geht
ist dein Motto lieber widerlich
anstatt wieder nicht, widerlich
Ich bin scheiße zu Frauen und sie lieben es
Mein Ego ist das einzige was größer als mein Schniedel ist
Jeden Tag Sex, ich leide unter Trieben
Einmal pro Tag wäre leider untertrieben
Meine Quote ist so hoch, denn sogar an 'nem schlechten Tag
Fick ich D-prominente Bitches wie der Bachelor
Ah, Sonnenbrille, Gucci-Muster
Weiber treffen sich, geben Kopf und schlucken runter
Und warum ich eure Alten gefickt hab?
Weil sie KC verehren so wie alte Ägypter

Immer diese Kahbas, hilfe ich bin am Arsch
Ich muss ein´ Dampfen, ich will ein bisschen Abstand
Endlich ist es Abend, ich gehe in die Rebell-Lounge
Und sag´ ich will den allerbesten Tabak hier im Haus

Wir finden keinen Nenner, Bruder, bleib du real
Du liegst auf der faulen Haut wie´n Penner, es ist Zeit zu spielen
Und diese Nummer mit dein´ ekligen Pissstreifen
Kann ich nicht verstehen
Wie chinesische Schriftzeichen
Du brauchst nicht dauernd fragen, ich sags dir in tausend Sprachen
Du bist ein offizieler Hurensohn mit blauem Haken
Dieser Rebell ist der Liebling der Welt
Da kannst du hundert Leute fragen, Familienduell
Sie machen ein´ auf Homie, diese Abschaumrapper
Dabei kenn´ ich sie nur flüchtig so wie Knastausbrecher
Rapper schmusen zu viel, sind in Huren verliebt
KC klatscht Frauen weiter nach dem Luden-Prinzip
Erst willst du mich dissen, Cho? Danach denkst du bisschen, oh
Ich lass den besser, bevor der kocht wie Alfredissimo
Für mich als große Liebe leckst du sogar Amors Hoden
Du machst die Beine direkt breit auf meinem Marmorboden
Erstmal machst du krass auf Vernunftsmensch
Doch wenn ich deine Futt bang´, sagst du muy bien

Aber am Mic bist du eh weit unten, live bist du eh die Schwuchtel
Light wie Diät-Produkte, dein Hype ist doch eh erfunden
Dein Ding ist viel zu klein für eine Penispumpe
Du machst dick auf eins mit deiner Mädchentruppe
Du gehst heimlich ab auf KC´s Mucke
Solange dein Mund nach Scheiße und nach Käse muffelt
Mach´ mir kein´ auf Fly in deiner Kegelgruppe
Ich hab´ echte Supporter und keine Juli-Fans
Die die boxen wollen, so wie Hooligangs
Da kannst du gerne jede Straßen-Hure fragen
Ich ficke Fotzen bis sie danach Nasenbluten haben
Sie sagt, ihr Arsch wär Jungfrau
Doch wenn ich meinen Big-Cock reinhalte
Ist sie hinten offen wie ein Flip-Flop
Und sie spingt durch die Gegend, so wie Criss Cross
Weil der Big-Boss fett rappen kann, wie Rick-Ross
Ich übernehme diese Scheiße hier mit Farid Bang
Wen willst du was beweißen mit deim´ Ami-Slang?
Und du willst direkt pfeifen nach den Razzien?
Somit bist du ab sofort freiwild, wie die Nazi-Band

Und paar Chöre auf die Beats
Kommen in Texten mit mehr Schränken als die Möbelindustrie
Sie pöbeln, wollen Beef, verkörpern einen G
Verklickern ein paar Fans sie wären ein Mörder auf der Street
Der aus Nöthen heraus dealt
ihr Gehirn ist inaktiv
Kippen in das Feuer somit Öl oder Benzin
Und halten sich dann wirklich für das Größte was es gibt
Scheiß´ auf den Rest und mach´ mein eigenes Ding
Nur weil ich jetzt singe mit ein paar Flöten in mein´ Beats
Heißt das nicht, ich trage Röhrenschnitt in Jeans
Ich bleib´nur an keinem Punkt, ich setz´ mir höheres als Ziel
Am Ende des Tages ist Musik die Königsdisziplin
Ich förder´ dieses Spiel, mit gehörig Appetit
Höchst intensiv um mit einen mörderichen Trieb
Trotzdem töte ich die MCs, behalt die Klöten, bleib stabil

Und hab den Schlüssel zum Erfolg gesucht, das Mercury-Prinzip
Hater gab´s immer doch mit gehörig Disziplin
Wurden alle umgestimmt, auf einmal hören sie´s auf Repeat

KC Rebell,"Hallo Schatz, das ist mein vorvorletzter Brief
Ich geb' es zu, ich war vor paar Monaten noch depressiv
Ohne Lebensziel, ich hatte nix zu lachen
Denn die Situation, in der wir uns befanden machte mir zu schaffen
Aber ich schwör' auf meine Mutter
Mir geht's jetzt besser
In diesen einsamen verfickten Nächten
War Geld und Alkohol mein Lebensretter
Ich bin jetzt wieder bei Vernunft
Und ich geh' gechillt damit um
Du siehst doch auf Instagram ich mache wieder Bilder mit den Jungs
Wochen her, dass ich dein Facebook das letzte Mal gestalkt hab
Ich hatte sogar Auftritte bei dir in Nähe, direkt in deinem Dorf da unten
Und du, zählst wohlmöglich noch die Kröten in deinem Teich
Und ich weiß, dass du weißt
Ich zähl jetzt Kröten wie ein Scheich, aber egal
Scheiß mal drauf, es war schön mit uns zu zweit
Ich hör lieber auf mit Details, ansonsten tötest du dich gleich
Ich habe null-Komma-null-Prozent, in meinem Wohlstandsbauch noch Wut
Aus und gut, ich hab' mir das ausgesucht

Aus Liebe wird Hass und aus Hass wird Wut
Aus Wut wird Enttäuschung, Aus Enttäuschung wirst du
Du wirst zu Scherben, voller Porzellan
Normal, ist dein Kopf nicht mehr normal

Aus Liebe wird Hass und aus Hass wird Wut
Aus Wut wird Enttäuschung, Aus Enttäuschung wirst du
Du wirst zu Scherben, voller Porzellan
Normal, ist dein Kopf nicht mehr normal

Hallo mein Schatz, das ist mein vorletzter Brief
Du kannst dich ab jetzt sofort ficken alter, Rest in Peace
Nicht, dass mich das kratzen würde
Aber glaubst du wirklich dass ich noch irgendeinen
Verfickten Gedanken übrig habe für dich?
Denkst du echt, das juckt mich
Wenn du mich auf Facebook blockst?
Das Kleid, was du gestern gepostet hattest, steht dir top
Denkst du echt ich weiß nicht, du lädst Bilder hoch mit diesem Bastard?
Weiß er, dass wir gefickt haben, während ihr miteinander zusammen wart?
Weiß er das?
Hat er eigentlich Geld, kann er dich ausführen?
Du nennst mich ein Stalker, nur wegen dem Zelt vor deiner Haustür?
Normal stalk' ich dich, du machst doch Schluss ohne Grund
Ich weiß sogar welchen Wagen du fährst und Duft du benutzt
Ich weiß sogar verdammt gut was du gestern noch gemacht hast
Schwer fiel mir das nicht, weil ich dein Handy angezapft hab, ich hab
Für dich nix mehr übrig
Außer Wut
Aus und gut
Wir haben uns das ausgesucht

Aus Liebe wird Hass und aus Hass wird Wut
Aus Wut wird Enttäuschung, Aus Enttäuschung wirst du
Du wirst zu Scherben, voller Porzellan
Normal, ist dein Kopf nicht mehr normal

Aus Liebe wird Hass und aus Hass wird Wut
Aus Wut wird Enttäuschung, Aus Enttäuschung wirst du
Du wirst zu Scherben, voller Porzellan
Normal, ist dein Kopf nicht mehr normal

Hallo, das ist mein letzter Brief
Heut' komm ich raus aus der Klapse und der Therapie
Unsere Beziehung hielt elf Tage und acht verdammte Stunden
Ich streu' ab heute kein Salz mehr in die Wunde
Ich wusste, dass du Kinder hast
Und glücklich in den Staaten lebst
Deshalb war die Art und Weise von mir der falsche Weg
Ich seh's heut ein, dass es mittlerweile acht Jahre her ist, alles
Was ich gemacht habe, macht man nicht ehrlich
Auch wenn du mich angezeigt hast, sag' ich Danke mein Schatz
Denn mein Psychiater schaut mir zu
Aus und gut
Du hast dir das ausgesucht
Und es bleibt nix zu reden

P.S. Man sieht sich zwei mal im Leben",Nicht mehr normal,2015
KC Rebell,"Es ist mittlerweile acht Jahre her, und du
Findest nie wieder Platz in meinem Herz
Ich liebe dich nicht mehr, und ich kann dich auch nicht hassen
Ich wollt´ dir nur sagen du hast einen Brand hinterlassen
Du bist mir gleichgültig, da ist einfach nichts
Hey stimmt das das jede Beziehung nach dir gescheitert ist?
Denn dieses Kopfabschalten und den Gefühlen freien Lauf lassen
Musst ich irgendwann mal ausschalten
Heute denk ich mit dem Kopf, denn mein Herz ist auf Eis gelegt
Denn dafür hab´ ich mit dir viel zu viel Scheiß erlebt
Ich lernte nach dir Frauen kennen, sowie Engel
Doch konnte ihnen mein Vertrauen nicht mehr schenken
Das war so nicht fair
Ich hab Menschen mit 'nem großen Herz 'ne reelle Chance verwehrt
Und die Antwort darauf wieso es nie mehr wird wie's war
Ist ganz einfach

Wir waren Porzellan
Ich hab' uns bloß in die Ecke gestellt
Und übersehen wie perfekt es war
Bis es zu tausend Teilen zerbrach
Wir waren Porzellan
Und alles was danach kam
Waren billig Imitate
Denn sowas wie wir ist rar

Wir waren Porzellan
Wir waren Porzellan
Wir waren, wir waren
Wir waren Porzellan

Ich hab einmal geliebt
War seitdem keinmal verliebt
Ich hab geschworen ich heirate nie
Doch heute besieg ich diesen Fluch
Reiß den Schmerz aus der Seele
Und hoff' er kommt nie wieder zu Besuch
Du warst das längste Kapitel in meim' Buch
Doch um das Schlusswort zu erreichen war die Liebe nicht genug
Gute Männer lieben schlechte Frauen, ist was ich heute weiß
Und gute Frauen lieben schlechte Männer, ein Teufelskreis
Ich könnte dich nicht mehr berühren sogar wenn ich will
Für mich und meine Seele bist du eine Brennessel
Ich wünschte das wär alles nicht passiert, meine
Erinnerungen, ich begrabe sie mit dir
Doch muss noch oft dran denken, nachts in meim' Bett
Über diese eine Frage, was wäre wenn?

KC Rebell,"Ich laufe durch die Straßen und seh' nur Kälte in den Augen
Die Seelen voller Elend, mein Freund, ich kann es kaum glauben
Ich laufe durch die Straßen und seh' nur Kälte in den Augen
Die Ruhe, die ich suche, finde ich nur noch hier draußen
Ich fühle mich leer, so unendlich leer
Ich fühle mich leer, ich kann einfach nicht mehr
Ich fühle mich leer, so unendlich leer
Ich fühle mich leer, ich kann einfach nicht mehr, yeah

Seitdem ich denken kann
Will ich dem Schicksal diese eine Frage stellen 
Ob man es lenken kann
Als ich sechs war
Mussten wir uns're Sachen packen und unendlich weit wegfahr'n
Seit dem siebten Lebensjahr wurd' ich mit Nazis und Skins groß
Und spürte am eigenen Leib jede Art von Rassismus
Hass bringt Menschen dazu, ihre Reue zu verlieren
So entstanden Narben, die mein' Kopf bis heute noch verzieren
Das letzte Mal geweint mit elf in meinem Kinderzimmer
Da allerletzte Mal, denn du gingst für immer
Mit zwölf die erste Kippe dann geraucht
Wir fühlten uns so cool mit der Clique hinterm Haus
Man hat als Kind noch keine Reife fürs Leben
Vielleicht war ich deshalb schon mit dreizehn am schweben
Mit fünfzehn ist das erste Mal ein Traum von mir zerplatzt
Mir fehlte Disziplin und die brauchst du auf dem Platz
Wir waren Kinder, die Scheiße bauen, doch im Herzen gut
In meinen Kreisen gewann der, der als Erster schlug
Überleg mal seitdem ich achtzehn bin
Verlass' ich meine Haustür nicht mehr, ohne dass ich bewaffnet bin
Vielleicht kann es sein, dass deine Gegend gut war
Aber du, mein NRW, zerstörst Leben, Bruder
In Rest Deutschland red' ich gut von uns zweien
Doch ich liebe und verfluche dich zugleich
Manche meiner Freunde waren nicht grade
Ich lernte Menschen kennen, die mehr als ein Gesicht haben
Der Grund, warum ich sage, du warst mal Bruder
Denn du hast dich verhalten, so wie Abfall, Bruder
Abstand, Bruder, wir brauchen uns nicht mehr
Mit den Jahren hab' ich das Ausmisten gelernt
Mit neunzehn war ich so benebelt von ihr'm Glanz
Doch merkte dann, wie bitter dieses Leben sein kann
Als ich dann ernsthaft dachte, dass es keiner schafft
Hast du mir mit sechsundzwanzig das Lieben wieder beigebracht
Ob du's weißt, dass du mir Hoffnung geschenkt hast
Ohne mich zu ändern, hast du so viel verändert
Wenn man viel sieht, entwickelt man die Reife des Verstandes
Mit elf war ich wie sechzehn und mit sechzehn so wie zwanzig
Mit achtundzwanzig sitz' ich irgendwo in Norwegen
Denn um mich selbst wiederzufinden, musst' ich fortgehen

Ich laufe durch die Straßen und seh' nur Kälte in den Augen
Die Seelen voller Elend, mein Freund, ich kann es kaum glauben
Ich laufe durch die Straßen und seh' nur Kälte in den Augen
Die Ruhe, die ich suche, finde ich nur noch hier draußen
Ich fühle mich leer, so unendlich leer
Ich fühle mich leer, ich kann einfach nicht mehr
Ich fühle mich leer, so unendlich leer
Ich fühle mich leer, ich kann einfach nicht mehr

Du fragst nach meinem Lebensziel
Mit achtundzwanzig hat mein Vater Inşallah den Krebs besiegt
Damit er meine Kinder drücken kann wie mich damals
Damit er da ist für sie wie er für mich da war
Nach ein' paar Jahr'n verbringst du Zeit mit deinen Enkeln
Vielleicht schon mit Mitte dreißig in den eigenen vier Wänden
Ich wollte schon immer mit vierzig Millionär sein
Mittlerweile wär' ein Mensch mehr wert, der mein' Schmerz teilt
Normal lauf' ich durch die Straßen und seh' Kälte in den Augen
Und die Ruhe, die ich suche, finde ich nur draußen
Ich brauch' Abstand, Abstand von mir
Abstand von dir, ich will Abstand von hier
Ich hab' mir vorgenomm', will nie wieder bereuen müssen
Und muss alte Türen schließen, damit sich neue öffnen
Seitdem ich denken kann
Will ich dem Schicksal diese Frage stellen 
Ob man es lenken kann

Suchen wir das Gute in den Menschen, so wie es sein soll
Damit fremde Mütter wegen uns nicht weinen sollen

Der Erfolg ist dein, aber bei Niederlagen bist du dir zu schade und das Schicksal ist schuld
Heh, du hast kein bisschen Geduld, triffst Entscheidungen voreilig

Heute Frühsport? Nein, danke!
Mit so ’ner Wampe werd’ ich sicher keine Kante
Ich geh’ später allerhöchstens noch zur Tanke
Die große Liebe gestern Nacht war doch nur eine Schlampe
Bei mir schwimmt momentan, aber U-Boot
Gefälschte Hublot, kaputte Schuhsohlen
Ich futter’ nur noch Pancakes mit Beefsteak
Wer ist dieser Low-Carb? Everyday Cheatday
Ich höre Blockflöten in meinem Kopf dröhnen
Dieser scheiß Kater hier wird mich noch töten
Ich lass’ es nie wieder so auf einer Party knallen
Vielleicht irgendwann einmal, aber heute auf gar keinen Fall

Nerven liegen blank und ich bin eigentlich am Limit
Aber mein iPhone, es bimmelt wie aus dem heiteren Himmel
Ich kriege ’nen Anruf und ohne viel Überlegen
Mach’ ich die Biege und gehe, lass’ alles liegen und stehen

Bacardi und bunter Schnee

Die Welt morgen untergeht
Geh’ ich vorher noch ’ne Runde drehen

I bought these dreams that all fall down

Yeah!
Ich kam hierher als Einwanderer
Mit dem Drang, etwas zu schaffen so wie kein anderer
Hing mit den Jungs ab ohne Sinn, doch spuckte dann Strophen hin
Und heute represent' ich dieses Von-unten-nach-oben-Ding
Damals mit Farid in Clubs gehangen wie ein Heckenpenner
Durch dieses Geld bei Banger haben wir heute 'nen selben Nenner
Selten Blender, echte Männer lassen Taten sprechen
Du willst in meinen Schuhen laufen lass die Karten wechseln
Während du dein' Arsch nicht hochbekommst aus deinem Winterschlaf
Kenn' ich meine ganzen Angestellten nicht bei Namen
Und ich weiß, du kommst gerade nicht klar
Denn dein Jahresetat trag' ich in bar
Alter mach dein Scheiß, du Penner, ich hab leider keine Zeit für kleine Bengel
Die meinen, jetzt meinen Style zu bemängeln, ihr habt
Dick Vision, doch von Motivation keine Spur
Eure Neidkultur schläft bis um dreizehn Uhr

I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for, tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

Du bist ein neidhabender Typ, dein Leihwagen ist grün
Wie die Scheinfarbe, für die dich dein Weib abends betrügt
Und ich hab mich für den Scheiß grade bemüht
Millionär mit dreißig ich war zwei Jahre zu früh
Du warst Wände am malen, ich habe gekämpft für das Bare
Damit Kinder mir heut sagen „Farid Bang ist nicht Straße!“
Ich kam aus dem nichts, ein paar tausend Klicks (Klicks)
Doch ich bin wie dein Album ich verkauf' mich nicht (Nicht)
Banger Musik wir überrollen das Business
Inzucht auf der Street, Brüder wollen uns ficken
Hol' es mir von euch, geb' meiner Mama das Kies
Denn wer nichts verlangt, der hat alles verdient
Hilf Leuten auf die Beine, die in 'nem Käfig leben
Und das erste was sie machen, wenn sie stehen, dich treten
Das gilt nicht für uns Rap-Rebell und Farid

I bought these dreams that all fall down

Bis hierhin war's kein leichter Weg
Wo ich jetzt bin, wollt mich keiner sehen
Hab mich die meiste Zeit im Kreis gedreht
Guck mal, alles ergibt jetzt Sinn
Fast hätte ich die Chance verpasst
Zu viele Cousins im Knast
Meine Feinde wollten, dass
Ich nie dahin komm, wo ich jetzt bin

Dein Kopf macht Randale, ein paar kostbare Jahre

Lass uns an die frische Luft und ein paar Vorstrafen sammeln
Deine Ex schreibt SMSen, warum lässt du dich so stressen?
Ich kenn' Dinge, die dir helfen, dein Gedächtnis zu resetten
Lösch den Chatverlauf und setz ein Lächeln auf
Auch wenn du die Kippen jetzt in Ketten rauchst
Ja, die Welt, sie dreht sich weiter, du weißt ganz genau, das stimmt schon

Kristallhagelnde Tropfen auf die knallfarbene Jordans
Die Schlagader am pochen und an die Wand male ich Hoffnung
Ich will weiter, will höher, will mehr, ich will solche Sachen
An den Wolken kratzen, ich will den Erfolg in Kapseln
Mit so viel Treibstoff schießt du dich gleich ins All
Doch wenn alle Stricke reißen, genieße den freien Fall
Die Zunge kreist umher, ich spür' mein' Mund und wein' nicht mehr
Mein Hund heißt Heisenberg, was bin ich alleine wert?

Ich will die Stadt von oben sehen
Also flieg' ich jetzt nach oben
Und ich mach's mir dort bequem
Bist du bereit, heut Nacht mit mir über Leichen zu gehen?
Alles und jeden um dich rum nur noch in Zeitlupe sehen

Ich bin kein Jude, doch ich mach’ auf deiner Bar Mitzwa „schnapp“
Und wenn ich mich in eine Bitch hineinversetz’
Dann nur mit meinem Schwanz bis er tief in ihrem Leibe steckt
Ich will Ausschnitte sehen, also lass mal deine Filme, Bitch
Das hier ist kein Horrorstreifen, doch ich kille dich

Keks rappen in finanziellen Engpässen vom Benz lenken
Ihre Zeit geht schnell vorbei, so wie Adventskränze
Weil ich die besten Tracks rappe und die freshsten Trends setze
Stimme, Dynamit, Flow, Bombe, Texte, Sprengsätze
Boom, wenn ich mit Jasko in deiner Hood auftauch’
Dann halt nach deiner ? Ausschau
Denn schon für hundert Euro will sich deine Hoe nicht mehr benehmen
Was macht die Fotze dann für eine Audemars Piguet?
Ghetto-VIP, auf dem Splash rapp’ ich rebellisch

Auf der Straße hab ich fame, ich mach' G-Rap mit Flow

Ah, ich mach' der Sängerin Ciara Kids
Und danach fick ich eine Bitch, und zwar Sierra Kidds
Kurz darauf hat die Bitch in ihrem Hintern Penis drin
Und ich 'ne Anzeige - Verführung von Minderjährigen
Bin im Zerlegen King und geh' ich scheißen in 'nem Zug
Bringt es mir mehr als eine Seite in der JUICE
Und warum sich die Kugeln in deiner Brust befinden
Zur falschen Zeit am falschen Ort im Bus ganz hinten
Hunde, die bellen, beißen nicht, sagen ein paar im Viertel
Doch Hunde, die bellen, werden am meisten gefürchtet

2 Milionen Euro, mein Jahresrückblick

Asphalt Massaka, die Trilogie, ich steche dir in deine Givenchy
Ich hab gehört, dass du in Wien auf krass Kanake da machst
Aber in Deutschland bleibst du 'ne Fliege, wie'n Krawattenersatz
Alles Fotzen, außer KC Danke für die Props
Und diese Aussage, doch ihr bleibt Fotzen, ohne Ausnahme
Die Fans haben es gemerkt, dass ihr Heuchler seid
Ihr habt null Loyalität in eurem Freundeskreis
Ihr zeigt euch gegenseitig an und so'n Scheiß
Also irgendwie müsst ihr doch charakterlos sein
Banger-Bro, jeder meiner Crew ist krasser
Die Rebell-Lounge wischt sich mit der JUICE den Arsch ab
Hip-Hop-Medien supporten sanftere Kerle
Denn unsere Schwänze sind zu lang für ihre Ärsche
Ihr unterschreibt bei 'nem Major 'n Deal (Ah, SC, ah)

Jeder hält ein Gewehr, B-A-N-G-E-R
Hurensohn, du machst auf Moslem mit dei'm Bart
Doch wenn's um's Eingemachte geht
Bestellst du dir das Schweinenackensteak
Der King, der Champ, der Chief, sitze mit der Gang im Jeep
Fahren nach Berlin, 'ne Runde Klingelmännchen spiel'n
Merhaba, ich komm' mit annormalen Songs
Und begrüße Rapper mit einem Scha-la-la-la-la-lom
Das ist nicht der Thron, auf dem du Penner grad sitzt
Rapper brauche keinen Flow, sondern 'nen Herrenhaarschnitt
Aha, aha, jeder, der denkt, dass er im Showbiz on top sei
Kriegt von mir das Solingen rostfrei
Oglum, du willst Stress
Ich steh' vor deiner Wohnung mit der Tec
Du kleine Fotze mit Napoleon-Komplex
Bestell' Champagner, denn er ist nach acht Gläsern leer
Dankeschön an unser'n Gastgeber Fler, yeah

Jasko, es ist immer noch der Dreckskanake
Ich ficke B-Tights Mutter wie auf meiner letzten Platte
Der Betrugo hier ist immer noch G
Und deine Mom ist wie Boom Beach, ich hab die Finger im Spiel
Ich seh' nur reihenweise Lutscher, und ich rede nicht von Facebook

Crackdealer Sound für den Häftling im Bau
Ich hol' mehr Fotzen vor die Kamera als Backspin TV
Eine Gatling im Bau, ich mach' alles, außer Spaß
G-Hot, deine Mutter, sie macht alles, außer Arsch
Die Bitch gibt sich Becks in der Wohnung wie ein Penner

Etwas Lippenstift am Schwanz, ich muss ficken wie ein Mann

Fler bleibt ein Hurensohn, auch wenn der Beat nicht mehr läuft

Yeah, eyo, Asphalt Massaka 3, ich hab wieder Blut geleckt
Milfhunter-Style, reife Mütter suchen guten Sex
Im Mund von dieser Gina ficken und zwar so tief, bis meine Eier
An ihrem Kinn hängen und sie aussieht wie Peter Griffin
Wieder spitten, du sitzt ahnungslos auf dem Sofa
Willst deine Bitch zurückerobern und trinkst Pisse mit Cola
(Haha) Fick auf Schule, Bruder, jetzt sind Wörter meine Waffe
Als ich wusste, wie man Geld zählt, hab ich aufgehört mit Mathe
Oberbilk, Mann, hier laufen keine Gangs auf Straßen
Um deine Bitch zu haben, muss man mit Paypal zahlen
Denn sie macht Cybersex für Kokaina
Und ist jederzeit eh on, wie Stromanbieter
Finanzamt fickt, doch ich bin am Tricksen - Uri Geller
Und mit Absätzen beschäftigt, wie ein Damenschuhhersteller
Fick die Stars von heute und dein Alter Ego
Ich fick Nazibräute auf Pegida-Demos

M-A-J, ich schieß' auf Schore-Junks
Meine Frau trägt nur noch Röcke
Damit keiner behauptet, sie hätte die Hosen an
Komm' ich mit Turban, du Homo, dann wird es eskalieren
Wie der erfinder vom Sturmstaffel-Logo
Packe die Langhantelstange, habe die Kur in mir drin
Und klatsche deine gesamte Bande im Uhrzeigersinn
Dieser MOK klaut wieder Chips liegt auf der Couch und er frisst
Weil sein Bauch fetter ist als der Mount Everest
Merk' dir, dass dich das Label mit dem Boxhandschuh killt
Er ist so fett, dass ihn nicht einmal die Bosst-TraFo hilft
Bitch, mein Herz ist aus Stahl, sag mir, wer macht auf hart?
Dann beißt er halt ins Gras, wie'n Pferd oder Schaf
Du würdest gern in meiner Haut stecken, so wie Testo-Spritzen

KCB,"After all jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries Mary

The traffic lights they turn a blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that they lived is dead

And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember?
The names it has blown in the past
And with its crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers ""no, this will be the last""

And the wind cries Mary",The Wind Cries Mary,2004

And this is so hard
'Cause I didn't see
That you were the love of my life and it kills me

I still say your name when I'm talking in my sleep
And in the limelight, I play it off fine
But I can't handle it when I turn off my night light

Remember the time 
We jumped the fence when 
The stones were playing, and we were to broke to get in
You held my hand and
They made me crawl
I swear to God it was the best night of my life
Or when you took me, across the world, we
Promised this would last forever but now I see
It was my past life
A beautiful time
Drunk off of nothing but each other till the sunrise (oh, oh, oh)

Okay I’m young and I’m tatted
I get them bucks like an addict
In this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay no need to panic, I’m on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin’ on medication, no I wont need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I’m young and I’m handsome
I say I’m filthy fucking rich, so I’m an old dirty bastard
And my cribs a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car but my Ferrari go faster
Sounding like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, bout to go see the cashier
On the grind so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou’ and think it's time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I’m here to share it
No it’s not a problem, better get it, then I wont be here tomorrow momma

That momma shot for our daddy so that HE wouldn’t forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he’ll remember
If not he’s human, I’m human, you human, we’ll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can’t see how momma hates him
He’s such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I’m only eight, I’m not old enough, guess it’s complicated
Two parent dwellings, expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it don’t get negated
I was gon’ save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through through, but it's the 1980?s
But now that we are cool cool, she sippin'’ Irish Baileys
She say “Stacks, you’re true blue?”
I said “Nah, I’m Navy”
I call her Kesha, she like it, because it’s hood to her
She call me Andre 6000 because I’m good to her

Well you better make it two or three

Wipe me down bitch, I’m super clean
I’m hella cold, mega paid, making moves doing things
Bitches stay queued and they all wanna do the king
I’m ballin’, royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special and this dick is so impressive
Bitch I bet you take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin’, I’m just here, couldn’t catch you when I catch you
Bitch my swagger super natural
Get you pregnant looking at you
I ain't nothing like them other dudes
I’m an atom bomb, they a molecule
Still paint ballin’ out the frame, stuntin’ like a fool

Or maybe just need some sleep
I've got a sick obsession,
I'm seeing it in my dreams

I'm looking down every alley,
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping,
Hit my head against the walls

What you've got boy is hard to find
Think about it all about it all the time
I'm all strung up my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love

Won't listen to any advice,
Mama's telling me I should think twice
But left to my own devices
I'm addicted its a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy,
My judgment is getting kinda hazy
My status is gonna be affected if
I keep it up like a love sick crackhead

What you've got boy is hard to find
Think about it all about it all the time
I'm all strung up my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind

Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love, your love, your love, is my drug
Your love your love your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you are away

So I got a question
Do you want to have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love, your drug?
(Huh) your drug? (huh) your drug?
(Huh) your drug?
Is my love, your drug?

Because your love, your love, your love, is my drug

Ke$ha,"Everybody know Juicy always turnt up
Tour bus smoked out, everybody purped up
9 to 5 grind and got the whole hood worked up
Ain't getting money then you better get your work up
Pull up in a Porsche drunk, back seat chauffeur
Taylor Gang in here, everybody know us
Hundred bottles, and there's more coming
Same shit tomorrow night, all I know is stunting
20 shot of Jager, I don't do chasers
White boy wasted, smoking out the vaper
Party with your girl, sweating out my pores
Becky so good, I had to thank the Lord
She won my heart and of course she go hard
Shake her ass and titties, I threw my card
Love California girls like David Lee Roth
You tell em that you love em, I say, 'take it off', 'take it off'

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

No changing us
Ball so hard, it's not a game to us
Pull up in the club throwing Taylor's up
Spending cuz money ain't a thing to us
But for the famous stuff, I wasn't the one to play with
Party all night, getting drunk and raging
Ball so hard, I think I'm gonna be sick
Wake up, roll a joint and do it all again
Yeah, I like to party
Got a cute face and I like your body
You leave sober and you might be sorry
Pour another shot then light the Marley
And what goes down, don't bring it up
Tell them broke niggas they can hang it up
Take six shots, feels like we're dying
Hit this once, feels like you're flying

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Won't stop cause it's my time, time
I'm staying on my grind, grind
You tryna take my shine, shine?
Step back, bye bye
When I rap, all the boys go cray cray
Every time that I jump on the stage
Oh, you like it when I'm in your face?
And if you don't, man, whatcha gonna say?

Looking for some trouble tonight (yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (uh huh)
We'll keep dancing 'till we die

Julie’s still a waitress living on tips

Shadows of a past life, wish I could rewind

In a small club in Minnesota

Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought
And felt comfortable in myself

Had a bitterness when I looked back
Was telling everyone it's not that bad
'Til all my shit hit the fan

I know I'm always like
Telling everybody, ""You don't gotta be a victim
Life ain't always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you""

I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

Had a boogieman under my bed
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head
Always whispering, ""It's all your fault""
He was telling me, ""No, you're not that strong""

I know I'm always like
Telling everybody, ""You don't gotta be a victim
Life ain't always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you""

So I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it

I see now maybe there's a reason
Why, I, I, I, I, I, I been through hell and back
Yeah, honestly, it's what made me who I am
Holding on to wasted time
Gotta learn to let go in life

I used to take comfort from long before I met you

And I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone (feel so alone)

So consumed with the wrong things, but in
The dark, I realized this life is short
And deep down, I'm still a child

Lose hope, what's left of my heart's still made of gold

Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

Get a python snake scare the bitch half to death

Make her fall in love fill her head up with dreams

Then I pimp the bitch have her makin' green

All day and night bring it back home to me



[Kenoe (Turk)]

Pimpin' ain't easy that's why we dog these hoes

Might over macks we don't love these hoes

Rule number one, never ever trust a bitch

Cause a hoe will getcha fucked up and leave ya dick sick

Puerto Rican, Dominican all kinds of bitches

Like to suck on they titties put my dick in they kittens

But I'll bat a bitch up if she cross me
Like that hoe named Ashley made her suck me


Bitch please, you try to keep my car

I putcha truck on ?? punch a girl in the jaw

Like Turk said (Bitch you must not know my background)

Night rider, Skinny Pimp n reppin' that Oaktown

Got a ?? in every city and I fly for free


Gettin' brain on the plane gettin' high with me
My uncle Snoop Dogg told me to maintain my G

Fuck a captain save-a-hoe

I make the hoe save me



[Kenoe: Chorus x 2]



[Turk]

Kenoe, look..
Nigga pimpin' ain't easy but somebody gotta do it


Put these hoes to work, make them think it's all good

Gotta let a bitch know where the fuck she stand

Which one wear the skirt and which one wear the pants

I tell a bitch go get money

She bringin' it back

When I program the bitch

Have her bringin' me stacks

All business no pleasure

Cash, no checks
??... just don't play with me




[Kenoe]

You can tell I'm a mack by the way that I talk


You can tell I'm a G by the way that I walk
You can tell I'm super fly by the way that I dress


Ya own momma wanna fuck talkin' bout I'm a mess
Now follow me

I keep a gangsta hoe on my side that'll shank a bitch

I've been in the game been pimpin' hoes and have 'em suckin' dick

Can I take y'all way back to 1996

I've been in the game been pimpin' hoes and have 'em suckin' dick




[Kenoe: Chorus x 2]


[Turk talking]

It's like that

Pimpin' these hoes

It ain't over

you understand?
I gotta send my shouts out


To all the motherfuckin' pimps across town

you understand, that nigga Don Juan

That nigga Pimpin Ken, Ice Berg Slim, ??

My nigga T.I., can't forget my nigga Snoop Dogg he a pimp

Oh boy, my nigga Too Short you understand

And guess what... Turk and Kenoe

Yeah, and it's like that

Uh uh

*Bitch* Bitch better have my money

Uh huh, it's like that

That sooner or later it got to come back around

Kept my foot in the fast lane

Keak da Sneak,"Muscle Cars, yay!

[Chorus]

Not out of the local news paper, but out the AutoTrader
Cleaner, than virgin cuchie, my nigga, one on her Cutlass, player
The beat wrapped in monster cables, the speaker's thumping
Trunk sounding like Godzilla, and King Kong, back there thumping
All we do is wic, and get high and pedal and push!
Organic weed, mystery weed, just purple cush!
I cut the rear weld, on my whip, and filled that bitch up
And now muscle car sitting up high like a monster truck
Monster up, suck up to none, don't be no poodle
Split his pack open like pack of Top Ramen noodle
In the heart of the soil, where you can find me
Try me fuck boy and get your face put on a white tee
40, Turf Talk and Keak the Sneak
They mayne ass voices, and they styles is hekka unique
High speed chase's and running lights
Water in the duals, make loud glass pipes

[Chorus]

Four barrel carburetor, four speed trany
Dual exhaust dipped in sauce
My car is a beast, catch me in the streets side ways
Threw the East Side-Boy, crunk like Lil' Jon
Show 40, and Mac Keak the last don
East Oakland the land of the side show
Richmond, Frisco, to the Valley Jo
I'm riding side ways, this way and that way
Door's open, while in traffic
Hold the door open (Hello!)
Shitting on 'em, no fronting
455 got me running up on Aston Martins
We run from them on streets, not the freeway
B&M shift kit (kik) me and Danny Phea
On my celly cell straight lace with no fucking dew
Mobbing in my ol' school, like Lil' Bruce

[Chorus]

Four 15's, beat supreme
Told niggas fuck Rally's, ride gold one's mayne
Mother's off candid, don't hate 'cause I ain't me
Race, foo, smoke in your face, foo
Super charger, push this button and my engine start up
Pistol tucked
Might be premiered, but my engine souped up
Quick to the floor when you open yours
Don't scratch my doors. 350 I push heavy
Not a Ford it's (Chevy, Chevy, Chevy)
First owner, not too many miles on her
We rep the BAY, we don't rep California (I'm liyin')
I'm run you for your car note
Why you don't got S-S's in front of your Monte Carlo?
Residence full of white folks
I'm leave fresh tire marks top of they asphalt

You got muscle car? You fucking with them Muscle cars?

Guess who's back 
Back again 
Shady's back 
Tell a friend 

Now everyone report to the dance floor 
To the dance floor, to the dance floor 
Now everyone report to the dance floor, alright stop
Pajama time 
Come here little kiddies, on my lap 
Guess who's back with a brand new rap 
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case 
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys 
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything, 
But little boys 
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor, 
I'm just psycho 
I go a little bit crazy sometimes 
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes 
Good God, dip, do a little slide 
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor 
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it 
Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK 
Oops my C-D just skipped 
And everyone just heard you let one rip,

Now I'm gonna make you dance, it's your chance,

Oh baby Aah aah, Oh baby baby aah aah 

It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party 
All the way to Sunday, maybe till Monday, I dunno what day 
Everyday's just a holiday 
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy 
Get the top down, let my hair blow, 
I dunno where I'm goin' 
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body 
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk 
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work 
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair 
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah 
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind 
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

I'm in jail and I don't know what happened 
They say I was running butt naked 
Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah 
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember 
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty 
They said save it boy, we got you on tape 
Telling an old lady to ""touch my body"" 
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down 
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound 
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now 
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves 
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
I don't have any lines to go right here so 
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah? 
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what? 
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls, tall girls, small girls, 
I'm calling all girls 
Everyone report to the dance floor, it's your chance for a little romance or 
Butt squeezing it's the season

'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding

And I've got to be free
Free to face the world that's ahead of me

On board I'm the captain, so climb a board
We can search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on

I look to the sea, reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had

We've been happy forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold
But we'll try as best as we can to carry on

And people gathered from miles around
To witness your quilt spread on the ground

And then they called out your name
Oh, yes they called out your name
Oh, and you will live forever
You know that I'll be loving you
Just like a patchwork quilt

Well, there were men and women, mothers and fathers
Sisters and brothers, daughters and sons
And children and babies, and lovers and friends
They all lay before me sewn into one

Your lives had meaning and your lives had joy
You touches so many people, many more than you will know
And you wrapped yourselves around me as I walked along these rows
You're letting me feel your beautiful souls

I feel the warmth of your lives
Oh, and you will live forever
You know that I'll be loving you
Just like a patchwork quilt

My heart spills over, flowing with tears
I cry for your suffering and for your shortened years
And I'll take you with me as I walk away
Remembering you who have died with AIDS

And tell you all the things you are to me

To you and to the one who gave you to me

And I waited a long, long time

I waited a long, long time,
I waited a long, long time,
I waited a long, long time,

Seeking out the memories I hold dear,
'Cause you put your spell on me,
Made me live a memory,

I don't see you anymore,
We love to think about the way things were,
But the time has come and I'm glad its over.

I don't know why I waste my time,
Getting hung up about the things you say
When I open my eyes and its a lovely day,
You know sometimes I feel like I'm,
Getting Snowed under with the things you say,
When I open my eyes and It's a lovely day.

Now you think that you're alone,
So you make your way back home,
I'd love to greet the weary travel,
But your time has gone and I'm glad its over.

I know how I let you down
But maybe I can change this time around
This heart and these hands are mine
Maybe I can change this time


Soon, I'm gonna be an older man
And I will struggle to remember
The blank space when I tried to see your face
The blinded eye, I can't replace

I know how I let you down
But maybe I can change this time around
This heart and these hands are mine
Maybe I can change this time

Rain, rain, will you ever go away?

I'd always have the right to,
Be living in the kingdom of the good and true.

But now I think I was wrong.
And you were laughing along
And now I look a fool for thinking you were on
My side.

Is it any wonder that I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Sometimes,
It's hard to know where I stand.
It's hard to know where I am.
Well maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand.

Sometimes,
I get the feeling that I'm
Stranded in the wrong time.
Where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme,
A sound-bite.

Is it any wonder that I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Oh these days,
After all the misery you made.
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?

Nothing left inside this old cathedral,
Just the sad lonely spires.
How do you make it right?

Oh but you try.

I reached out to touch your hand
But I was watching from a distance

We cling to love like a skidding car
Clinched to the corner
I try to hold on to what we are
The more I squeeze the quicker we all are

You take the pieces of the dreams that you have

You cut them up and spread them out on the floor

But in the final reckoning

Keane,"I shake through the wreckage for signs of life
Scrolling through the paragraphs
Clicking through the photographs

I wish I could make sense of what we do
Burning down the capitols
The wisest of the animals

Who are you, what are you living for
Tooth for tooth, maybe we'll go one more

This life, is lived in perfect symmetry
What I do, that will be done to me

Read page after page of analysis
Looking for the final score
We're no closer than we were before

Who are you, what are you fighting for
Holy truth? Brother I choose this mortal life
Lived in perfect symmetry

What I do, that will be done to me
As the needle, slips into the run out groove
Love, maybe you feel it too

And maybe you find, life is unkind
And over so soon
There is no golden gate
There's no heaven waiting for you

Oh boy you ought to leave this town
Get out while you can, the meter's running out
The voices in the streets you love
Everything is better when you hear that sound

Spineless dreamers, hide in churches
Pieces of pieces of rush hour, buses
I dream in emails, worn out phrases
Mile after mile of just empty pages

Wrap yourself around me
Wrap yourself around me

As the needle, slips into the run out groove

In words and in pictures, but I'm not listening
I'm not taking it in

Going to bury my head, where I can't hear the sound of bombs

Me, I'm just playing along
You and I, so many good people all
Just playing along

I'm going to go to a bar, where is the jukebox is on
Going to shut out the noise, with a rock'n'roll song
Playing along

I'm going to turn up the volume [Repeat: x3]

Sing us a swing time American melody

We are blisters on the earth
We are not the flowers, we're the strangling weeds
In the meadow

And love is just our way of looking out for ourselves
When we don't want to live alone
So step into the vacuum, tear off your clothes
And be born again

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just animal reflex
There's no one looking on
Forget about fashion
Forget about the law
Pretend that you're alone now

I wonder what I'd do, if I could wake up every morning
With a clean slate
I'd burn through the cities, I'd tear through the towns
'Cos there's no deals to make
So break out of the cages, the delicate structures
We cling to all our lives
'Cos we are just the monkeys, who fell out of the trees
When we were trying to fly

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just primal desire
No right and no wrong
Forget about the future
Forget about blame
Pretend that you're alone now
Pretend that you're alone now

She's not waiting for tomorrow
And she has no love in her eyes
Oh no, I wanna come down right now
But oh no, I wanna get out right now

Oh oh!

Pretend that you're alone now
And everything's gone
Just animal reflex
There's no one looking on
Forget about religion
Forget about shame
Pretend that you're alone now

Tied up to the ground

From jewels and stone
I made you
In the image of myself

Anything else

I reach for you
You slip
Through my fingers
Into cold sunlight

Smaller as I sit here
Pulling at the loose

Turns on the TV
As the levy breaks

But that girl she wheeled you in
This time was never good enough
'Cause she was gone and seen everything
And if you ever spoke of love
She just smiled and put you down
'Cause she was making all the plans
She had a vision of light and sound

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And everything that we've been dreaming of making real one day
So save your money pack your bags
We better run before we disappear
She took the train into the city but you're still here

You hear a song that takes you back
The song long for God tonight
And friends who said they hang your back
But they just turned them round and let you fight
And on the bowling alley wall
You used all your smartest minds
But they'll be painted over now
Looks like here gonna get left behind

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And all the things that we've been dreaming of making real one day
So save your money, pack your bags
I wanna run with you on Stamford hill
She took the train into the city but you stood still

You stood still about the train
You knew as you watched her go
That she wan never coming back
And start to places that you know
You said you're scared if I
And that didn't want to go
Where everyone else goes

She said the neon on the river will light my way
And everything that we've been dreaming of making real one day

And are you hearing that call?
'Cause you've got everything that you need to make a start

I had a dream of my own
Just walking out of my home
And going I don't know where to sing beneath the stars

Your whole life lies ahead
It's just around the bend

So when the sun is coming up and you go
And there's still so many things you don't know
Don't you look back, I've no doubt that I
Will see you on the road

When the world's laying you low
Why don't you let me carry your load?
When things get bad you know you have a friend
All along the road

And I would love it sometime
If you would walk at my side
Going I don't know where to sing beneath the stars

If in your life you need a hand
Reaching the promised land

So when the sun is coming up and you go
And there's still so many things you don't know
Don't you look back, I've no doubt that I
Will see you on the road

When the world's laying you low
Why don't you let me carry your load?

Is the fag end tail of amoeba-hood

And curse yourself for growing old
The sterile scent of shaving foam
Reminds you of another world

I see you when the lovers stop outside
I see you silhouetted on a wall

And I ain't tryna be the one who's making you unhappy
'Cause if you're unhappy then I know
I ain't tryin' hard enough, gotta try harder for you

Gotta do better girl, I'ma be trying, keep trying
Gotta do better girl, I'ma be trying, keep trying
Gotta do better girl, I'ma be trying, keep trying
Gotta keep trying, gotta keep trying, babe

Gotta do better girl, I'ma be trying, keep trying
Gotta do better girl, I'ma be trying, keep trying
Gotta do better girl, I'ma be trying, keep trying

If I could be your take home to mom
If I could be your money for your rent
If I could be your car payment

If I could be your time spent
If I could be your heart from your dad
If I could be your bedroom
(Ooh)
Then that's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be

Now that I'm your company
Now that I'm your get no sleep
Now that I'm your soaking wet
Not that I'm the one you can't forget

Now that I'm your do it all
Now that I'm your alcohol
Now that I'm your feel good
Then that's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be

I'll be your good times, your bad times
That's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be
Ohh, that's what I'll be, ohh, that's what I'll be
I'll be your good times, your bad times
That's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be
I'll be your good times, your bad times

If I gotta be your heart break
If I gotta be the pill you take
If I gotta be your fussing and fighting
If I gotta be your wrong and your right

If I gotta be your dead end
If I gotta be straight trifling
If I gotta be your head ache
If that's what it takes, then that's what I'll be
Baby, that's what I'll be

I'll be your good times, your bad times
That's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be

That's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be
I'll be your good times, your bad times

I know you might think I'm going crazy
But when it comes to you I'm willing to do almost anything
Just to prove to you that I'm a rider, a provider
And baby, that will never change, I'll be, baby, your everything, ohh

Let me break it down, down
Tell you right now what I'm gonna be
I'ma be like a bank in a robbery
You can call me down and take from me

You can get away, come back in another week
Baby, you can keep robbing me
I'ma be the man, do what I can
To make sure that you got everything
I don't care, girl, I swear, ohh, I'll be your everything

Don't you get it?
This is what I'm talking about, baby

That's what I'll be, that's what I'll be, what I'll be
That's what I'll be, that's what I'll be, what I'll be
That's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be

That's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be
That's what I'll be, baby, that's what I'll be

KeAnthony,"I ain't tryin' to walk into an empty house
And end up on the couch by myself no
And I ain't tryin' to be starin' at the t.v. feelin' hungry
With no home cooked meal
And I ain't tryin' to be callin' your name wonderin' where you at
Cause I know that your right upstairs
I ain't tryin' to be wreckin' my brain
Goin' back and forth thinkin' bout how I gotta change
This ain't no game
Cause I ain't playin' girl
Its you and me girl
That's how we be girl
And I'm goin' change
And I'm for real girl
Cant do without ya girl
Cause baby your my world

[Chorus]
I ain't tryin' to be without you
And I don't care what I gotta do
Girl I'll do anything and I'll go anywhere
Cause ain't nothin' workin' without you baby
I ain't tryna be without you
And I ain't tryin' to be the one who's makin' you unhappy
Cause if you unhappy then I know I ain't tryin' hard enough
Gotta try harder for you

I ain't tryin' to be all out in the street
Or up in the club sippin' on Patron
Wit my flirt on
And I ain't tryin' to be sneakin' home
Wonderin' what to say
When you ask why I smell like fresh soap
And I ain't tryin' to be lyin' and hidin' the truth
Decievin' you
That's that old shit I used to do
And I ain't tryin' to be scared of my own cell phone no more
I don't wanna piss you off

This ain't no game
Cause I ain't playin' girl
Its you and me girl
Thats how we be girl
And I'm goin' change
And I'm for real girl
Can't do without ya girl
Baby you're my world

[Chorus]

If I don't get it right the first time
Baby please believe me I will try it again
And I don't care if it takes me a lifetime
I swear to God I will try to the end
As long as I'm on earth
I'm gonna keep my word
Girl I'll do whatever it takes
To prove to you that I'm a changed man
Did some foul shit
But I won't do it again

[Chorus]

Gotta do better girl",I Ain't Tryna',2008
Keaton,"She wears a long fur coat of mink 
Even in the summer time 
Everybody knows from the coy little wink 
The girl's got a lot on her mind 

She's got big thoughts, big dreams 
And a big brown Mercedes sedan 
What I think this girl
She really wants, to be in love with a man 

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
Without love it ain't much 

She saw him standing in the section marked 
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie 
She threw him bread and said make me scream 
In the dark what could he say 

Boys with small talk and small minds 
Really don't impress me in bed 
She said I need a man's man baby 
Diamonds and furs 
Love would only conquer my head 

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
Without love it ain't much 
 
They made haste in the brown sedan 
They drove to fifty five Secret street 
They made love and by the seventh wave 
She knew she had a problem 
She thought real love is real scary 
Money only pays the rent 
Love is forever that's all your life 
Love is heaven sent it's glamorous, lead

The glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much

She wants to lead the glamorous life 
She don't need a man's touch 
She wants to lead the glamorous life 
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much

Lead, the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love, it ain't much, it ain't much",The Glamorous Life,1973
