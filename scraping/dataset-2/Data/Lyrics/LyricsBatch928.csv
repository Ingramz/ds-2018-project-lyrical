Rick Ross,"Yeah, good looking E-Class, I needed that, nigga
What? Trilla, realer to fuck niggas

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

I started flat broke, now I'm poppin' rubber bands
I know I'm the shit, I done ate a ton of spam
If the club poppin', Ima burn a hundred grams
Check the parking lot pimpin', whip cost a hundred grand

I'm in love with shades, I got a thousand pairs
So that's free game for all you thousand airs
It's funny sour D's will smell sweet
All these niggas think they sell them on Canal Street

I'm sittin' twelve feet, fuck, can you tell me
I let the 12's beat, 'Nightmare on Elm Street'
So don't fall asleep 'cause my life a dream
And they ain't gotta speak, they know I'm spittin' cheese

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

We got them bottles poppin' soundin' like they gun shots
Got the models balkin', did it all with one watch
I hit a lot markets, start 'em off with one block
People love the product, so my people come to shop

My uncle, 65, he still sellin' dope
He claim he petrified, the field goin' broke
It's them Caddy Seville's, went from acid to pills
To elaborate deals if you want status you kill

'Cause they have it for real when I step in the spot
Treat the club like the charts, I go straight to the top
They cost a stack, so don't step on the shoes
And ya know I'm strapped, I'ma play by the rules

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

Take the good with the bad, in the club blowin' your last
Ballin' like I violated, bottles keep me hydrated
Party up in skyscrapers, parachute to prevail
Pistol like a paratrooper, tell 'em take it easy

Bitch is bad as can be, this her fantasy
Left her panties at home standin' there thick as can be
Are I see K are O S S, standin' there dressed fresh
Gettin' pussy, hell yes, Ross, Ross

You know me, I walked up in the spot, the baby's be goin' crazy
While niggas bet he dippin', you know they got that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

You know me, I stay up on my grind, like working that 9 to 5
Plus hitting that 95, I'm out to get that
That street money, that street, that street money
That street money, that street, that street money

Yeah Jay-z I'm callin you out, you suck, you hang out wit 50 cent 'cause you're not worth a dollar buck. And for chammillionaire you horrible and even worse, you similar to Jay-z's album, God gave me the GIFT, and gave you the CURSE.

And we go by the runners

(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
If you rep yo' hood and you goin' hard

You can't stop this

If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me,
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me,
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
Cause it's in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go 
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end, 
I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 1: Kanye West]

First I spin around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad won't nobody get up on it, I
Flow sick, nigga how sick, sea sick
Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I have some wins, some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as it get,
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip, 
Fly as 57 passengers
This finna be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it, then get at it
But I ain't gon have it,
No I ain't gon have it

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me,
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me,

Makin money ain't shit to me,

I am gettin it in until the end, 
I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scared 
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt 
Gon' head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt,
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt Like I couldn't really give it my all,
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall,
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me,
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't no where to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down if I knew what I know now 
I'm scooby, I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin' old, well it's good I'm young
'Fore my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one?
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me,
Fuck ya'll niggas, I'm out of here


[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me

And when they came in we unpacked 'em all
Broke 'em all down and unwrapped 'em all

And just your luck the rap game got me hold up

Here we go again just spent a hundred of that brown paper
Bag money all on timbs, and that bad bitch is all on him
'Cause the cars that he drives are all foreign
The game is mine I'm so far in I'm speaking with an accent
Just cartwin, can't even relax in my room,
That brown paper bag money push my mattress through the roof
This for my niggas getting brown paper bag money
This for my strippers getting black plastic bag money
We're talking that bad money, that i.r.s can tax money you dig me

Miami Khaled took me in like a orphan
Why did they start him?

Pen it so easy, a caveman can do it
Nigga we simply the best don't confuse it

Rick Ross,"This is so all bad, nothin' good can come from this
Sweet but sad, I don't know love ruins a relationship
It will never last but it feels so good, guess I gotta deal with it
This is so all bad, this is so all bad
Got me messin' 'round with you
You got me messin' 'round with you
Out here messin' 'round with you
What you gon' say? What you gon' do?
Baby if they knew?

I'm a G, she say the pain runs deep
But she can't run from me
I'm in these streets with the killers, thugs, and drug dealers
100 mil' plus, in trucks with no ceilings
Fuck who don't feel it, I'm feelin' like I'm the realest
Biggest boss in the business and really that's to infinite
What we doin' wrong but it feels right
Can't discuss what we did the whole night
Won't be the last time, on my cash line
Duffel bags so accountant is the past time
And for the last time, I'm not a bad guy
I just like what I like, now shorty act right
Small waist, red weaves
Black car, keep it flyer than them Red Wings
Nightmares, day dreams
She the one, listen how she say things

This is so all bad, nothin' good can come from this
Sweet but sad, I don't know love ruins a relationship
It will never last but it feels so good, guess I gotta deal with it

She in love with the life, champagne and all the light
Chanel sneakers and scarves, I want you to be my wife
We can run around the world and tuck with no fear
G4, G5, whole team here
Call ourselves friends, but we holdin' hands
Got alot of questions, am I a controllin' man?
I run the streets but I'm well known in Japan
As a G, a boss, the money coming fast
She from a lovin' home, I'm from a troubled home
One bedroom, didn't have a telephone
Now I'm on the corner, time to get my hustle on
Women recognize, and now I got a couple of 'em
Speedin' in the Beemer then I got a Range
She not a side chick, she all in my lane
She a quiet chick, may let her see some things
I'm catchin' feelin's for her, she take away the pain

This is so all bad, nothin' good can come from this

Life amazin', wake up in new places
Big faces stuffed in suitcases
Played the hand I was dealt, few aces
Now the bedroom suite is too spacious
Niggas wanna kill me but I put 'em on pause
Broke motherfuckers better bow to the boss
I'm gettin' high, I'm above the law
Gettin' down and dirty, makin' love to her
Please believe in niggas that's still schemin'
But the ghost that floats the 4 Seasons
To love me baby is too easy
But what I need you to do is just believe me
She got the Range Rover, I was cool with it
Been the land, cruisin' girl I went to school in it
Green Goyard bag, it got the tool in it
Everytime we fuck I act a fool in it

This is so all bad, nothin' good can come from this
Sweet but sad, I don't know love ruins a relationship
It will never last but it feels so good, guess I gotta deal with it

Look at these seats, they gator made
Friend or foe niggas never know (know)
Never know when you finna blow

Do you scrape up the curb
Then was sippin' some syrup
Then was blisted, twisted, since this pimp got in that heard
But I handle my issue
I got several pistols
That won't whistle, missiles not grisled from fatty tissue
Mississippi's my home
Till I'm die and I'm gone
I know I put it on my back, held that bitch up alone
Put no lable but docking
Pride split into fractions
I hit the ocean on heavy bustin' back at the crackin'

Rick Ross,"(Welcome to the world, welcome to the world)
You got your pop star, I'll be your rock star
When it's a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast, predictions wont stop
You get your fifteen, and then they take the spot

Lets go, lets go and then you're ready to go
Lets go lets go 'cause it's the end of the show
Lets go lets go so just get ready to go
Lets go lets go, lets go lets go

All the time that you were gone,
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Okay, hello, welcome to the world

She saw the bright lights, she caught the fever
She got contagious, she never leave it
So no more time spent and no more free shit
In fact this free ride has reached its destination

Lets go, lets go and then you're ready to go
Lets go lets go 'cause it's the end of the show
Lets go lets go and when its over, you'll know
Lets go lets go, lets go lets go

All the time that you were gone,
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Okay, hello, welcome to the world

Life's a tour, I'm so sure
The ex so pure before you exit girl
No more games, I confess
Far from lame I'm just so fresh
Who but me? It's the big boss
New kid on the block, Mr. Rudolf (Kevin)
Two stars, hold your applause
I hold it down he holds all guitars
Half my life I sacrificed, but I only came to party tonight
New chicks, get my drinks up
Every weekend we can link up
New rings, with the pink cuts
You'll need a passport, get your Minks up
Took my turn she love it, each touch
And when she closes her eyes this what she thinks of, Boss

All the time that you were gone,
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you're coming down to earth
Okay, hello, welcome to the world

Still hustlin' out the honda 
Just tryin' to take out my momma
Gotta problem nigga holla

Big money in this bitch if you didn't know
Big business minus the business suit
Even I look in the mirror like, ?Is it you??
And I say I must be the hottest if it isn't you

Stay fresh from my top to my tennis shoes
New coupe, no top, big tennis shoes
Never slipping, even on the side of a swimming pool
We don't get ridiculed, we get rid of fools

They said I couldn't play football, I was too small
They say I couldn't play basketball I wasn't tall
They say I couldn't play baseball at all
And now every day of my life I ball

And they say it ain't raining until someone assassinate
And I feel like M.L.K.
Yeah, I have a dream to be your worst nightmare
Now meet the boss of the cartel, Ross!

I'm a seven-nine satan, sitting on Lorenzzes
And I seem really patient, picture the equation
People taking pictures and they really getting flagrant
Flagging down my spaceship, sergeant sniffing for a fragrance

Yayo, yayo, he wanna sniff the yayo
Flying saucer on the hasa in the casa just to lay low
Make more money man that the model for the mob
Need a blowjob my model, get a model for the job

Go hard, no job, hustler, no prob

Forty around spending doe, flip ya for my kinfolk
Luxury tax on them packs if you didn't know

Bought a new crib, niggas feeling like I hid
3.2 but I just did it for the kids
More guns than a pawn shop, got my whole arm rocked
Keep the 760 double-parked in the wrong spot
Still hustling, Boss

Yeah, you gotta pay for this
I remember when I used to pray for this
This, this is classic, so shit you might never see again

Yeah, imagine this, no, imagine that
Gave me my sack like, good luck getting back
I'm like, ?The fuck I'm going outta there?
And if I'm not careful, be the same place they find him there

And I'm a winner if I make it cross the finish line
Putting food on the table like it's dinner time
And this is what you call sterotyping by far
Can you tell me why your dog keep sniffing my car?

Huh? Got the audacity to call me a liar
?So what you got in your trunk?? ?Oh, just a spare tire?
You niggas talk blow, well I sold mine
Like a bad crampe, it's locking up in no time

More time in the kitchen than I spent in the studio
Gangasta?s paradise and I ain't talking about Coolio
And I can't lie, still addicted to the odor
Got a ice cold Pepsi, still thinking Coke-Cola

Hold on, every morning I get dressed in black
While y'all half-assing, nigga my pants sagging
I'm getting money and my swagging black flagging

Million dollar status, fully automatic
Heavy on the innie and even harder on the women
If it wasn't for Reverend, I?d probably be out pimping and shit
Pops, my papi, has already hear me

I tied trapping, shit sent me to prison
Got mad and went to snapping, so homicide came to visit
I smell gun powder, so you got one hour
To come up with every damn dollar or your done dollar

It cost to ball dog
Especially when the players on your team consider you as the ball hog
You treating me like Shaq and you Kobe
But I ain't saying you owe me nigga
But act like you know me nigga

Rubber bands by the grands in a big bag
Pockets fat like I'm carrying a backpack
A couple grand for the Louie band nap sack
Understand I'm the man who you can't match
Money man minivan full of brown bags
Better grand any man never top that
Cause money and the gat pop those straps
Getting loot in the top drop right back
I ain't playing creep ya avenue and I'll blast
Bust shots like a new year day blast
And I ride all day like a buss pass
Grinding hard for the bread and the cash flow
Kick doors wave 4's where the cash go (where the cash go)

Yea its that real shit (feel me x2)
Laid back, lay back

Up in this pussy feel better than a lottery 
Don't lie to me 
I'm a hot commodity 
Six figures from a nigga cause he gotta be 
Don't lie to me I'm what you tryna be
I'm a big girl 
Not a lil' girl, 
I had a real man, move a real girl
We was real close, he had real money 
All he ever asked never steal from me
That was real shit 
I'm a real bitch
He told me stay real, I'm ma make you real rich 
Back to reality is this real?
Big house on the hill far from Lincoln field

I'm so hood yet I wouldn't stay 
Couldn't name a price that a nigga wouldn't pay 
Snap my fingers he'll be over here today, 
If I ask he'll rub my feet for days

Don't lie to me I'm a hot commodity [Repeat x2]

She's so real with all kind a ass
And 6 inch heels with LV bags

They said it was not so
Certain things your money can't buy
Like being this fly, 'til then, I'm just gon' ride
I'm like G-Rap with better transportation
On the road to the riches, reach my final destination
In the Lear, closer to Aaliyah, say a prayer
Hope I get to see her when I disappear from here, baby, yeah
But I don't see the endin' through these millionaire lenses
Just the two M's on the emblem
The partition roof, translucent and humidor
Refrigerators, where Ace of Spades and two I store
True story, my closet is like two stories
Straight to the happy endin', 'cause I don't do stories
Shawn Corey, real rap
The Maybach is bananas, peel back

You feel that? Young, c'mon

Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
Since way back, since way back
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back
Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach
8-track episodes, been doin' this since way back

Boss, can't be stopped now
I got too much cake

They pinchin' pennies, while I'm musclin' for mills
And that muscle be that muzzle, when I stuff it in your grill
Stuffed shells, thanks to crack, I crack crab and lobsters
Not all mobsters imposters, gotcha
Boy, I got a eagle view, standin' on my balcony
Can only stay a week or two, so many people out for me
I bulletproofed my Maybach, got a killer's intuition
Holdin' on that MAC-11, Makaveli premonition
Waitin' on my Suge Knight, one nation under God
Since I chose a thug's life, guess I gotta play my part
Never will I die, my name symbolized
The hustle for young killers coming from the other side
Some things your money can't buy
Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
I'm large, my black car, menagin' black broads
Massage for frauds, I'm livin' large, my fat rocks
It's eat to kill in the field of hip-hop
Runnin' up on the car, you get popped, mopped and dropped
I'm the boss",Maybach Music,2008

Standin' in his bloody boots
Yea I'm fresh outta boot camp

Counterfeit bills will get you killed
Now where the goons at
It's poppin' in Opa-locka, floppin' them candy paints
Chrome Dayton's, 12 pack of 12s in the seven trey
Still hustle everyday, Dade County be the place
Get murdered for a burger with a nickle-plated burner
Still burnin' rubber, bustin' rubbers

Tell the truth I ain't a lover

Super cats on the coupe, cover of the whole zone
Catch me in the Source, double XL rated
Next to million dollar Nextel
Workin', ain't trippin' other checks now
Super sells, so the pussy's platinum
Back to the basics
You in danger at 16 with the beam
One in the chamber aimed at that 0 7
Got the chopper close by
Head bussa from the Bronx
Rep my city every night
Hundred thousand worth of ice
Tight work, boy that's life work
Crystal clear starin' make your eyes hurt

Let me get the OK shorty, what's on your brain
I wanna know I see you looking, I been peeping your game
I get a rhythm, see me jooking t, teach you a thing
Or two, I'm in the dang zip, you wanna come entertain me boo?
We can do that, there, just gimme the go
Been a player unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say, cheers (Let's take a toast)
No wheat or white bread in my Pillsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O
All eyes if you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties(?) strolling all over the city

I know you see me staring girl
I see you looking at me
Go find and it's apparent girl
You feeling luck in the street

[Fat Joe]
Crack! How hot is hot?
She on fire baby burn the block
I even taught her how to turn to pot
You cool it off, and it come back rock (crack!)
Yes! I am him
Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standing on line
Black chicks is standing on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

Rick Ross,"Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for,
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds,
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred a**aults, and four murders,
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world:
Slim Shady!

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, b****es hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us.
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust.
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed.
B****es lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the s***
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.

[Chorus]

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I'll be dammed, just f***ed around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

[Chorus]

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
N**** on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a f***
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf***er I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the s***
I gets what the f*** I want so what I trick
Fat a** burgundy bags cla**y s*** Jimmy Choo shoes
I say move a b**** move

It's crazy in the club when I'm in there man, get up!
Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!
Now get on the dance floor off the chain
I say get up!

I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!

I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras

When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out

Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain

I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove

I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up!

Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside

I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn

While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout

I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood
Nigga wattup?

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands in the air
I said get up!

And get into it
You are now rocking with the Unit
I said get up!
And get into it
We gonna show you just how we do it

Everyone knows your the bosses girl.
My diamond, envy of all yo friends.
Big moves that we're making.
Got us on top of the world.
Your the bosses girl.
(I got nothing but love for you baby)
Baby your the bosses girl
(I love to pay yo bills baby)
Oh
(It excites me! You know what I'm talking bout?)

Fresh limousines, tall waterfalls.
Valet at the crib, my cars I love em' all.
Boss Lady, she the head bitch in charge.
She asks for head first so she gets it off top.
Champagne pop, rubber band knots.
Multi-millionaire no that other man not.
Let her call the shots, she want me on the top.
And the way I want it, it will be a month before I stop.
Kinda walk funny.
Stubble out the bed
Snap of her finger niggas picking up her tabs.
Walking through the mall got me carrying her bags.
I gotta pause cause this motherfuckers bad.

Baby you, you shine just like I do.
Just like your supposed to.
Everyone knows your the bosses girl.

Looking at my savings baby I can save ya.
Take ya parasol and go straight to Jamaica.
Ya man a boti boy, with the bumbaclots.

Tellin' lies getting niggas wives tied up and raped

Shorty what's on your brain, 'cause whatever is clever
Number one at whatever, I get bundles of cheddar
This that black cloud you deserve wonderful weather
Run a few errands (Ross), summers in Paris
Never shopping in clearance, don't make me embarrassed
She never a bird, but baby my parrot
Her flavor superb, I pay her with carrots
My house is her home, I made her a palette
Maybe being too modest, my shit more like a palace
Follow the waterfalls, as it makes you wetter

Look what I made brah, don't owe no favors
Have 700s, first one to get it
My car's a virgin, first one to hit it
Hit the rim shop, get 'em to the hood
Stop by her momma house, that's if I'm feeling good
Now I need a fifth, time to hit the strip
I'ma hit the club, I'ma buy the VIP
We spending money, I'm talking slick
I hope she ride me, I'm talking stick

Look up at the stars she like honey where the roof?
Pull up hear the dogs canaries they goin roof
Even once had a job pouring tar up on a roof
That boy had it hard no facade its the truth
So now when I Menage and get massaged its the proof
Proofs in the pudding and that baking sodas taking
Paper that I'm making got her taking photos naked
Listening to niggas like whistling at Wendy Williams
I flip my middle finger I'm chilling on 20 million
The rumors turn me on I'm masturbating at the top
These hoes so excited they catching every drop
I'm dodging the debacles like pot holes in Jamaica
We cut down the weed bury the paper on them acres
Martin had a dream bob got high I still do both but somehow I got by

Creflo pray Mike Vick payed bobby brown stray Whitney lost weight
Kimbo Slice on the pad when I write
That Mayweather money looking funny in the light
But who really cares we just throw it in the air
Celebrating wealth pouring moet in her hair
Excuse me her weave the blue is a weave
Trunk full of white car smell like blue cheese
That boy get salad beef bout movements
BM dubs on them big things looking foolish
Shawty sitting low big things popping
Tip on the glock from a crip up in Compton shooting at the cops
Fuck one time I gave her to the block
I fucked 1 time we boys in the hood and nigga you lil trey
Suppress ya appetite we taking ya lil' tray
Love my handgun but my chopper still the shit
Banned in 1994 but I'm to legit to quit
1996 kilos was the shit but that be better then roofing that shit be bad for ya skin
Niggas was ruthless and lord knows that I've sinned
But I thought about my future in the loops I could pin
Walked out on a gig and I turned to the streets
Kept my name low key I ain't heard from in weeks
I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically
I did it for the city but now everybody mad at me
Motherfuck em all they sweat from my balls
If I drop another album I did that for my dogs
10 Maybach's everybody riding big
I just sit back like look what I did
Then I bow my head and beg for forgiveness
Once I said my prayer everybody back to business

Smoking on a blunt in my own restaurant people looking from a distance think I'm big daddy kunk
Reincarnated spirit of a g beef ill make u dinner take a seat so we could eat
A Farrakhan aura paws on the pork you eat from the bowl while ya dog need a fork
Niggas ain't loyal snakes slithered in they coil im laughing at you
Cause kill you niggas when I'm bored

We stepping on ya crew until you motherfuckers crush
And making sweet love to every women that you lust
I love to pay her bills can't wait to pay her rent Curtis Jackson baby mama
I ain't asking for a cent
Burn the house down gotta buy another
Don't forget the gas can jealous stupid motherfucker
To another chapter paper that I captured
Caught up in the rapture off of gunshots and laughter
Homicide is humor and nigga you looking funny
Women love to stare cause they know they see the money
I open up my mind by opening bank accounts deposit a 100 stacks
Break up wont take it out baby that's a gift maybe you could live
I knew it wouldn't work but I just like to give used to run the street

And still my talent is yet to be challenged
Had new jet with my own pilot
No blastin' off, but flexin' DJ Khaled
My mom stressin' college but my crude sense of logic
Did a lude to my empty wallet

Try spittin' on a green tinted Accord
Which could mean a sentence up north
Where the homie was but back then
Doe was like a hoard it goldie love, it didn't exist
And office foley cuffs was after my wrists

Was not Beverly hills where we chilled
Imagine this, the nas 'n' rith had to get from rags to rich
I used to stand on rooftops, with two glocks
Figurin' how do I turn my timbalands to clocks

Now reptiles was left out about a watch
What is you thinkin'? Murk you
Plus the muscle that you bringin' is nothin' to me

Down with all of you gangstas to the roughest Jamiacans

Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin'
Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny

If you ballin' physics, nigga money never flow
Meanin' every day I'm livin', tryna stay on flow
Coming from a boss, I can predict a double cross
Handlers managin' money, they never come across

I spend in Africa, Magnamers, numbers involved
AK47s singin' win or by sum or you fall?
I dealt with brawls and those willin' to sell their soul
Over cars and clothes, man I'm talkin' petty hoes

Ask ma feddi grow, fuck a feet of spaghettio's
I'm club poppin' in Cali shout out to Ariel
Somebody dim the lights, triple black tuts
'Cause associated and the flesh is tryna catch up

I roam with niggas who destined to get a life sentence
Get their baby mama a Lexus for them nice visits
Ma nigga got a dub an' love to do the push ups
I got a million cash tryna get the kush up

Doin' a 150 miles and runnin'
Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin'

Gotta kick off your shoes, okay lets take a cruise
Here's my captain now relax, let him do what he do
Okay, who rolling spinach? cause I'm reeling the anchor
Smoke up up an acre a grass wake up in Jamaica
Couple nautical miles, I call my cubanos to cop
Puerto Rico for women, hit Barbados to shop
Living larger than life call this the yacht club
Before ya join us bitch ya gotta get your stax up
Shes walking back and forth, shes just itchen to fuck
And then I heard her whisper: ""Girl you know he 's rich as fuck""
Travel the seven seas, there is no better breeze
If he indulgen jealousy his ass better breathe
Man overboard cause hes goin overboard
Damn its over for him put that on my vocal chord.

Speaking creole and gentle men as I cruise the Caribbean
Oh Lord I'm a star down in saint barths
The fat Tommy Lee I made out with like 8 broads
Put up in Costa Rica, I get the most of features
She no speakay no englay, maybe Fat Joe could teach her
Smoking barrels of reefer, only the yacht club
Before ya join us bitch ya gotta get your stax up
Travel the seven seas, there is no better breeze
When we started selling keys that's just how we thought it would be
No one agrees with me, but that's just how it goes
I'm the greater genius no reference to the ugly clothes
I still hustle for dope, but no more me scuffing my

Tell you to kiss her ass, after you bought the bitch breast
Her head above average, my head above water
But now you could see my balace right off the coast of Florida
Im in ta fine fish with a slight lime twist
Veggies on the side of course, kush appetizez
Let your Mercedes chill, roll wit a navy seal
This the yacht club, wanna trust me your lady will,
Still spillen champagne, or is it merlow
Fuck it its fine wine, my bitch a vergo
I don't do the signs, unless there dollars on em
I'm the boss a theboat, cashmere collar on em,
Thinking a last year and all the moneys made
Now its corporate invest in, and amongst the other things

When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying ""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind

If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned

Proofs in dat pudding & dat bakin' sodas takin'

But I thought about my future in the loops like a pin
Walked out on da gig and I turned to da streets
Kept my name low key I ain't heard from in weeks

I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically
I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me
Mothafuck 'em all and sweat from my balls
If I drop anotha album I did dat for my dogs

My new Mercedes bright

Me knowing this how lady's like it
We counting thousand stacks
I'm on my 89th
She on her 21st
Feel like a pretty curse
But then the tables turn
She acting like she ain't concerned
Running with a wide receiver cause hes paper firm
Another angel came
Player got hes ankle sprained
Out for the season now she see that things are not the same
She made the wrong choice picked the wrong man
But baby I forgive now get with the program

Rick Ross,"People said I wouldn't make it, that I'd never get to the top
There was nothing they could say that would make me stop
So I had to keep pushing through the pain and the tears
All the things I've been through is why I'm standing here

That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
They was wrong, this the song of a champion
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

Coming up I use to watch TV look up at the screen
Then look at my mama tell her ma that's gon' be me
She said son you gon' be great, I knew it from the start
Your daddy was a poet that's how he captured my heart

It's in my blood, you ask me why I keep it real
Like talkin' in the flow asking how a nigga feel
Imagine how it feels
Waking up to nothing is enough to give you chills

Waking up to nothing is enough to make you kill
Enough to bring your daughter on a heist, unreal
You said you gotta song living life unreal
That's why I put my life in every song I kill, sing it girl

That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
They was wrong, this the song of a champion
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

I had a job too, niggas so what?
You haters make me laugh, how you hatin' so much?
Go head and do the math, watch the numbers add up
Picture me and Khaled rollin' to the Grammys, messed up
Keep running to The Runners when it's time to make a

I'm gunning at you suckas who ain't tryna feel this shit
[Incomprehensible] blastin' out a niggas whip
Throwing up a peace sign to all my hustlas on the strip
Top down in the Chevy yeah, you know I keep it pimpin'

And my pistol heavy, niggas know that ain't slippin'
Know that I'm on the grind, niggas know that ain't slippin'
My faith is on the line so you know I ain't slippin'
You trippin' and that's why

That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
They was wrong, this the song of a champion
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
Let me see your hands up if you a champion

Ladies put your hands up high
Came too far now to give up
We gotta keep reaching for the sky
It don't even matter say what you want

Fellas put your hands up in the sky
Nothing you could say that'll make me stop
We gotta keep reaching for the sky
I'ma keep going till I reach the top and that's why

Definitely livin' life, I gravitated to the light
I sacrificed a decade, now it's times every night
Let them suckas' spectate 'cause shorty I expect that
We still touching big weight and surely I invest that

Break it down the best way 'cause I know how to stretch that
Haters talking sideways and I could never stress that
Ready for the war though, I would never compromise
Mammy call me Gordo, you shine like summer time

That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing
They was wrong, this the song of a champion
That's why they can't tell me nothing, they can't tell me nothing

Ha, I got you gigglin' like I'm piglet
Oh that's the ticket, I hope you are more like Anita Baker than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady so let me quit it

Wrong section, this ain't where da cris get poured.
This where da pills get popped, dro get rolled.
Where the thugs posted and ducks get soaked.
Better keep ya head up and ya eyes open.
Might not wanna chill over here if ya ain't dumpin.
If we don't fuck with ya pussy nigga then keep floatin.
We gettin loose a lil bit, but everybody focused.
Cause everybody on yack and every body scopin.
Keep a unit in my face and back against the wall.
And hand on fire in case I gotta get off.

And we ain't friendly over here so give us some room
We ain't hard to find nigga just follow the fumes
Any nigga can't hang over here 'cause we got rules
Nigga look like he wanna do something, then do her too
Better keep your feelings to your self and stay cool

Got a team of them, honey feel free to bring with
G-5 waiting, fly away at my convenience

Gettin' high all week, catch me in the V

In a fast car super bad broad back seat

See the moon say goodbye and the sun greeting us like

Hello, Good morning

Hello, good morning
Hello, good evening

Rick Ross,"Love is a powerful word
And you've been on my mind so much, lately
How can I say this?

I'm always late to dinner days
Lookin' in her face
Marathon lovin' making but she win the race
I live a certain life 
It's hard for me to feel them safe
Toni Montana money greet the guards at the gate
Greeks and Gurads on the line no need to state
Versace couches sandals, candles and matching plates
This picture better than Bosciach greatest endeavor
Kissing shorty in the rain but I'm making her wetter

It beats every single time that I see your cell number,
Showing up on my phone.
It beats every single time that you're near me, 
I'm not ready yet just leave me alone.
I feel it deep in my veins, It's trying to say it's okay
But I ain't ready to go.
Without my permission, my heart is on a mission
It's got a mind of it's own.

I say no, 
And my heart just goes
With no control
So I'm trying to flow with it.
I'm so gone 
And It shouldn't have told me, 
Never should of told my heart.
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
Never of have told my heart
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
And my heart is saying
Boom boom clap 
Boom boom clap 

And my heart is saying
Boom boom clap 
Boom boom clap (I never should of told my heart)
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
(I'm so in love)
Pitter pitter, patter patter
Everything is scatter, scattered
Something is the matter with me
Boom like the radio,
Loud like a stereo,
This is how my heart beats
It's like a broken record, but I can't eject it,
Feels like it's on repeat.
I got a new confession
Loves my new obsession
My heart's talking to me
It said, boom boom boom

I say no, 
And my heart just goes
With no control
So I'm trying to flow with it.
I'm so gone
And It shouldn't have told me, 
Never should of told my heart.
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
Never should have told my heart
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
And my heart is saying
Boom boom clap 
Boom boom clap 

And my heart is saying
Boom boom clap 
Boom boom clap (I never should of told my heart)
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
(I'm so in love)

I'm chilling court side Jordan six rings
You know we court side till we get a six rings
We both on common ground it ain't a big thing
But when we come around they make it a big thing
Still on the block in that drop chicken box
They askin' what that is, is that a different from Watch?
When I'm in stunt mode I got to let the city watch
Oh it's the clear core jet to a chili spot

I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
Never should of told my heart 
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
And my heart is saying
Boom boom clap 
Boom boom clap 

And my heart is saying
Boom boom clap 
Boom boom clap (never should of told my heart)
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
(I'm so in love)
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love
(I'm so in love)
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love (never should of told my heart)
Boom boom clap 
Boom boom clap 

And my heart is saying
Boom boom clap 
Boom boom clap (I'm so in love)
I-I-I'm so-o-o-o in love (never should of told my heart)
Should of kept it from my heart",So in Love,2010

Rick Ross,"I love it though
I love it though

Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan

I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us
May the God's be with us
And that magic hour
I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions
Oh she do it,
What happened to Religion?
Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up
She casually allure
Text message break up, the casualty of tour
How she gone wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the ass hole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stuntin' on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like ""this what you really wantedt, huh?""
What we argue anyway, oh I forgot its summertime

Put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan

(Satan, Satan, Satan)

I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

When the sun go down its the magic hour
The magic hour
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies
You got green on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Don't leave while your hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered you jerk, she said ""you are what you eat""
You see I always loved your sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme that's Dior Homme not Dior homie
The crib Scarface couldn't be more Tony
You love me for me could you be more phoney

Uh put your hands to the constellations
They way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' Rose all along
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin' runnin' signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore G.4's at the Clearport
When it come to tools fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars D.M.V. though it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the nights over
God bless the man I put this ice over, uh
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller

Do the rap and the track triple double no assist
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch acting like I owe her shit
I heard the beat the same raps that give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so yeah I had to act sane

Cause you will never get on top off this

Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh

Travel in your mind, explore your sexuality 
Melt your imagination and mold it into reality

But none of them overrated 
There no others, you the one 
Our destiny is to make it 
Gotta thank you just for sharing your world 
Its so real, an inspiration for no reason 
But thinking that I'm incapable of taking on the duty of making you interchangeable 
The thought is sensational, its perfect bliss 
I'm ready to take the milky way to your Hershey's kiss 
You know my tongue's got batteries in it 
The bedroom, we lose calories in it and start families in it 
And don't worry 'cause the situation's under control 
So let me dive in your heart and swim around in your soul (Luda)..

Take me I'm yours, shawty 
As we rock to the left, rock to the right 
Lend me your body and we'll rock it all night 
Don't leave us on this floor, shawty 
The door's to the left, I parked on the right 
Tell the niggas holla back, tell your girls goodnight..

I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave: you dealin' with some rich niggas
We done lost symbols speakin' cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom, valuable like gifts of gold

I embark on life; my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can't crack
I understand the folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won't fail, but a lot of men will

Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo

Free Lancer

Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors

All-black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce--guess you made it nigga
All-white neighborhood; you they favourite nigga
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK

Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
Right now I could rewrite history
I stopped writing so fuck it
I'll do it mentally

Hear me clearly: if y'all niggas fear me
Just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales
Go to hell; this is God engineering
This is Hail Mary pass; y'all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It's amazing that I made it though the maze that I was in
Lord, forgive me; I never would've made it without sin
Holy water my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red hot; I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus piece flooded, but thou shall not covet
Keep your eyes off my cupboard; I'm a bad motherfucker
It's 'hov; hust say you love it

If I ever die, never let it be said I didn't win
Never, never say
Never say Legend didn't go in (I'm-a go in)

I got the Porsche, I was so ecstatic
Hundred grand a day, my operation is so elaborate
Credit card scams, that was for the fagots
Mother fuck window shopping, boy I gotta have it
Now my shit be booming all across the atlas
Gucci puchi money long, now we call him Alex
Had to move from Dade because that shit was local
Pick up the mansion and I sat that bitch back down in Boca
My baddest bitch is Latin, but they call me loco
Till I fuck 'em in they ass out in Acapulco
I'm thinkin' money, every moment thinkin' money
I bust a nut, then I'm back to thinkin' money
My wrist froze, my mind blow, I'm off slow, my eyes closed
You gotta judge a man by his principles
Teflon Don, I am invincible

My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm riding dirty, my dick clean
She talk dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch, I'm M.C. Hammer, I'm about cream
I got thirty cars, whole lot of dancers
I take 'em everywhere, I'm M.C. Hammer
Started selling though, I'm too legit to quit
When it's hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick

It's Gucci,
Hammer's movin' on my chest when I hammer dance
Seventy grand make my jeans sag like some hammer pants
Ambulance, ambulance, 9-1-1, 9-1-1
It's Gucci Mane, yeah, that's my name,
I'm goin' thug, I'm goin' thug
Blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up
I'm like M.C. Hammer, I put that on my grandma
I ride through East Atlanta in my new Ferrari
It's up for fifty-eight if you don't have one, sorry
I let you borrow mine, I think I'm M.C. Hammer
I never borrow jewelry, I'm takin' naked dancers
It's an occasion, a celebration at Central Station
With Haitian hos and Jamaicans I'm tryin' to make it
Old school, want to race it, we can test it
I'm flexin', I leave a sucka egged-up for breakfast
Throwin' spit, throwin' up respect, and I'm well-connected
I'm M.C. Hammer, hundred-fifty on the kitchen, it's Gucci

My gun dirty, my brick clean
I'm riding dirty, my dick clean
She talk dirty, but her mouth clean
Bitch, I'm M.C. Hammer, I'm about cream
I got thirty cars, whole lot of dancers
I take 'em everywhere, I'm M.C. Hammer

Purple Rain over Central Park; chillin' with my goons
Big Pop's and Sade's, Cirocs and Chardonnay
My Cassie's sassy, so my penthouse's my balloon
We doin' it big, it's goin' down, nine-eleven
I'm doin' it big, pullin' up in a nine-eleven
I been tryna fuck for months, baby girl, it's now or never
Got the condo on the beach, hope through our storms we shall weather
We shinin' when it's pitch dark
Yeah, this bitch a movie, but this time I play a big part
Uh, fuck the marketing, look at what I'm accomplishin'
I'm beatin' niggas by margins bigger than Fran Tarkenton

All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eye to the sky, that's where you'll find me
'Cause we are, we are, super high
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Bring your sexy ass here, baby

I wanna buy my bitch every bag
And she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back
I wanna take my bitch around the globe
Hawaii, hand glidin' in the mountains, shittin' on these hos
Rare bottles by the barrel
Poppin' Giuseppe tags like it's American Apparel
20,000 up in Barneys, haters'll never harm me
Rick Owens on me, bombers for my whole army
Andale, andale, baby, move fast
She drop it down and bring it back; I like that
I wanna buy my bitch every bag

Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high
You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine

Women of a caliber
Only seen in magazines and calendars
And I'm sitting with Miss October
'Cause my birthday's in October
Strawberry and her Rose on
I can see it in her eye as she wink and she toast me
And later on we gonna mosey
To a place where less populated and get cozy

If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss; take a look

Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me

Rick Ross,"Smoking the best spliff in a brand new Benz
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin
Lookin' in the mirror but I don't see much
Staring in the streets so I don't sleep much
Watching the snakes so they don't creep up
But the way I'm gettin' dis money niggas cant keep up
You niggas can't keep up
Niggas got beef but it cant be much
I'm still walking through the crowds like I cant be touched
Top back all black Gretzky puck
Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck
Damn, she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didn't even know the bitches exist
Quarter milli for the muthafucka'
No insurance on a muthafucka'
Ain't life a bitch, but you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody knows I'm a a lot of people's threats
Biggie smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me lord will I be poor and broke
Tell me lord will I be dealing dope
I wanna take my momma to the Poconos
But only lords knows

To all the love ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me, why?
Thought having everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My god, I'm scarred
I have tattooed tears of joy

Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this
Young rich muthafucka' still uneducated but dammit a nigga made it
God damn a nigga made it
Crib bigger than a church Lord know I'm blessed
Five different lawyers Lord know I'm stressed
A punch in the face get you 300 K
Ask Blair Knight he back makin' minimum wage
Another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch Vivica nice
And I'm still swimming in ice
I'm just living my life
I'm just living my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next mournin' I can tell you how the pussy taste
I got expensive taste

At least they cant see me cry
And I ask when someone wants to be me, why?
Thought having everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My god I'm scarred
I have tattooed tears of joy

Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this
Not to dwell on the the past
But to keep it real I gotta represent for Emmitt Till
All the dead souls in the field
Lookin' at my Rolly it's about that time
White man got a problem wit' mine
And we suppose to be shy
The revolutions televised
Bobby still on the rise

Goodbye
To all the love ones I leave behind

Exotic red-bottom sole body glitter in gold

Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win

All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there",All I Do Is Win,2010

Rick Ross,"The time is now on everything
Took my heart away from money, I ain't interested in fame
And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless, it’s something that’s in your veins
And I put that on my name

Uh, the only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times were harder than the cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking at the niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' rollin' fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it
Aint get my message, was a signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I’ll be the corner back
Me and Folarin MMG gon bring that Warner back

For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

(It speaks for itself. Define Ambition for me?)

My ambition to win, just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? It’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something thats in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change

For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

Well wishes to my opposition
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I aint spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically the MC
Lebron shit, I was heading six after twenty three
And family is everything and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas, fuck you and your position!
They play surface so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don’t say it
You know you real, we gon feel it

Rick Ross,"It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna

Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got 'em feeling like he's Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue in the insides potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit I'm made of that
Cocaine parties like the seventies, I cater that
You know what fame is? Sitting with the woman
Of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is? Flushing two bricks
And tryna have a nigga strain it out the drainage

[Chorus]
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like you Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

Grew up watching momma car repoe'd
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velor, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real niggas sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why
Show 'em all love, the bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

[Chorus]

Testarossa top models, G fours
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambiance
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilate's on
Where the kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans pouring in

Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like 
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money 
Just a bittersweet symphony 

I play these keys, handle dope Barry Manilow 
The game a bitch but at times she sweet as cantaloupe
Hit the road, key of coke in the manifold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes 
Japanese denim, down south numbers 
Hit it once trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble 
Do the speed limit, all gold shoes 
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too 
I'm tipping strippers but I call it penny pinchin' 
She told me shit but I could get her titties lifted 
My new crib got it's own city limit 
Motherfucker got his own city in it 
Blue marble on the floor 
Where the salt water 
I'm the boss this player holes like a golf course

Walk the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves 
So they swarm to my honeycomb, hide out for the bees

Money countin' sound bytes 
Machine gun fire 
Name ringin' through like the town like 
Church bells ringin' 
Know where he was found like? 
Colombian necktie over hospital gown, right 
She live on her knees 
I live in a condo in the trees 
The air's a little thinner that I breathe 
Iron Man Audi, let the top strip tease 
My life is slow motion but the watch screamin' freeze 
Yughck, young nigga gettin' money 
The feds dragged neck, couldn't take nothin' from me 
The decoy car is a crash test dummy 
What follows is a hundred of 'em wrapped like a mummy

Just a bittersweet symphony 

And they gon' risk a hundred lives 
So they could rock a hundred whites 
The guests look like a hundred lights 
Man when blade down my city, cried a hundred nights 
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred types 
Every wrong I do, I'm stayin' tryna do a hundred rights 
Got her for cheap, a better price 
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White 
And don't worry 'bout the info 
From where they ride Pintos, couldn't afford Enzos 
'Cause everybody know, keys open doors (keys-keys open doors) 
But bricks open windows 
Countin' a hundred hundreds, more by more 
Built this form the tile up, floor by floor 
Talk shit, I send 'em door by door 
Made for the Snow White life, four by fours my nigga

Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh

Big black nigga, and an icy watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Counts the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordan's kick 'em off they might high, swish!
I'm swimming in the yellow bitch, boss
In the red nine eleven looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof 'till he got hit the fifth time
Drop Palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I'm the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected, got killers off in Chicago

That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E
Five letters, YMCMB

You know the rules, kill 'em all and keep moving

So don't make it come alive
Rip yo ass apart than I put myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever (huh)
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon' bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, poppy gave me forty bricks
Son of a bitch, than I made a great escape
Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus
Niggas gather 'round, got gifts for each and all of y'all
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up

Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front 
Step out on the block all the bitches they still in shock 
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop 
Pandemonium, causing pandemonium 
Half a million for the same car we rolling in 
Pandemonium, pandemonium 
We the number one niggas your bitch notice it 
 
Million ways to make this money, you gon get it 
On the grind twenty four I'm with it 
YSL swagger, wrist wear frigid 
Jumping out the Phantom like a motherfucking midget 
Money knocking at the front door I'm like ""who is it?"" 
It's Benjy, tell my lil nigga ""goin get it"" 
Cause I've been counting all this dirty paper for a minute 
Lamborghini dreaming thinking how I'm spend it 
I'm like one's for the money, two's for the show of it 
Three's for the bitches that be fucking for the hoe of it 
Four for my niggas that be stacking it and then blowing it 
You would think I had a curfew the way I'm going in 
Look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium 
Probly got them keys in, he like my custodian 
I was tryna bag a brick you was Nickelodeon 
I was in them trenches getting down and dirty serving it 
We's part the reason that them Churches got some services 
The morgue could afford just cause we was doing murdering 
Nigga called my phone talking reckless I aint heard of it 
Fuck ya girl, give her back I'm courteous 
I can keep a secret with Vicky have a menage with Nicki
And be out London with Lauren and telling Megan Good morning 
Catch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton with Paris 
From Hollywood to the hood, I want a mom and I swear that I want em all 
Wanna fuck em all 
Had my niggas down so I'm screaming fuck the law 
Monday night wrestling, I'm so fucking raw 
She gon wipe me down, I'm gon brush her off 
I'm way harder than the concrete 
I say what my mind speak 
Word to the homie Ross I can get that nine Piece 
For the low that nine cheap 
Call me if you want it, haters see me 
And I'm stuntin' got 'em sick to they stomach 

[Chorus] 

Whole time, see that fly shit I've been on 
All the girlfriends fall in line from my spin off 
That's game bitch aint shit 
Nudies and some J six 
Where I'm from it's cold 
And niggas get at you like handkerchiefs 
God bless you unless you was disrespectful 
Bitches disappoint you but money won't ever stress you 
They say I'm special as Devin Hester on fourth down 
So all that shit you niggas kicking we aint worried about 
Catch me at tha carry out, mumbo sauce and half and half 
Fliest niggas out here, period no maxi-pad 
Bitch I got a right to brag 
Bitch I got a right to boast 
Presidential suite and bitch 
And I never use my right to vote 
My vision enormous, my bitches is gorgeous 
And I am dead serious, bitch I spit with embalming 
Shout out to lil g, shout out Tre and Mohammad 
That boa shit we get paid with death over dishonor 
I'm known as Obama's don't I know no-one in congress 
These bitches love me all the way, u got sorta's and kinda's 
Sort of remind you, why you don't call no vagina 
Just give em awesome intercourse and ignore there inquires 
Quietly becoming a top ten 
You dreamed of getting cream, best believe I'm John Deere 
Green as mont-clair shit, earth tones in the winter 
Purp rolled in a rillow 
I am on my John Lithgow 
Out of this Third Rock, nigga it it out 
I am on my Tom Brady y'all niggas is Eric Crouch 
What the bloodclot, Tommy Frazier fuck yourself 
I can see your album coming 
That shits like a sucker punch 
Here for breakfast, fuck for lunch 
Dinner time she bring a friend 
Write my shit so vicious 
Y'all are like snitches you can't see the pen 
Always on some new shit CNN 
Shittin on these niggas like I need a pen

Rick Ross,"I apologize I don't recollect your name (Ooh, baby I don't know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame (Look at your body baby)
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?

Look, another day another dollar
She hate me when I leave cuz when I leave I never call her
That's life shit, alright, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call you gone be like ""Boo why we haven't Skyped yet?""
And I Skype, bet you say ""Lay where my flight at""
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more than hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive
Women will sell they soul just to buy some attention
I need something to hold fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road don't ask me no questions
Please, fear watchu don't know

I apologize I don't recollect your name (Ooh, baby I don't know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame (Look at your body baby)
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?

Don't remember how I met her but I know I won't forget her
If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see heaven
She say she from Seattle, she twenty and some change
Before I get to T.I.A. I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane Chi town over here
We spend some time and get some wine have some miles from Harrod's
I told her this here's overrated but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off in Dallas I'm headed to some money
TSA be laughing all them rubbers in your luggage
I know Ima always leave em but I swear I'll always love em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another

I apologize I don't recollect your name (Ooh, baby I don't know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame (Look at your body baby)
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl how could we get that way?

Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood
That baggage claim awaiting miss thang outta St. Louis
Know she shining bright, got on my Cartier,
She my Billie Jean we Minaj with Mary Jane
See we city hop, Vegas to LA, brings a lotta joy Bugatti boy that's Laina Lane
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench,
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs
Marc Jacob the makeup Gi-Givenchy consumer Gianni Versace connoisseur a carnivore
Accountable for half a million uncounted for

I apologize I don't recollect your name (Ooh, baby I don't know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame (Look at your body baby)
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time

We both said that things will change
But it's still the same shade of grey
I get mad you walk away
When it all just start to fade
I know you're fed up so am I
But we just can't say goodbye
Boy, you know I love you
But I just can't go on no more
Feelin' this way

You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right?
Just can't get it right
Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right
No matter how hard we try

I got her looking at me sideways
Live every night like it's a Friday
My conversations are so monumental
Licking on her ear, I'm whispering a couple riddles
She fell in love with my technique
I made her call me boss when in the bedsheets
We both coming from the same place
All in her both coming at the same place
Still on my dope boy swag
Top down on my Cam'ron, Oh boy swag
Played the hand we were dealt from the beginning, baby
Ya the dealer, cut the deck, while we winning baby

You got me sayin' why, why, why?
Can't we get it right?
Just can't get it right
Don't know why, why, why?
Can't we get it right
No matter how hard we try

Can't we turn love around
We build it up to break it down
If you knew the way I feel
You would know that this love is real
But live in heaven, go to hell then
Go right back, across the lesson
Tired of stressin', get the message
I can't live in this depression no more
Boy, you know I love you
But I just can't go on feeling like this no more

And I think it should be you

Rick Ross,"All we wanted was opportunity
Just Blaze, Lord Knows!

It’s your worst nightmare, it’s my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I’m going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don’t trust these hoes at all
But that’s just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple porn stars that I’m ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna are my only role models
Heffer and Jordan my only role models
That’s why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it’s whatever if somebody wan’ make it a thing
I’m more concerned what niggas thinkin’ about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields they’re making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I’m workin’ overnighters right by the motel
Drug money, outfit record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin’ team
Matchin’ Rollies for real, matchin’ Rovers for real
Places they say they’ve been, we’ve actually going for real
I’m really killin’ shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin’
I’m going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin’ for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that’s living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they’d ever survive in this era
In a time where it’s recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin’ fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yup
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I’m a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I’m hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin’ emotion don’t ever mean I’m a pussy
Know that I don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I’m heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost the rate up, it’s time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin’ spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That’s why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

You know I love this
Yolo, ""You Only Live Once""
I’m going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal

I fell in love with the pen, started fucking in ink
The hustle’s an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I’m talkin’ Carnival cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It’s the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every by week, shit, I’m bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz of that bubble double R
Headlights flickin’, lookin’ like a fallin’ star
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin' ye' like anime
I run the game but the ladies think I’m running game
Mink coats making women wanna fornicate
Rosay and Drake, I’m gettin’ cake, nothin’ short of great huh!",Lord Knows,2011

Block is my attire
Keep them sticks off in that cupboard nigga

Fuck em once, I fuck em

Make my bitches stomp her

Drive it, bet I own it

Twelve gauge stop a nigga heart like a bowl of Aspirin
I hold automatics, let your man hold the casket
Murder game cold as Aspen, body found in the trash bin
First forty-eight, they don't find me, case closed
Like a rehabilitation spot in Bobby Brown nose
Take em back to Boyz in da Hood when I pull the pump out
Something like C-Murder on Worldstar when I dump out

[Chorus]

Ain't nothing changed but them bullets in my clip
I still pull it, still bully niggas on the strip
Beef, I cook it fully with the fifth
And I ain't got no pets, I put a bullet in ya bitch
A nigga with a gun in his hand who won't bust it?
Like a bitch with a dick in her hand who won't suck it
This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing
Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone
Drive by or walk up on, I just stop, breathe, aim cock squeeze
Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam
So your block up on machines while the pussies run and scream

[Chorus: x3]",Heavy Artillery,2011

Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean

We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy

But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient,
Me and forty back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations,
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking, watch me take it

Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm  out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair

'Cause I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

Tailor made black linen
Escalade with a made man in it
Rose gold shades with the rozay lenses
Pink champagne and the flow so endless
All I seek is perfection
Ain't no secrets I'ma eat that for breakfast
Keep her close to me like lyrics
She spoke to me in the middle of the winter
So I'ma let her close to me

All these stars out
And these people know my name
I can be so pretentious
But he likes, all the same
And these lights are glowing
But he don't want none
He rather chill and hug me
Baby, he could be the one

[Chorus]

You want me to trust you
But how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions
And I don't wanna listen
Messing with my heart and I just got it back

I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

I've been here before
I don't know if you're the type
Who's gonna be keep me sure
When the dark creeps in my mind
Will you be there baby?
Or will you let me go?
Can you stand the pressure?
This is what I need to know

[Chorus]

You want me to trust you
But how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions
There's so many lessons
And I need for you to have my back
I just wanna love you, baby
I don't wanna waste no time
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

All white in the winter
Green in the summer
Painted the Lamborghini same color marijuana
Floating in the six til I made her seasick
Wetting these niggas up with this amg kit
Earned a reputation repping up and down the boulevard
Me and baby Bonnie and Clyde off in the rental cars
Propositions through politicians are common now
My money tall we can never be on common ground
Peel the top back getting higher than the higher power
Making love in the penthouse then it's cianara
Fell in love with shawty blame it on the chemistry
Tools on the low fools really envy me
Money multiply s600 Benz
Me and my shawty lie we a team to the end
Monopoly shopping sprees imagine what we can spend
Me and my shawty live we gonna do this shit again

Don't break it
Please, don't break my heart
No, don't break it
Please, don't baby
I just wanna love you, baby
I know it from the very start
Wanna be your only one, baby
Please don't break my heart

You got me living on a prayer
You could be a millionaire or broke
We won't pretend
You know you're more than a friend
Just because you love me
Imma love you 'til the end
I got you
You got me
I like you
You like me
And we could do everything
I wanna love you, oh, baby, baby, baby

Rick Ross,"Shorty bad as my son is, pretty face and no stomach
Was the city’s most wanted ‘til I said gimme yo number
Youngest nigga I’m stuntin’, no more Civics from Honda
Money comin’ in bundles, that’s the reason she wanna

Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up

I keep a vest on my chest, to cover my heart
I’d rather fuck in the light, ‘fore I make love in the dark
'Cause she was fuckin’ me right, it felt like love from the start
Was gettin’ money on tour, so we was lovin’ for fall
But first we go together then break up, tears drip on her makeup
Fuck all night ‘til we wake up, and like George Gervin we lay up
'Cause all them lies I made up, it’s big checks no pay cut

Floor seats in Florida, Heat game vs Lakers
Shorty on my team now, it was us versus them haters
And everybody they talk bad, when they talk that she take up
She mess our flavor, young boy get paper,
And all I know is go hard, and every time
I touch that ball I go swish

She know it’s game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (Don’t miss), I don’t miss (Don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

Sittin’ back with this paper fallin’ in my lap
Feelin’ isolated nothin’ but them hundred stacks
When your money up tell me who you’re supposed to trust
Every night a different woman, fuck your money up
My bank account in shape, I could run with Puff
I came to put you down shorty so what the fuck is up
Since I met her she can’t keep that pussy off me
On the pill, Ima kill that pussy softly
Back to back time to show you how a gangster move
Keys to the pad, talkin’ infinity pools
V12’s ain’t a thang, time to change your name
Paper stuffed in her purse can’t hear her phone ring

She know it’s game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (Don’t miss), I don’t miss (Don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

Homie picture me rollin’, all them bitches be on me
They be fishin’ for compliments, I’m just fishin’ off Boca
Made a grip off them vocals, got a gift with the vocals
So much over these hoes should have been on a poster
Infatuated to say the least
He lay it weak, I lay you once you lay a week
Wale a freak, he know it doe, no go with hoes
When it come to showin’, I am working with totem pole
That’s head on head, she give me head, I give her glow
I’m in her body, I’m in her head like quote unquote
The coldest flow, the flyest combination was voila
Au revoir to my rivals, double M genius shotta

She know it’s gametime when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (Don’t miss), I don’t miss (Don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

From the night to the morn’, yeah she tryna lay
Got a freaky, freaky game and she tryna play
Couple more shots baby can you make it stay, stay up
Lay up, lay up
Might just slap the backboard, give you what you ask for
Lay up",Lay Up,2012
Rick Ross,"Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I think Ima dedicate this one
To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here
Dream chasers

Yeah, it was all a dream
On the corner servin' all them fiends
Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team
The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings
Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame
And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains
When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame
So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'

Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition
Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams
Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
And this money shit ain't funny, all the shit it brings
You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean
And birthdays was the worst days
Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday
And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day
Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace
Philly, we back!

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I'm blunted, you wanna see life's meaning?
On the radio, Al Green, while Mom's cleanin'
Mom's singing along with the songs
And shortly I learned the words to 'em
Nerf balls, I threw 'em
But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus
Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic
I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle
Whose wife left him down in the bottom
Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem
My liquid money's a hypnotist to your Mrs

Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist
Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is
Mystique like Sade
Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment
I ain't tryna do too much
Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough
But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle
I made it so I'm chillin' now
Transparent ceiling now


Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

The chorus cinematic, going back to Cali
Young street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's
Jewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler
I could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter
Domino effect, you in that magic city
Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli
Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly
Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city
Honor thou mother, go to war for my brother
Giving sufficient funds to significant others
Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature
More war came from the bottom so I know the war
Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm
Talking cash over salads, heavy croûtons
Cuban Linx's equivalent to having suits on
Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed",Maybach Curtains,2012

Cameras in the ceiling, Seline on my arm
We get ghost, you already know what it is
Money stuffed in my bag
Maybach shit

Bright lights and dark corners, it's night embark on us
Refugees running wild Wyclef with a Sig Sauer
Nothing to lose, I was starving from the start
Now the same cat drive in Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper
The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty
Billionaire bid, wrists on chill
Standing in the field of dreams tryna see a hundred mil
These boys going blind they just happy being free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a key
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all decease
These boys snort lines I'm fine just sipping wine
Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always running late, quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel, quick to match it with my toolie
Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit
Red or blue, do you, as long as you're getting rich
Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change
These niggas acting like they want a war!
When it come to whacking niggas I done won awards
Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?
I'm riding in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a report
Amsterdam state of mind, I just gave you a tour
I'm laughing at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn

I'm Barry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Raw blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm living through these beats

Burning Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

I'm speaking on unwritten laws the code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into
At a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie!
And that could take a long time!

Never question mine, my mind is so inventive
Quadrupled my net worth and threw in a few incentives

Two mil, the jewels, no flaws, ask them lames

Never in the draft, but that boy know he going
Throw me a bone, get me a brick
That's on the Quran I'mma go and get the chips
Go and get a rental, I got a cute bitch
She's showing some potential, so we taking trips
Nigga, assets last while memories fade
I'ma patch that ass I don't get paid
I'm a Mike Tyson type of, typewriter sniper
Double M life 'til a nigga pay the piper
I love when the beat dip
Same way I love to see a key flip
Go and pay your mama house off
Get sucked off, shorty wipe your mouth off
I'm alive, you could never write the South off

The good times don't last long
Just rewind the last song
We all shared some great times
As I read some great rhymes

What we does, is what dreams are made of
Come and get your love, all of this love

500 for the car that I got on the strip
That's another 100, what I got on my wrist
800 for the jar that I'm about to twist
It's a female strand, you know life's a bitch
As I get high, move my curtains to the side
Age like fine wine, ambitions they never die
Niggas get abused like boys at Penn State
Greatest that ever did it, decided my own fate

Dreams, everything that we are
The life that we're living, baby it's ours
Dreams, money, homes, and cars
Baby that's a given, I'm talking about every fantasy
Be good real with me, still don't mean something, ooohhh, oh
Baby come with me and live the dream

It's a whole nother different element
It's Maybach roman numeral four
You couldn't fathom this, you couldn't imagine this
You can't produce this, you won't reproduce this

I'll be dreaming of you
I'll be dreaming of you
You'll be making it come true
I'll be dreaming of you
I'll be dreaming of you
I'll be dreaming of you
You'll be making it come true

Treat that bad bitch like a bad check 'cause I cash that and I bounce

You can't stop a bullet, this one for the money
Secret indictments, Porsche costs me 200

Fuck your insinuation, work come from Venezuela
Love me some skinny bitches, fat boy just 'bout his paper
Hustle while niggas gossip, hating, that switch the topic
Jump in my 911, 2 bricks in my compartment!
She let me smell her pussy!
I know you smell the money!
Still smell the gunpowder
911, 100 miles and running

I bow my head, I pray to God
Survival of the fittest help me hold my chopper lord!
If I die today, on the highway to heaven
Can I let my top down in my 911?
In my 911?
In my 911?
In my 911?

Rick Ross,"Got on my darkest shades, this man is made
Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness
Physical fitness, home economics
In the kitchen digital scales producing the product
Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave
In the coupe with the tec, it's the home of the brave
They wanna know names, they toting them thangs
Never wanted the fame, just wanted the range
I needed some change, mama needed a raise
She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage
I'm feeling the same, all these criminals paid
Wearing Bally's and gold, I'm selling dope shameless to say
And maybe one day I could put this pain away
Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

Before I was a fetus, had the genes of a leader
I mean look at my features, educated my teachers
I was calling them plays, you were still in the bleachers
Booby gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers
Now I'm roaming the block, car missing the top
Meaning missing a roof, hope you listening y'all
I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows
Even shed a few tears, I travelled that road
Went from walking on gravel, now I'm riding on vogues
50M's in the bank, I get me 200, I'm gone
Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say
All the money in the world can't take this pain away
It's just another story at the campfire
Court side seats with the franchise
I think about my niggas doing 25
Shining bright, who am I for you to criticize?

Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

I'm smoking psychedelics, I hustle like a felon
Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chilling
Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poise
First you stack you some money, then go to war with them boys
Anybody can get it, hand his man some tissues
Better ring the alarm, cause we bringing them pistols
Have her singing them songs, speaking on sensitive issues
These emotional niggas, and most of them killas
They moving in silence, but they follow your Twitters
These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures
See I live by the code, that the mafia wrote
When he ran his mouth, me I rather smoke
I'd rather listen, he had to ask permission
I had to make a way, I had to act commission
Until the day I'm slain, the commission remains
Now I'm worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say

Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me gap
Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek
Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released

I could ship her something, you know that December coming

I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish
I was skipping the classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest

When 16 ain't enough, having a dope beat, dope idea
16 bars ain't enough!
How the fuck can I squeeze my whole life into a 16 bar verse?
You know, so many different levels, when 16 ain't enough, to living your life
Depicting with your wordplay, when 16 ain't enough, exactly what life means to you
16 ain't enough

I know y'all gonna feel me on this one
You gotta feel me on this one

Huh, it's funny how things change, funny how time fly
More than my feet travel, the more that I feel fly
More that I make now, the more that the chicks smile
She call me a local nigga, I opened a Swiss account
Eisenhower status Etta James on the dash
John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac
Seville, feel my life on the real
We the Last Poets so this is a world premiere
Rolling like Mick Jagger, the women just getting badder
All I see is the money, cream, Eric Clapton
And all I wanted was one 16 ain't enough
Talking that fast money 15 every month
When your people labelled poor, that motivated me more
Everything I ever wore was once worn before
Roll with the punches now it's box office numbers
Dressed like Sammy Davis, steamin' my marijuana
Double MGs, double M fees
We in every hood, nigga, government cheese
Yachts and Yacht Masters, Old Dirty Bastard
Floor seat for the Heat paper that I'm stackin'
Better put away a penny for the rainy days
Pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away
Livin' like Scottie Pippen, dribble riddles for vittles
Started off with a scribble, now I'm flowing a river
She say my heart cold I'm naming my son December
Whitney died night before the Grammys, damn, what a memory
Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed
Born broke had to use a nigga's instincts
Now I get a hundred racks for the 16
Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
Niggas hating, I'm just watchin' on the big screen
3 stacks on the beat and the kicks mean

When 16 ain't enough, you know how sometimes you got so much to say but
When 16 ain't enough, they on they only give you 16, heh
Man it's like I mean I got so much to say ya know
The world has said so much to me, I just wanna give right back to 'em you know
When 16 ain't enough, but I only get 16, that's like a cage you know
When 16 ain't enough, I really can't say what I wanna say, you know it's just a glimpse
That's all, just one uh, one little single glimpse
Just a page
But I guess I'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking

Summer '88, or was it '89
Or was it winter-time, ah, nevermind
I'm in my room, boomin' drawin' LL Cool J album covers
With crayolas on construction paper
I'm trying to fuck my neighbor, I'm tryna hook my waves up
I'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups
Before Le marc was Jacob, before them girls wore makeup
Before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs
Before my mama wake up, before my palms would cake up
Before they told me they love me and we'll never breakup
Before the time she makes love, to someone that I thought was, my homeboy
But boy was, I wrong now
I don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and porch
And a Porsche, and a horse and unfor-tunately
But of course an assort-ment of tor-ches that scor-ches the skin, when they enter
Intru-ders, whose tutors did a lousy job
How's he god if he let's Lucifer let loose on us
That noose on us won't loosen up but loose enough to juice us up
Make us think we do so much and do it big
Like they don't let us win, I can't pretend
But I admit it, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate
Hence why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
Then go grab the finest wine and drink it like
We know which grape and which region it came from
As if we can name 'em, hint hint, it ain't um Welch's
Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
Y'all can't measure my worth
But when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods
Because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall
I feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home
All Kelly green with envy while I'm jelly beans descending
Into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smiles
With such a devilish grin, Like ""where the hell have you been""
She yelling that selling’s a sin, well so is telling young men
That selling is a sin, if you don’t offer new ways to win
A dolphin gone shake his fin, regardless if he is in
Or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim
And flipper didn’t hold his nose, so why shall I hold my tongue?
I miss the days that O' and Market Hole had scowl on his arm?
And I set off these alarms, when camera’s snap snap snap snap
Return fire, pa-pa-pa, pa, pa-pa, pa, pa, pa
They’ll learn why, near privacy, so essential
They won't make no laws, I break their laws till they see out our window
I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
Forsake them all, I hate them all, don’t like em don’t pretend to
Yea something tells me, we ain’t in Kansas anymore
All that shit that used to be cool ain’t cool anymore
All the women you been pursuing, now they want more
And they deserve it all, don’t settle for what ain’t yours

When 16 ain't enough, when 16 ain't enough, ooh yeah, oh yeah

When 16 ain't enough, when 16 ain't enough, ooh (When 16 ain't enough) yeah, oh yeah (When 16 ain't enough)

(Break down, break down) Does your mama know you see me, does she know you're freaky?
Does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya I am speaking?
Do you ever ponder where I'm at when you get sleepy?
How the hell I'm gonna tell the youth don't be me?
Yea, ha ha

(I love it) Does your daddy think you perfect, does he know for certain?
Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?
Do he think I'm 2Pac 'cause I'm black and put them works in?
Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman yeah?

Count mills for the times that we had it hard
Asking for a hundred mill as I pray to God

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

Young nigga coming up, they wanna gun you down
Drinking vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you Peanut)
Riding real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga)
Shopping for them Os when the mall close
Repping for your homies when they all gone
Get empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit)
All black tees, ten gold chains
At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game
Ten years strong in the same trap
Ten years blowing on that strong pack
Lord knows that I wanna live right
But Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right)
Forty dollar tab meaning forty grand
Lord ? got it rolled up in a rubber band
Holding on the forty in his other hand
Ten chains on, smoking in the motherland

Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

I'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice
All these jewels on, all ?
I could see it in the sparkle cause it lacklustre
Black card maxed out, damn black brother
White collar, black minded
Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket
Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta
Screaming your affiliations, but that don't matter
I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither
Never blackmail them, motherfucking killer
On trial and they wanna execute me
It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me
True G to the core, feel my texture
A true G keeps it raw in his lecture
Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers
Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

Versace shirt, Jesus laying on the chest
Man I swear Big did it the best, I mean
Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean
Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best
And I was so impressed that I went and got ten
Now I'm stunting on these niggas cause I couldn't back in
Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum
And I wear them all at once, I ain't trying to match them
I remember bumping Mac 10 and that deuce in the corner
Scraping up for a sandwich and a soda
Now my strength is up and I'm dangling chains off my shoulders
But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed
For the reason that I rhyme
And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine
Or even put it in a rhyme
It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards
But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss

I do this for my niggas facing hard times
Empty on them corners if you hustling part time
Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties
Rakim flows, coming from the far side
Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid
Quick, quote a prayer, pull it from the archives
I pray for every soul that this music reaches
Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces

I’m so serious!

One, two them boys coming for you (Huh!)
Three, four, better lock your door  (Huh!)
Five, six, hide your bitch (Woo!) (Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit)

They said, thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon be our year, every year gon be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over ""In God’s We Trust""
We believe in God but do God believe in us
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know 'em
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

I’ve been poppin' shit for too long
But still reppin’ where I came from

I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel
G5, make it rain, I can change the weather
We fly them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle consider ‘em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quotin'
Huh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only thing’s truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
""God Forgives and I Don’t"" pussy niggas unnoticed

I wish you would nigga (Woo!)

You just got home nigga, you tryna live nigga

The boss is testing yo ass, the feds’ll question yo ass
They be drug testin’ yo ass and then they pray you don’t pass
And then you look in the sky, you got some questions to ask
With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac

I mean handcuffs, time to man up
Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin' bruh
'Cause I'm a black man, in a Phantom
Or is it 'cause my windows tinted
Car cost 300 thou' and I blow Indo in it
You mad 'cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'ma fuck her 'til the springs break

Yeah Roll another one 'cause I'm winnin'
And my four door looking real photogenic
Jam ‘'em on the tire, in threads that won't expire
I'm in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses, did it from the weak hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I'm getting so much money I can buy ya bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I'm thinking
Bought that ho a ring it was for her pinky
Uhn, that's pimpin' that's slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent

Fuck y'all mad at me for
Got a black card, and a black phantom
With a white bitch in Idaho, I do the same thing in (Montana)
Got a thick bitch in Atlanta, got a redbone in the Chi
Got two chains, they two-tone, two hundred racks, no lie (true)

And my AR see murders, that's beef nigga no burgers
I'm insane and you Usain, nigga better turn on them burners
Got ?, bitch ?
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail
You a bitch nigga, no female, I smack niggas, Sprewell
I'm on the block like D 12, I got the white, no D-12
Like a little nigga in Africa, I was born toting that K
And that's real shit, no Will Smith, and no ?
But they yellin'

Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle fuck it let 'em spray

I take my case to trial, hire the Dream Team
Robbie Kardashian, Johnnie Cochran, I seen things
I dream big, I think sharp
Inhale smoke, Hawaiian tree bark
Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel, now you swimming in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settling for less, I call 'em bottom shelf
Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothing at all
On the road to the riches, bitches not tagging along

Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone
Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashing the chrome
I'm waving the Tec, Tity spraying the Mac
Extendos in the back, [gonna lap?]
Got a bitch that look like Laila Ali sitting in my lap
Got a call from Skateboard, pick 'em up at Lax
Speaking skateboards, where Tune at?
Fuck with him, I'll break a skateboard on a nigga back
2 Chainz!

Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, No Lie already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with a ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys, we bring 'em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence, if you got work
Go to work the work at your residence
For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Riding through the jungles in that mothafuckin'' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the muthafuckas in, made another mill'
Got a nigga feeling like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it whip his ass today

Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted

Stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dawgz so I had to put the bails up
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up

You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days

We can do like eight positions
Hit it til your make up missing
Baby girl my stroke official
And you know I paint that picture
Hoes on my line, most of 'em 9's
Couple of 'em dimes but all my hoes is hard to find
And I ain't always on the prowl
its just my soda mixed with brown
Got me quite open for a while
So let me in or let me out
And I like my marijuana bright
And I like my window tinted out
Shout out them strippers who hustle
Yeah George you know what this about
I just might throw a big amount

And I say “can I get a threesome?”
She say “boy, you funny”
But I be like foreal, just pick up that phone call on one of your girls
When I’m on that pill and I pop that perc
Girl I put in that work
Long as she come to me first its 14 racks what I put on that purse
Shit that Birkin bag, make the old dude mad
When I murk through passed in a dark blue jag
Say she like my style but I talk too fast
And I got that drive and she just might crash hold up,
she say she fucking with me the long way
She gon’ ride this dick I had a long day

Wow, I really wanna shine
That’s what it boils down to, real shit

I just want my mind to be free
Never mind if they fond of me, I’ve been a beast
I recline in my seat, number nines on my feet
Womanizer admittingly, but mind you I’m deep
Although they inclined to critique
Motherfuck ‘em, they couldn't lace up a nigga’s Chukka’s
‘Cause money talk and I make them bussa’s pay for discussion
Chasing duckets, chasing dreams, got me praying for foes
Chasing hoes, dick ‘em good enough to make ‘em propose
Winning, the feeling is so incredible
Something that’s forever true, my niggas over revenue
Little bit of Chanel, decorate your appearance
Double C’s on your purses, perfect I get the message
Isabel Marant I get you some, you give me that
All of my thoughts fluorescent ink, though I’m always thinking black
Sitting back, cognac, sixty-two behind the pack
I ain’t thug, but I ain’t stupid four niggas, five ? hold up
Fire shots for the winners
And as long as I’m delivering, this genre’s gon’ be winning
Double M-G pimping, my relevance never ending
My penmanship ain't too pretty, my ink is why they gon’ feel me

This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me

I got a couple old schools and some new girls
They like old jewels and new pearls
They obey no rules, they some rude girls
You know the bad ones that rule the world
They just wanna have fun and crash parties
But when them games is over they down to ride for me
Bonnie and Clyde story, Mick and Mallory
A killer in them sheets, they bring that ish up out of me
After that I sit and counting G’s after G
‘Cause it’s right back to these ends
Send her on her way, tell her come back with some friends
We can do it all again, the repetition that I like
The reputation of a pimp
And I do it all on him, peep the way I limp
Pimp walk I been brought my chick, it was money well spent
They say it’s cold-blooded how I talk
I been winning this way for years, so what if I ain’t lost?

May our legacies live forever, huh

All my niggas quiet but we burning loud
Makaveli to the max: never turn it down
Mac 11 in a Benz: how you like me now?
I run the city so my closet look like Nike Town
Niggas talking like bitches, is it my income?
Am I fucking your bitches? Is it official?
My nigga did a dime, didn't learn a thing from it
Came home, in two weeks got him a 600
Get a text from the boss: you know them bricks coming
Chicks at the beach house like they gonna miss something
From the churches I rose, only loving the dough
From the Chevy to Rolls, now it's fur on the floor
Smoke an ounce of the truth: that's my fountain of youth
R.I.P. to Mr. Shakur, this one is for you
Nippsey Hussle and I got my nigga Stalley on it
Double MG burning out in Cali on it

Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental
Keys got me sentimental

These rap books buried in gold
The treasure of a million men, Versace shades trimmed in gold
My life's big like them cameras explode
Capture this rags to riches story that I unfold
The youth fountain for the few counting
Made money, but who's counting?
It's hard stunting living in subsidized housing
Every bag you bring though the door, dude's counting
And every new girl you bring through, dude's hounding
They want your youth, so they watch your moves
From your pinky ring, down to how you lace your shoes
Rope chains with the precious jewels
The dope game had impression rules
What they did with cocaine and a couple spoons
Had the whole hood acting like goons
Trying to be the richest, trying to the be fliest
Claim to be balling, end up like Len Bias
Screaming from the bottom of this fountain here, nothing but silence

Stained glass window in the Benzo
Lost in the instrumental
Keys got me sentimental

Laces in my blue Chucks, represent my bros first
Staring at my Rollie bezel as I soul-search
Run this money marathon til my soles hurt
But no materials could measure what my soul's worth
I wanted everything, feel like I had no choice
Young niggas wishing on a star like Rose Royce
Being honest, killing mamas when we sold work
I made a promise, give me options and I cold-turkey
Sick of sitting on the side while it's game point
Recurring dream, tryna scream but ain't had no voice
Crazy lady speaking tongues said it's gon' work
Never vocalize my visions, actions was my spokesperson
Study rich niggas' moves like my homework
Sacrilegious; however, streets was my own church

Like a boss, so you know I let her count it for me
Like to floss, new watch, gold rings
People next door swear I'm dealing cocaine

New Maybachs, boy, that's way out of your range
All the chicks came like we at a Knicks game
Carmelo numbers first and the fifteenth
We the best in the biz', baby there it is
I'ma handle mine, little homie handle his
At the Portofino, I just bought the top floor
I'm living like Nino baby, and want more

Overlook the city, blowing out her back
She better blow my mind or she can holla back

Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want

Ricky made off everything I deserved
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga

It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked

I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle

May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas, lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle

I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio state gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a bilion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, where it hurt you
Life in the power circle

Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?

I tried to warn you niggas
It's too late now

Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect

Reminiscing on how them bricks keep going back and forth
I ask the Lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grinding like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, talking laws of attraction
The paper I'm making, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor-made, flossing's my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in in '06
Planted my flag, bitch, I'm taking no shit
I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish
Niggas is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Heinemann, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sipping lean

Never gon' know so
No never, no never, no never
No, no, no, no

This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper
They don’t rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, make my money from hustle
Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing
Never hate you in public, better let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5’11?, what the fuck you guys scared of
I’m a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my mama
Getting up in they mental, get ‘em outta their garments
Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama
Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us

All of a sudden, niggas ball and stunting
Y'all just started pulling on Havanas
Pull ya card, ya spineless, where ya heart, I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying
Gold medallion over my son chest, he’ll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me?
I never owned the concept, I was here
I’m just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other
My kid to me, I am my children through history
Upstanding men and stand up women
I am existing
I was conceived to break bread with kings and make connections
We haven’t met yet, my reputation you’ve stuck with
Until we have our formal introduction, that’s enough
But every male is not a man

Nobody gave me ish so it's nobody I owe
I got that Lee-Roy glow
Soul of an assassin and I'm trying to have me backed in
Off up in that corner but I'm off up in this bitch
Gold dangling all over
This W tat sweater and it's double M G
I ain't gonna be slept on forever
Tell the Sandman to wake em up and help me count this cheddar
Not enough hands on me
Eyes on the sparrow and I'm laid up like a pharaoh
Got a couple grand on me, I'm just living my life
They said I would change, I'm just proving em right
I was broke before, so I'll be broke some more
Man, that don't sound right
But what it sound like is a good year for me
I used to look at the future and I couldn't bear to see
Me, my momma, and my sister was the bears in the tree
Porridge in my bowl, trying to keep hold of my souls
Now I'm the big man to beat
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree
When you start shaking that tree
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree
Look at me

My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

Gold Rollie, most hoes want to know me
Blowing OG, I never socialize with police
Glock 40, never had it, why I'mma need it?
It'll be them niggas that's looking for it mama'll be grieving
I ain't thugging, who the fuck is you mean-mugging?
I seen the meanest and toughest niggas Speedy Gonzales
Don't obsess over money, I'm just eager for comfort
Don't obsess over fame, I just speak to the public
Ain't reached my zenith, but all the people see that I'm buzzing
Shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealing my thunder
Lost a lot of homies, none of 'em even died
I see 'em all the time, but jealousy is sabotage
Riding in another drop, ain't talking Enterprise
They try to see me, get diabetes from humble pie
Yeah, I hate to lose more than they love to win
That's the difference 'tween me and them

My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

I wake up in the morning, roll up my marijuana
Thinking 'bout tomorrow, I don't want to be a martyr
Stress that I be under, blame that on my baby momma
Pills that I be popping, wonder will they take me under?
Rush to Mac 11 for these ho niggas with drama
Success in my possession, had you murdered out of karma
All these niggas snitching, witness perjury, Your Honor
Handle my business, tuition for my kids' college
Dope boy styling, DEA target
One point seven for these VS's on my collar
Born in the projects, now I'm known as the hottest
Lay your whole label down, bitch I came for the dollars

My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy

Large yacht, fast money, she need a slow cruise
Cigar, Ciroc, her nigga old news
Old money always put me on my new shit
Hermes ahead in my to-do list
Rollin' up loud, take a walk in the clouds
Take a look at my niggas, young, rich and we wild
Ain't no bitches allowed, acting like snitchin' in style
Got this gold on my neck, we teachin' new principles now
Startin' the Lotus, revin' the motors

New cars, new crib, but I ain't a switch

Got this loot together, same ones gon' spend it
Circle of winners baby girl I done brung you in it
No iPhone pictures, you gotta live off memory
Pop the hood I show you the engine
Roll through my old hood, put you up on my history
Smoke joints with my niggas and cash stunts on them bum ass niggas
I don't deal with, with a caught fire now them suckers catchin' feelin's

Girl, I'm not gon' break your party heart, party heart
Girl, I'm just letting you know, because we 'bout to party hard
I hope you ready to go

Outside slamming Chevy doors, Chevy doors, Chevy doors
Rims tall as John Salley though, Salley though, Salley though
Gold chains, mainly Figaro, Figaro, Figaro
And one of them Rolex links
Mister T necklace, Slick Rick rings, diamonds dancing through the night
Pregamed all day, waiting for the night
I'm on the tree, she on Ketel One and Sprite
Told her take it light cause later on gon' be tight
64 lowrider solid gold pipes
Stars and the stripes, Spangled Banner cameras and the lights
Stars out tonight, red carpet life
Standing on them couches, blowing clouds at bouncers
Spilling champagne on my trousers
It's a party all around us

The music gets into my party heart, party heart
Now I'm just ready to go, right before the party start
Girl, I'm not gon' break your party heart, party heart

Me and LeBron got the same whips
Me and Dwyane on the same strip
Me and Wiz burn the same piff
Me and Stalley need the same pick
Me and Meek bone the same chicks
Me and Wale rock the same kicks
Contract like I play for the Knicks
My crib look like I'm still playing with bricks
My Chevrolet shines like a marble floor
Baby keep it raw, have you modeled before?
Fontaine Bleau, Club Liv, gold bottles galore
We can party hard in exclusive couture
Starting at your toes and I'm travelling north
Down South boy, diabolical boss
Hermes belt, spent a G for it
The G5 ready for a D-Boy

The music gets into my party heart, party heart
Now I'm just ready to go, right before the party start
Girl, I'm not gon' break your party heart, party heart
Girl, I'm just letting you know, because we 'bout to party hard
I hope you ready to go

You know I like to party hard, hard, hard
Use a Glock for my bodyguard, guard, guard
Throw it to my dogs, now it's far-fetched
I be on the block with Ron like Ar-test
Niggas saying that they 'bout it but I'm 'bout this caper
Damn near got carpel tunnel trying to count this paper
Met a girl named Jamaica but she from Decatur
Got a brother with the work, trying to get my cake up
Had a crib with the lake when I was 24
Bought rims for the car off of Channel 4
Niggas round the city, they have been exposed
If you really getting money then it's really dough
I'm on the phone with a bitch that say she wanna smoke
Click on the other line, this bitch say she really broke
Man what gives? I got ideas, they don't wanna listen
All you gotta do is pay tithes and pay attention
I wanna thank God, for this permission with this intention

Rick Ross,"Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on
Am I right?

On the way we shed some tears
Every day we sacrifice
So we can be standing here
Oh what a hell of a life
Been winning so many years
And the future is bright
Now it's very clear
That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever
We gon' be rich forever
We gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever

I remember being blind to it
'Til the day I put my mind to it
Pen and pad on the dresser for me to fine tune it
I sat in the corner, made up my mind, do it
Def Jam on my heels, should I sign to it?
Million dollar advance for me to rhyme fluent
Every day I'm hustlin' on every corner boomin'
Back of the phantom couldn't fathom I was such a student
Grandfather deal for the Godfather
Lucian Grainge from the ghetto, I follow God's orders
And he told me I was rich forever
And he showed me I was rich forever
They call me Mr. Roberts when I'm in the bank
Digits like the Dodgers when it come to franks
Flossin' out in Compton like I got a cape
RoseMo tried to fight it, but barely niggas fade
White sheet, yellow tape, where your dogs at
Count a million cash, can you blog that?
Me and niggas your type never exchange numbers
Want to conversate and steal game from us
See the watch, now you want to know the name of it
Never playin' so I went and got the frame flooded
Cartier, Hublot, I could name a dozen
Your shit pushed back cuz it ain't buzzin'
Now these thugs actors all of a sudden
Niggas hustle backwards all of a sudden
Can't talk snow, where the soft at
Your man got murked, but you squashed that
Hope you know what we call that
I think you know just what we call that
All you pussy boys fall back
Big face Rollie, rose gold cost 40
Platinum twenty-one, it's time to go and spoil shorty
You only live once I'm screaming YOLO in the VI
Time flies fast balling with my nigga T.I
Ciroc, no glass, smiling women in my presence
Tall supermodels always fall in my possession
Atlanta housewives taking pictures in my section
But I only got a thing for young bitches with aggression
Show me that affection that a D-Boy craves
Rich forever in my D-Boy ways
So dope, blue jeans, new J's
Sold dope by any means all day

Been winning so many years
And the future is bright
Now it's very clear
That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever
We gon' be rich forever

100 mil ain't enough
Got 100 women, gotta deal with it, love
Worth 40 m's is he still dealing drugs
Cigarette speedboats, but he's still with the thugs
Club Liv, Louis shots on a Sunday
Grinding, even be legit one day
Order some more bottles because I'm on one
I know her pussy wet, and she wanna cum
She wanna cum, maybe come over
Stop dealing with them niggas you need one soldier
Keep you as my bitch forever
'Cause you know a nigga rich forever

Been winning so many years
And the future is bright
Now it's very clear
That we gon' be rich forever, and ever, and ever
We gon' be rich forever

On the way we shed some tears
Every day we sacrifice
We gon' be rich forever",Rich Forever,2012

Diamonds are forever, she my bitch forever
Had my back forever, I was in that trap forever
All the lonely nights, I was chasin' cheddar
Now I got her movin' white, now it's like whatever
Put down that bus pass she got her some Porsche keys
Got her a Birkin bag, earrings for 40 G's
Sex keep on getting better, cause she keep gettin' wetter
Got her that sexy condo, nothing can separate us
When I'm in Chi-Town, I'm just a call away
Or on the West Coast, lost like I'm Marvin Gaye
I put up the Phantom, time to chill in Atlanta
She say I'm her future before she peel off them panties

Crib big as Turner Field so you know we rich forever
Diamonds in a bezel, smokin' on this leather
No my grind couldn't be better, and she thick as ever
I got killers in Decatur, as well as Dade County
She in cribs with elevators, as well as water fountains
How we move can't be debated, the hustle well rounded
Talking square feet, master suite, 12,000

Rick Ross,"Its time to take it to the other side
The side you gotta watch A&E cable television for homie
But we live this shit

I'm not a star
But thats a lie
I've seen a man raise his hand on the stand he testify
Spoke on a homicide
Amongst other things
Even shared my triple beam dreams

A project minded individual criminal tactics
Us blacks kids born with birth defects, we hyperactive
Mentally sex-crazed dysfunctional they describe us
They liars, the end of the day, we fucking survivors
I remember watching Scarface the first time
Look at that big house, that Porsche paid for by crime
How could I sell this poison to peoples in my mind
They dumb to destroy themselves is how I rationalize
In a bastardized nation, Magnum 4.5 carrying
Where I'm from, ain't far from Washington Heights the cop Aryan
A rookie boy the cookie didn't make no profit
A stranger to the block I damn near had to make them cop it
It only took a fiend to taste it once to say it's garbage
I brought it back to poppy, ain't tryna take no losses
He focuses on my emotionless young dealer face then pauses
He gives me powder he has faith in Nas'
Ambition's to distribute coke
Had additions to gold chains, Mercedes Benz hopes
But I'm again broke
This shit ain't cut for me, other dealers they up their orders
Barely at 62 they already up they quotas
They out there everyday, some true hustlas for ya
I'm at it halfway, none of my customers are loyal
Picturin' piping out the seats of a Pathfinder
Powerful pursuit for pussy cash, the flash diamonds
My junior high school class, wish I stayed there
Illegal entrepreneur I got my grades there
Blaming society, man it wasn't made fair
I would be Ivy League if America played fair
Poor excuse and so I was
Throwin' rocks at the pen just for the love
Evil the secret life of G's
You seeing my blurry, triple beam dreams

Pocketful of money, parking lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin', crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens they got cameras every angle
Dope been coming so you know the income major
Rule number 1 I can't do business with a stranger
Contract killers coming when I feel in danger
Early nineties reminiscing when I had a pager
Triple Beam Dreams now Pat Riley my neighbor

Fuck boy talking outta turn nigga
In a court room spraying like a germ nigga
25 on a line, them niggas dropping dimes
Cooperation got them red necks dropping time
Khaki suits and them niggas got to acting cute
We was all cool stacking them Acura coupes
More accurately we acted as if jackin' was cool
Snatching niggas out they shoes then wear their jackets to school
Fuck boy you caught up in my dream
Countin' cream on the cover of a magazine
I'm the Source, got the plug with the uncut
Jay-Z blue magic nigga, what! what!
Brand new S Class with a meal ticket
Nigga cocaine white as Tommy Hilfiger
Ralph Lauren Blue Label as I'm gettin' high
Triple beam dreamin' as the cream multiplies
Fuck boy talking outta turn nigga
‘Fore you sell dope there's shit you gotta learn nigga
Home invasions, duct tape
Fornicating, counting money with a fuck face
Fucking bitches that be giving up your whereabouts
Slow leaks, gotta air ‘em out
Kill ‘em all, Rolls Royce Ghost nigga ball
Phantom drop head shit, I had to get ‘em all
Niggas hate but they know they never get involved
Food on my plate, fuck 'em all like a
Triple beam dreams, the ghetto's my reality
I'm from where ya hustle determines ya salary
6 figure family member, nigga forget about it
Low income housing, nigga try to get up out it
I got a plan nigga just believe in me
Triple beam dreaming with this thing me

Pocketful of money, parking lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin', crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens they got cameras every angle

They don’t know how to play it cool you know
Mean it’s a time and place for everything
Been thinking bout you all day
Right now, is about that time
Look how you turn me on baby (They like when you talk to em)
(If you saying something)
Seeing is believing (Ursher baby) turn the lights on

She kissing on me, biting on my bottom lip (Huh)
In the gallery all I get is buy me this
Conversations on the phone until the break of dawn
Combination to her home, I gotta make her moan
Mean hustle got me chasing all this fast money
Balenciaga sneakers, now she touching cash money
So sexy in them all black Giuseppe heels
50 stacks in her bag so she know it’s real
Top off the Ferrari now we thugged out
Smoking on that Cali' bumping 2Pac
It’s me against the world now what’s your phone number?
Jumping in that range rover and I’m coming over

(Fuck’n you) Been thinking 'bout you all day
Still can’t get my mind off your body
I’m day dreaming bout (Fuck’n you)
Look how you turn me on baby
'Cause nobody compares to your body
Every time you let me touch (Fuck’n you)
And every time you let me
Nobody compares to your body, yeah

I think I wanna put a ring on it
I think I wanna tat her name on me (tat tat tatted up)
I had a lot of sexy women, but this is not the same for me
Bounce, love it how she always make it bounce!
Rose petals on her bed, I walk in unannounced
I love it when she speak a different language
I touch her in so many different angles
Born stunna and my baby so stunnin'
Niggas want her, but she find them so funny
I’m getting money, living like the most wanted
She all I ever needed, now Usher sing it

Still can’t get my mind off your body
Day dreaming bout (Fuck’n you)
Look how you turn me on baby
Nobody compares to your body
Every time you let me touch (Fuck’n you)
Let me and every time you let me
Nobody compares to your body, touch

Pink champagne for my dime piece
In the sheets you know I flip her like a 9 piece
In the streets you know I’m eating like a lion feast
Lick a nipple tryna tickle all the finer things
Keys to the crib, keep it trill, time to handle biz'
Big dreamer, new beamer, just the realest nigga
Cover of the source, owner of the Porsche
Killing all haters, showing no remorse
Knocking at the door, she recognize the voice
I’m not them other boys, she know I shine the most
She modeling a lot I know she on the go
Another bottle of Ciroc, baby let’s have a toast

(Fuck’n you) Been thinking 'bout you all day
Still can’t get my mind off your body
I'm dreaming bout (Fuck’n you)
Look how you turn me on baby
'Cause nobody compares to your body
Every time you let me touch (Fuck’n you)
Every time you let me
Nobody compares to your body, touch",Touch'N You,2012

They told me get 'em, I got 'em,
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I ain't never asked for no handouts
You won't carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they ain't mad at me,
I'm on fire and I'm gon' burn
And they ain't gon' learn,
I remember they said that it ain't my turn
But it ain't confirmed, then the table's turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I ain't gon' stop, 'cause I'm gon' climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let's go

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Path that I choose flashing cameras as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred wreck she don't know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell tryin' to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it's hundreds and millions, this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the born achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the ropes
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars
Be all that you are
And make 'em all fall down

Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Go)
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em (Go)

Can't fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby still know who you are
So you gotta keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It's not too far

Can't fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes
Get off the rope
Don't let 'em ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who's the greatest
Reach for the stars

The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas giving orders now
The gold presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me gap
Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek
Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released
Bitches, they keep coming

I could ship her something, you know that December coming

Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish
I was skipping the classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a profit stuffing my pockets, you niggas starving
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit

Rick Ross,"My new lady says she leaving me
Ah fuck her, I don't care
Plus I got another over there
She been wanting to be with me
Got her in her underwear
Gave her what she want, now she need me
I got more of that coming over soon
Lingerie all up in my room
I'ma make this toast to that one girl I love
I still smell her perfume

Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Numbing up

Since you've been away, love's been MIA
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Now I'm MIA
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love

My new lady says she leaving me
Ah fuck her I don't care
Told me that she loved me, yeah
I just give them the scenery, they won't ever compare
To the ones still got it
I call her up but she won't answer
And she knows what I'm looking for
And she knows what I'm looking for

Pour one up, no pour another

Since you've been away, love's been MIA
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Now I'm MIA
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love

I be a rolling stone, missus, still tryna deal with ya
Loving too much will leave you blue and I ain't pledge Sigma
I'm a real nigga, giving feelings just ain't me
The more attention you give em, the more options they seek
Talk is cheap, knew I should've kept the receipt
She said she loyal, but all bitches gonna talk in the streets

As I hit another paper plane I'm MIA",M.I.A.,2013

Light it up 'til we both explode
We love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Why'd we ball so hard?
Yeah, and I, I'm not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing

Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double-breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin' shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin' fast, I'm never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in a tuck
Semi in a truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin' like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, boiling like I'm Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale

You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain’t hearing none of that street shit
Cause in my mind, you mothafuckas sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I’m a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Water colors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descendant from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Over night I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain’t no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home

Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes

If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on

We'll make love on a star, girl (so high, so high)(Maybach Music)

She's such a centerfold, you other chicks just run along
She shoot on Christian Louboutin, she will put it on
No logos on the bag if she got in on the arm
All she talk is swag and you know she gon' pour it on
On those cold nights fat boy had to keep her warm
Kept a paintbrush, studying The Art of War
Mr. Brainwash fuckin' to my favorite song
I run with cash money but you know my money long

I'm so high I'm wasted, I don't wanna come down
Let me take you to Mars, girl
We'll make love on a star, girl

I'm so high I'm wasted, I don't wanna come down
Let me take you to Mars, girl (Let me take you to Mars, girl)
And we'll make love on a star, girl (so high, so high)(Ma

I don't wanna talk
I don't wanna think
I'm up here waiting for you

I was born to be another number
So was number 1, I pray I never fumble
I used to wear the cheapest clothes
Now my posters in the reefer stores
I be posted like I’m 7’4
Till the day I'm knocking at my heaven's door
Just like club LIV when that confetti fall
I fell in love with the game, damn it's a distant love
I let her see it just to tell her friends what she saw
200 mill how I get it, damn I can't be far
I keep my sneakers low cut
Heat fitted, G-5 with the nose up
Self made St. Regis with the toast up
Roomservice, Belaire time to toast up
My attraction have African in them happy homes
Never seen a square nigga with a happy home
All the money generated, double M the greatest
Rest in peace to every genius that never made it
Don't it sound like I'm dedicated
Joe Flacco deal, nigga with hot flows
Whole cheerleading squad all through my iPhone
All them hoes in my iPhone, nigga

Momma poor, Daddy poor, what's the antidote?
Wind through the window blew the candle out
No lights, many cold nights
Hungry belly burning yearning rice
Rent late, on a plate just a blank space
Old girl lookin' at me with the blank face
Made it off a prayer and a saint's grace
AK's kept me in a safe space

Probably on tour for the one four
Sucka tried to give me life plus one more

I'm not a back and further
I don't make friends, baby I make offers
Like you can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you get with this, cause this is where it's at
Hate when broke niggas try to play mediator

Whether life or death, guess we're far from fire

Who want to test this? Titty to necklace
Money so tall she gotta count it in Giuseppe
Balling like the ESPY's
Drinking on that Texas
Sexting. texting, aggravated flexing
Did it for the money and the fame came with it
Connect from the island and the cane came with her
Rode through the block in a cherry colored drop
Jim Carrey, Mariah Carey, you get carried off
They got a stretcher with your name on
Shoot a nigga and I’ll dash like Damon
Insane in the membrane
2 Chainz, but today I got on three chainz

When the heat is on we burn hotter than fire
People will burn up on, we burn hotter than fire

Rick Ross,"I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

Bitch, I do what I do, I feel how I feel
Got my drink on the rise, got my house on the hill
Got the girl of your dreams yep I pop her, for real
And I'm thumbing through bill after bill after bill
After bill, but I still pay respect to my city
So much man you thought I was in debt for real
Every day is a chase, every night is a thrill
I feel sorry for whoever's not in the will
Good music or die ho, shout out to Ye-Ye
Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than day-day, no off day just pay day
Boy, since I was a bae-bae I swear was OG, you was a no G
Texting these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's
When you was a OG, bitch, I'd still be more G
Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not getting that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped control just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearing the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talking with the same hoes
All day about how find 'em and Hov hit the same hoes
Some niggas never grew up until they grew old
I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
Fuck with me and you'll destroy fool
End up on the fucking Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus
Fuck am I saying, Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright thought if I just got you, bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin
That's the difference between a 9-to-5 and a 10-to-10
Sean don

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

They done fucked up now, haha
Mastermind

My kilos on ice, my sneakers snow white
I got a place at the Trump, just to pray for advice
My new bitch is Hispanic, got me speaking bi-language
Some call it tricking cause this bitch thicker than Trina
Anybody wanna motherfucking die? Come try me then
You ain't real till you fucked your dawg's ho
Seen a brick and had to buy a Benz
Coming through and I don't fuck with niggas
Bitch you wish you wanna fuck a nigga
Good chance she done fucked a nigga
Turned around and said fuck that nigga
Stack on my belt, double M we a cult
Mastermind's in control, so nigga fuck what you thought
16′s of coke, all my verses be dope
Fuck XXL 'cause I'm The Source to these quotes

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

I've been held from ten to tens, swear I won't sin again
Bring the Hell to my residence, godly presence with presidents
My day job, it made me shit, public housing ain't got no fence
And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick
I did work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem, plus the issues, I can't solve them
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin'
Nigga please! Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred, shit
Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion
Who knew one day her son would grow up and learn how to read or write
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn, how you do that?

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again

Rick Ross,"I got a feelin nigga wit it ? and my money be da root.
Look up at da stars, she like ""Honey where da roof?""
Pull up in a Dawes ?, canaries ? dey go on roof,
Even once had a job pourin tar up on da roof.
Dat boy had it hard, no fasad it's da truth,
So now when I menage and get massaged it's da proof.
Proof's in da pudding and dat bakin soda taken,
Paper dat I'm makin, gotta take dem photos naked.
Listenin to niggas like whistlin dat Wendy Williams,
I flip my middle finga, I'm chillin on twenty million.
Da rumors turn me on I'm masterbatin at da top,
These hoes so excited so dey catchin every drop.
I'm dodgin debacles like pot holes in Jamaica,
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on dem acres.
Martin had a dream, Bob got high,
I still do both but somehow I got by.

Creflo prayed, Mike Vick payed,
Bobby Brown strayed, Whitney lost weight.
Kimbo Slice on da pad when I write,
Dat may why the money lookin funny in the light.
But who really cares? You just throw it in the air,
Celebratin wealth, pourin Mo«t in her hair-
Excuse me, her weeve- the bluest of weed,
Trunk full of white, car smell like bleu cheese.
Dat boy get salad ?, beef bout movements,
BM dubs on dem big thangs lookin foolish.
Shawty sittin low, big thangs poppin,
Tip on da glock from a trip up in Compton.
Shootin at da cops- fuck one time.
I gave her to da block, I fucked one time.
We boys in da hood and nigga you Lil' Trey,
Suppress ya appetite, we takin ya lil' tray.
Love my handgun but my choppa still da shit,
Banned in 1994 but I'm too legit to quit.
1996, kilos was the shit,
But dat were better den roofin dat shit be bad for ya skin.
Niggas was ruthless, lord knows dat I sinned,
But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin.
Walked out on a gig and I turned to da streets,
Kept my name low key, I ain't heard from in weeks.
I came up with a strategy to come up mathematically,
I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me.
Mothafuck em all, they sweat from my balls,
If I drop anotha album I did dat fo my dawgs.
10 Maybachs, everybody ridin big,
I just sit back like: Look what I did.
Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness,
Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business.

Smokin on a blunt in my own restaurant,
People lookin from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Kunk,
Reincarnated, spirit of a G.
Beef? I'll make you dinner, take a seat so we could eat.
A Farrakhan aura, paws on the Port,
You eat from da bowl while ya dog need a fork.
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in dey coil,
I'm laughin at you 'cause, kill you niggas when I'm bored.

We steppin on ya crew til the mothafuckas crushed,
And makin sweet love to every women dat ya lust.
I love to pay her bills, can't wait to pay her rent,
Curtis Jackson baby mama ain't askin for a cent.
Burn the house down, we gotta buy another,
Don't forget the gas can, jealous, stupid muthafucka.
To anotha chapter, paper dat I captured,
Caught up in da rapture of gunshots and laughter.
Homicide is human and nigga you lookin funny,
Women love to stare cause dey know dey see da money.
I open up a mind by openin bank accounts,
Deposit a 100 stacks, break up or take it out.
Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live,
I knew it wouldn't work, but I just like to give.
Used to run da street- young nigga, bare feet,
Now I'm in da suites and I'm eatin crab meats.
Ice so right, otha rappers envy,
Dey callin all my jewelers up askin wat he spendin.
Thinkin bout Boss, not thinkin bout dem,
This a letter to my enemies, one I won't send.",Deep,2014

We would take collection from the fiends
People dyin' all around me
So I gave you my testimony
We were down from the beginnin'
When the world wasn't listenin'
Now that I got your attention
Let us in with the benediction

We are gathered here today
Paying our respects to bein' broke, hope he's in a better place
'Cause life out here ain't sweet, oh no
I would close my eyes to sleep but didn't dream no more
So I had to make a way for my home, you know
Now I'm in a place where I ain't gotta scheme no more
The good life, I'm done with the hood life
I did what I could but didn't always do what I should and I was misunderstood
So many nights I tried
To hide how I felt, I would cry inside
And I ran through the streets till my feet got tired
'Cause I ain't wanna have my shoes on them power lines

But I made it, and it made me
I know I did wrong, I prayed to God he forgave me
'Cause I made it, and it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger, I pray to God that you feel me, that you feel me

Our father who art in heaven
I pray you free me from my demons and keep me level
I know you kept my out of prison where I was headin'
When I heard someone killed my brother, one-eighty-seven
I hope he made it to your presence, for me he was a blessin'
At least I know he's restin' and he ain't out here stressin'
Tryna get to the good life, and out of this hood life
I pray that my step-pops stay off that crack pipe
So mama could sleep at night, I know it's been hard on her
I was ripping through the streets, it was hard for her
Now I'm up in hotels on the ocean shore
When I was sleepin' on the floor at the corner store

But I made it, and it made me
I know I did wrong, I prayed to God he would save me
'Cause I made it, it didn't kill me
So it made me stronger, I pray to God that you feel me, that you feel me

Bottle after bottle, snatching Belaire out the bucket
Rightin' all my wrongs for these homies out here thuggin'
Pray for benediction, pretty women on my premise
Condo out in Cabo, screaming ""GABOS"" to my nemesis
Gold around my neck I'm ballin' for these final minutes
Nothing lasts forever, for these sins I seek repentance
Shots fired, another gone, I feel that man's pain
Daddy sat me down and said: ""that came with the game""
Shake my head, roll up the window, turnin' up the music
So much anger in these songs for these soldiers that we losin'
A mastermind is one who's feedin' others off his talent
I owe it to my city but it's time I pay my balance
I'm in Holyfield's estate, I started with a pallet
I made my first tape, I gave that shit to Khaled
Thankful for my supporters, everyone that ever bought us
Grateful for every lesson these by any streets taught us

I ain't saying that I'm bragging, babe
I just like to celebrate my accolades

Push it to the limit like a big body Benz
Push it to the limit, push it, push it to the limit

Love saying how I feel about my life right now
My hair so high and I can't come down
So I'm high and I'm on it, on it
He feeling my persona trying to push up on me
I'm ready and willing and capable
So come get it, what are you waiting for?
Cause I'll let it hit it, now watch it blow
Not finished with it, you see the smoke
Oh, what I could give you is almost perfect, babe
I ain't got no worries, look into my pain

Cause you may never get another night like this

If you on it like I'm on it then come on it, we gon' flaunt it
I'mma stand on top off the globe
I don't, I don't think you're ready, but this thing is dripping wet
Tell me what you trying to do
I could have you floating higher than what you got in that cup
I could tear that thing up, I could tear that thing up
Got you creeping up behind as you feeling up on mine
I wouldn't make it up

If you want it, I got it
That body on me, I got it
Then wake up, I got it

Got this body on lock and we can take it there

Telling the courtroom that I'm being evasive
She wanted to walk into the SunTrust
She made me sign over my lil son' trust
Take away the joy my lil daughter brings
Bitch even wanted to take my daughter's rings

Take you past the sky

Wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga
Call it public housing when you next door to the killers
On them corners it gets better as you go
Grind that motherfucker 'till it's yellow brick road
Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse
On my knees praying, niggas shooting in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next?
Go against the odds, youngin' go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids
Thug Cry for Mac Dre throwing up the Thizz

Smoking on that loud, pumping up that volume
Get it cracking like an eggshell in this motherfucker make omelettes
Get a bad bitch and post up like comments
They don't know what I been through, don't know what I'm going through
As long as I get through that's what I look forward to
Richer than a bitch but still I can't afford to
Let these niggas play with me, need to be remorseful
I swear I got that silencer on that Mac 9 and I kill these niggas with silence
My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant
Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers, that
Ain't a threat that's fact cause they coming at my neck
Like the best a man can get
To make a long story short, I need a shoulder cause the devil on one
The other one, I'm looking over, Tunechi

No tints on that pretty ass Bentley
Want you to know that them comments don't offend me
Cause your baby mama so friendly
I proceed with the plan, weed in my hand
Ciroc in my cup, quick pic for a fan
Money over bitch, first nigga with a Wraith
Double M, we handle business
'Cause them niggas getting raped
Go get the yellow tape, it's well orchestrated
200 acres estates, a young nigga made it
Came from the hood, ain't nothing changed
Still lemon pepper on my motherfucking wings

I've been knowing Ross since he was Teflon

I remember us sitting in the parking lot talking about getting money

Cracks in the wall, standing in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on, my nigga, as they walking back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's something for his mother
It never is enough, trying to show her that I love him
We were fishing buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas getting robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bending corners
Always keep in mind, you fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the ages
When you parking all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals dripping on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw

My old school is running Gatorade in my Chevy
My money in shape, I'm runnin' laps round you fakes
We barricaded the front, the waterfalls in the back
Enough crack for a month, you smell it all in my raps
Niggas wanna be famous, I want the luxury tax
Not one of my checks like my company facts
I'm pumpin' my gas comin' down Cleveland Ave
How much a nigga worth? Ho don't even ask
Ten mill' with Diddy, I'm getting money with Tip
When you see me in the city then it's money we get

You can tell how I walk I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Pay ya ma' shit, sure get the Calito
He go too far, twenty west he better holla at them
And if we catch 'em, down to test 'em, Hustle Gang here ho
Say Trae The Truth gon' cut the fool, give 'em fifty to go
You the business pull up spin, we don't mention it though
Told you before who about that action,you weren't listening though
I'm in the BM got you female in the skippiest clothes
She fucked 3 ho bust in her throat then she went home, he proposed
We in the Lambo raising the door
Acting like an Atlanta nigga never made it before
In case I ain't say it before, 2014
Till I got a .40 Cal and 2000 in my jeans, nigga

Bring 'em back twenty years, they was homies, tight
Sixth grade, for the love of the paper ain't nothing nice
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles, blowing paper
Balling hard, he know they hating
But they gon' respect it, cause he rocked Tony
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding, they ready to fall for him
'Cause word on the street that Paulie did that
Used Key gold digging ass to get back
Text him through her phone, found out where he live at
She woke up in the morning like, I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth, fitting to start a war
Cause Tony's little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law (LOOORD)
And Paulie on a rise now
Niggas that played the middle picking sides now
Plus he heard Tony's brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head, he gotta die now

Paulie's youngest on the corner
Tony's little brother he slipping, yea he's a goner
Fucking with that lean, he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired, niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too, reach and fixing to get up on 'em
The gat jam, he bang back trying to avoid 'em
Them niggas dumping, he get up running and hitting on 'em
He hit the alley, get a body he dipping on 'em
Said it's on now, try and kill 'em it's war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feeling like he dead there ain't no remorse now
Getting high and he thinking 'bout kicking in doors now
Momma and little kids get on the floor now
Finger on the trigger he feel that it's going down
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
'Cause they sad when it rain it really gon' pour down
And it's raining like Katrina, he got thirty in his nina
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his beamer
Paulie wasn't in it when he heared it he was steaming
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin'
And he want this nigga dead before Sunday hit
But youngin' tryna live on some Sunday shit
And time fly fast it was Monday quick
And Paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show 'em how it's done so he loadin' up his gun
And show this young nigga he fuck with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin' the long gun
And it's on sight he don't give a fuck if the law come

So he out here
Ridin' dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurking
They tryna murder heared he out there
Niggas spin 'em they tryna hit 'em
Hitting every corner seeing niggas but he ain't with 'em
Youngin' layin' low he know Paulie ain't playin' though
There's money on his head and niggas is sayin' go
But youngin' he ain't scared, he cool as a fan though
He know it's get down with that burner or end up a tag-toed
It was four in the morn', Paulie goin' home
Windshields wiping, middle of the rain storm
And Paulie he ain't slipping yeah he got that thang on
You know what he did to Tony he won't get the same song so
When he hit the crib he spin the block before he park it
Paulie ain't bitch at all Paulie just cautious
But little did he know niggas in the streets talking
And out his rear view it's like he seen a reaper walking
Nigga with a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparking
Shot hit the window get low he tryna off him
Youngin' boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching, trigger squeezing, trying get him off him
Them shots ringing youngin' squeezing clip empty
That's when Paulie rose like Derrick, put six in him
Walked down on him he laying in a puddle

Fourthth of July, light up the sky, step on my shoes
All I do is feed niggas and they call it food
That’s my fool, I assume you know he in the room
You hear the boom, soul floating like a balloon
Fatal wound, if war niggas yell “I played the rules”
A lot of goons, cocaine bitches consume
Still fill the room, King of Diamond, go get the broom

Fast whips, G wagon that’s horse and carriage
Marriage is not for me I’m rich and careless
Ex-ex relax under my mattress
Fourty blocks of white, that Marshall Mathers
Eight mile, a while my shit was stagnant
Seven fifties do ‘eight’ figures, young nigga at it

Was we ready for this move really honestly
Did you ever have the tools to really honor me
Well I fell in love and I had a great time
Now I'm back out on the streets no more face times
For the have nots I could've been a mascot
A lil timid with these women on my cash route
Counting paper in the ghetto underneath my rag top

Drop your seed off, let the weed up

Grinding 'til my new accountant is fully at ease
Beefing with broke niggas really like pulling my teeth

You can have the ex, I got enough hoes
You can have my next, once we a month old
Reptile black, Birkin Bamboo handle
Now the trophy on the mantle, well I got a Phantom
Being down and out was inconceivable
When you find out the one you love is just misleading you
Tryna make a living, remain spiritual
Egotistical ways I embraced back in middle school
If the chick was game, we would run a train
Send her home on a bus, then forget her name
But now the bitches be the realest ones
I done cried on the shoulder when I'm feeling numb
Seen a man getting life and never shed a tear
But his daughter in the ninth never pierced her ears

Inmates gave me commissary just because I'm famous
Or is it 'cause I'm rich and I know what pain is? 
Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman
Now accept these words as they came from Eminem
Democratic party sentenced to the pendulum
Killing them, I voted for Andre Benjamin
Head of black music do you know what rhythm is? 
Stick your head in the basket, it gets venomous
Straight clear my chicks finish my sentences
Time to squash the beef, or kill a nemesis
Show up at the wedding in my Timberlands
And for the record, know my best man will kill a bitch

So if I die before I wake, say I, I lived my way
Never said I would be perfect
Never said that I deserved it
Never said I wouldn't lie
Never said I wouldn't make my mom cry
But if I'm gon' die, I believe it's alright

Enchanted by women who speak nasty
Tip toeing to court, went there for the past week
Leaning on my lawyer pinky looking glassy
Charges dropped, these plaintiffs just wanna tax me
Secret service wanna see me driving taxis
Hug my attorney and then we do the money dance
Whitey Bulge' your horse, soldier leaving Vietnam
Pledge allegiance to the flag
Where we keep it 100 and get your money back
Pull a plug, brain dead, dope game nigga
Knew the rolls was fake and so we brought the real with us
Repertoire hustle such a tenacity
High roller, bet us another masterpiece
More Rakim then maybe Master P
Thirsty nigga paid in full I'm tryna buy the beach

Caution, I'll approach you with a business mind
Slight two step as I check the time
Rub my hands when my palms itch
50 in the bank diamonds looking flawless
This the sway of a rich nigga
Praying for the day my nigga seeing 6 figures
Black bottles popping when I'm on the turf
Two private jets what this nigga's worth

No whip under a hundred grand

Propellers out the window over our lands
Where I land

Top floors, cop rooms no reservations
Gold in my grave, half a ticket in my coupe
Ex cheerleader flipping now this nigga truth
Money piles have got me out on Sunny Ave
Black with me everywhere I go he'll gun you down
Full clips, magazines yeah the Forbes list
If this all for nickle recount it, it's bullshit
But when it right we do the money dance
Fly nigga my nigga Randall Cunningham
When she hear the slang then she know the name
Italian suits for the gooks I spend it on the chain
Pool so long we should take a swim
I love that ass fat, I can spread it thin

Uh, I feel wonderful, how about yourself?
You rolling with the real niggas you know we got it

As the world turn and the weed twist
Flew a hundred niggas to Veil on a ski trip
Put away the dope we can see the slopes
We built this shit together why it mean the most
Head on collision somehow I walk away
Give you music for free recouping with the yay
You're rocking with the bow-tie Don
In God we trust, I bust and post bond
In the hood we the Run-DMCs
Best quotes and ropes we don't need
Death Row on foul like Cool C
Big glossy the bitches like ""who's he?""
The Corvette was a beast I had to lease
Six months then we're free to holler, ""peace""

They sent my nigga on house arrest
I'm coming through nigga they ain't stopping this
I bring the beach to the front door
All bitches out the pool we need to park the boat
Turn South Georgia to Florida
And turn the rest over to the lawyers
'Cause we ain't tryna hurt nobody
Just tryna bring life to the party
If I ain't change your mind think whatever
One thing you can't change is I changed the weather
And this my Rockafella flow

They say I always left a paper trail
Duffle bag in the attic, now how that paper smell (Woh)
And I musta left it there for several years
In case of emergencies, go get a set of wheels
Burning tobacco with my ancestors
Learning lessons on my transgressions
Accept in the street, niggas we live by different rules
Pill poppin’ everyday I’m in a different mood
They scream our names since we walk the halls (Boss)
With everything to gain only fear Allah
Full metal jacket still the wardrobe
Never waste a prayer for peace in a war zone
Pray to keep the lights on your porch on
Even better pray I get to see my boy grow
Before Instagram we did it up in the ozone
Only nigga still killing never told on

First and one, I got it on the goal line
Fully automatic weapons for my O line
Wanna buy the team they say I need a cosign
I got a beacon jumping out the gym
My new freak she Puerto Rican trying to reel me in
Hit the homey from the hood I told him fill me in
On top of that he said he good, I told him bring me 10
Gentrification across the barren land
I thought the goal was get rich be a married man
Never question my vision I seen atrocities
But I also see profit on several properties
Still rising enterprising young entrepreneur
Ostentatious globe-trotting out with Lira Galore (Young Coco)

Pick me up in that new ‘Rari swerving lane to lane

So it better be that Ghost or that double R
My Alma mater is serving fed time
See the streets before God cut off his deadline
Demigod so tomorrow grows the prominence
Bastard case you can see that was some common sense
I entertain niggas under poverty lines
So I paint these pretty pictures as part of my rhymes
Crack spots block to block I’ve been a benefactor
I don’t think you understand the type of chips I’m after
Corporations but they run them like they small time

Who really gonna be your rider when the Bentley's gone?

I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another verse

I was all alone, car full of niggas
How'd I get here? Car full of hittas
I was rollin' weed, they was snortin' blow
Such a cool breeze, heart so cold
Step up to the plate, where your money at?
Bobby Brown on cake with a hundred packs
New editions, Lisa Lisa
We were secret lovers, had to get a beeper
My Atlantic star, not a Notre Dame
Not a student loan, tried to motivate
Continental, my Bentley, this shit should be illegal
Selassie eye in the ghost, thousand bales of that diesel
Lord, go toe to toe with any pussy boy
Fuck, one time for facin' all the Boobie boys
26 inch plates on a 68
Where I'm from a half a key'll set a nigga straight
I just wanna make the car notes
Let mama make the pot roast
You should meet me at the car wash
Washin' all 8, that's inshallah

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do
Hustle 'til I see the dirt
Riskin' 25 years just to see another verse

Speakin' for those squeakin' in them cell blocks readin'
To blacks, whites and Puerto Ricans
Brothers with those ankle bracelets, impatient for their releasin'
To make it back to the block, the hatred, the priest hit
Time sure flies, look how many years went by
My young niggas already need hair dye
Alcoholic faces, women bad as a mug
Gettin' fat as fuck
Fried food be addin' up, the system thrives off its victims
They ask how this economic collapse
Can affect people all over the map
Tea party for tax reenactment is whack
The past the past, yo, to my vatos out in the East Los
Nietas on the east coast, shouts to Puerto Rico
Dominican Republic people, rep I
Brown and black, we must get it together
The prison industrial complex a fuckin' set up
The Aztec, almac, African settled on this land from the get up
I changed my aim, who I'm gon' wet up
When violence is resorted, knowledge is distorted
Unless it's payback for brutality
I'm more or less with that, get back

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke

Smoking good shit 'cause they tryna take me back to some hood shit

If they start shooting all they remember is Nas was there
Some homies of yours bangin’ affiliation on their personal time

Straight to the jeweler, and did the watches the same way

No material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this

I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath
Attain wisdom and refuse graph
And build upon what I built on
And wisely regulate time I do have
'Cause what is defeat?
But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste
So I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove the schism when the rules missing
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships
Just invest in my business
And appreciative of the rarity of my existence

'Cause I got chillin' by the million
Tranquilo by the kilo, nigga, nigga

Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga

I got bitches on bitches
All my dreams and my visions
I remember me fishin' out of canals in the trenches
Now a nigga be flossy
Rolls Royce lookin' glossy
Quick to put down a demo to get these haters up off me
I like to smoke to myself
I just try to improve
Let my son hold my strap while I swim laps in the pool
Told my daughter the rules which we all must abide
Your daddy was far from perfect, things we did to survive
I just wanted to fly, they always lookin' down on us
School district full of killers, I mean these niggas ferocious
Only violence and drugs, there was nothin' for us
All I had was this music, I couldn't afford to do much

'Cause I got chillin' by the million
Tranquilo by the kilo, nigga, nigga
And I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs

Tranquilo by the kilo, nigga, nigga
And I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga

Young nigga say, ball
'Cause he ain't really livin' life 'less he's down to roll the dice
Put it all on the line for a couple dollars
And a bad bitch that only think about him if he, call
Is it really worth the time and the effort?
Chasin' wood grain and the leather
Puttin' pressure on the pedal, I don't want the devil
Hopin' he fall
Feed him to his nonsense, mothafuck a contract
You don't need a handout, they gon' bring the bands out
Choppas make 'em stand down, good Lord
But you don't wanna be another nigga
Chase the figures that never really add up
White folk pass your face
Dyin' in the grass 'cause they wouldn't call the, law
'Cause you're hooded, Black and they think you're sellin' crack
Maybe so, you don't give a fuck in a rut, nigga
Ten toes in the street got you stuck, nigga, what, nigga?
Buck, buck, nigga
Buried your partner just the other day knowin' he was too young
Had a tool, tryna roll on the folk
Let it go on the folk
But he wasn't down to shoot one
Know the time dead and gone
Is YOLO what we on?
I heard different, it's never too late to listen
And be reborn
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Go be reborn
Peace and understanding is what you should be on

'Cause I got chillin' by the million
Tranquilo by the kilo, nigga, nigga

Yea, that's where we at with it
Take it to the top
Just cause you are a character
Don't mean you have character
We taking stock right now
You ready? Let's go

A wise man know what he know and what he doesn't
If he's not really sure what he's saying, he don't discuss it
A righteous man walks the earth without judgment
And loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
A pious man relies on religion for his direction
At times he introspective, but his bible he'll never question
A dying man will make a confession, try to get into heaven
Thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
A violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
Get post-traumatic stress disorder, become an officer
A man of peace uses his words in different mediums
He'll bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
An honest man knows only lies are scared of the truth
His word is his bond, but his action's always to prove
A faithful man never need evidence to believe
But still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
Let's go

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see, I understand
But the picture is so much bigger
Than what we could even imagine
It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

Top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
All the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
Rain down, thunder storm with the flows
Articulate with the bounce, now I'm back like I'm Derrick Rose
Once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
Nefertiti would hold me when I was cold
Communion Sunday, my twenties, went in the bowl
Forgive me lord for them bitches the night before
Binny's deals And these Bentleys I can't afford
Gotta be the example for children to do their chores
Blowing weed smoke on the cover of The Source
Rolling Stones on the blunted was the boss
Fallen soldier on his own so we march
Roll up a bag of that weed, therefore I spark
Recite the Quran, I'm in the dark
Devil knocking on my door, he like a narc

Sometimes it's hard to believe
In what you don't see, I understand
But the picture is so much bigger

It's hard to feel better
When the weight of the world make you feel sadder
Put your faith into action
Heads up and eyes open

No excuses, if I start it then I'll see it through
God is what I see in you, so you might as well believe in you
Think what you see on TV's true? The media deceiving you
They misrepresent and misquote and then they misleading you
Belief is a funny thing, in case you're wondering
If they want the ring, they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
These average rappers is acting up for the dough
Yeah I tell you what I believe, but I back it up with what I know
It's the facts versus the facts simile, your raps killing me
My last victory was great moments of Black history
I celebrated with a bottle I just brought back from Italy
And some loud, I got super packs like I backed Hillary
Lost in desire, I walked through the devil's fire
I inspire the resurrection of kings like Hezekiah
The trust you put in me to be a beast with this rhyming
That's where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science

Ok, cool
Came back two weeks later, I got access
Soon as I got on the cell block I heard it all the way from down the hallway

It feels good when you make it from nothin'

I always need a prayer before we do the toast
My circle competitive, let's see who move the most
I gave my niggas game before they do the roast
Now let's talk about numbers, I really do 'em both
I still got two real uncles who still be doing dope
One of them used to run wit a freaky stokes
So many new faces sometimes I do get ghosts
Still one call away from ones who really knew me most
Stand in my lane, out of the uzi smoke
You only beating cases based on who you know
Public defender gave him a funeral
Juvenile sent to Rikers, he never knew the rules
Assesin' religions, he don’t know who to choose
Let's bow our head over these Ramen noodles
God is the greatest and I pray for peace
Still rolling up that leaf, Mr. Drew Ali, I salute you

Damn, it feels good from way up here
Damn, it feels good, baby
Yeah, from way up here
I just want the money, baby, yeah
Hey, what they want from me, baby
And we still want it
Money is coming, we still run dough
Niggas' pile run up but we never lay low
Niggas kept it real so we never lay low
Never lay low
Running through the money, going way up
Money on the wheels, go way up
The doors on the coupe go way up
It's so easy to hate us
Niggas in the club spilling Aces of Spades
Popping on the bub' and they love a check
Niggas going somewhere, I'mma make it
If you ain't got my money I'mma take that
They probably thought a nigga wouldn't shine like this
Got deals so I signed like this
Diamonds on my neck, I blind them with the wrist

Down by a stream in a hollow
Turn your head feel the breeze

For the white King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

They let him in by a back way
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round

Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn color
Cover your neighbor we'll be all right

There will be no game today, she cried across the board

And all the pieces cheered as tidings spread abroad

I've given you cookies and candy, and the woofer, and you
Still don't want to be good. Come on now honey-sugar, you know

Come on now baby, you hear the phone ring
And sometimes you don't even answer and you know
I love you and you just treat me all kind of ways
Come on now, honey-sugar, you know your baby waitin' on your love doll
You know you got my load. Can't you hear me talking to you, honey?
I try to treat you good and give you everything you want and sometimes
I see you making love with your love doll
But I still love you more than I love my clavinet
Come on now honey-sugar you know your baby love
You know just the other day I was gonna take you to go see a movie
Sweet, sweetback, cause I thought it might give you some inspiration
'Cause we ain't made love in so long, come on now sweet little sugar
Honey baby, now what if you knew I was going to put my harmonica down
Just to make love to you
Come on now honey, you know the woofer's waiting on you
Come on now baby, you know your baby loves you
Even more than he loves his clavinet

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.

And stay by my side until morning is nigh.

Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.
