Deep Purple,"Found some money in an old black jacket
I'm going out tonight, gonna find me a woman or two
I don't know how long it'll last
But I never regret the past
When I wake up tomorrow, I'll be looking around for you 
I got no reason to be down at the station
I got no ticket, but I'm gonna take a fucking ride
Don't care where I go
I never seem to know
I never had a penny, but I never wondered why
Oh no, I never wondered why 

If I'm cold I need some heat
If I'm hungry then I eat
I'm not responsible 

I woke up this morning and I couldn't find my shoes
It's one long party and I haven't seen the sun for days
I'd take you out tonight, but I'm just a little light
So let's go out anyway, you'll be amazed 

I take my woman to the palace dancing
I never coulda made it but the doorman is a friend of mine
So I raise a glass to you, the foot is on the other shoe
You can pay the bill and while you're at it pick up mine
Oh, no no, I don't mind 

If it rains I stay inside
If I'm scared I run and hide
I'm not responsible, oh no",Not Responsible,1984
Deep Purple,"Infidel can you hear
Would-be strange delight
I need you to give your sympathy tonight
When you hear what I say
Deeds I've done
Realize I've never lost and never won

I've got a feeling that it's never right
There was a reason but it's out of sight
It's going down somewhere tonight
Under the gun

Put death in my hand
Learn to fight
Who could care if it's wrong or if it's right
We got no choice
Under command
We're ordered to die or take this land

Stupid bastards and religious freaks
So safe in their castle keeps
They turn away as a mother weeps
Under the gun

When brave men fall
Under crimson skies
There's a sadness reflected in a soldier's eyes 
Tears will dry
For those I kill
Remember no more their names but someone will

The only way to be victorious
Screw the fools who think it's glorious
Who gives a toss about the likes of us?
Under the gun",Under the Gun,1984
Deep Purple,"The day is gone
When the angels come to stay
And all the silent whispers
Will be blown away
And lying in the corner
A pair of high heel shoes
Hanging on the wall
Gold and silver for the blues

One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show

Someone is waiting behind
An unlocked door
Grey circles overhead empties
On the floor
The cracks in the walls have
Grown too long
The slow hand is dragging on
Afraid to meet the dawn

One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show",Wasted Sunsets,1984
Deep Purple,"The sky is red, I don't understand
Past midnight I still see the land
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand 
The city's a blaze, the town's on fire 
The woman's flames are reaching higher 
We were fools, we called her liar 
All I hear is ""Burn!""

I didn't believe she was devil's sperm 
She said, ""Curse you all, you'll never learn!
When I leave there's no return ""
The people laughed till she said, ""Burn!""
Warning came, no one cared 
Earth was shakin', we stood and stared 
When it came no one was spared 
Still I hear ""Burn!""

You know we had no time
We could not even try 
You know we had no time 

You know we had no time
We could not even try 
You know we had no time 

The sky is red, I don't understand
Past midnight I still see the land 
People are sayin' the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand 
Warning came, no one cared 
Earth was shakin, we stood and stared 
When it came no one was spared 
Still I hear ""Burn!""",Burn [Live],1985
Deep Purple,"Black night is not right,
I don't feel so bright,
I don't care to sit tight.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

I don't need a dark tree,
I don't want a rough sea,
I can't feel, I can't see.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.

Black night, black night,
I don't need black night,
I can't see dark night.
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line
that I'm free, free to be me.
Black night is a long way from home.",Black Night,1985
Deep Purple,"Emmaretta, did you get my letter?
I sent it to you, oh Emmaretta
Do you still feel when night is falling
Something calling, oh Emmaretta
Behind my thoughts, oh Emmaretta
I can get to you to feel better
I must go now, oh Emmaretta
Full moon's rising, oh Emmaretta
Oh, it's a thousand miles
Oh, and I need you child
Oh, they can drive me wild
What I feel can make it real
Help
Oh, it's a thousand miles
Oh, and I need you child
Oh, they can drive me wild
If what I feel can make it real
Emmaretta, did you get my letter
I sent it to you, oh Emmaretta
Do you still feel when night is falling
Something calling, oh Emmaretta",Emmaretta,1985
Deep Purple,"When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind, opened up the door

Help me if you can I'm feeling down,
But I do appreciate your being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
Now I know I need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can I'm feeling down,
But I do appreciate your being 'round me
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please help me, my love?  

(Help) I need somebody
(Help) Not just anybody
(Help) I need someone

Won't you please help me, my love? 
Help me baby, help me",Help!,1985
Deep Purple,"You're sweeter than the morning
When the sun is shining down on me
There is nothing you can say
That could make me go away you see
But you keep saying to me baby

Hold on, 
I feel I'm getting ready
Hold on, 
I feel I'm rockin' steady
Hold on, 
I'm gonna make it with you woman
Hold on, 
You got to gimme some love, gimme some love

I held back before
But your love took me easily
You got the power
I knew was gonna creep up on me
The more I give
Your love keeps comin' on strong
Although it's mine now
I know it won't be for long
There's something in the saying
That a woman needs a little more time
I'm getting tired of waiting for you
Giving me some kind of sign

Hold on
I've got to love you when I want to
Hold on
You've got to love me when I want you to
Hold on
I ain't gonna let you leave me baby
Hold on
No never no more

I know the game you're playing
And I guess you think I'm easily led
You think the words you're saying
Are really going through my head
I'm gonna take you home
And give you all I can
I'll prove to you, baby
That really I'm a man

Hold on
I know I'm feeling ready
Hold on
I know I'm rockin' steady
Hold on
Guess I've made it with you woman
Hold on
I've got you giving me love

Something that you give me
Keeps me hangin' on
No use me stayin'
There's nothing to be done
I'm gonna take you home
And give you all I can
I'll prove to you woman
That really I'm a man

I only want to take you higher
Hold on
You are the root of my desire

Hold on",Hold On,1985
Deep Purple,"Take the trouble to decide the things you do
Will not be the things that don't appeal to you
See the mess your makin' can't you see your fakin'
Gonna make it hard for you, you're gonna - into the fire

Turn on the mandrake that was given to you
See if you can make it like the others do
Feel the blood a knockin' when you're finger poppin'
Gonna make it hard for you, you're gonna - into the fire

Stop your bleeding mind before it's over and done
Listen very closely to the message I've sung
Feel the blood a knockin' when you're finger poppin'
Gonna get a message through, you're gonna - into the fire",Into the Fire,1985
Deep Purple,"Get outta my way

Got to get my feet back on the ground

Lady double dealer
Get outta my way
Lady double dealer
You got nothing to say

I ain't satisfied
Dealin' with second hand goods

Taking everything you could

But you ain't waitin' 'round for me to lose

Lady double dealer
Get outta my way
Lady double dealer
You got nothing to say
I gave love to you
Did what you wanted me to
But all you did was bring me down
So I just had to try
Try to reason why
You took advantage of my love

Two timin' woman
Tryin' to take me for a ride
You're a hard lover honey
But you sure don't keep me satisfied
I wanna be there

Faces, smiling everyone
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition
I feel it in my heart

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

Talk about her like a Queen
Dancing in a Eastern Dream
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river
That carries me away

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

But I'm at home and I just don't belong 

So far away from the garden we love
She is what moves in the soul of a dove
Soon I shall see just how black was my night
When we're alone in Her City of light

Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire
I get high

Deep Purple,"Read all about it; tell me 
Have you heard the news?
Captain Bob - he don't pay no dues 
You know he's looking in my window 
He's stepping on my toes 
Don't want the truth, and it goes to show 

I got a joker up my sleeve 
I know what to believe 
It ain't right just because 
It's in black and white 
Find yourself a hero 
Treat him like a friend 
You build him up and tear him down again 

It don't hold a candle 
Hold it to the light 
Check it out 
Is it wrong or right?
Is this the news of the world?
It's just a pretty girl
She's all the news that's fit to print in 

Black and white 
Inside information, taken down note by note 
A silent footstep, that's all she wrote 
Shit, that's all she wrote 
No need to worry, the baby's gone to bed 
Dreaming dirty dreams in black and white and red 

Now I got nothing to fear 
Is this the scoop of the year?
Headlines on my bathroom wall 
In black and white",Black and White,1987
Deep Purple,"Don't look too long in my face
It could be a big mistake
I'm hanging on a thread so fine
I need a little space
I shouldn't say, but I know I must
I've had enough of pain
I'm pissed off standing in the rain

It makes me feel like
A mad dog
I got nothing to lose
Mad dog
You got nothing I can use
Mad dog
Howling at the moon
A mad dog

I need no friends
I'm on the edge
Of a broken dream
Laughing at the pain
But it makes me want to scream
I should've known
She'd be no good
She tore my heart in two
But I don't need to talk to you

You make me feel like
A mad dog
I got nothing to lose
Mad dog
You got nothing I can use

She said a hard man is good to find
And then she raised a doubt
All that I could give she took
And then she threw me out
Well I don't care
I don't care anymore
I'm going to lose my grip
I'm going to let it rip

Deep Purple,"Flying to Salt Lake City
Seats 3a and be	
I was down and needed
A window
But in 3a sat Mitzi Dupree
She said hi I am Mitzi
The queen of the ping pong
Where you going boy
I said nowhere
She said I'm moving on
I thought what is this
I cannot resist
Here she is
And I've always wanted a girl
With a name
A name like Mitzi Dupree

She said what do you do
I said I'm a singer in a band
She said ya I'm an entertainer
Reached out and took my hand
She was going to a mining town
Way up north to do her show
I said it must be cold up there
She said depends on who you know
Oh that look in her eye
I can tell you no lies
I'm just a man
She made me feel like a king in my mind
I love you Mitzi Dupree

I said what is this queen of the ping pong business
She smiled what do you think
It has no connection with china
I said ow have another drink
Well I knew right away
That I'd seen her act before
In a room behind a kitchen in Bangkok
And three or four times more in Singapore
She may not be the first
But I know she ain't the worst
She was mine but I ran out of time
I miss you I love you Mitzi Dupree
My darling Mitzi Dupree",Mitzi Dupree,1987
Deep Purple,"Well there must have been a reason
for the smile that you had upon your face last night
Are you the cat that got the cream
Did you lick your lips did you close your eyes
Can you imagine how it feels
It's so hard to reveal
Oh I can't get through and I'm falling
I'm getting out, I'm losing ground
The Spanish archer's gonna bring you down

is there someone somewhere waiting in the wings
to take my place
Let's not drag it out like a Cagney death scene
In this season of change it's not hard to explain
Like the leaves on the trees I'm falling
And as you turn, don't look away
The Spanish archer's gonna make you pay

Do you remember when the sky was blue
we used to talk for miles
And now we drive along in this thundering silence
It's such an obvious lie with that easy smile of yours
I'm letting go and I'm falling
I'm getting out, losing ground
The Spanish archer's gonna bring you down

Well is there something I can say as we stumble to the edge have we gone too far
Why don't we call it a day before we call it a nightmare darlin'
If we made a mistake then all that it takes to be free
Is the wave of a hand and you're falling
And as you turn, don't look away
The Spanish archer's gonna make you pay",The Spanish Archer,1987
Deep Purple,"Strangeways
Strange, strange

I was born into confusion
My mother said to me
'When you become a man you'll understand'
But it's still a mystery
'And if you want to get ahead
Get some decent clothes
The only way to make it
Dress the part'
That gets right up my nose

And I think to myself in this river of doubt
This is something I can do without
But strangeways is what I got

The indians are coming Isaw it on tv
They're 20,000 strong
But they always get depleted by the cavalry
Salvation is at hand
It's guaranteed
Just send a donation straight to God
1-800 toll free

And I think to myself in this academy of fear
Where am I going what am I doing here
But strangeways is all I got

Have you seen the headlines
Princess engaged
3 million out of work
But that's on the 2nd page
The alien has landed
Finger in his ear
Can't hear a word I am saying
But that ain't such a bad idea

And I think to myself in this cradle of lust
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
But strangeways is all you get",Strangeways,1987
Deep Purple,"Sweet Lucy was a dancer
But none of us would chance her
Because she was a samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high

Enjoy a little paradise
The lock was in my pocket
When Lucy met the rocket

Sweet Nancy was so fancy
To get into her pants we
Had to be the aristocracy
The members that she toyed with
At her city club were something in diplomacy

So we put her on the hit list
Of a common cunning linguist
A master of many tongues
And now she eases gently
From her Austin to her Bentley
Suddenly she feels so young

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
Oh, it's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
No, it's not against the law

As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
And cold spirits of ice
All my life I am the echo of your past (echo of your past)

I am returning the echo of a point in time
Distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your, all your life shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
Perfect strangers

I know 
I know, I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind

Her hand upon her hip
Said 'look out boy

Licking her lips but I had the taste

I was coming to the boil
Her fires were burning
She was pouring on the oil
I do not jest, she really took me to the cleaners

It turned into a laugh
It ended with a scream

Washing the sin from the street
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing ground
Just trying to make ends meet
Well I work every day to sweat out my dreams
Won't you show me that you understand
It's only my life, whatever that means
And you've got it all in your hands

I need someone to pull me through
Won't you take the pain from my head
Give me all your loving, the way you always do

And my nights are getting too long
My hopes and my fears take their toll on the years
And my willpower's almost gone

A time of desperate need
Sometimes life don't make sense
Fighting the anger, jealousy and greed
One day I'll look back and wonder where it all went

I've got a warning for you
You've got to learn to take more care

And I felt the pain
In a dirty little room

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

The minute that you said good-bye.
I thumbed right through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry.
And I went from A to Z;
I took out every pretty girl in town.
They danced with me, and while I held them,
All I did was to talk about you.
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There is just no getting over you.
No girl who is in my little red book,
Just ever could replace your love,
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinking of.
Won't you please come back to me?
Without your precious love I can't go on.
Where can you be?  I need you so much.

Hear your name and I start to cry

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale

Had a friend once in a room
had a good time but it ended much too soon
In a cold month in that room
we found a reason for the things we had to do

Deep Purple,"If you're leaving close the door.
I'm not expecting people anymore.
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale. 

Had a friend once in a room,
Had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do. 

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.",When a Blind Man Cries [Livesex-Re-Act-A-Mix],2007

Say a prayer for the lost and the broken down
It don't matter where you come from
You will end up being from the wrong town

I came up from Jackson Corner
Just to have me a drink and look around
I went back with Deacon's daughter
She was looking for a way to get out of town

Everything gonna be alright
And the sun's gonna shine tonight
Everybody gonna come my way
And we'll understand it all one day

Caught a ride with pulpwood driver
He was drinking red liquor from the floorboard
Said he used to have a daughter
Now he don't want to think about it any more

We went flying down a two lane
God knows why we didn't see the bridge out
She went down in yellow water
Now it's all in the world I can think about

I had a dream
It didn't make no sense
I saw myself tangled up in a barbed wire fence

A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery

I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said I ain't for takin' won't you ever learn

I want you I need you I gotta be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you I need you gotta be near you
Ooh I got a strange kind of woman

She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
Saturday nights from now on baby you're my star

She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride
I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died

Deep Purple,"Called to Madonna
To give me a line
She said boy what have you done
Passing your time with a holy man
Talking about the moon and sun
But I can't tell the difference
Between the fool and wise
Show me a river to follow
Away from all these lies

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me your hand
I've been picking up my bones too long
Won't you understand

Called to the captain
To put me ashore
For it looked like no man's land
Is this the way to follow
I cried as I shook his hand
He told me had no answer
He didn't really hold the key
I am a simple man
Was all he said to me

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me a hand
I've been out in the cold too long
Won't you understand
I've been on the road so long
Won't you lend me your hand
I've been out in the cold too long
Won't you understand

Heard my mother crying
She was calling out my name
Whisper in the dark night
Saying who's to blame
The hour glass keeps turning
With not enough sand to see
I am a holy man
So don't you bother me

I've been on my own so long
Won't you lend me your hand

The line that's drawn between the good and the bad
See the blind man shooting at the world

Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

Pulling kids out the ground

It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

It was empty cold and bare

With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat

We can spend the cash

I do things for you

Took you out to lunch
Spent fifty on your food 
You ain't eat that much

I'll smash some twins
I peep game from a distance

So let me swing your wheel
In your red Seville
I put food on these tables
You can pay these bills

Type of sistas
Were T.Y.P

We need a woman to help us out
And never
A girl like you who don't know what a player's about

Put baggets in my grill
Buy a house on a hill?
Then maybe we can chill 
If you can't come through
Then you gon' get the boot

Every thing was gravy
Till you started talking about them dollars
Trying to be another gangsta boo
But, uh, I'm a make you holla holla
Like J-rule 
I'm a act a fool
Can't get a dime from owing me
Better ask my partner 
That boy, lil' Marcus 
Can't get that F.Y.B to the E
That's J-five
We struggling to strive
Up in this thing for finer things
Breaking up all these plots and schemes
Can you put a bling bling up in my ring?
That's your best friend 
I'm talking baggets
If you really want to, uh, keep it real
Baby, I'll drop half on the bills 
But you need to chill and keep it real
And that's fifty-fifty, not eighty-twenty
Tryin' to stack my paper up real tall and long
Talking down on my name like Jenny Jones
Blowing up my phone 
'Cause I'm riding on chrome
Better leave me alone 
And get lil' daddy to pay your bills
'Cause you don't know no playa wit' my skills
So you better chill and keep it real

Deepak Chopra M.D.,"A lover knows only humility, he has no choice. 
He steals into your alley at night, he has no choice. 
He longs to kiss every lock of your hair, don't fret, 
He has no choice. 
In his frenzied love for you, he longs to break the chains of his imprisonment, 
He has no choice. 

A lover asked his beloved: 
Do you love yourself more than you love me? 
Beloved replied: I have died to myself and I live for you. 
I've disappeared from myself and my attributes, 
I am present only for you. 
I've forgotten all my learnings, 
But from knowing you I've become a scholar. 
I've lost all my strength, but from your power I am able. 

I love myself...I love you. 
I love you...I love myself. 

I am your lover, come to my side, 
I will open the gate to your love. 
Come settle with me, let us be neighbours to the stars. 
You have been hiding so long, endlessly drifting in the sea of my love. 
Even so, you have always been connected to me. 
Concealed, revealed, in the unknown, in the un-manifest. 
I am life itself. 

You have been a prisoner of a little pond, 
I am the ocean and its turbulent flood. 
Come merge with me, 
Leave this world of ignorance. 
Be with me, I will open the gate to your love. 

I desire you more than food or drink 
My body my senses my mind hunger for your taste 
I can sense your presence in my heart 
Although you belong to all the world 
I wait with silent passion for one gesture one glance 
From you.",Desire,2000

Where no one knows me

It's a necessary thing

Counting stars and fighting sleep

Deepspace 5,"When the moon shines at noontime, and the sun blazes at midnight
Dark and Night coincide, I stay inside and keep the lid tight
Catch side of the morning that passes by through my window
Another child is born, another dies, and still the wind blows
Spin slow, drawn into strong voice of reason
Standing there in soul thinking of summer ?
Just longin' for another season
For no particular Reason hear I stand-
Just rocked another show, just can't remember where I am
And my families far from here, but the stars are bright this evening
On this morning on this afternoon, just got here now I'm leaving
And I shall remember the marble just as clear as I do yesterday
Never dance with the Devil, 'cause I can't afford the hell to pay
When I blast through your speakers every time your pressing play
When I fish the phonograph so we could set the record straight
Dear god I pray-
Just let me show this world a better way
How you helped through to your heart and all the times you fade away
I get to, say these words and speak my piece to Catholic Crowds
Not certain if it's Day or Night but I know the time is NOW
And if we ever lose the purpose as a prelude to the sound
Lets just call it a Day, and burn my empires to the ground...

Ya, amazingly, Cask of Amanciatto
Cracks wide open and vibrates your bravado
So I escape, body-bagging, like I'm kinda like Monte Christo
World Tour, DL, Koffeshop, and I'm coming to your Bistro
We show bright when it comes to your ability
I'll be yellin' out homonyms 'cause I dwell in possibility
We gonna call it a Day, 'cause I know your feelin' me
Listener, Rapper, Popuri of Life- all synonyms of Cornucopia
I'm so glad you have a wife- In this wolf eat samurai world
You better grab your swords and saw your nads off
You'll get chopped off by the needle as it spins over to my rhyme, yo.

Please think twice before you say your things in the microphone
I might not be, but I take it seriously
When you really listen to the words, an your not just hearing me...

Day and night
Wrong or right
Spill our guts with every breath on the mike
And hope you call it tight
If it's blind give it sight
If it's Dark make it Light
Some call it Music
Deepspace calls it Life

Workin' it out (out), placin' my feet to concrete
Hittin' the street with vengeance, steangence, so sweet
What bitter we consider every circle we pass
Probl'why the reason that I reason with class, so step fast
We pushed and finally pushed that was burnin' staying determined
And yearnin' 'cause the lessons we learnin' were life long (life long)
Its my song, I place to erase
And transpose all these average Joes
With weak flows-
Who knows not, -
The true livin' roles who ascended, blended
With the beat, compete, and apprehended
Today's feelin' all right, color all right
 Being blocked by the shotgun and pray every day and night
Now I've gone a full day without some wackness heard
The One's speakin' absurd-
Are finally heeding my word.   (ya right)
And now I'm left with nothing else to say
That be the Night that I Called it A Day (Called it a Day)

I'm gonna throw thoughts to a page
Let 'em fall where they please
Let 'em rise to the sky, rain down, on four seas
An ocean of possibilities that dwellin'
Yellin' at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon
A nocturnal being of love since the grown of time
Watch the sunrise with both my daughter's eyes
Permanent Shine, refine my reflection inside
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, and all glory given back to God

It was the Night that 24 turned into 12
Had to adjust my spiral off, from the top of the shelf
On the blank page, using the utensil of potential
I'm diggin' in my Brain so I could Rip the Instrumental
With 20 bars left, and I'm consistent from the intro
Lighting candle sticks, as the rain hits my window
Need to focus in, take the topic and let it flow
Got 8 down for the count and 16 to go
The Writer's blocks are stepping stones
Towards the metronome
I'm racing dead last
I'm head last
Placed on my prose
Nocturnal with my journal, a wordplay professor
The aggressor, resembling soda cans under pressure
I'm shakin' but not stirred, deterrent from my train of think
Now I'm aligned, readjusted to infuse the ink
I want to handcuff the hands of time
No great spirit here allotted for here's the sunshine...

[Chorus]

Bet I'm casting nets and dreads
The deep blue ways are wet?????
God's Silhouette, I want to palettes painted pink by suns and sets
BURNT from a long days work, but feelin' fine
Tip his cap and path the moon on his back, his day declines
Candlelight Switch as you slip into the evening
A courtesy to the sun, as it dips below the ceiling
Feeling sort of satellite, like the wind beneath my wings
Or the tightrope, or gravity keeps lunar kites on orbit strings
Man on the moonlight, dream before my time
Like the moon reflects the sun, I make the black begin to shine
Like the moon rewinds the waters, makes the ocean recline
I collapse your mind; I'm Syntax, but melancholy kind
Redefine the best, framed fresh in terms of holiness
Bless the mike, device, 'cause I get nice to keep the conscious
And I split tense mint's spit words like sentence fragments
Moon dust the must 'cause I ain't' in it for the cabbage
The incandescent presence spins, as I'm your present flame
But my name would flicker out my name syntax the wax and wane
For the name above names, I'm so glad that Christ came
The black bird bright the night, we called it a Day...

Shadows step on the one, on, under every tongue, run
Spoken sentence frags., spoken on shattered breaks
It's a black hole soul with my faith as I take

Break Minutes back with father time to coordinate seconds
I surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon

Villain threatened to sweat the syndrome of the wicked
Heading for your Auditory where the Listener would stick it

Fiction, we're steel, when it breaks from the construction
Crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption

Sunrays, like a score with notes my surfacing
Great mad at meteors or record the all heed

And when the, Sun Sets
Some one lets the mike down
We pipe down, unplug it and leave it hide down
But not before we retire the pen
'cause yo tomorrow we'll be back just to do it again

Uh, shackled and scarred
I still maintain my praise of dark days
A sullen world covered in pain
So from Dusk 'till Dawn, I represent his word

Well never did we ever think that these were desperate times or misery
And they softly spoke of how it's supposed to be
Never did I think that I was so naive

So please let me be lonely tonight
For how many times I thought this was the life
But I'm not so sure I even am alive

Well I've torn apart and warded off nearly every lover every friend
Every smile was so delicate, floated around until the nights would end
And I'd wander off and then I'd find a bed

But I knew that they were all Little White Lies

Look at how I've gone and made myself a fool
I couldn't please you, you never believed that I was true

Or I could stand and give a toast
To those who made it out alive
It's you I'll miss the most

I've got a fifty dollar bill
But somewhere in her weak heart
She knows I never will

Oh love, it's hard to hide it
True love, it's hard to find it
Though I was once beside it
I've fallen far behind it

From a tiny room up on Smith Hill
It's easy to disappear
It's easier to run off hiding
Then say ""I don't want you here""
I can't stand to face the facts
It'd only leave you hurt
I don't care much for what you have to say

When all he ever got was sympathy?
Take both your hands and put them round my neck
You're a fool for wanting everything
It couldn't be much fun being a millionaire to one
Cause a million's just a million of one thing
Cutting to the chase, I suppose there'll be a day
When all your tired hands will be put to shame
I've got a restless old woman standing by my side
She cannot wait for the finer things in life
She waited all this time so I suppose she has the right
But I drank away all the things I could provide
All of that aside I never meant to make her cry
But crying is just the baby inside
The ones that mess around that tend to fuss and bring us down
Tugging at your lips to make you frown
So my grandson will be living with a chip on his shoulder
And God don't listen to his prayers anymore
I hope he understands when he's a little bit older
That I always wished the best for him

And I was only of age one year

I was on the cusp of a breakthrough
When they took me out
and stuck it in
It went so deep, man
it leaves scars you relate to
Are only burdens to me

I was a dream, a dream, a dream of my self
I was no longer in good health

Have you ever been here?
Or someplace else you can relate to
Out of fear,
out of trials and error

I was no longer mine
I had pantomimed
I had felt for lights
I had grown to find
I had no place in mind
When I began to drive
No destination
No destination

You can feel my pain?
You want to relate,
you want to stay

I was feeling real bad
And I had found all my problems
I had found all my problems
They came flying up to me",Nitebike,2013
Deerhunter,"Take me on the trip man I’ll never get sick.
Take me wherever you go and I won’t complain along the way.
Well, I’ve been waiting so long to say bye bye bye.
This town ain’t gave me nothing but a bald head and trouble.

Well, if it can’t be better if it can’t be tried.
Doesn’t matter much boy and I will dry my eyes.
Well, I could be your boyfriend though I could be your shame.
Until I see your eyes in the beltway (?), babe.

Let’s go.
Hey, I came from the delta down to the plains.
Well, I came round from the delta right through the plains.
Right through the plains, right through the plains.
Right through the plains, right through the plains.

Well, I came from the delta down to the plains.
When I got back home there was nothing unarranged.
The woman that I love took another man.
When nothing ever ends up quite like what you planned.

They took me to the central station
and I jumped on board of that bus the long way.
Time to take my trip; give me that ticket, man.
Straight to Pensacola.",Pensacola,2013

I remembered all my drunk
Younger days in a daze
I would spend my empty days

For a week I was weak
I was humbled on my knees

I had conquered all my fears
Not alone anymore
But I found it such a bore

For a drunk I was young

You forced on me a hopeless dream
I've been looking for one true thing
Too numb to see I've been sleepwalking
Too horrified to see

Wait and think it doesn't get you down
You're flying now but you'll come back down
And with both your feet on the ground
You'll look around, yeah you'll look around
Too horrified to see

I've been looking for some harmonies
Some words to sing that could really bring
The lonely-hearted some company
All the people that were just like me yeah

When a decade is spent searching
For something time will never bring
Something starts to shut down inside
My body and my tired mind

Your heart, it's hard now
Can't you see, we've grown apart now
We've grown apart now",Sleepwalking,2013
Deerhunter,"Many years ago
I happened on a place
The shadows hanging low
I could make out his face
In an ancient mist
They gazed into the flame
Around a dying one
They chanted out a name

They looked up to the sky
Reciting ancient rites
The trees began to sway
Bathed in fluorescent light
The embers in their eyes
Fixed on the living dead
Motionless he rests
His skin was glowing red

And as sure as we stand
When we call
With our four hands
For the one from above
Who will heal us
With a touch

Take it anyway I could leave or I could stay
Wouldn't matter much to me, much to me

I could see a light up these, a light up these
A light up these, a light up these

It's all the same, it's all the same, it's all the same

My friend's dad got bored, changed his sex and had no more

No more wife, no more kids, nothing left

I was dreaming of a man with a heart attack

Martelés par les pas des prostituées quand s'éveille le soir

Et dans quelques années c'est ici que se terminera ma vie
Dans cette ville aux 10 000 cités, aux mille et une filles
Où le béton des tours caresse Aton qui brille
Mais ne te méprends pas, le pays d'où je viens
N'a rien à voir avec celui des merveilles

De vuelta de todo, pisando fuerte,
charlando a gritos con los amiguetes.
Atentos siempre al telediario

Discutiendo por la quiniela

rellenas formularios absurdos,
dejas tus datos, nadie te llama

""Ésto no es ningún balneario.

mirando en la ventana a la gente que pasa,

Def Jef,"But when it comes to
Protecting the lives of twenty-two million Afro-Americans
Then all of a sudden, Uncle Sam becomes very conscious, of legality

Here's the reason that, I've been upset for a while
'Cause if you're black you get life, but if you're white you're on trial
Ain't nothing to it, just like that chump Charles Stewart
They're always claiming, that the devil made me do it
For insurance, he killed his wife and his child
And blamed it on a brother, and racists got buck wild
He had the media, believing the, aesop fable
And all the whites were like, ""I can't wait 'til
They catch the bastard - I hope they fry him""
They were sure that he did it, there was no need to try him
And Willy Bennett, who was in it to win it
Got bassed and harassed cause they was sure that he did it
And the thing that really pissed me off and truly offended me
Is the suckers wanted to reinstate the death penalty
For a brother man, but not the other man
And when they found out, he killer her himself, hmm on the other hand
Now it's inhumane, bring it back they wouldn't dare
But his brother confessed he was with it, so give HIM the chair
But that won't happen with that punk Dukakis
Flynn and Mickey Roach, you better just watch for us
I don't want to hear that you're sorry to me
After you tore up, and started a war up in the black community
It's out of the news, but it's still in my head
Charles Stewart still lives even though the sucker's dead
I'ma speak upon it

He is trying to wipe, you, out
Trying to eliminate your total existence
With falsehood and lies
And he's succeeding in doing it!

Now here's a verse about a relative, that coulda lived
But killed by a cop that thought negative
Shot in the back like a victim of Jesse James
Tell them his motherf***ing name!
Phillip Pernell, murdered by a devil
That never saw a cell, so I'm here to raise hell and tell
About a child that was left to decay
And the next couple of days the pig was suspended with pay
Receiving support from cops and superior courts
And all we receive is a bullet inside a corpse
Now tell me, what type of justice has been done
What woulda happened if I shot his son?
I woulda been killed, taken to a chamber and filled up with gas
But yet nothing has happened to ?
So I had to take two extra steps
And put it on wax, cause I couldn't let it rest (why?)
'Cause I can't stand to see Satan smile
And get away with taking the life of a child
You meant to do it, so now your motto is (tell 'em)
The more bullets, the less blacks live (you better)
Watch your back you murderer because you're wanted
But for now, yo, I guess I gotta speak upon it

We've got to come together
Pool our efforts, our strength, our finance
And build our own nation
The Chinese did it, it's called Chinatown!

Let me speak upon this with a radical take as I take
Time to talk about the systematical break-down
And deliberate destruction through mis-education
Of the Nubian Nation
Starting in kindergarten, continuing through college
They continue to kick you trick knowledge
And call it education but I call it training
Washing your brain into gaining and maintaining
The American dream, but to me it's a nightmare
Because they keeps ya right where
They want you to be, mentally, physically, and monetarily
As you go merrily merrily merrily
Down the stream but it's more like up s***'s creek
Without a paddle and the boat's got a leak
We start drowning in all that s***, getting deeper
Mind's in a choke hold or should I say a sleeper
But I ain't going out like Rip Van Winkle
So you can't gas me up anymore, and I think you know
That I can see clearly now the rain is gone
It's bright outside, I see the light, and I'ma speak upon it

You know what I'm saying?
'Cause all that s*** they taught me in school amounted up to ZERO
(Word is bond!)
Abraham Lincoln ain't my motherf***ing hero, why know what I'm saying?
(That Devil ain't my hero neither)
Word up, yo this is Def Jef the poet with soul
Cooling with my man Eddie O.G.
On a funky funky funky funky funky funky track
(Yeah, Bulldogs is out there, why'knahmsayin?
ShaQuan, peace to you and Ace, why'knahmsayin?
Peace to Teddy Ted, Special K, DJ Doc, Ramos
Yeah boys, the soul brothers, why'knahmsayin?)
Oh yeah yeah, Craig B. ? Love and the Legend
And DJ Eric Vaughn, hah
(Word up)
Yeah

Notice this!
They put ""In God We Trust"" on a dollar bill
They don't even have it on a church
And don't even open the verses of their bible
But on the dollar bill is a big sign ""In God We Trust,"" correct?
Then they have, on the back of the dollar bill
The key, the scales, the pyramids
All of the symbols of bondage, slavery
How they took the country, who they took it from
Who you are, the builders of the pyramids
Without your eyes
You are the builders of the pyramids without your eyes
Because you don't know you did it
Why don't he know?
Because a traitor, taught him to eat wrong foods, since he was a baby
Put pork in him, has you eating pigs feet and ribs
Has you living in his image
And took away your divinity
And replacing it, with his low animalization",Speak Upon It,1991

coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard, 

don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk,

Def Jef,"[ VERSE 1 ]
Excuse me, baby, haven't I seen you before?
I don't forget faces, and I'm pretty sure
That I know you from a long time ago
I was in the 12th grade, you were a grade below
I used to see you in the halls, goin to class
And when you saw me pass, you switched that as-
tronomical butt from the left to the right
And you would give me letters sayin (call me tonight)
Now your face was pretty, and your body was hot
So then I thought to myself, and said, why not?
You can be the skeezer, I'll be the skeezee
I knock the boots, and you're strung on me
But I have to admit, you were a whole lotta woman
You had to be good, cause you kept me comin
Then I graduated, and I left town
That's why you haven't really seen me around
But after all these years, you're still lookin good
And if we got together, I know you would
Reminisce and miss this Def Jef kiss
I respark the flame, and I knew you'd just
want to give it here

Give it here
(Give it to me, give it to me)
[ VERSE 2 ]
I got a fat bank account, I'm pretty comfortable
But hey, I'm very picky bout the girls I pull
Because nowadays you never know
If girls like you, or they like your dough
They always say, ""Buy me that"", and I say, ""Buy you what?
You better keep your mouth shut and do the butt strut""
Cause I'm not spendin a dime until you spend some time
Givin me what I want, cause I'm in my prime
And you know what I want, so don't even play dumb
Girl, give me some, and I can make you come
Back to my house at all times in the mornin
You won't have to say, cause I know what you be wantin
You know the routine, so assume the position
I'ma take my pole, and I'ma cold go fishin
Like a tootsie-pop. you know that I last long
And if you can't sing. you be singin this song
Give it here

(Give it to me)
(Oh)
(Oh, you gotta give me some now)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Because you promised me the day that you quit you boyfriend
You'd let me in, so tell me when
Because you had me waitin and waitin for such a long time
You keep tellin me that it's the wrong time
You're makin it harder and harder
For me to control, and hold back that part of
Me that needs you, and wants to please you
Cause I know what you like, and I'll do more than HE do
So stop trippin, too late to start flippin
Before you start lippin, you need to go slip in-
to the negligé that I got you for your birthday
And don't be scared, cause I came prepared
So if you're old enough to give me shot
And if you're bold enough to take all I got
Don't say that you're ready if you really are not
Cause - mh, when I get hot
I'll give you more than anyone before
I'm not Prince, but I'll do you like you never been done before
Let's get together, I know we fit together
Like a hand and glove, come on and get this love
Just give it here

Give it here
(Give it to me, baby)
Yeah baby
You know I like it like that
Of course I love spendin time with you
You know you're my one and only
Ehm - ehm - hold it
What was your name again?

Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip 

Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip 

Of the ropes and chains that kept us 

Since we were black they didn't want to except us 

But it's ok, I got my own plan 

'Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program 

The natives cook, wash and clean 

And to the rubbers that throw in the scene 

M-A-N-D-E-L-A 

Now you got a chance to hear what he say 

Since they kept him locked up for so long 

'Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong 

But we need to all stand together though 

And let the red, black and green show 

Become aware of yourself before it gets too late 

Another message from King Tee the great

Hon living lovely, Miss Gouchi 

Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends 

Ugn, miss quick fast in a heedy 

Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy 

Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids 

And the man caught a nice thick bitch 

Now the bitch is on skid 

Screaming how she hates her kids 

The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy 

Think slick, she better get wit the wick

Black women and men from the white power structure 

They stucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya 

And you gave birth to a nation 

You freelabel laid America's economic foundation 

Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years 

But now here was a peer to give you shift in the gears 

The turn of the tables, knowledge and ables 

Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels

I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen 

And knowing his father slowing 

And his mother is hoeing 

And now should he be growing 

He's too young to be sewing 

he should just chill and be flowing 

I know he was being malested and sold 

And his mom for being infected 

Never check it, so I invested 

My time and made sure little bro was looked at 

Pops got evicted, not a smack 

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless? 

The bum got done by the one 

And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip 

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip 

It confuses and bent ill thoughts 

In the soul of the youngster 

Is daddy a monster 

That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain 

Drys and open your eyes for the insane

The whole sky froze golden
Some said it was the aftermath of the radium bomb
While the others told of a final retribution
A terrible revenge of the Gods
But we understood the grand finale
Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before
So all that was left was

All the women were captured and chained
And national suicide was proclaimed
And new America fell to the ground
And all the children lay crippled lame

But all the nations came together
In fear of the thought of the end
No more would we fight in the streets
No courage had we to defend

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

A blinding light the sun had died a new moon took its place
Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman race
The city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend
A sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the end

When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
When the walls came tumbling down
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound

Tonight - I see the fire in your eyes
Tonight - So right this night could be dynamite
Wait 'n' see, if it pleases you it pleases me

It's in your eyes, those eyes are where I wanted them
So give me heart 'n' soul, I lose control

Got a million ways to make my day, but daddy don't agree

He get plans for me 

Get your butt right out of bed - Stop buggin' me 
Get up and move your sleepy head - Don't shake my tree. 

He said 
Mow the lawn - Who, me? 
Walk the dog - Not my style, man! 
Take out the trash - No way! 
Tidy your room - see'mon get real! 
Sorry dad, gotta disappear, 
Let's get the rock outta here.

I'm your average, ordinary, everyday dude 
Drivin' with my baby, To get her in the mood 
She's dialin'through my radio and I'm ready to make my move, 
But what she got ain't rock'n'roll and it really blew my groove 

It was - Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven 
It makes me want to scream - Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins 
Turn it off! - That ain't my scene 
Well I'm sorry girl, here's my confession 
I suppose a rock's out of the question?

Def Leppard,"Could you ever steal a prayer to deny your God 
Could you ever buy your love and not count the cost 
Could you ever take a life when all was lost 
And would it ever be enough 

Could you bite the hand that feeds you and then ask for more 
Could you kiss the wound that bleeds spit it on the floor 
Could you open up your heart then close the door 
And would it ever be enough 

Every word you whisper 
All the tears you hide 
You die for love when it's alive 
But where does love go when it dies 

If you came across your dream would you walk on by 
Hold a candle to the wind and just let it die 
And is there room inside your mind for one more try 
And would it ever be enough 

I watch the time go rushing by it's like an ocean wave 
Showing you no mercy throwing dirt upon your grave 
You're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light 
And there ain't no prayer that's gonna save you now

Would you wash the pain away no one understands

Def Leppard,"Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the spiders from Mars. He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Now Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
'Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders, while the fly tried to break our balls
With just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kid was just crass, he was the nazz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man I had to break up the band.

Def Leppard,"These are the days we throw away
The words we never say
That I'm so fragile and so wrong
And we're still knockin' on the door
Of a world that's gone before
Until the real thing comes along

Kiss the day on it's way
And the sun will never shine
In your eyes like the skies
And the darkness will arise

Kiss the day and await
It holds you in it's arms
And the light will never fade
Kiss the day

And now I've seen enough to know
Though the truth can leave you cold
It can always lead you home
Back to the place where we belong
To the time when we were strong
When we could blow away the storm

Kiss the day on it's way
And the sun will never shine
In your eyes like the skies
And the darkness will arise

Kiss the day and await
It holds you in it's arms
And the light will never fade
Kiss the day, kiss the day

These are the days we throw away
The words we never say
Till the real thing comes along

Kiss the day on it's way
And the sun will never shine
In your eyes like the skies
And the darkness will arise

Kiss the day and await
It holds you in it's arms
And the light will never fade

Wake up screaming

Death of you again

Or just a fall from grace?

And I feel no shame

Or just a good man
Gone insane?
And my demons
Lie sleeping
Till my dreams come
Creeping in

Many years from now. 
Will you still be sending me a Valentine 
Birthday greetings bottle of wine. 

If I'd been out till quarter to three 
Would you lock the door, 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, 
When I'm sixty-four 

You'll be older too, 
And if you say the word, 
I could stay with you. 

I could be handy, mending a fuse 
When your lights have gone. 
You can knit a sweater by the fireside 
Sunday morning go for a ride, 
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, 
Who could ask for more. 

Will you still need me, will you still feed me, 
When I'm sixty-four 

Every summer we can rent a cottage, 
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear 
We shall scrimp and save 
Grandchildren on your knee 
Vera, Chuck and Dave 

Send me a postcard, drop me a line 
Stating point of view 
Indicate precisely what you mean to say 
Yours sincerely, wasting away 

Give me your answer, fill in a form 
Mine for evermore 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me.

I be the don up in this motherfuckin(ha ha)
I puts it down,I rock 'scapes
I roll bounce to the ounce(die-I!)
I bring dat physical front(aha)
Believe it I function the paraplegic
So teach it like if he was playin backgammon
A new sheriff in town and not reggie hammond
I pack a cannon .38 snuff nose
Not for shootin use it for executin
Lames out there callin my name
For fame,change ya plan punk refrain
This tune leaves ya whole crew stuck or stupid
Dumb and dumber all this summer
A newcomer,yeah I take em to check out the avenue
Me and my crew went through
Wooh!ah-ah!word is born!word is born!

(Redman)
I said ""come on!""(come on!),""come on!""(come on!)
We's the posse pair so some niggas can get done on
I'm not the one to funnel,I'm lyrically inclined
Seriously devine,whatever we g is crime
Ha!I take it down,make it clear and in your bare lair
Leaving critical as sang elsewhere
You want to get jig-dafied-what it all means
For such,I tote glocks in akarl jeans
For all means necer-ssary,my blood vessels
Turns to .38 specials and cause wind pressures
I be blowin like I'm mr.cool,the invincible
Keepin my court trials municipal
The principal my next class will teach you how to roll blunts
Pick up (aah!),buda and mex tags
Fifty the less,mo' vex,the soviets
Another co-nnect on my rolodex
I met my smokin vex,I keep my lyrics smack-daddo
Cash in your chips then proceed to blast metal
Next up I believe that's keith
Why don't ya get on the mic and rock the symphony

(Keith murray)
Well it's the 16-bar slaughterer,telepathical brain murderer
Comin with the sh-t you never heard
Ask yourself the very same question
Which crew is fuckingg with this squad in this profession
Your mic's in my possession,I crush you with aggression
An' I ain't talkin for niggas that learn a lesson
So why should I sit around and let this fake fuck pass my eye
Fake niggas fuckingg up my eye
Filthy with nasty it's the slog for the job
Forget any clan said ""who squad the mob?""
Tired of beat-down,shot up and robbed
Niggas askin why,it's my motherfuckin job
How many ways can I say ""I just don't give a fuck!""
Runnin niggas over in every truck
But my motto is ""fuck!get the bottle!pass the bottle!""
Bad luck had ya stuck,uh

Def Squad,"
If I gotta go out, I'm goin out ""Full Metal Jacket"" style
Reverse suicide to do or die
I'm broke, I lost my deal, my car, my brawl
And me and my landlord, we at war for the rent
Yo E and Keith, it's time to rob and steal
See that First National Bank? I'm showin my grill
Fuck a mask and a glove, I'm worldwide for drugs
Turn the TV on, that's me on America's
Most Wanted, for most blunted
That tricky shit you did, I done it
We rock gear for deer huntin               
When we do jobs, me and my dogs ready to get it
Snatch you out the five series like I'm winnin the pennant
Even at 112 degrees, sky's the limit
Sodomized the style till you idolized the finish
Sucker emcees get stuck too, fuck you
And if you blink, I'm 'a show you shit I be up to
Cause if the shit gets thick, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if you actin all that, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if we lose our jobs, (we stick a motherfucker)

I know you niggas checkin me out, ha ha ha, yo
I know you niggas checkin us out, ha ha
I know you niggas checkin me out, yo yo


Who want the Source, the E got 65 mics
So i guess, I got shit that motherfuckers like
Some rappers, they choose to be disobedient
Dummies, advance your skills from intermediate
I'm suave with it, my rhyme I play with it        
I cut the style up, and DJ with it
Can you help me? Ask Bill Bellamy what's the jam of the week
When he speak, it be something I freak
Who gives a fuck, I show and prove, I got juice
Drop my drawers and let mt balls hang loose
The green eyed bandit, shuts it down quickly
Taking care of business, since Strictly
Cats talk behind my back, I get heated
And bust a shot from my CLK two seated
The Squad do work quick fast in a hurry
Me, Eric Serm, Funk Doctor Spot and Keith Murray
Cause if the shit gets thick, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if you actin all that, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if we lose our jobs, (we stick a motherfucker)
Yo yo yo, yo, yo yo yo, yo (we stick a motherfucker)

I know you niggas checkin us out, ha ha
I know you niggas checkin me out, yo yo yo

          
Now if your bitch is paging me you best check your bitch
And if your bitch is in my whip you best check your bitch
And if your bitch is on my dick, nigga check your bitch
And if my clique fucks your bitch, nigga check your bitch
Ay yo, I'm sly as a fox, smooth as Hennessy over the rocks
Knock you out your boots, Lodge you out your socks
I see you checkin me out, you felt it
When I stepped in rockin gators and  electric blue velvet
I see you checkin me out through the corner of your eye
You deny, but yo, you ain't got to lie!
You check me out till your eyes get sore
But that's alright playboy, cause that's what I'm here for
Check how I get biz
Me and the microphone is like the Junkyard dog in the somethin somethin
Violated, reinstated, genuinely illated
You're belated, you'll be checkin me out till the day I'm creamated
I keep you heavily sedated
Illified, illustrated
The original juice, not from concentrated
From up north to midwest to west coast to down south
No doubt, keep checkin us out
Cause if the shit gets thick, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if you actin all that, (we stick a motherfucker)
And if we lose our jobs, (we stick a motherfucker)

Now first but not least you will respect Keith, lay a nigga down
Like a doo-rag in some grease, you must be crazy tryin to play me

Lyrical chemist rhyme minister, diminished you for the benefit
Then continue to kill shit for the fuck of it, I see y'all been writin
Still bitin, still lookin lame, half y'all niggaz still soundin the same
I'm excitin when live on stage, when receiting in lighting, frightening
lightning
Throwin thunder in chain, when i first came, I gave birth to a million MC's
In the game, who should all carry my last name
And I'm Gonna Get You Sucka like Damon Wayans, and fame like Jermaine
Bring pain and novacaine, okay y'all lil monkeys want to play?

I need your full cooperation and total attention
There's a few things I'd like to mention, these rappers out here swear they're
So appealing I, step to your business and hurt your feelings

Okay, well thinkin it's okay to rhyme that way, you'll be P.O.W., M.I.A.
And I'm seven steps ahead of you, five from eternity
An all that shit you kick just don't concern me, I separate the dead from 
The chump, ask a nigga blunt, ""Yo, how many lumps you want?""
So flavorous you could taste it, so hardcore I wrote this layin on the floor
In the basement, my style ain't no walk in the park, got mainstream MC's
Scared to rhyme after dark, an there Ain't No Half-Steppin
I'm reppin like a nuclear weapon, manifestin the Immaculate Conception
Lyrically I rape an MC like sodomy, add tragedy, to your odessy
For battle reservations call 1-900-SQUAD, frontin on us
Is like frontin on God

[Redman]

Now when we take it there, these three niggas in the square
My squad hangs out like fourhundred pounds in braziers
My deathrow allines, bein signed then aligned to electric
So it clear like a chair in Texas, HOT, approach wit extreme caution
No horsin around when my squad abortion a sound
Our crew's like Smokey off sokey, even Little Bo Peep, your style is weak
Guard your Rollie, wit all the ice in it, I snatch the ice out and put a price
out
Cop a Benz, put my mom in it, as long as I'm alive I'mma keep the vibe

Props grow like crops
Desert boot Clarks wit no socks
Parking space killer stay out my lot
You hear my voice, you see my face, you know my name
I take it out your ass and charge it to the game
I battle with words, go to war with ideas
You defeat me never in a million years

Is that you either get killed, wound, or captured
They shoot you up so bad til the end you fought
But then you got caught up in my final thought

[Verse] Redman

I was chillin' up, ??? Dog Deluxe
Rockin', diamond and G with the rooftop cut
I'ma grown man, don't got no time for games 'n stuff
I got balls that'll beat ya ollets 21 rough
Look at my face, Doc's the name, don't forget it
I makes ya make ya scream: ""BOW!""
Like my name's Willie, I get sick with it
Re-dig with it, I had a nine inch slug up
Before yo' stink bitch bit it, I betta clippin' crap
That ya'll cats is black, a prays if the eight jacks
So send neck through facts, reservoir (---) go ball when I was four
Explore whores, when rock came to the door
You never seen before, life to your hood
My steady shows leave niggaz faxs like Rosewood
When I drop the filth weather, bigga built
Our dog fucked the shit outta bitch, of Tiger Mill

[Chorus]

You drinkin', I'm drinkin'
You smokin', I'm smokin'
You freakin', I'm freakin'
You fuckin', we fuckin'
You fucked up, we fucked up
We make it, we take it
You hate me, I hate you
You talk shit, I talk shit

[Verse] Erick Sermon

In a flash I be the E, cat 'n mouse and cash
Not many ballin' niggaz out there, can touch my style!
Or touch the S-class, the 5-00 sittin' on parrellies, chrome
The big 2-0, catch the pitcher, my whole rap steez is deep
For all ya fake dues, I'm the only show that peeps
Last week I was uptown, playin' the streets
 ????????1-5-fifth and get...BUDDAH
That's when I do, when I roll dolo, I call her bitch
There was a time if I ain't doin' that, I ain't doin' shit
I might go to the studio and make a hit
I call my baby's moms, an hear her talk shit
I scoop, I ain't get my kids, niggaz please
We hit Toys 'are Rus and then Micky D's
And go to a movie, the end (of) the day, and talk to 'em
And take 'em back around away, and that's REAL!

[Chorus]

Well it's the sly Gemini, me and potatoe cuttin' drops
Have the guy, wellknown but still just gettin' by
And I verify mathematics don't lie nigga
Put in some work, and get a piece of the pie
It be the niggaz that don't immediate pertain to the situation
That be tryin' to come up off the chips, and niggaz makin'
And always worried if I'ma diss you, you insecure bitch
To the government, stay out my shit!
Niggaz was glad when I came with the keys to the chains
To the cellblock to the stage, now it's time to rock
I return like I never left, D-E-F, got the whole world gaspin' for breath

On the micaphone its the eve of destruction
As the world goes around like Passion
You get flattened in an orderly fashion
You was warned like a coming attraction
I got playa hated, felt liberated
Put him on the burner cause the nigga violated
We scamper like guard dogs through the fog
If you feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog
The sergeant general get busy chief
The fastest way to spell rhyme relief is Keith

My tactics make evil D say come on kick it
A black five wit rims, what you can spot me in
Wanna die I snatch you like Doc Kevokian
So turn the beat up

First of all, MC's be on my balls, straight up
Pubic hairs and everything, lick the whole plate up
Bay Area, roll up your Las Vegas
To all MC's, I love it that you hate us
Drop skills that might send wind chill factors
Back through Patterson, J.C
And Hacken-sack
Step uncorrect and get blackened
The assassin, find da MC's by the jazz men
I don't tote guns I tote funds
While you still puzzled how my antidote runs
Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit it
Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it (Get on down)
You remind me of school on a Sunday
No class, beatin all King's down
Doin over seventy, in a Hyundai, blast
Give em a good reason to open Alcatraz
Back, nobody got the Red shook
Been a weirdo ever since the doctor said PUSH
Def Squad skills make it hard to overlook me
That's why the hardcore promoters still book me
You shook G, word up, hah hah

Smoke indoneez I'm milky like Magnese
Oh-seven-one-oh-three, rest them car thieves
Guzzlin quart for sports of all sorts
Nonchalant spark buddah on the front porch
At courts, F-U-N-K-D-O-C
S-P-O-T, feel the Solo type remedy
Then freeze.... (Get on down) hah, ha-hah
Where was I? Oh yes
Sippin on Cristal with fingers up your bitch dress
Don't play close cause jealousy make folks act loc
Another nigga smoked from impression
Second guessin my verbal weapon, you're lettin
Spit, sixteen bits, come equipped
And I still walk around with the hooked up
Motorola flip on my hip, fuck the government
Drop shit, it's a microscopic topic
How I stay mo' bent than McDonald arches
And uptown got the la-la spots
And bad ass hoes with 54-11 Reeboks
But still, I walk around with the grill
Cause niggas be blinded by this hip-hop shit for real
I ain't havin that, I'm clappin shit
Fuck this rappin shit, I cause accidents

And let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet takin a shit
My style is all that, and a big bag of chips wit the dip
Fuck all that sensuous shit

And leave your click holier than the Ten Commandments

Can't wait to face ya, mutilate ya

Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body
Secret society, trying to keep they eye on me

Make my moves strategically, the G.O.D.

I use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real
Yeah you motherfucking right kid you know the deal

You get back slapped so hard make ya nose bleed
Some, kids feeling guilty bout the,
But you first baby girl so just face it (alright)
But anyway, back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing (kid)
Everything is real not just a song that we sing (word up, it's real)
From my life to the paper (what), very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E (shine baby, just shine)
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D
I shot ya fagot ass

Now who the fuck you think you talking to, I pay dues I spray crews
Look I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like he's bad news
Running this racket, from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
I'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch ass niggas know we stronger
Than these weaklings, seeking, for respect that ain't there
Knuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulance, this man's wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razor, which I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spatter, at any ad out, that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Now that the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture (what the deal pop)
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Ceaser

Thug niggas give they minks to chinks
To' down we sip drinks rockin minks, 
Flashing rings and things (what the deal)
Fronting hardcore deep inside the Jeep, macking
Doing my thing fly nigga you a Scarface king

Fuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers
Flossing rocks like the size of Fort Knox

Niggas fight, glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MC's, that fuck with LL they gets bucked
That's real, what's up with that I Shot Ya deal?
Light shit, niggas slip now how the bullet feel?
New York appeal, in L.A. they gang bang
But if you touch a mic your motherfucking ass hang
That's facts, niggaz don't receive no type of slack

The meaning in the words
can make the world shine
Coming out of soul
it's holly divine
Intertwine thoughts with
emotion so hot
It stops opposition with
pants down caught
Hard as rock, be strong,
lift up your head, belong
To the society of life,
live up, live long
Do you belong, be free,
open your mind and see
There is more to life
than to just believe

Went from stackin ones to stackin them one-huns 

Scored runs 

The hotter the bat, the more fat 

It's Dilated, Ras, 'Fari, we bust back 

Like that, like that, like that, like that 

Like that y'all, like that, check it 



Yo this that where the big hits are guaranteed

Defari,"Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

In L.A

""But it's a Herut Likwit Crew Connection""

Don't regret it  you had your chance and couldn't set it 
You hear me rhyme and try to shine on my time  forget it 
Hear me on radio  live vocally do edits 
E Swift scratchin and threading  with supreme unleaded 
Only the best out the Likwit Crew out the west 
And we shine time after time writting lyri-gets 
On freshly buffed and waxed marble steps 
Defari got a stlye that's iller than Tourrettes 
Make you switch, make a bitch get undressed 
Make people in the club want to dance chest to chest 
Bruised falcon, strive for perfection like Malcolm 
Back the name wit potential, but now they know the outcome 
So now the ticket's weakened, I stay away from tricks 
Defari, Phil Da Agony, Xzibit, and Tha Liks 
""The world's"" ""But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection"" 

Yo, talk a big game, play a big game 
You know my motherfuckin name 
Phil Da Agony, it's all the same same 
Game tight, Crescent Heights, get the name right 
I do seven songs in the same night 
Work ethic, proper etiquette, the better shit 
I want my gold plaque for this shit 
Soon as the stores get it (you get it) 
Focused Daily, Likwit activity 
Phil Da Agony causing you total tragedy 

My chest is burning from the Hennesy rock 
Yo I live to see the enemy drop 
The safety night got Kennedy shot 
It's political, the way I smash down is pitiful 
Situation critical, barely breathin in a hospital 
Dead meat, we give it like professional athletes 
The elite wit a chick for everyday of the week 
I'm talking Monday through Sunday 
Models walkin up and down the runway 
I take a lethal role in the gunplay 
To finish wit flyin colors, Tha Alkaholik brothers 
Connected, respect it, ain't no choice but to love us 
It's not, east to west, I want the whole world behind me 
I got niggas in L.A. sayin ""Fuck Guiliani"" 

I'm hella-cocky on the mic, I fuck it up on jeep beats 
So while you rockin to this beat, the beat is rockin to me 
Foul-mouth CaTashTrophe, I knock heads since '93 
So when you come across my style, it's like you smacked into a tree 
I turn the heat up in this bitch, I make the women strip fast 
So no matter what you do you can't fuck wit Big Tash 
I came to kick your ass, quick fast, not to house you 
I want your homies saying ""Tash smacked the shit out you"" 
Smoke something, drink something, eat lyrics that twist 
This that shit that's on your baby momma's Christmas list 
So balls amount to this, no matter what y'all niggas name is 
You're not as famous, as the Likwit entertainers 

""The world's famous"" But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection
""The world's famous"" But it's a Herut-Likwit Crew Connection

It's the Likwit coalition, start the mission 
We gonna turn this into a tradition 
My b-boy stance is updated, I feel like we made it 
Even though we underrated 
Yo, it's to the Ro, act a fool over flow 
I got the uncanny ability to cold rock a show 
I got fired from my job 'cause I was late to my shift 
'Cause I was drinkin a fifth, wit John Jingle Heimer Smith 
And here's another caper from the lyric landscaper 
I write flows wit two by fo's wit sand paper 
Now what is a MC if he can't flow 
Up next is E-Swift and my name is J-Ro 

We don't give a fuck if you down wit such and such 
You can still get touched, by the Likwit bumrush 
Better train hard before you face me 
You better off fightin Royce Gracey 
To get me out that ass you gotta mace me 
I make MCs want to tap out, before I blow they back out 
Likwit niggas winnin every bout 
Rippin MCs like cheap jeans 
Fuck your DJ and your mainstream production team 
And if you sleepin on us, then sweet dreams 
'Cause when you ain't lookin we be bookin mad shows makin cream 
My profession is killin studio sessions wit no question (what's that)

A different caliber of mc
This track is filthy, word to o.j., you make me feel guilty
Of first degree soundbwoy murder
Unlike anything out of l.a. you ever heard of
Word up, you play with fire, you'll get burned up
Best believe that my shit sound the best, when it's turned up
Loud, mashin down the block suburban style
Eighteen speakers plus kit chromed out
Yo, you think that you fuckin pro?
On the low the other night i caught your wack-ass stage show
Oh.. boy, you're just a bore
But you tell everybody that you're like busta
And you got ""rhymes galore""
Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Got the nerve to call yourself an mc, man you be frontin
I don't apologize, oh yeah, and uh
Go back to school, learn some concepts and grammar
Of yourself, get a hold
Next time you on stage, use primatine for some breath control
(ha ha ha) but now don't let asthma be the excuse
You was definitely doper, when no one knew you
[chorus 2x: defari]
I'm on a killing spree, murder soundbwoy constantly
Constantly murder wack mc
I'm on a killing spree, skill level at maximum
Dem pussy-clat bwoy nah want to see me
[defari]
You was stone cold lyin by the full wack rhyme writin
If i had some gasoline i'd ignite it, with my lighter..
.. boom! you combust, cause you disgust me
Wacker than them flat-ass crackers on three's company
You walk around, mad cause no one's feelin you
Mad at me, cause all your peoples they know my lyrics too
They sing along cause my song bumps
On the mix tapes that you made, yet and still you try to playa hate
(what?) you're featherweight, weaker than a paper plate
Lyrically, when compared to me, i know your style is fake
Fraud, manufactures, cheaper than hyundai
Now you're hardcore you probably used to be a true nerd guy
Make up your mind guy, now you're the mr. get high guy
If you ever step to me you'll think french because you're fuckin fried
In the mix of my verbal assault fightin sticks
You shouldn't gamble cause round for round you can't handle this
[chorus]
[defari]
Cat was out of pocket, got socked in his jaw
Fell to the floor, that's all she wrote
But i wrote rhymes, that burn every time
On mad mix shows i got wreck off the mind
But what's in a rhyme, if it don't sound tight?
You ask me if a lot of rappers are wack man you damn right
Who's to say these brothers from l.a.
Will take charge like debarge and shine, in a special way?
I say okay, let's get paid
Let's put this money on putnam and sip bombays with dis lemonade
Use, gatorade to refuel
Electrolytes after i ignite this mic too
Yo what's my name? defari herut
By the way since you been askin all these questions
Who the hell are you?
I seen your kind before, no lie
A devil spy, disguised as an ambassador
You can't fool the divine sun rule
Word to blue magic - step right up - and see the likwit crew
Hurry hurry, get your tickets, stand in line
After the show it's at the towers on sunset and vine
Me and my niggaz at the bar sippin henny
Got your bitch open all night, as if her name was denny's
[chorus] - 2x",Killin' Spree,1999
Defari,"Ayyo I think it's time I let 'em know how I gets down
(What's that?) How we do what we do
From where we from... (what why'all do?)

[Verse 1]
I hit the freeway on a Friday, the highway
Feelin' real good like when the Lakers traded Vlade
Could that be Sade' in the next lane?
I see her through my windowpane, I wonder if she knows that cat Dwayne
Johnson, nah probably not
I'm headed up Fairfax North to Riq's spot
I, flex the quest for barbecues brews and fifths (what?)
Trees lift niggaz while other niggaz talk shit
It's time to mount up, tonight another show
Gotta let the whole world know how it go strictly professionals
We're never amateur, pure like lightning
Whether on stage, or holdin' the page writin'
or freestylin', on radio frequencies
Los Ange-les, city of scanda-lies, cash and ?

Ayyo I'm nice with the ball like Paul Pierce
Them brothers, that play for the wood, they somethin fierce
Ahh, to each his own so I choose to maintain
Ready to rock, blow the spot, make it boil like crockpots
I, shot lyrics from a mini-mac cordless
Broads hear the name, see the frame, and they adore this
Hundred and ninety, nigga known to get lively
Plus put in work ""Between the Sheets"" like Ron Isley
At the bar, Herut the Cognac star
Ice Courvoisier, brothers crowd around like seminars
I'm smooth and ready like Telly Savales
Likwit Crew, nuff respect to why'all niggaz, we swiggy ballers

[Chorus]

[Verse 3}
I want to fly the world, like ?
flies, to Is-rael, and like Ishmael Valdez
I pitch heat, lyrically
Over rugged beats under the ground, from the mainstream
See where I dwells, it's all about skills
This MC walk the walk when he talk, plus get on the wheels
And freak new release with 1200 Technics
Every week, got a hall of fame game, like Dominique
Wilkins, yo Evidence we sound killin'
Many rippertons word to etchin lab on my building
Yo X, yo spouse a raw deal nigga
Barbershop flex, time to collect figures
Yo (Likwit Crew) me and you
we like the treble and bass, straight cousins, here to shake the state
Almighty ?, whom of Allah blesses me upon
We straight keep keep keep it on

Over 6 million tracks with 10 million topics 

I'm fiber optic crystal clear with my projection 

Wack MCs get cloths lined when they walk across my intersection 

They need protection 

Some guidance some right direction 

A job center with with an application for a new profession 

Never settle for nothing' less 

I blaze contests 

And set shops for pay days 

In strange ways life twists and turn 

Word to Gangstarr in this business skrilla Hard To Earn

Defari,"Now this is a story in fundamentals
Pure fundamental principles
And all my ????? know what I'm talkin about, knowmsayin?
But yo, it happened like this all the time at the past, no doubt about that
A 1969 vintage bottle of red wine in my hand
Who is that by the checkstand?
With the tall brown tan I call a caramel
The closer I get, the distinctive scent of Chanel
Yo, she was fine, but this happens all the time
L.A.'s notorious for havin top notch dimes
But this one here was a stallion
She looked half sister to me but said she was Italian
Via Puerto Rico
She said that she didn't know pops and that moms lived on Pico
And Fairfax, word to Mix-A-Lot, she had backs
Open off Defari the moment she heard the Goldy Mack
Her name was Cecilia
You know I had to ask her about that wedding ring on her finger
She said that she was separated
That's all I needed to hear cause for a moment there I hesitated
I hooked it up for that night a little later
Flex ???? put my groceries in the refrigerator
Turned on my TV to channel 2
_60 Minutes_ was on, you know the CBS news
Popped a brew, sat down for a minute
Caught this story 'bout this mafia boss known for killin kids
And gettin his, known for smugglin guns
The next thing they show was wedding pictures of his only son
Spit out my brew cause guess who I see?
Right on the TV it's that broad I met at checkstand 3
She's pagin me, let me think quick
Let 10 minutes fly by, called her back and fronted like I'm sick
She leaves messages I never return
I'm not one for the trick bag, too smart to get burned
So anyway, I sees her the other day
She says, ""I know I lied but I'm feelin like Marvin Gaye
I need some 'sexual healing', I'm really hot""
She grabbed my dick, I pressed my luck, fucked, then I shook the spot
Aiyo, the moral of the story is this:
What was I supposed to do, the bitch grabbed my dick

You doubtin' this so I connect wit Mr. Alchemist 
The Soul Assassin straight blastin'  bringin' heat 
You marvel at my connects wonderin' why you can't compete 
You're not competitive  you're more like a sedative 
You put me to sleep wit each line  are you the bedtime kid? 
Yet in still  I remain crisp like newly printed bills 
And watch for those money-hungry Anita Hill's 
Lyrics are effortless, no matter how stormy the weather gets 
Those who know me like Kobe say ""he's proliferate"" 
The gifted kid, focused like triangular pushups 
Why you claim to be hard when you a buttercup? 
I fuck shit up, stutter step wit action packed mag 
Don't pull no crap just hit the track like a fullback

This track hits like Sonny Liston for the Alchemist 
Will someone give me an award, illest vocalist 
I'll come wack when LL loses the hat 
Better yet, catch me wit Feds when Jordan grows dreds 
I own scissors for clones, kill mics and mega-phones

I throw bucks under Daly like Chuck

[Defari] 
I got the funky feel like be	 Real 
I put ""all in your head up"" [B Real] wit the pure raw skill 
Franklins are my favorite bills 
No hands  my favorite type of windmills 
Only now and then do I drink champagne 
Like I said in Big Up I strictly fucks wit Covasea 
You glamorous rappers are too sweet 
Wit your rececycled beats and your styles that put me to sleep 
I'd rather listen to some Brant Green 
Authentic, not like you, got real meaning 
I'm like the low-ridas, I like the oldies 
You know songs, like Agony and Ecstacy by Smokey 
You's a phony, I heard your single 
Corny, like a thirty-second jingle 
Here comes the master of paragraphs on phonographs 
Every letter, etched and sketched like an ancient tag 
You know my heiroglyph, I got a higher gift 
You's a passenger tryin but never be a pilot 

[Chorus] 2x 
""Aiyyo enough's enough"" [Fat Joe] 
Word up, I don't front 
I just keep it on the rise, and give you what you want 

[Defari] 
(What you need) 
Here, don't fear peep this 
Step inside my mentals, bare witness to a lyricist 
Skilled technician, rhythmous technique 
Advanced speak, I put mics in condition 
The streets always like hard beats 
That shit that make you move your neck when you're in car seats 
My star fleet, Likwit family 
You Sorry, like that game from Milton-Bradley 
Bound by honor, rollin mad bags of skama 
I've never been the one for the Jerry Springer drama 
Not an actor, just the greastest multiple factor 
This rap game's like a computer, and I'm a hacker 
Linebacker, wit hits that hit like LT 
Watch the blitz, you'll get a Joe Theisman injury 
What's all the glitter gear, meanwhile I wear and tear 
For fanfare, while you rock eye liner and mascare 

Chorus 4x 

[Defari] 
(See what you need) 
When it comes to real lyrics I know you can't hang 
Word to Tash, I'm from Killa Cali where niggas gangbang 
Plus slang more than words, nouns and verbs 
But pure crystal lah, lah meazy herbs 
You couldn't enter the saloon where brothas despise bafoons 
You're funny-style, this ain't no cartoon 
This is Hard Earned dues, word to Guru and Premier 
I'm more than ten years deep, but now it's my year 
""Aiyyo enough's enough"" 
Aiyyo Herut's been long overdue 
But instead these labels and fans have been fuckin wit the likes of you 
Yo don't mistake them, I'm not no hater 
Just a truth-sayer, serve when Vega woofer shaker 
A plees blower, live show flower 
Wit lyrics that'll blaze a whole crowd like a flame thrower 

Chorus 4x 

""Aiyyo enough's enough"" 
Word up, I don't front 
I give you what you want, what you need 
(I give you want you want) 
(I don't front) (What you need) 
   
",Keep It on the Rise,1999
Defari,"A different caliber of MC
This track is filthy, word to o.j., you make me feel guilty
Of first degree sound boy murder
Unlike anything out of l.a. you ever heard of
Word up, you play with fire, you'll get burned up
Best believe that my shit sound the best, when it's turned up
Loud, mashing down the block suburban style
Eighteen speakers plus kit chromed out
Yo, you think that you fucking pro?
On the low the other night I caught your wack-ass stage show
Oh, boy, you're just a bore
But you tell everybody that you're like busta
And you got ""rhymes galore""
Ain't that something?
Got the nerve to call yourself an MC, man you be fronting
I don't apologize, oh yeah, and uh
Go back to school, learn some concepts and grammar
Of yourself, get a hold
Next time you on stage, use primatine for some breath control
(ha ha ha) but now don't let asthma be the excuse
You was definitely doper, when no one knew you

[Chorus: x2]
I'm on a killing spree, murder sound boy constantly
Constantly murder wack MC
I'm on a killing spree, skill level at maximum
Dem pussy-clat boy nah wanna see me

You was stone cold lying by the full wack rhyme writing
If I had some gasoline I'd ignite it, with my lighter,
Boom! you combust, cause you disgust me
Wacker than them flat-ass crackers on three's company
You walk around, mad cause no one's feeling you
Mad at me, cause all your peoples they know my lyrics too
They sing along cause my song bumps
On the mix tapes that you made, yet and still you try to player hate
(What?) you're featherweight, weaker than a paper plate
Lyrically, when compared to me, I know your style is fake
Fraud, manufactures, cheaper than Hyundai
Now you're hardcore you probably used to be a true nerd guy
Make up your mind guy, now you're the Mr. get high guy
If you ever step to me you'll think french because you're fucking fried
In the mix of my verbal assault fighting sticks
You shouldn't gamble cause round for round you can't handle this

[Chorus]

Cat was out of pocket, got socked in his jaw
Fell to the floor, that's all she wrote
But I wrote rhymes, that burn every time
On mad mix shows I got wreck off the mind
But what's in a rhyme, if it don't sound tight?
You ask me if a lot of rappers are wack man you damn right
Who's to say these brothers from l.a.
Will take charge like debarge and shine, in a special way?
I say okay, let's get paid
Let's put this money on Putnam and sip Bombays with dis lemonade
Use, Gatorade to refuel
Electrolytes after I ignite this mic too
Yo what's my name? defari herut
By the way since you been asking all these questions
Who the hell are you?
I seen your kind before, no lie
A devil spy, disguised as an ambassador
You can't fool the divine sun rule
Word to blue magic, step right up, and see the like with crew
Hurry hurry, get your tickets, stand in line
After the show it's at the towers on sunset and vine
Me and my niggas at the bar sipping henny
Got your bitch open all night, as if her name was denny's

Shake my hand then watch they man try to throw me

Get ripped up (tied up)

Cause without them, there'd be no us, that's real
There's something on my mind.. everyday, all the time
It's the legacy, why'know? generations, of black people
Now bust this...
Aiyyo i think about this government, three strikes capital punishment
Enslaved my peoples for four hun-d-red
Yeah, plus some
Often dream of goin' back in time and givin' slaves guns {*buk!*}
So they can watch the master run

Watch them devil try to get away then clap his back with the shotgun
I got one, let's cut his head off
Let's take it to Harriet Tubman, show her that we ready to set it off
She get Nat turner, Nat go get Sojourner
Sojourner send a messenger for Touissant l'overture
Through the underground railroad, we go
Through the dark to the edge of forest to meet with Denmark
Vessey, you know he got soldiers ready
Ready to kill like lions, in the Serengeti
So like a stampede we rush the plantation
Settin' fire to everything, burn them down like cremation
No hesitation, free up the black nation
Kill them devils take his ships and head back for the mainland

Every baby she'd have the master would take away
She never seen one long enough to give a name
Everytime the master would rape, Jamie'd feel ashamed
She was only fourteen
Violated, used and abused, far from a queen
I met Jamie in a dream
I gave her a brand new M-16 with two magazines
I told her next time he come around
Act like you want him, get him to lay down
Make sure that he take off his clothing
After that i want you to fill him up, full of bullet holes
Release the whole clip, set trip on that motherfucker
Tell him that's for disrespectin' you and your mother
Your grandmother, your great-grandmother
Your brother your father, in the land they call the mother
Next thing you do is round up all the rest
Stay together and shoot your way to freedom, god bless, aiyyo

and she kinda bad, threw him six and I was read'
(Whatchu want me to do?)  To get spic and span
Man I'm glad you came and got me from that old white man (good lookin)
He took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps
(bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt)
And I change colors when the sun hit me
Fix me up, now my owner want to slang me for 50?
Bling bling, now I belong to a Japanese
And they was quick to throw me in the magazines
I make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools trippin
(Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dippin?
(None) Afraid to get that ass caught slippin (why?)
For me it was an easy task
I kept an engine on my ass with heat under the dash
Fool (peep game) I was born to lowride on rimz and tirez, yeah

Danger danger, wild west ranger ranger
Rearrange 'a the mark ass stranger
Behold, the look on my face stone cold
With a rare cowboy style that never grow old

I'm the Golden State bear with a rough flare, plus debanare 
Time for me and mine, but for any kind I can't care
Stormy weather rain liquid 
Defari con Tony Toca, Tash, and Xzibit

Break necks bounce with it when I spit it
Knockin this jam is a form of calastenics
Let it knock when you mashin down the block
Rims spank with the car wash

Watch the bitches stop
An look, always stay five steps ahead
Hard at work, while you tricks lay in bed
Dead to the world but ?Hayru? he be the sun

Always burnin, 'Cause my job is never done
Run from one time I rather dump an AK
that's for all the black and brown that got carried away
To the morg, when I look in the mirror I see the Lord

Guns to the ammo, niggas think they Rambo

Try to reply, don't touch what you ain't gon' buy

Defari,"Yeah, this ain't no funny style rap (no way)
with the lights and neon
This that real shit with Mighty Mi, and my nigga Mr. Eon
And they came all the way to L.A. for this one
Eastern Conference All-Stars boy
Yeah, ha-ha, so check it out

I cherish good word in the scripture
Just like the frozen moments in every picture
No less than a hundred percent, that's what I give-ta
And on any quest to be the best in my center
Scarin' a regime that lasted for many years
Wash 'em down like Crown and beers, cheers
Here's a toast to a new west coast brigadere
They hate from a distance but then smile when they near
Really in fear I want to make this landmark with my trademark
Beam my shinin' light on all those who stay dark
In the mind, searchin', seekin' you'll find
what's been right, in front of your face all the time
For example; I grew up in a city of scandal
I knew that nothin was iller than the drum and piano
The commando, bada la sio de la Los Angel
With Xzibit I told you that my business I gotta handle
So I gamble, I rap for my mighty old camel
With a touch of eloquence like a mahogany panel
Wood grain, every line I feed the brain food
Pick or choose the degree'll abuse, while the noose'll loose

[Chorus x2]
So when you look into my eyes, you won't see no funny guy
Just a serious side, that can't no money buy
When you look into my eyes and you see my physi-cal
You'll see maximum dedication to the men-tal

So when you look into my eyes, you won't see minimal
Some brothers is righteous, some criminal, what is it now?
Do we all stand up the same?
Do we all fare equal in this life of game?
I don't think so, the color of the skin makes one unequal
And what is now was once then, divided people
No justice, when a cop prejudges
How many cops dump Glocks when a man just budges?
The budgets, are bigger with devils than in the ghettos
Senior citizens blowin' their checks at the Meadows
On the three horse, a pint of Jack
Skip a three-course meal, and wash away the pain he feel
Imagine going to war for a country, and when ya get back
you can't work (what?) for none of they companies
They try to chump me, loan sharks are feedin' me money
I'm so hungry, the American Dream, it ain't that lovely

Defari,"I thank, so if I don't your considered slippin
Then I gots to get you even if we ain't trippin
Fuck that nigga who ain't Wadda try to certify
Got love for Chico anybody else we do not vibe
I think niggas try to flip the old school shit too much
I think I put there like Mcnabb with a nice touch
I think emcees with no flavor should stop rappin
I think some sampling is cool if fools ain't yappin
Man that's it about it, I don't wanna hear shit about it
Plus I think when this shit drops niggas gon' get about it
Hip Hop is too crowded
And I'm on in the tip of the stage slappin hands in the front row tight
Hittin blunt rolled tight, y'all swing 'em left to right
If ya feelin it
Don't even talk about this verse, just say I'm killin it
Whatchou think about that? It's just a thought, thought
I think flava to this whole shit is what we brought

See I've been thinkin all these bitch niggas need to quit it
And quick to speak on it niggas ain't never get it
Rhyme reported Chico the Chipper put it in order
What the fuck they run? Nuttin but they bath water
Last quarter, less than ten ticks
Standin at the line can't you feel this shit and bricks
Brickin like a busta
Cus you sour like lemon custard, don't trust ya
Nigga shoulda been rushed off the stage
Feelin nutty then bust a gauge
Cut like spades, blowin back out like hand grenades
Ya patna's over there bleeding
Now you in church, four days later obituary reading
Test me, lets see am I hard like I claim to be
Stomach scarred from the gang activity
Just a memory he did and I won't get caught
Let it be known fuck em that's my thought

The average man fragile, handle with care
On the contraire me, I'm a golden state bear
Dump a flare in the air
Two shot from the glocks
Style I got, karate chop through a concrete block
Chop the tree in the amount for the blunt
Doja, what niggas smoke out of where I come from
Hit hard blinds eye blitz, you Bret Favre
RIP Derrick Thomas promised to work hard
And hold it down like a big hog
Cool cats run with big dogs
Blacks fall victims to the White man's laws
Ain't nuttin new under the sun
But you never heard Defari's version of how the West was won
Two smoking mikes instead of guns
My tongue way a ton
They all want advice, you I got some
So many rap critics think they can spit it
Don't touch a mic if you ain't tight and that's on Likwit

I feel great hookin up the ill state in killa Cali
I'm about to make these muthafuckas feel a valley
Parallel Kurupt and Defari live
Without a deal, you should see the type of car I drive
With mista Chico the Chipper and Juice on the Glove beat
See this where the hip hoppers and the thugs meat
For you to drop a dope 16 joints
I'd have to lower my IQ a whole 15 points
I'm a Prozac gangsta, I sold crack thanks ta
My niggas I'm able to control whack prankstas
Exquisite, I freestyle I love it and I live it
Ask my niggas Tash and J-Ro, can I Xzibit?
I almost died on the bumpy plane ride
So now Cali Chronic well it got my brains fried
And if you muthafuckas want beef, well let my crew know

Pull out the blunt nigga I'll wreck your shit
I'm out that window with my 44, another fucking hit
Don't know who to trust with my shit
I'm in this click, you in my hood you better know who you fucking with
Who you stepping with, Skandalous fucking dangerous
Bitches brains I bust, feel the lust in God we trust
Nigga I'm at your door, don't pray to God cause you done lost your grace
Been in this game for too long you bout to lose your face
I got the mind of a psycho ass ??
As I take another hit on this shit nigga you dead
Never ask forgiveness told the Lord to give me grace
You talked some shit front your boys and as result you lost your face
Blood all over the place I'm counting the fucking bodies dropping
I know my destiny cause I can hear the devil knocking
I done sent body and soul to my eternal flames you best believe
I numb them bodies and play my fucking game
I sold my soul at an early age
And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage
My eyes in a daze
Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming
Is juices running when ya done in
Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid
But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they
Dead
Crack scarfs for my fucking glory
Talking shit up in my territory
Another day another world's sad story

Verse 2 (Steph)

Smoking blunt, smoke a nigga selling dope on the block
Pop pop goes the glock I bring more nightmare than Hitchcock
Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard
Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol
Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags
Tagging toes, nigga drive slow
Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese
Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues
Freeze your whole coalition
Strapped with ammunition
Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads
This figure from head to toe
Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door
But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales
Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail
Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale
Lyrical laggers, wanna be chrome packers
Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac
My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat
You hoes ain't fucking with that
Or this, cause I piss on competition
And have all you hoes in submission
Trying to recondition your stilo
Lyrical nino
I sling rhymes like kilos
>From here to Puerto Rico
One other sequel from the infamous unseen
Scheming for the green smoking bitches and niggas like nicotine

Verse 3 (Mia X)

Cause she up to schemes
Tired of chasing apple pie dreams
Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know
50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers
Followe by your second line of flowers
I devour competition, causing complete submissions
Cooks more dope in my kitchen
Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls
Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed
Boss chick you don't want to see her
Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters
Mia's right and left well known with the clout
To wire your mouth, knock your grill out
That's what this here be bout
So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip
Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit
Too much to deal with
I'm still a bitch that' be's designer down stay scheming on the man
And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands
My flow so grand it make the beats say damn
Shit jumps back makes you wanna holler
But I sees nothing but dollars
Feminist power
My lyrics knocking like a KL beat
It be that she-devil that below sea level bitch you can't see her
Niggas and broads be trying to figure at 5'4
How they still need a ladder to face this hoe

By the time the shit drop, I done already been there

Hard to tell the difference like they fake Louis bags

I don't fuck with that industry flow
What I do fuck with is that industry dough

A side deal with who? Why not, where I sign at?

I used to do unto others, this the difference
This year fuck with things in my best interest

No chance to think about coming back
Chain smoke 'em, turn they lungs black
See I was raised to love black, but sometimes
Black folks wanna sweat you harder than the one-time
Never participate in dumb, def and blind shit
Plus I got my little man, so daily I'm reminded
The ride only gets rougher (right)
But I'll be damned if me and my niggas suffer
Smuggle this motherucker with the raw shit, I'm blessed with
Lookin' at the world, burned for the young and the desperate
You showed heart, but got cardiac arrested
More than a nigga with an image and a press kit
The wreck hits, creates desert land, desolate
The whole intent to rock the shit, keep the herb lit

We blaze shows, never no Half Step

No false images, no bullshit semantics

Rainin' on they brains with lyrics, from the mountains
Don't contemplate what you can't even demostrate

Nigga who wanna hate but front like its all great
I gots no time for these emotional niggas, I gots to motivate

Never sloppily, picture someone stoppin' me
From gettin' mine, line after line
And you wonder why I call these fake niggas Miller
They think they genuine
I'm startin' to shine, imported Italian
With a custom made Herut charm as my medallion

Seem like, I recite the same prayer every night
Watch my folks, make sure my dogs stay tight
And fully prepared to gunfight in broad daylight
Till then, lick it to the chin, let it begin
We could break bread or break skin and watch me send it
Try not to break the law, sometimes I gotta bend it
And my directions, suggest for your own protection

Pull out the blunt nigga I'll wreck your shit
I'm out that window with my 44, another fucking hit
Don't know who to trust with my shit
I'm in this click, you in my hood you better know who you fucking with
Who you stepping with, Skandalous fucking dangerous
Bitches brains I bust, feel the lust in God we trust
Nigga I'm at your door, don't pray to God cause you done lost your grace
Been in this game for too long you bout to lose your face
I got the mind of a psycho ass ??
As I take another hit on this shit nigga you dead
Never ask forgiveness told the Lord to give me grace
You talked some shit front your boys and as result you lost your face
Blood all over the place I'm counting the fucking bodies dropping
I know my destiny cause I can hear the devil knocking
I done sent body and soul to my eternal flames you best believe
I numb them bodies and play my fucking game
I sold my soul at an early age
And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage
My eyes in a daze
Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming
Is juices running when ya done in
Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid
But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they
Dead
Crack scarfs for my fucking glory
Talking shit up in my territory
Another day another world's sad story

Verse 2 (Steph)

Smoking blunt, smoke a nigga selling dope on the block
Pop pop goes the glock I bring more nightmare than Hitchcock
Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard
Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol
Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags
Tagging toes, nigga drive slow
Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese
Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues
Freeze your whole coalition
Strapped with ammunition
Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads
This figure from head to toe
Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door
But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales
Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail
Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale
Lyrical laggers, wanna be chrome packers
Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac
My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat
You hoes ain't fucking with that
Or this, cause I piss on competition
And have all you hoes in submission
Trying to recondition your stilo
Lyrical nino
I sling rhymes like kilos
>From here to Puerto Rico
One other sequel from the infamous unseen
Scheming for the green smoking bitches and niggas like nicotine

Verse 3 (Mia X)

Cause she up to schemes
Tired of chasing apple pie dreams
Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know
50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers
Followe by your second line of flowers
I devour competition, causing complete submissions
Cooks more dope in my kitchen
Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls
Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed
Boss chick you don't want to see her
Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters
Mia's right and left well known with the clout
To wire your mouth, knock your grill out
That's what this here be bout
So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip
Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit
Too much to deal with
I'm still a bitch that' be's designer down stay scheming on the man
And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands
My flow so grand it make the beats say damn
Shit jumps back makes you wanna holler
But I sees nothing but dollars
Feminist power
My lyrics knocking like a KL beat
It be that she-devil that below sea level bitch you can't see her
Niggas and broads be trying to figure at 5'4
How they still need a ladder to face this hoe

So here's the return of the one on the mike

Hates an MC sounding like a compilation

I've gotta get paid 'cause I have my needs
What I really want does grow on trees
What I really have flows like a dream
Roll in the pub will create a breeze
Pulling out the stops, no need to tease
Your MC's come in their 2's and 3's
Try to dismiss, sucker MC please
You never come close to vibes like these
I got more styles across the frees
Taking my spot is a never could be

Shut the door after me please

Swim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle

To tear out from your eyes with a word to stiffen brooding lies

Deftones,"Floating on the water ever changing picture
Hours out from land
In tune with all our dreams

The ocean takes me in to watch you shake it
Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight we ride

Cruising through the city after hours
With me fusing all our powers
Here's to all our dreams
Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight we ride",Sextape,2010
Deftones,"You arrive
In my dream
Beside me every night,
You and me
We explode
Through the scene
We try to drain the night 
Empty

No one goes off in every way
Like you do

We got together
We weaved our web
Tangled in the waves
We spread the scene in red
We both erupt in colors
And carve out our names
You keep me aroused
I know you
Feel the same

You arrive
In my dream
Beside me every night,
Just you and me
We explode 
Through the scene
We try to drain the night
Empty

No one else has a hold over me
Like you do
You open up the covers, you lure me in
Tackle me anxious, back into bed
Well I hope to discover all of your ways
This place is death
I know you
Feel the same

You arrive in my dream
Beside me every night, just you and me

We try to drain the night in every way",This Place Is Death,2010
Deftones,"Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna take you home
And watch the world explode
From underneath your glow

I wanna watch the way 
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
'Cause you know my room
And then crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

I wanna watch you close
I need to see for sure
And then the tape is on
Who do you think we could show

I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
'Cause you know my room
And then crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

I've remained on your side
In chains, entombed.

I became your device
To lay and soothe.

But go ahead and take a side
But watch how you choose
Or be headed for a ride
'Cause I just don't know if I could

I can't stop what you began
I can't fight for what you began

You've opened the gates
Now face the other side
Just go on it's cool
Now head into the fire
I just don't know if I could

I can't stop what you began
I can't fight for what you began
I know what's inside
For you again

Switch on your game
Stop wasting all your time
'Cause surprise it's you
Who'll face what you decide
I think I'd have known about you

I can't stop what you began
I can't fight for what you began
I know what's inside
I know your fate
I know I can't stop what you began",Gauze,2012

Across your towns
When I’m set
Cut inside before
The trends begin
I spend my time perfecting

Waves of contrast
Cutting out all
The same shit I’ve outgrown
I’m bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease no sweat

I see the crowns
And I forget the couture
Two at a time
I watch the kingdoms fold

I’m breaking in with all my friends

Designed for you, designed by me

We must prepare the heart strings
To cut all the ties

Let me inside 
Guess I’m confused more or less 
She'd some light 
And tell me your secret 
How are you trained? 
I promise you I can keep it 
Go on explain

Tell me how you do it, now 
Your poison is glowing 
Against the night 
How can you lose

I’m aware of the demons 
That you’ve tucked away 
I like to watch you release them

Tell me how you do it 
Every time it takes my knees out 
Still every time you do it 
I’m surprised 

Show your strings, your wires 
Check the lights 
Provide me clues just go ahead 
And break your silence 

And tell me your secret 
Can I watch you train?

Your chance revolt, resist!
Open your chest, look down, reach in.

Shedding your skin,
Showing your texture.
Time to let everything inside show.
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever, time to let
Everything outside you

This is
Your test come forth, confess!
Extend your tongue, speak out, go on

Shedding your skin,
Showing your texture.
Time to let everything inside show.
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever, time to let
Everything outside you
Shed your casing, show your lines
And shapes

Wear your insides, on the outside,
Show your enemy, what you look like
What you look like
What you look like
From the inside

I think you keep playing to play
Knowing that I feel sick

Just to drive me wild
I let you pretend
But you know
Truth is that
I love you to death

And watch you play dumb I’d like to see
You play with the odds
On your plate instead

You’re constant changing phases
I watch them
Releasing right on cue
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

So why wait to discover your dreams?
Now here’s your chance
I promise
To watch and raise your babies
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

I’m hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end

So why wait for the colors to bleed?
What do you expect?
So heartless we march into the fumes
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

I’m hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end
I wish this night

I’m hypnotized by your name
I wish this night never end

I wish this night wouldn't end

But the engine’s drone
Our minds set free
To roam

Time (shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
Our minds bend
And our fingers fold
Entwined we dream of unknown

Time (shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes

Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me

We slow down
As the engines stall
Our eyes catch sync
We explode

Time (shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes

Time (shift)
As we collide
With the energy
In other ways

Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me
We play in dreams
As we cross through
Space and time
Just stay with me",Rosemary,2012
