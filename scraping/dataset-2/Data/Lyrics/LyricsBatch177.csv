Drew's Famous,"Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by m'self
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock and roll

Don't try to take me to a Disco
You'll never even get me out on the floor
In 10 minutes I'll be late for the door
I like that old time rock and roll

Still like that old time rock and roll
The kinda music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock and roll

Won't go to hear 'em play a Tango
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
There's only one sure way to get me to go
Start playin' old time rock and roll

Call me a relic call me what'cha will
Say I'm old fashioned say I'm over the hill
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock and roll

I had my hair piled high and my baby just looked so right
Well, pick you up at ten, gotta have you home at two
Mama don't know what I catched off of you
But that's all right cause we're looking as cool as can be

Well, we found a little place that really didn't lood half bad
I had a whisky on the rocks
And change of a dollar for the jukebox
Well, I put the cold rock into that can
But all they played was disco, man
Come on, baby, baby, let's get out of here right away

Well, there's a real square cat, he looks a 1974
Well, he looked at me once, he looked at me twice
Look at me again and there's gonna be fight

Drew's Famous,"In a church, by the face
He talks about the people going under

Only child know

A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep
And through a fractal on a breaking wall
I see you my friend, and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip

But we're never gonna survive, unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive, unless
We are a little crazy

Crazy yellow people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun, to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
Ohh, get it, get it, get it, get it no no

If all were there when we first took the pill
Then maybe, then maybe, then maybe, then maybe
Miracles will happen as we speak

But we're never gonna survive unless
We get a little crazy
No we're never gonna survive unless
We are a little crazy
No no, never survive, unless we get a little bit

Oh, a little bit
Oh, a little bit

Oh

Amanda decides to go along after seventeen years

Oh darlin'
In a sky full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy
In a world full of people, only some want to fly
Isn't that crazy, crazy
In a heaven of people there's only some want to fly
Ain't that crazy

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise

Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies

He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go

I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes

To a family

About all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad

We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise

He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash

It was a graveyard smash

The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five""

They played the mash
They played the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They played the mash
It caught on in a flash
They played the mash
They played the monster mash

Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?""

It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
The monster mash
And it's a graveyard smash
It's now the mash
It's caught on in a flash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash
The monster mash
And do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash
You'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash

To send their wanted son
Up to the White House, yes,

To voice their discontent
Unto the Pres-I-dent

What has swept this continent?
If tin whistles are made of tin,
What do they make fog horns out of?

On the half shell they're the heroes four.
In this day and age who could ask for more?
The crime wave is high with mugging mysterious.
All police and detectives are furious 
'cause they can't find the source of this lethally evil force.
This is serious so give me a quarter.
I was a witness. Get me a reporter.
Call April ONeil in on this case eh.
You better hurry up.  There's no time to waste.
We need help like quick, on the double.
Have pity on the city man it's in trouble.
We need heroes like the Lone Ranger when

determined to put these crooks in jail.
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened but before she knew it,
she fell in the trap and got caught.
Yeah, she was all alone, with no friends and no phone.
Now this was beyond her worst dreams 
'cause she was cornered by some wayward teens.
Headed by Shredder, they were anything but good.
Misguided, unloved, they called 'em ""the foot.""
They could terrorize and be angry youth 
and they'd mug the people who needed proof.
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound.
Shouting ""Cow-a-bun-ga"" as they hit the ground.

When there's a battle got the enemy wishing that they stayed at home instead of 
fightin' these Ninja Masters with moves like lightnin'.
They were once normal but now they're mutants.
Splinter's the teacher so they are the students.
Leonardo,Michelangelo and Donatello make up the team 
with one other fellow, Raphael.
He's the leader of the group, transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop.
Pizza's the food that's sure to please.
These Ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese.
Back to the story, it's not hard to find.
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind.
Those were the words that the Master instructed 
but a letter from Shredder has Splinter abducted.
 
That was the last straw. Spring into action.
Step on ""the foot"" now they're gonna lose traction.
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice.
Your shell is hard so you shout, 
""They can't dust us off like some old coffee table.""
Since you been born you been willin' and able to defeat the sneak, 
protect the walk, fight for rights and your freedom to speak.
Now the villian is chillin' so you make a a stand.
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand.
Remember the words of your teacher, your master;
""Evil moves fast but good moves faster 
than light shining for your illumination.""
Good versus evil equals confrontation.
So when you're in trouble don't give in and turn sour. 
Try to rely on your Turtle Power.

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

I execute it with the proper etiquette

And we're gonna be a ball 
Just like we always do. 
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby i
n the last row in the balcony?
 
There's Technicolor and Cinemascope, 
A cast out a Holly wood, 
And the popcorn from the candy store, 
Makes it all seem twice as good. 
There's alway lots of pretty girls 
With figures they don't try to hide,
But they never can compare  
To the girl sittin' by my side.
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby 
in the last row in the balcony?
 
Movies are better than ever, 
And just as dark as before, 
And Saturday night when you're with your baby,
Who could ask for anything more?
 
A' Saturday night at the movies, 
Who cares what picture you see 
when you're huggin' with your baby 
in the last row in the balcony?

Drifting Cowboys,"Took my fam'ly away from my Carolina home 
Had dreams about the West and started to roam 
Six long months on a dust covered trail 
They say heaven's at the end but so far it's been hell 
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air 
Gold in them hills and it's waitin' for me there 

We were diggin' and siftin' from five to five
Sellin' everything we found just to stay alive
Gold flowed free like the whiskey in the bars
Sinnin' was the big thing, lord and Satan was his star 
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air 
Gold in them hills and it's waitin' for me there 

Dance hall girls were the evenin' treat
Empty cartridges and blood lined the gutters of the street
Men were shot down for the sake of fun
Or just to hear the noise of their forty-four guns
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waitin' for me there

Now my widow she weeps by my grave
Tears flow free for her man she couldn't save
Shot down in cold blood by a gun that carried fame
All for a useless and no good worthless claim

And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waitin' for me there
Fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waitin' for me there

Thinking twice, could you maybe think again

When dinosaurs still roamed the earth Speaking
Of course of the Three Great Alabama Icons
George Wallace, Bear Bryant and Ronnie Van Zant
Now Ronnie Van Zant wasn't from Alabama, he was
From Florida He was a huge Neil Young fan
But in the tradition of Merle Haggard writin'
Okie from Muskogee to tell his dad's point of
View about the hippies 'n Vietnam, Ronnie felt
That the other side of the story should be told.
And Neil Young always claimed that Sweet Home
Alabama was one of his favorite songs. And legend
Has it that he was an honorary pall bearer at
Ronnie's funeral such is the Duality of the
Southern Thing And Bear Bryant wore a cool
Lookin' red checkered hat and won football
Games and there's few things more loved in
Alabama than football and the men who know how to
Win at it So when the Bear would come to town,
There'd be a parade. And me, I was one a' them
Pussy boys cause I hated football, so I got a
Guitar but a guitar was a poor substitute for a
Football with the girls in my high school So my
Band hit the road and we didn't play no
Skynyrd either I came of age rebellin'
Against the music in my high school parkin'
Lot It wasn't till years later after
Leavin' the South for a while that I came to
Appreciate and understand the whole Skynyrd thing
And its misunderstood glory I left the South
And learned how different people's perceptions
Of the Southern Thing was from what I'd seen in
My life Which leads us to George Wallace Now
Wallace was for all practical purposes the
Governor of Alabama from 1962 until 1986 Once,
When a law prevented him from succeeding himself
He ran his wife Lerline in his place and she won
By a landslide He's most famous as the
Belligerent racist voice of the segregationist
[ Find more Lyrics on http://mp3lyrics.org/NEt ]
South Standing in the doorways of schools and
Waging a political war against a Federal
Government that he decried as hypocritical And
Wallace had started out as a lawyer and a judge
With a very progressive and humanitarian track
Record for a man of his time. But he lost his
First bid for governor in 1958 by hedging on the
Race issue, against a man who spoke out against
Integration Wallace ran again in '62 as a
Staunch segregationist and won big, and for the
Next decade spoke out loudly He accused Kennedy
And King of being communists. He was constantly on
National news, representing the ""good"" people
Of Alabama And you know race was only an issue
On TV in the house that I grew up in Wallace
Was viewed as a man from another time and place
And when I first ventured out of the South, I was
Shocked at how strongly Wallace was associated
With Alabama and its people Ya know racism is a
Worldwide problem and it's been since the
Beginning of recorded history and it ain't
Just white and black But thanks to George
Wallace, it's always a little more convenient to
Play it with a Southern accent. And bands like
Lynyrd Skynyrd attempted to show another side of
The South One that certainly exists, but few
Saw beyond the rebel flag And this applies not
Only to their critics and detractors, but also
From their fans and followers. So for a while,
When Neil Young would come to town, he'd get
Death-threats down in Alabama Ironically, in
1971, after a particularly racially charged
Campaign, Wallace began backpedaling, and he
Opened up Alabama politics to minorities at a rate
Faster than most Northern states or the Federal
Government. And Wallace spent the rest of his life
Trying to explain away his racist past, and in
1982 won his last term in office with over 90% of
The black vote Such is the Duality of the
Southern Thing And George Wallace died back in
'98 and he's in Hell now, not because he's a
Racist His track record as a judge and his
Late-life quest for redemption make a good
Argument for his being, at worst, no worse than
Most white men of his generation, North or
South But because of his blind ambition and his
Hunger for votes, he turned a blind eye to the
Suffering of Black America. And he became a pawn
In the fight against the Civil Rights cause 
Fortunately for him, the Devil is also a

So throw another log on the fire boys,
George Wallace is a coming?

Now, he said he was the best friend a black man from Alabama ever had,
And I have to admit, compared to Fob James, George Wallace don't seem that bad
And if it's true that he wasn't a racist and he just did all them things for the votes
I guess Hell's just the place for ""kiss ass politicians"" who pander to assholes.

So throw another log on the fire, boys, George Wallace is coming to stay

They announced it in the lobby what had just gone on
He drove up from Birmingham back to the family's farm
Thought he'd get him a deferment there's was much work to be done

In the South Pacific over half a world away

On the farm that he grew up on so I guess so did I

Every year in June George A. goes to a reunion
Of the men that he served with and their wives and kids and grand kids
My Great Uncle used to take me and I'd watch them recollect
about some things I couldn't comprehend

And I thought about that movie, asked if it was that way
He just shook his head and smiled at me in such a loving way
As he thought about some friends he will never see again
He said ""I never saw John Wayne on the sands of Iwo Jima""

Most of those men are gone now but he goes still every year
And George A's still doing fine, especially for his years
He's still living on that homestead in the house that he was born in
And I sure wish I could go see him today

He never drove a new car though he could easily afford it
He'd just buy one for the family and take whatever no one wanted

Through the shadows of the cage around the forty watt light

Tell me about the lows and the highs
Tell me how to tell the difference between what they tell me is the truth or a lie
Tell me why the ones who have so much make the ones who don't go mad

Said the Great John Ford to the young man rising
You got to frame it just right and have some luck of course

Tell them just enough to still leave them some mystery
A grasp of the ironic nature of history
A man turns his back on the comforts of home
The Monument Valley to ride off alone

And when the dust all settles and the story is told
History is made by the side of the road
By the men and women that can persevere
And rage through the storm, no matter how severe
And whether it's a horse or a car or a train
There's gonna be some fine times and there's gonna be some pain
In the end it's a silhouette framed by the sun
And just The Monument Valley when the evening comes

It's a strong wind blowing on the open range
It's gonna be beautiful and it's gonna be strange

When to print the legend and when to leave the facts in

Won by the softness of the sons of women’s hands

I'd rather not listen
I know what I'm missing
It's always too soon
It's always too soon to be cold for comfort
To belong to someone inside a locked room

But that always happens when nobody's looking (nobody's looking)

I really don't care what's inside you
I wont stand beside you or answer your calls

I don't want to fight now
I'm only here right now
This moment is all
This moment is all

Don't call me your baby
I'm nobody's baby
I won't let you cage me
Or lock me away

I'm not yours to keep
Don't want you to save me
You're just a vacation
A wonder way station
To keep me awake, until I'm ready to sleep
To keep me awake, until I'm ready to sleep

He asked her, if she weren’t too busy
Might come out for a ride

She’ll ride him until he’s dead or rises to the occasion

They landed with a mighty crash
Then got crushed by the falling star.

Somehow those bills would all get paid

Never forgot the things she said

She’ll ride him until he’s dead or rises to the occasion

She said I ain’t got the gumption to make it

He opens the door for her, there’s kindness in his smile
But she loathes the need in his eyes

She can’t stand to have him around

How attached she’s become
And if it were up to me, I’d prove her wrong, but it’s too bad

Blended whisky in his veins and murder in his heart

Like a house fire in the distance, like a car crash in slow mo

When it’s speeding down the runway and
The brake line’s cut in two

Drivin' n' Cryin',"I saw two people kissing on the street today
Holding hands and promising there be no end
I saw two people hugging on the street today
AS if there would not be no yesterday
And oh how they must think it is 
To be an adult just like a kid
Living off my black and white
And adding color to my life

I saw a man looking at a lot today
Thought how he could use it in so many ways
Like tearing up your parking lot to build a house
So you'll just have to park your Volvo somewhere else
And oh how they must think it is
To be an adult just like a kid
Tearing up a parking lot
To build a home, to build a house

Ain't it strange
Ain't it strange
Ain't it strange

I saw two people dancing in the constant rain
Getting soaked and doing all they really can
Getting soaked and pretending they're in Hollywood
Doing all they really can and all they could
But oh how they must think it's strange
Standing out in the pouring rain
Come in where its warm and dry
Come in where its warm and dry

I saw a man singing on the street today
Singing songs he wrote about the ways today
How people walking by think he has got some nerve
He's singing in the street and singing on a curve
But oh how they must think it is 
To be an adult just like a kid
And living off black and whites
And adding color to my life

And the southern wind
Blowin' down around this
Dying land

Nothing in the pocket
His hand to the sky
Nowhere else to go

Or believe it

And farther yet

To the parking lot

About what they might have heard
And runnin' down they shouted out
It seemed

Next door a girl she lives
About the same age as me
And asked me to come upstairs
For a see

Just then her mother burst in
Said, ""You're the son of that bitch in the wind
Get outta my house
Hit the road""
I kept fallin' like a Rolling Stones song
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my mama said
I'm going straight to hell

The stars came out
And warned me so
As I walked on down
The road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase
Steered me clear

She took my hand
As we walked into the sun
A new days promise had
Begun
We'll make it alone

And in the living room

From that funny little shop in Spain
Remember how we found it 
When we ducked in from that sudden summer rain
But I think I keep the silver tray

Cause it makes more sense being used
And girl what do you know?

Cause it makes more sense being used

she would answer everytime you called her on the phone,
And they could pass the present of the girls she thinks they want,
And with the face down that she's looking for
In a life she can't escape
And when the girl starts drinking
She won't stop shaking
And she'll do it again, do it again

And your searching for a message
In this mess that you've been making
But its safe to say,
You won't learn a thing from your mistakes,
You'll wind up on your knees,
Watch a week from now,
You'll end up going back for more

Dropkick Murphys,"Tim Finnegan lived in Wattling Street
A gentle Irishman mighty odd
He'd a beautiful brogue so rich and sweet
To rise in the world he carried a hod

See he'd sort of a tripling way
With love for a liquor poor Tim was born
To help him on with his work each day
He'd a drop of the Craythor every morn'

One morning Tim was rather full
His head felt heavy, which made him shake
Fell from the ladder and broke his skull
So they carried him home, his corpse to wake

Rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
And laided him upon the bed
A bottle of whiskey at his feet
And a gallon of porter at his head

And whack Fol-De-Dah now dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake

His friends assembled at his wake
And Missus Finnegan called for lunch
First they brought in tay and cake
Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch

Biddy O'Brien begged to cry
Such a nice clean corpse did you see
Aye, Tim me boy, oh why did you die?
Arrah shut your gob said Paddy MCGee

And whack Fol-De-Dah now dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you
Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake

Then Peggy O'Connor took up the job
Biddy says she you're wrong I'm sure
Biddy then gave her a belt on the gob
And left her sprawling on the floor

There the war did soon engage
Woman to woman and man to man
Shillelah-law was all the rage
An a row and a ruction soon began

Mickey Maloney raised his head
When a bottle Of whiskey flew at him
It missed him falling on the bed
The liquor scattered over Tim

Tim revives, see how he rises
Timothy rising from the bed
Whirl your whiskey around like blazes
Tonamondeal, do you think I'm dead

And whack Fol-De-Dah now dance to your partner
Welt the floor, your trotters shake
Wasn't it the truth I told you

Shake the hand that shook the world

Shoe-shine boy to champion, he'd fought and beaten many foes
His calling card was a kick to the groin, and a broken bottle to the bridge of the nose
He aimed to kill when he took to the ring, this Boston strong boy loved to fight
On more than one occasion, a bout was stopped to save an opponents life

Came these ever-proud world-renowned rowdy, roving men
With a firmness and a purpose that so many did dismiss

From the prison of their lonely hearts they labored long and hard
Working 18+hour days for the B.A.C.

Respectable,
But made of modest means With an independent spirit, so full of hopes and dreams
Opportunity denied them in a doomed and starving land
Came these openhearted kindly spirits of a truly threatened man",Boston Asphalt,1999

With a toast that tells of a love you never shared.

From Ireland they came
And they have a leader to the fold,
And Cochran was his name
It was in the month of April,
When the boys they sailed away
And they made a sight so glorious,
As they marched along Broadway
They marched right down Broadway, me boys,
Until they reached the shore
And from there they went to Washington,
And straight unto the war

So we gave them a hearty cheer, me boys,

We're the fighting sixty ninth
And when the war is said and done
May heaven spare our lives
For its only then we can return,
To our loved ones and our wives
We'll take them in our arms, me boys,
For a long night and a day
And we'll hope that war will come no more,
To sweet America

So farewell unto you dear New York,
Will I e'er see you once more
For it fills my heart with sorrow,
To leave your sylvan shore
But the country now it is calling us,
And we must hasten fore
So here's to the stars and stripes, me boys,
And to Ireland's lovely shore
And here's to Murphy and divine,
Of honor and renown
Who did escort our heroes,
Unto the battle ground
And said unto our colonel,
We must fight hand to hand
Until we plant the stars and stripes,
Way down in Dixieland

Sit and ponder.
How I could have ever neglected you.
For the blood soaked soil on the old ball field,
I gambled on a hand I wasn't ready to lose
But if the tables were turned and I faced the troubles,
Tough times and struggles I put you through
I'd of been there as you were through hardship and horror
My life and my love are pledged to you.

Through thick and thin,
She stood by you
She held the key to my broken heart

Remember the nights she waited and wondered,
fused to a myth that it had taken it's toll.
But this Godless man has mended his way,
Never again will she be alone.

I remember it well,
Still I always knew that she was destined to be my bride
This woman had pride,
She was full of life.
I could see the passion in her eyes.
She thought she found a man,
But she fell for the devil
An evil monster in disguise.

I'd of been there as you were through heartache and hardship
My life and my love are pledged to you.

[Chorus]

Remember the nights she waited and wondered, 
fused to a myth that it had taken it's toll.
But this Godless man has mended his way, 
Never again will she be alone.

I remember it well, 
Still I always knew that she was destined to be my bride
This woman had pride, She was full of life. 
I could see the passion in her eyes.
She thought she found a man, 
But she fell for the devil
An evil monster in disguise. 
Now I'll honor and obey, 
Forever stay.
True to you, my Irish rose

Dropkick Murphys,"By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young girl calling
Michael, they have taken you away,
For you stole Trevelyan's corn,
So the young might see the morn
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay

Low lie the fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling
Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free
Against the famine and the crown,
I rebelled, they cut me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity

Low lie the fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star falling
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
So she'll wait and hope and pray for her love in Botany Bay
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry

Apprenticed in trade I was bound 
And many an hour of sweet happiness 
I spent in that neat little town 
Then bad misfortune befell me 
And caused me to stray from the land 
Far away from my friends and companions 
To follow the black velvet band 

As I was out strolling one evening 
Not intending to stay very long 
And there met a frolicsome damsel
As she came tripping along
A watch she pulled out her pocket
And slipped it right into my hand 
On the very first night that I met her
Bad luck to the black velvet band 

Her eyes they shone like the diamonds 
You'd think she was queen of the land 
And her hair hung over her shoulder 
Tied up in a black velvet band

Before judge and jury next morning 
Both of us did appear 
A gentleman claimed his jewelry
And the case against us was clear 
Now seven long years transportation 
Right down to Van Dieman's land 
Far away from my friends and companions 
To follow the black velvet band 

Her eyes they shone like the diamonds 
You'd think she was queen of the land 
And her hair hung over her shoulder 
Tied up in a black velvet band 

So come all you jolly young fellows 
I'll have you take warning by me 
That whenever you're out on the liquor 
Beware of the pretty Colleen

She'll fill you with whiskey and porter 
Until you're not able to stand
And the very next thing that you know
You've landed in Van Dieman's Land

You'd think she was queen of the land 
And her hair hung over her shoulder

Come single guy and gal unto me pay attention
Don't ever fall in love
It's the devil's own invention
For once he fell in love with a maiden so bewitching
Miss Henrietta Bell down in Captain Kelly's kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

At the age of seventeen I apprenticed to a grocer
Not far from Stephen's Green
Where Miss Henri' used to go sir
Her manners were sublime she set my heart a-twitchin'
When she invited me to a party in the kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

Sunday was the day that they were to have their flare-up
He dressed himself quite gay
I frizzed and oiled my hair up
The Captain had no wife and he had gone a-fishin'
She groped me on the stairs beneath the old man's kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

Her arms around my waist she slyly hinted marriage
When to the door in haste came Captain Kelly's carriage
Her eyes were full of hate and poison she was spittin'
The Captain kicked the door in and stormed into the kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

When the Captain came downstairs he saw my situation
In spite of all his prayers he was marched off to the station
For him they'd take no bail
To get home I was itchin'
He had to tell the tale how I came into the kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

I said she did invite me
But she gave flat denial
For assault she did indict me and I was sent for trial
She swore he'd robbed her house
In spite of all her screechin'
I got six months hard
For his courtin' in the kitchen

My mind was bent on rambling to Boston I did fly
I stepped on board a vision and I followed with the wind
When next I came to anchor at the rocks on Fairmount Hill

It was on the 23rd of June the day before the fair
When Boston's sons and daughters and friends assembled there
The young, the old, the brave, and the bold
Came their duty to fulfill
At the parish church on Thatcher, a mile from Fairmount Hill

I went to see old friends there, to see what they might say
The old ones were all dead and gone, the young ones turning gray
I met the broker Hughes, he's as odd as ever still
See I used to crash at his mother's house, when I hung on Fairmount Hill

I paid a flying visit to my first and only love
She's as white as any lily, and as gentle as a dove
She threw her arm around me saying, ""Andy I love you still""
Oh, she's one miss Bazo Bailey, the pride of Fairmount Hill

I dreamt I'd fought a violent war for the hand of this darling gal
Against an angry jealous foe by the name of Danny Gill

Dropkick Murphys,"Now the fog and smoke is lifting from the fallen row on row
In 1861 they prayed for god to keep their souls
Jimmy left home in April, that was one year to the day
Writes his mother back home in Brighton, but he ain't got much to say
He's forgotten what his town looks like, the smell of death is all around
He dreams of the blue atlantic to once again be homeward bound
Homeward bound

Though the road was long and winding many snares lay in their path
But their struggle they saw as righteous they fought with might and struck with wrath

Now the battle hymns are playing, report of shots not far away
No prayer, no promise, no hand of god could save their souls that April day
Tell their wives that they fought bravely as they lay them in their graves

As the train pulled in the station and the families gathered 'round
You could hear the first car echo with a loud triumphant sound
But the last car it was silent, they listened close but they couldn't hear
It was laden down with coffins, that didn't speak and couldn't cheer

But love and affection this family afforded me
Worries came early and often it seemed
Fate was not pleasant still I was redeemed
Then compassion soon faded to chaos
As they did their best all the while
When circumstance outweighs intention
Sometimes the mountain's just too hard to climb

They were cruel, they were ignorant
They were beauty, they were kind
They were patience, they were virtue

And some senses are harder to find

You'll still answer to those you defied

Dropkick Murphys,"On the fourth of July 1806
We set sail from the sweat cove of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand city hall in New York
Twas a wonderful craft she was rigged fore and aft
And oh how the wild wind drove her
She stood several blasts she had twenty-seven masts
And they called her the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrels of stone
We had three million sides of old blind horses' hides
We had four million barrels of bone
We had five million hogs six million dogs
Seven million barrels of porter
We had eight million bails of old nanny gold tails
In the hold of the Irish Rover

There was old Mickey Coote who played hard on his flute
Ehen the ladies lined up for a set
he was tootin' with skill For each sparking quadrille
Though the dancers were fluther'd and bet
With his smart witty talk he was cock of the walk
He rolled the damnes under and over
They all knew at a glance when he took up his stance
That he sailed on the Irish Rover

There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And your man from the West Meath called Malone
The was slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracey from Dover
And your man Mick McCann from the bankls of the Bann
Was the skipper of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And the ship lost its way in the fog
And that whale of a crew was reduced down to two
Just myself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock oh Lord what a shock
The bulkhead was turned right over
Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
And the last of the Irish Rover",The Irish Rover,2011

At mass in the morning handing out the Holy Ghost

And tomorrow you are out the door.

Our bodies heading straight.

To find our whole lives waiting there?

Might be off the 40 'cause I'm OG like Ice-T 
Ya dig? 

Smoke hoes, an coke hoes, are sumpthin' like the same 
One fo the white dope, one fo the nigga that's in the game 
Now I know bitches that say ""Richard, do what ya want to"" 
But like old Vogues them bitches cry when I hit the corner 
My 7-duce, produce, 'cause the zues was pissed off 
I'm still gettin' zips off 
Niggaz feelin' ripped off, an clipped off 
Until they told me, it was Knumskull, Yuk an Dru 
Now what you want to do? 
It's thirty five-hundred for the straight laced triple gold, wit the vogues 
That's what they cost in the store, yeah 
An you can reach, but you can not touch 
Ever figga, scared nigga that you feared too much? 
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts

That's why I, keep my bitch business in the cut 
That way I gets yo skrilla, plus I get to fuck, 
'Cause we.

You want to make an effort towards paper, then bitch get crack 
So sick wid it 
That's why I shitted on raps fo luck 
I'm like what ever it takes to make a buck 
Could never be stuck 
I'm facin' a life of brokeness already 
Fuck the pain, it juss make sense fo me to stay on my hustle and game 
Blame no nigga fo my down fall 
But pimpin' is the final frontier, I gets around y'all 
We all.

How would you like it if a nigga was broke an' came fed on ya?
That's why I'm still on my P's an' Q's
Readin' fools I'm known as a shista deceivin' fools
See quit's pagin' me

Snoopin' around found trouble
Fo tryin' to fuck up a niggaz bubble
Don't bubble mo than he got
'Cause now he know that if he get rid of you
Then that's more cash in the Pot

I got a rival now, tha turf is showin' what it's worth
I gotta pack a gat fo survival now, they just won't let me be
All I can be so all I can see is victory
I'm struggle master so the doo doo that you do
Will only make me wanna bubble faster

No party poop 'cause this troop came Federal
Slappin' hoes in they neck juss to let 'em know

Twenty eight grams on the triple beam
Chefs hittin' clean, how much clean?
Four-fifteens, an' the zap-co
The rap-go, we slip an made a weak move

Don't sleep dude, I pull licks every week fool
But ain't no Bonnie an' Clyde nigga
'Cause if a bitch set up a lick, I get the money an' slide nigga
I hit the crap game first thang, leave if you shot yo
'Cause bein' broke is the worst thang

Check this out man, 'cause you know I ain't that type niggie
I scoop the dice, once or twice then the riggie, riggie
Dangle roll shot, is a fa sho shot
No shot, I mean it's so hot, I'm snatchin' hella face from the block

I got the glock sixteen on my waist juss in case
Never hit 6-8's, know the haters at the gate
When I shake the dice another one bites the dust
They mad as fuck gettin' struck by the shista

I shoulda known 'cause rule number one
Never roll craps wit some niggaz on a track you ain't from
They young an' claimin' they broke, but they forgotten
That I got they mail, an' I can tell they plottin'

But shit, they'll get licked like a popsicle
Don't fuck around an' get sent to the hospital
Little niggaz think they slick but they already sawin'
Popin' at y'all take on raw shit

Let me raise up from these cowards turf
Yeah 'cause little do they know what's below the Eddie Bauer shirt
Niggaz mean muggin' me but what that do
I'm a soldier till it's over 6-5 on my tattoo punk

Dru Down,"Ah yeah!
Yeah!
It's all about you, one time!
I'mma say it's all about you baby, yeah!
It's all about you, it's all about you, yeah
This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac you knowhat I'm sayin'? (It's all about you)
Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' boo, is this is all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga
It's all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin'
She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin'
And all females love that
Especially when you're dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didn't have to say much
'Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Don't be trippin' if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
I'm gonna still let you know girl
That it's all about you, you, you, you",All Bout U,1996

All the freaks come out tonight
Ain't no shootin, no stabbin no fights
It's so tough, oh in the ""O"" so rough
Skeez's skirt's the town so tight
All the freaks come out tonight
For the dough oh, on the ho stroll

[Verse 1:-Dru Down]
You got some money?(I got a tender)
And you can bend her over the table
But, be sure that you bring my stallion back to my stable
Say baby, everything was cool in the 80's
But now it's the 90's, and oh I got's to find me
One of them ladies, who be up in the closet
Come out on holiday's, and birthday's lookin sausage
The party's at the Henry J.Cozier
Ain't nothin but the X.O.,Tanqueray, I can't see no budwiser
Maybe a little bit of Cognac, that's phat
A little bit of entertainment, patna's that rap
No zapp's, stricly P.I.'s, V.I'S, and Playa O.G.'s
Them little freak nasty's that be rated VD
Be in the town daily in the candy mercedes
But ain't no freaks in the day
I wait fo' the night fo' ho's to get right
And wouldn't care if they're in pantie's
Or in skin tight leather zebra stripe's, it's midnight

This rap here....It goes for all you playa hata's
Handcuff your ho's....that goes for all you captain saver's
Peep, my major industry, gold teeth and diamond's, been grindin
For nine and half year's, now I'm rhymin
I'm the Fretmore like I'll be sure to drink X.O.
Petal to the metal in the Lexo
How we make em shout like the ????, when we step out the Ice Cream van
BIOTCH... don't you hear the music?
Trick's just loose it, they want to hit the fluid
But mobb nigga's just do it like Nike, nobody like me
No fella's called me, but when I was just broke ass Jerold Ellis
They was all jesus,we just nigga's who went from wearin Fila's
To rockin Collar's and fluid's, and my adidas
Strapped up wit heater's, now when they nigga's need a mini 14
To spray nigga's, they say I got more cream

[Numskull]
Once upon a time in the project's, show
Two briddy's had one I did, break em all from the East O
Figured out a plan, Num is my man, plotted like a gold-digger bitch
I ain't got end's, so I get tha shit
But I gotta change it around...
Walked her in the bathroom at Snaz Crib
Beat the cock up like she was gettin her ass kicked
After that I got my ass licked, and passed it to my homie's
Once, twice, now everynight she want's to bone me
She think she own me, talkin to my nigga bout marriage
(""That's right I don't need no,blah,blah,blah, marriage"")
The drunk talk, the drunk walk is what I gave her
The next thing I know she started screwin my neighbor(who dat be?)
And that be snack back hack, so bad he ran game on her
So pimpy doo, we ran train on her
So she let the thang take on her mind
Speak it on her like her pit tight

Girl, I rolls in dough like Pillsbury
""Tonight's The Night"" like Kris Kross
So let's floss, I be in the midnight freaker tosser
Like saucer, puttin thangs down
Got to plan the man
Waitin for somebody like John Wayne, ready to pop the???????????????
No old school, say it's like ""baby what's your name!""
Got at em pimpy doo word's, and I made em just for you baby
All ready can't see you, cause you locked up all the time
Two toast for my comfort, too tight like my Nikes
Hit the street's poundin, representin the West Coast sound
One in charge, want to know the name, it's Mr.Down
Looks so right, sound's right, lit up the night
I never seen you before, so were ya been&were you been hidin?
Probably, havin a bad relationship, steadily fightin
Came to find me someone like yo, problem solver
The man you been you like night, sneak and creep, and wasn't a caller
Let's make it right, and the only way to make it right
Until the midnight, until the midnight

A big mack capalized double D. see. 
And it's on, so I'm a get sick wit it, 
A give me drank da bomb and let me get wit it.
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year 
Goin' around doin' shit like this here. 
Cause a nigga is strong, 
And way to long when it comes to my ding dong. 
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line, 
So now I know I gotta get mine. 
It's really no thang to me, see, to be a real true P.I.M.P.
Cause I had me a hoe or two or mo' 
Way back in eighty fuckin' fo'. 
That's when I was a teen. 
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see.
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes, 
smackin' hoes, up and down tha fuckin' avenues. 
And ever I do that,
I dig a deep in the pocket for tha fat gat.
Feel me. I'm so god damn bad, 
That I had to kick off in a hoe's ass, 
Cause the girl tried to do me, 
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony. 
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah the nigga raped her. 
But I'm not trippin'. 
Bitches like you want to keep on slippin'. 
So I had to move on, to the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear,
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch.

Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.

First thang first on the second verse. 
I learned a hell of a lot, 
A get from the get down start. 
So I had my hoes hoin'. 
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'. 
Cause all the game I spit is good shit, 
And the shit that I spit made me rich. 
Cause I was all about money. 
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey. 
Cause I'm givin' it up quick. 
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips. 
Uh, and a bet is better than grey, 
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley . 
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney. 
But I knew she was a fake one, 
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none. 
I just walked up to her. 
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler.
And from the get go,
I'm just a pimp, hoe, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said okay,
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today.
Yeeyah, then I said get with it and don't be a bitch and try to split
Uh, She was right up under my wing ,
At the airport at five fifteen. 
She said ""Who are you and why are ya here?"",
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year. 

Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies.

I've got a thang for makin' hoes.
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold.
And I don't go for talk back, 
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that.
Deduct from tha pay check, 
Matta fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac,
So I can ride and check mate.
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate. 
And no I don't play around, fuck around, 
A when it comes to my money nigga. 
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung, 
I give her Henesee, a with tha one on one. 
So she can get so high, real high, 
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy. 
Cause I'm a kick somethin' just for the hoes, 
And for myself I keep indo. 
And when a hoe finds out I'm real, yes I am
Mack playa pimp of tha year.

Head split an ass kicked in
Chin shattered
An nobody could recognize you when they found ya
An they still don't know who downed ya

This shit is deeper than you think
Wit' a straight face
Lay down an come up off them cavy case
Slow down
Better pump yo brakes
Don't know my click from a can of paint
These niggas won't last
When I
Buck one in that ass
An hit the gate
I seen two more escape

It ain't no room for no non-ass soldier niggas
An it's amazin how the heat bring out the ho in niggas

Hoes at the bus stop wanna get in

Foot soliders
Not swangin like a Nova
Plus them niggas ain't tight
To make a right an pull my 600 over
Juss as I left I looked to the corner of my eye
That it's them same niggas that bucked at me
But it wasn't my time to die
Ah pull out my thang
Hit 'em in the back
Whatever remained
So the bitch stay out my business an let the Benzo skirt
An swang
Yellin' Mobb, clouded wit' Age
For the nigga I said
""I didn't love yo punk ass
An plus I'm tired of the pain""
Like Cameo this shit is strange
A nigga doin' a dude
To get his whole neck an head rearranged
Mobb members, make niggas think about what they doin'
Watch what you pursuin
Fuck around an get yo whole career ruined

Gettin' high niggas be
Gettin' by on these streets
Do or die on these streets
Hit 'em high meet defeat
Wit' 'em tied across the feet
Niggas lie beneath the creek
Many try but don't eat
Much food
Unless I run wit' a fool that picks me up in a Lex
Fuck school!

When they bury ya they pissin' on the side of you grave
No witnesses but a buckshot from inside of the gage

Handcuffed an made to lay down

To skanless, manless
To slang a gang
Strapped down
My shit be fully greased up
Hits the muthafuckin' streets up
'cause niggas ain't takin' no beat ups
They re-up wit' the heatas
Leaders of the new school
But we don't bust a rhyme
We bust a nine
Muthafuckas find
Nine's under the bridge in the Pacific Tunnel
Mobb material
Scratch off the serial number
Fuckin' ballistic so
Roll to the riches
Fuck hoes, bitches, an sluts
Bubblicious Yuk

Now what these niggas tryin' to do?
Get gunned down, stomped an pistol whipped fool?
If not I sugguest you get the fuck up out the West
When it come to gun play
There's no contest
I leave you wit' two holes
One in yo dome
One in yo chest
An Elliot Ness
He wouldn't have made it on the West
And yes
I know you muthafuckas heard about us
'Cause we was all on the news
Fo' Mobb-Style murders
I crack a fool on top of his head
Wit' a strap
Told his bitch to come over here
She sat on my lap
Man this Mobb shit
Ain't never been no joke
You headed straight for the pen
Or you end up smoked
That's why I keep a heater
On my passengers seat
An I'm Mobb Affiliated
Uh, uh
I know you hate it
I rather be caught
With my heater
Then wit' out my heater
It's juss a misdemenor

I'm crackin' backs like a chiropractor
Come see a Cydal factor
Get off yo block when rifles splatter
Come across wit' a rival chapter
Don't be afraid to be blastin'
An don't know nothin' bout lastin'
An if he flashin'
We gassin' him
An leavin' his ass in a wagon
The last dragon
We smashin'
Imagine missin' in action
I hit his ass for his cabbage
An dissapeared like Aladdin
An trappin' his ass inside a muthafuckin' cave
Niggas that came wit' the pistols
I got missles and hand grenades
An some troopers wit' bazookaz
Ready to shoot you
Do you in
Crushin' boulders wit' soldiers
Cook it an make it pure again
It's yo friend the Prince Of Darkness
Whenever the dark hits
I feel my heart get
To beatin' an you bustas be my target
PM it's cold heart

It ain't no room for no non-ass soldier niggas
An it's amazin how the heat bring out the ho in niggas

We use no parinoia
Or dedication to our paper it's so deep
The paraphanalia to the Mobb
Love to creep
Our elevations is racin'
Up to the top
Non-stop wit' a caulked back Glock
Then hop
Into some cut
To then nigga skirt-skirt
You notice I juss do some dirt
I puttin' in work
I hit them were it hurt
Crack yo spine time
Instead of hittin' 'em wit' my nine
I'm Strictly wit' this hit Mobb shit bitch!
Recognize what a muthafucka' do is steal
Right between your eyes
The nigga was dead before he died I slide
To the next scene
To the next route
I'm speakin' on what I jus' did at the head quarters
An to my Mobb soldiers
No one can fold us
Readin the weakness like some Black Jack
If niggas can't handle it
They get stomped from that Mobb attack
An if you come back from that stompin
Lay low
Got 'em
Hard-headed niggas will get they head put on fire

It's A-G-E once again
Pullin you niggas ho cards
Strapped for them niggas that frontin like bitches tryin' to act hard
It ain't nothin' but the mutha fuckin' Mobb in me
I went from sellin' coke on the block
To doin' robberies
To 'luffin yo ass
Stuffin' yo ass
Up in a trunk punk
Caught wit' a 3 Times circumstance like T-Funk
Too soon for 'em
Shoulda' had a tomb for 'em
Non-ass solider niggas
There'd be no room for 'em

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' boo, is this is all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga
It's all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin'
She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin'
And all females love that
Especially when you're dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didn't have to say much
'Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Don't be trippin' if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
I'm gonna still let you know girl

Why did you say goodbye 
I still feel your presence 
In my bed at night 

And what was reality once 
A love True in form 
Has now added pain 
For a man scorn 

Forced to wear the memories of pain 
Around an empty heart
 
Now I sit in silence and begin to think 
As laughter echoes through the air 
I can't get you off my mind 
But a whole new love 
I could never bare 

So now I lay 
Me down to sleep 
And I pray my Lord my soul to keep 
And if I die, before I wake 
Then I promise I'll be there for you always

Maybe I'm better off on my own

If I pray to myself
Maybe God above will hear me
And if it is in his will
Then he'll send you right back to me

I'll hold my feelings inside so that you won't see me cry
I hope it's all in my mind cause I'm scared.

I'm gonna chill to myself
Leave the stress of a world from inside me
I'm gonna walk all alone
And leave all my troubles behind

That ain't me

Ain't no way to get around it
Now you're stuck with me, baby, baby
Did you know that you'd be surrounded 
By my love and ecstasy

This is the start of one great love affair
That's never ever never gonna end
We can share the world together
Oh, this is where it begun

[Chorus: x2]

OH, girl I'll stand by you
If you give me your hand
I'll make love to you baby
Your every wish is my command

Let's play out your fantasies
Oh, I can lose your mind
Take you places you ain't never been before
I promise you it's alright

If I make a promise to you 
Then baby that's what I'll do
I have nothing to lose
I give my whole world to you

Since I held you in my arms
So I picked up pen and paper
And decided to write you a song

Things just ain't the same
Since you took your love away 
All I have is dark and lonely days
'Cause the sun don't shine my way

Wish that I could find the words to say
To show you love is real
The words just can't express the way I feel

[Chorus]
You're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together
Why you want to leave me now
Only you can ease the pain I feel
And wipe my tears away
Won't you fly back home and make me whole again

Baby not a day goes bye
That I don't want to cry
When I think of what we had
How you walked out of my life

All I had was yours to take
Till my heart you chose to break
Still wish that I could make love to you
Just one more time for old times sake

If only I could find the words to say
To show you love is real
The words just can't express the way I feel

[Chorus]
You're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together
Why you want to leave me now
Only you can ease the pain I feel
And wipe my tears away
Won't you fly back home and make me feel whole again
Come back home
Come back home

'Cause without you here beside me 
My house is not a home
Only you can ease the pain I feel
And wipe my tears away

Won't you fly back home and make me whole again
You're my angel
My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together

Why you want to leave me now
Only you can ease the pain I feel
And wipe my tears away
Won't you fly back home and make me whole again

My sun up in the sky
We've been through hell and back together
Why you want to leave me now

To just first of all thank you all for taking the time out to listen to this
Album.

Hope you're enjoying everything you hear so far.
Right now I think I need to dedicate this song, this next song coming up to
Every man and woman, boy or girl whoever and wherever you may be, who has ever been
In an relationship that just didn't quite work out.

Also this song is dedicated to everybody who comes up to me in all the clubs,
Supermarkets, airports, and everywhere else in the world asking me, ""Woody when
You gon' do something, when they gon' let you sang?""

Not knowing that man I sung all of ""April Showers"" a verse on ""All Alone""
A verse on ""5 Steps"" and about half the songs on the album but that's cool y'all
Ain't know.

Listen to this song right here 'cause this here is for y'all.

But then again you didn't notice me
So well remain passers by
Until the next time we speak

I hope that I can make you mine
For another man steals your heart
And once your beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name

I'm hoping I can make you mine
For another man steals your heart
And once your beauty is mine
I swear we will never be apart

But I didn't want to move too fast
'Cause I knew that when I saw you again
That I wouldn't want to let you pass

'Cause my eyes have seen the glory
In the coming of your smile
So I swear if you ever come round again
Please stay for a while

Walks by me every day
Her and love are the same
The woman that's stolen my heart
And beauty is her name

I'm hoping I can make you mine
For another man steals your heart
And once this beauty is mine
I swear that well never be apart

You are so beautiful
When I'm down and out
I never seem to get tired
Tired of your love

'Cause you are wonderful
You're wonderful
I'm just dying to make you see
Anything you want inside your heart

You can find right here inside of me
Walks by me every day

And beauty is her name
I'm hoping I can make you mine

Girl it don't have to be a thang
I'll wait for you, you wait for me
Cause' true love is insisting we don't have to rush at all

These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can just take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not all

Be thinkin bout you all the time
Morning, noon and suppertime
Tear you up in little pieces
Swallow you like reeses pieces
Come on girl you know i need it
It ain't s'posed to be a thang
I know
If i wait for you, you'll wait for me
And i know
True loves insisting we don't have to rush at all

These are the times we all wish for

We don't have to do a thing at all
We can just take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not all

I don't make promises
Cause i know my heart gets weak
I get around you
It makes them hard to keep
You bring out the best, you make me the man
God knows i'm proud to be

These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all

So you say your ish is it
And you say your ish is hot
You want me to touch your spot

Now I watch your earrings jingle
And I watch you work your middle
'Cause your handle bars ain't little
Makes me wanna... (Y'all ain't ready)

If you wanna move

Said, East Side, where you at? Yo, what the deally?
And to my ladies over West, can you feel me?
Tell me, what the deal with the South?
And tell me Master P got it all figured out
But if you say you with me, show you with me
You're so pretty, you stay shitty
Ain't no shorty over forty chillin' in the VIP with me
Damn right, game tight, 'cause that's how we do it tonight

Yo, yo
Who got the best body on the planet?
I take advantage, then skate like the kissin' bandit
Leave of hearts
Got these shorties out after dark
We're lady killers
Then blow back apart, raw dealers
Tical! Dru Hiller, strange love, seven thirty
I'm like Herbie with a Love Bug
Then skip town like a Casanova Brown Mrs.
You look delicious like a two piece with a biscuit
What's goin' down?
In my mind I'm rippin' your clothes
Playing with your feet, girl, suckin' your toes
Go 'round with the Ghetto Sarano', mellow
Romeo, who like his women on the same level
Pay my bills that were due; all accounts settled
Now I'm relaxing like Pa, now with Ma Kettle
Baby laughing, earrings in both nipples
Like Janet Jackson, busting out her latest fashion
Or the smashin'
Honey, come on over here; I fuck feet cold
Throw them panties over there, you won't need those
You talk like sex
You walk like sex
Ya smell like sex
Ya yell like sex
And all ya want is Mr. Meth, hell of a man
That can sell an Eskimo a fan
I come equipped for any spot that you want hit
Or want licked; when my dick get the fuck outta here, ah, shit
I start to think back on how I go hump
In seven minutes to heaven at the age of eleven
Couldn't tell me nuthin' then, can't tell me nuthin' now
Honey child, milkin' the cow, lovin' my style
This is what we do, kid - me and them Dru kids
Take 'em blind, crimpin' them crazy, even toothless
Lastly, if you know me, don't ask me
Call me Method, Mr. Meth if ya nasty

If I move it on the left, will it be hot to death?
If I move it on the right, will you make it last all night? (Woody)

If I move it in and out, will it make you scream and shout?
Come on

But maybe I am being far too gloomy
Yes, maybe I'll make waves in pastures new
Find goverment and politics come to me

Got mad weapons too, ain't tryin' to hear that
Tryin' to bring down me, this champion
When y'all clowns gon' see that it can't be done
Understand me son, I'm the slickest they is,

Without you
Def soul
I'm free to fly like a bird
Over the earth far away
Seeing where beauty's
Entailed places
Unveiled take me away when

When I envision your eyes
You light up the sky
Holdin' my dreams in a cry
Now I feel my
Heart's been revealed
Hiding so long
Feeling all alone

[Chorus:]
Could never see myself
Without you living
So far from home
I could never
Be myself without you
Don't leave me alone

Soaring from a valley so low to
A mountain so high
What a life

Exploring why your love
Never grows old
Bo hug is too tight
This is right

When I envision your eyes
You light up the sky
Holdin' my dreams in a cry
Now I feel my
Heart's been revealed
Hiding so long
Feeling all alone

Dru Hill,"Yeah, this one's dedicated, to my grandmother, and your grandmother
It's all love, let's not forget who raised us, word up

Big Mama, my grandmother, my main girl
I love you much more than the scandalous world
As a young boy you gave me whoopings to save my life
Cursed me out, to keep me out the streets at night

'Cause my momma had me when she was young
So you took on the responsibility to raise your grandson
You taught me if a task is once begun, Todd
Never leave it 'til it's done, Todd

Be thy labor great or small Todd
Do it well or not at all, God
Big Mama, my blood is your blood
When the whole world's against me, I know I got your love

If I was in a cell for the rest of my life
I know I'd hear your prayers in the middle of the night
Used to sit me on your lap and teach me mother with
Early Sunday morning for them salmon and grits

I love you baby, you the one and only, that's a fact
'Til death do us part, I'ma always have your back
You beefed 'cause you heard that I was cursin' in my raps
Eighty-six, still you want to run and get the straps

I love you, I promise you I care for you deep
'Cause when I had bronchitis you would rock me to sleep
Rub me down with green alcohol
Little brown-skinned lady bout five feet tall, Big Mama

[Chorus]
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table (you gave me unconditional love)
There was no time to eat, she said to me
Boy hurry to Sunday school (you gave me unconditional love)

I remember when you told me certain friends wasn't real
I didn't want to listen, I swore I knew the deal
Come to find out, everything you said was true
Who I end up goin' to for advice? You

I love you, that's why you got nurses and maids
Ever since I got paid, you ain't never been afraid
That's granddaddy wife, she taught me how to think
How to navigate through life, you made the sacrifice

You kept on livin', 'cause when my granddaddy died
It took all your might, but you ain't quit on life
We took trips down South, biscuits and chicken
Me you granddad and Alison, trippin'

Remember, you used to pick me up from junior high
And classmates laughed when the Buick rolled by
Remember, I pulled my privates out in class
And from Farmers to Dunkirk you straight whooped my (woo!)

The best cookin' a man could ever taste
It's written in my heart, it can never be erased
Thank you so much, you taught me well

How to not get souped up, because I'm LL
How to walk the street, and hold my head real high
How to live with Christ and not be afraid to die

We sipped daiquiris, but you never told moms
We even shared beers, Big Mama my dear
A toast to a woman that raised a man
In popular demand all across the land

You're my lawyer, my teacher, my doctor, my friend
My mother, my father, you with me 'til the end
I love you, I mean that from the bottom of my heart
That's the reason why my record's number one on the charts

I'm a tell it like it is, I love you forever
Dead or alive, we'll always be together
Big Mama I love you

[Chorus]

I dedicate this to the Big Mama's everywhere
The ones who raised us, when nobody else was there
The ones who held us and told us it'll be alright
When gunshots was goin' off every night

Taught us how to lock the door and check the peephole
And how to swallow Vicks when we had a chest cold
How to stay proud, and represent hard
Eat plenty baby, but first say grace for God

Big Mama, I'm a miss you
When one of us leave this earth
But baby for what it's worth, I love you since the date of my birth
And if it wasn't for my children, I would want to go first

You're the reason I'm the man I am today
The inspiration, for me to be LL Cool J
When you told me ""Knock 'em Out,"" I brought you home a Grammy
I learned to be tough from Big Mama and Aunt Cammy

A black man that was raised by black women
On tour, sippin your special honey and lemon
You told me, gargle with vinegar water and salt
The concert was hot, thanks to your support

Girl, you're the one I love
Whether right here with me or smilin' from up above
Trouble or no trouble, you always had my back
So I had to let you know your son appreciates that, Big Mama

[Chorus: x2]",Big Mama (Unconditional Love),2002
Dru Hill,"Does anybody stay together any more
Seems like love nowadays doesn't endure ooooh
We haven't always Gotten along
But I stayed cause I always saw this day
And I want to say

I knew that we could make it {me and you baby}
Please be my wife, grow [old] with me {Hoooooo}
Millions didn't make it (But our Love) {ours was a love that}
One of the ones that did {we made it baby}

Real thin so shy really not my type no
There was no future for us girl honestly

Did I hurt you all that bad?

Who would've known that she would be my future wife
Or the mother of a child so beautiful
What I had in love I lacked in self-control

See, I had to have them all to be satisfied
And on an average night, I'd take four or five
But the measure of a man ain't how many you can fuck
It's how you live your life so you can keep her trust

Men always regret getting over 'Cause you don't know what you do
So, you're better off loving her from the start
Even if you're not sure if she's loving you
Men always regret getting over She'll hide her pain in her smile
And be in your bed sleeping with another man
While you're on the phone askin' 'bout your child

Remarkable, incredible, confrontational, yet irreplaceable
She wouldn't cook or clean, so I let her go (Oh no no)
But she's got the kind of love that you can't let go
But still I loved her unconditionally

I wish she had've told me that she didn't love me
Could have been better off on my own (yes, I would)
But then I never would have wrote this song

See, my girl is the kind that walks around with a smile
Kissin' and huggin' me like she don't even care, Oh yeah
So one day, I come home
Smilin', ready to say I love you
But then I walked upstairs
And all your things were gone like you were never there

I just want to talk to my child

Still can't understand
Why you let me get away with what I did
I don't want to hurt another girl
Knowin' I was sleepin' with another girl

While you were home sleepin' in my bed
I really can't be mad if you turn around and do the same to me
Please, God, give me the strength

'Cause one day she'll leave

Dru Hill,"[Nokio]
I tried to be the man you wanted me to be
But it just wasn't good enough
And I'm sitting down here alone
What am I to do...
 
She don't really want to talk to me
'Cause she said that our love is done
She don't even want to look my way
'Cause she said that I'm not the one

All she wanted was a faithful man
who can tell her just what he felt
Now she found love in another man
So I'm back here all by myself

[Chorus]
She said that she would comfort you, through anything
Where did she go? (Where did she go?)
She said that she would be right here, never ever leave
Where did she go? 

[Lovher]
She said that she would comfort you, through anything
WHere did she go? (I don't know)
She said that she would be right here, never ever leave
Where did she go?

I guess I'm gonna have to tell myself
There will be better things ahead
And all I have to do is think about
All I had before she left

She don't really want to live alone
But she will if it brings me pain
And I don't want to have to sacrifice my soul
Just to keep love the same (She said)

[Chorus]
She said that she would comfort you, through anything
Where did she go? (I wish i knew)
She said that she would be right here, never ever leave
Where did she go? 

[Lovher]
She said that she would comfort you, through anything
Where did she go? 
She said that she would be right here, never ever leave

I told you I was crazy 'bout you
Loved you from your ankles up
And almost everything I told you
I said it just so I could f... f... mmm...

But now that I've done got you, baby
Seems like we had so much fun
But when I really think about it
There's somethin' that you still ain't done for me

The only thing you haven't done for me
Is show me why your name is ecstasy
I know you get down
So girl, why don't you quit playin' 'round

2 or 3, it don't matter when
I only want you for my special friend
And there's some things I want to do to you
Girl, you know you want to do it too

I heard so much about you
I'm so curious 'bout what you do
Girl, you know I'm goin' down

Baby, tell me why you want to get down tonight
You tell me you don't want to be a freak, uh
You tell me why you wasted so much time
Girl, you know that I
But what about the sexual things that you like to do
I'm waitin' here so patiently

Dru Hill,"I don't know how much longer 
You're going to be here 
So I say my prayers 
Every night 

One 4 my mother 
One 4 my father 
And one 4 the love of my life 

So if you decide to leave today 
Then leave tomorrow at the door 
And take only 
Half of yesterday 

Forget all hope for the present 
'Cause it just went away 

We were 5 steps 
From eternity 
4 steps 
4 steps past love 
And 3 wishes 
From 

Touching the heavens above 
Another day is gone 
Another night now dawn 
Waiting patiently hoping you'll return 

But not before long 
Why'd you say goodbye 
I still feel your presence 
In my bed at night 

And what was reality once 
A love True in form 
Has now added pain 
For a man scorn 

Forced to wear the memories of pain 
Around an empty heart 
Now I sit in silence and begin to think 
As laughter echoes through the air 

I can't get you off my mind 
But a whole new love 
I could never bare 
So now I lay 

Me down to sleep 
And I pray my Lord my soul to keep 
And if I die, before I wake 
Then I promise I'll be there for you always 

We were 5 steps 
From eternity 
4 steps 
4 steps past love 
And 3 wishes 

From 
Touching the heavens above",5 Steps [Radio Edit],2007

I'll make you ooh, like ""Girl that's it""
Now gi-gi-give it to me like you should (like I should?)
Yeah, we can slow it down or speed it up
I love it when you flip it then beat it up
You know them other girls ain't sweet enough
So every time he see me he eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Don't slow it down baby keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
I love it when you make it go deep enough
And I'm so gone I can't hold it in
Now one mo' round, can we go again?
I'm lovin' each and every little thing you do
I kinda think I really wanna sing to you
Sing to you, sing to you
You got me in a zone when I think of you
Think of you, think of you
Now baby come and tell me what I need to do

Wrap your legs around my waist and hold tight (hold tight)
Hold tight (hold tight) cause we're gonna take a ride tonight

You got yo' boots, strapped up
And I got my ticket, got my ticket
And I'm ready for the ride of a lifetime
Is you wit it? Is you wit it?
Fasten yo' seat belt, buckle up
Take two shots, double up
Play this song, pump it up
Then get a little closer, snuggle up
Take yo' time I'm a take my time
Sip a little somethin then relax yo' mind
Let's do it like we never did befo' (did befo'?)
Yeah, I got you screamin ""Oh my God""
The headboard hit that wall so hard
Sound like somebody knockin at the do' (at the do'?)
Yeah, keep yo' hands inside the ride 
When you up in the air and ridin high
Tonight it's on, I wanna hear you moan 
When I put a little kiss inside your thigh
Put a little bass inside your ear 
When I whisper and tell you that daddy's here
Daddy's here, the heat is on
And I love you with your little Vickie Secrets on
Even though I'll never let you keep 'em on 
Cause you pressed my button and the freak is on
Let's make it a night to remember 
And bend that mattress that yo' sheets is on
Sheets is on, yank 'em off
And every little kiss I'm a make 'em soft
Yo' undergarments, take 'em off
Take 'em off so you can

Dru Hill,"We started out together, rode a love journey
We said we'd be together till the very end
Ain't nobody ever made love, that we did; oh yeah 
I must admit we had something special
Almost perfect 'cept those things we didn't let go
You did you dirty, girl; and I did mine too
And now you want me gone away.
Sooo easy making mistakes
All broken down, beyond repair
We're being selfish, and had us helpless
Now it's better that we go away; away 

Never thought that we would be apart
And leaving with broken hearts
How did we let our love get away? (how did our love gave away)

Never thought we'd let it get away
The future we had faded away (away, away, away)",Away,2010

How Many Kids Are We Gon' Have
I Remember We Used To Make Plans Like
'I Cook The Food, You Cut The Grass'
I Remember We Used To Go Out Shopping, And How Picky You Would Be
I Recall We Used To Watch Bill Cosby And Say That's How We Gonna Be

(What Happened) To All The Years Of Care
(About What) Making The Visions That We Shared
(The Promise) Where Did The Aspirations Go
(I Don't Know) See Baby All I Wanna Know Is

Can We Take It Back To The Way We Were
Back To Every Single Time You Saw Him, You Saw Her
Even Though We Try To Stay Away
My Heart Is Still In Yesterday
Lets Go Back To The You And Me
Like We S'pose To Be
Back To The Future

I Reminisce About The First Time I Saw You
My Future Flashed Before My Eyes
I Often Think About The First Time I Called You
How We Were Laughing Thru' The Night
We Used To Say We Would Outlast Forever
Travel A Road That Never Ends
We Need To Find A Way To Put It Back Together
Live In That Moment Once Again

Adrenaline rushes through me
Feels fast
Hope the moment lasts forever
Yeah
In perfect pink and gold it contained you 
Framing you so well
Slip
And though the night was cold
It was warm for you
Slip
As far as you could tell
Slip
And by the headlight's glow 
We lost control
Into perfect red I watched you go
Slip
You leave me wondering
How long I can survive

Take what we can from this
Take everything we need to live
Breathe in every inch of this 
For my love
Blush red over my pale skin
The moon unscathed above our heads
Dizzy, I feel your hands on me
And I sink 

I slip
In perfect pink and gold

Framing you so well

It was warm for you

Your silken slip is a perfect fit
I can't keep my hands off of it

Back to the back of the lac incase them pussy niggas wanna jet
Know I keep that .45, turn you into Cabbage Patch

Drunken Boat,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",A Gift,1992

Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're in Love,1997
Drury Lane Theatre Orchestra,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1997
Drury Lane Theatre Orchestra,"Younger than springtime are you
Softer than starlight are you
Warmer than winds of June
Are the gentle lips you gave me

Gayer than laughter are you
Sweeter than music are you
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Are you to give me
And when your youth and joy
Invade my soul
And fill my heart
As now they do, then

Younger than springtime am I
Gayer than laughter am I
Sunlight and moon beans
Heaven and earth
Am I with you",Younger Than Springtime,1997

Egotrip' du re-noi aux grosses lèvres
31 mars, j'augmente le level
Disons que le soleil se lève
J'suis venu récupérer le trône
Dites-leur que le fauve est de retour dans la faune
N'ayez pas peur mes petits
Mais c'est vrai qu'en ce moment, j'ai beaucoup d'appétit
J'fais plus du rap, j'fais de la menuiserie
MC, je découpe, j'freestyle avec une scie
Mon prochain album c'est Saw 5
Jusqu'à ce qu'ils disent ""Arrête, c'est trop zinc!""
J'ferai des boucheries comme George
T'auras mon rap en travers de la gorge
Depuis que je rap dans l'urgence
On croise beaucoup plus de Mc's aux urgences
De l'égotrip j'vais t'en donner
L'étalon noir est venu pour éduquer les poneys
J'suis un sauvage, j'rappe depuis une réserve
J'suis une espèce rare, tu sais même pas c'que j'vous réserve
J'suis productif comme la Chine
J'ai toujours la ""Rage Against The Machine""
J'suis une machine, mon album c'est un massacre
Imagines, il fera passer le tien pour une arnaque
Ou au mieux pour une mixtape, gros, imprègne-toi de ça
Regarde comment on fait, maintenant retourne en studio
Ils ont les larmes dans les yeux, depuis que j'rappe lacrymo
J'fais des crimes au Mic, leur botte le cul sur leur créneau
""Cruel"" est le mot d'ordre, le rap j'vais le mordre
Lui tendre une corde et le pendre, j'vais le tordre

J'viens du Demi-Lune Zoo, et ce n'était pas n'importe quel gang
Alors MC, je t'en prie reste poli
Les seuls millions que t'as palpé, tu les as pris au Monopoly
Han, ça fait mal, han, très très mal
Eh, pourquoi tu rappes moins bien que Fatal?
Han, euh ta carrière c'est un fantasme ou une blague?
La couronne sur ta tête n'est qu'une bague
Fermez les portières quand je fais du rap-jacking
Comme Rim-K, c'est bim-bim, vite-vite rangez vos bling-bling
J'viens geler vos carrières, glacer le décor
J'suis froid comme si la banlieue Sud s'trouvait au Pôle Nord

J’arrêterai le son le jour ou je serai bien mais pas avant
J’veux plus que ma mélodie fasse de l’auto-stop
Être dans la lumière une fois sur deux tel un stroboscope
Ma musique touche le monde mais elle est intouchable
Si près du peuple loin des guerres, ses responsables
Si tu connais la bonne zic c’est qu’tu connais Dry
Mafia K'1fry pour le pera on a donné grave
Ouais on a percé, percé tous nos khey
Mais moi perso quand j’opère c’est que pour faire du zeille
Audi ou Renault 5 j’veux mon son dans toutes voitures
Ma mélodie a la bougeotte c’est un nomade le vois-tu?
Elle la voix sûre, calme les malaises
Voire les blessures mais la censure aimerait qu’elle se taise
Elle prend trop de place pour ne squatter les sous-sols
Aucune oreille lui ferme les portes car elle a la clef d’sol

A force de cogiter j’réponds moi même a mes question
Sur Terre j’ai pas vu de paradis
Ma vie n’est pas une parodie
Triste réalité, triste est la mélodie
C'est triste et j’commence à m’y faire
Mais j’n’écoute pas ce que les gens disent
Mais j’n’écoute pas ce que les gens disent
Non je n'écoute pas ma vie c'est cette mélodie
Je puise toute ma force dans l’écriture depuis des décennies

Ma mélodie vient du 94310
Elle a connu la hass les galères pour 3 centimes
Puis elle a pris des prods forcement du poids dans le biz
Tôt au tard on le remarquera comme un quad en ville
J’écris mes albums avec mes tripes
Des flows techniques inédites toujours avec maitrise
J’veux qu’mon son soit ton compagnon d’galère il est fidèle au poste
Indomptable comme un camer
J’ai plus rien a prouver dans la musique j’ai tout fait
Fumer des kills de son temps en temps tu m’verre tousser
Elle respire la santé comme si elle avait 20 ans
N’accepte pas le proverbe qui dit que tout a un temps

A force de cogiter j’réponds moi même a mes question
Sur Terre j’ai pas vu de paradis
Ma vie n’est pas une parodie
Triste réalité, triste est la mélodie
C'est triste et j’commence à m’y faire

Des liens qui cassent, le cœur se lasse
Oh tu me disais ""il faut qu’on face
Nos vies, qu’on trace""
L’idée m’angoisse
Je viens te parler des choses qui fâchent
On se détache, le temps qu’on gâche
À regretter le passé, j’ai peur de tout manquer
De passer à côté

Je viens te parler du temps (qui passe)

Je n’ai pas vu le temps passer mais j’ai vu pousser mes rides
Cherchant des oasis dans des déserts arides
À trop guetter dans le retro j’ai perdu le fil
À en faire disparaitre l’amour un peu comme Copperfield
J’vois qu’au fil des nuits mes insomnies t’insupportent
Tu suffoques mais supportes quand claquent les portes
J’ai plus les idées claires à respirer dans la brume
Y’a que dans des nuages de fumée que j’y vois des claires de lunes
Yeah, au-dessus de ma dune
J’ai vu c’que l’homme était prêt à faire pour des thunes
Très peu d’études, pourtant j’ai eu l’choix
Entre les profs et la rue peux-tu trouver un peu de foi
Mais toutefois j’ai du cœur délicat un peu séducteur éduqué
J'ai compris tes peurs et t'aimer
Pour moi c’est le cas mais
J'suis aveugle comme un camé
Dans ma vie décalée
À croire que finalement j’ai pas fait tout ce qu'il fallait

De passer à côté

C’est à travers tes yeux que l’amour m’a fait un signe
Car les bonhommes ne causent que la langue des signes
Du temps j’perds, je t’observe
Ton regard de glace me renvoie le mal que j’t’assène
Et le ciel gronde, veut faire chavirer ma barque
À croire que Cupidon s’est empalé avec son arc
À bout de souffle, notre relation manque d’oxygène
Forcément quand ça dérape, c’est l’un ou l’autre qui gène
J’en garderai que des souvenirs, des bons, des mauvais
Au fond s’qui m’plaisait, c’était ta façon de m’aimer
Même pas le temps de crier ""Mayday!""
Que tu rappliques pour m’aider pour moi plaider
Je tombe, tu m’relèves, estompe mes colères
Pour toi c’est sommaire, ça joue sur ton sommeil
Ce qu’on a fait a donné raison à notre entourage
À construire un bateau sans tenir compte du naufrage

Paris, une terre d'accueil où sévit le deuil
Tu subis ça sans réagir à l'heure où la faux te cueille
À défaut de feuilles, j'roule mon seum dans des paraphrases
Au seuil de la mort, vois l'enfer si t'as pas la phrase
À qui mon cœur ici n'a jamais donné?
Dans cette vie d'infirme où le valide à peu d'chances de voler
Si j'ai dû voler, fauter, dû léser mes valeurs
C'est pour prouver que le crime paie, en apprécier la saveur
Noire est ma couleur, comme les rimes que je dégueule
J'ai vu l'crime me faire de l'œil quand la Crim' traçait le sol
Près d'la rosée où les béliers chantent à la place du coq
Chez moi, j'te rappelle qu'on te braque pas que pour du toc
Des cœurs en or, si, si, j'en ai croisés
Chassés-croisés entre voyous et jeunes mecs de cité
À force de rentrer sans toquer, on en devient toqués
Mais dans l'fond, on n'fait que reprendre c'que l'État nous a braqué

Donner c'est simple, juste un aller simple
Comme pardonner à ses ennemis sur le chemin de la guerre sainte
Génération fuck, où l'JB a remplacé l'absinthe
Et pour soporifique : deux mass', une clope et des enceintes
Vécu trop d'actions sur mon territoire, jeune bandit notoire
Du larcin au maniement d'armes, y'a si peu d'écart
J'ai vu des colossus gémir à la barre
Face à des peines phénoménales à rendre barjos la plupart
J'suis passé par les bars paros où ça défouraille
Où le courage se résume des fois qu'à quelques rails
La rue m'a proposé, pour elle, oui, j'ai disposé
Prédisposé à faire du sale, du bien étais dispensé
J'aurai vendu mon âme pour leur démontrer qui j'étais
Dépossédé les bras, violents tel un possédé
Mais l'temps m'a trompé, non stoppé, shooté à bout portant
Terrassant mes intouchables absents

Pas du genre Gorée, mais du genre où Bolloré s'endort
Marre de ces choré' pour esquiver les dek' aux abords
Comme des ballerines, on danse sur des bûchers, d'bâbord à tribord
À mon Val-de' j'ai tout donné
Mon âme et mon corps à la science, pour les quartiers bétonnés
Marquer l'Histoire comme Usain Bolt
9'4 secondes aux 100 quand les sirènes gueulaient ""Stop!""
J'ai délaissé le vice pour goûter la vie
Entrevu le soleil après la pluie
Mais dis-toi qu'Alice est morte dans le pays des pervers, dont Satan le perd
Ici comme ailleurs, on laisse tout derrière une fois sous terre

Et je suis pas forcément l'homme que je voulais devenir
Entre regrets et rêves inaboutis
Devant les aléas de la vie, je me fais tout petit
Je croupi dans l'oubli, mes soucis
Me coupent l'herbe sous les pieds, quitte à tout perdre
J'avancerai, si le contraire m'arriverait
Je ne saurais que faire de ma vie
Et j'ai du mal à faire du mal, du mal à faire du mal aux gens
Et, quand tu fais du bien, tu finis écrasé par les gens
Insatisfait, et ce depuis le jour où j'ai vu le jour à Lariboisière
Les vestes se tournent, on se voit sous un autre jour quand il y a du khaliss à faire
Mais est-ce vraiment ma nature ? Est-ce que je suis cette immonde créature?
Est-ce que je suis né pour l'échec ? Croulé sous les dettes et être abattu
Mais j'essaie et je me heurte à la réalité, renié malgré mes qualités
Du mal à prendre des décisions, un peu comme si j'étais habité
Si j't'écarte de ma vie, ce n'est pas inadéquat
Car il n'y a qu'au cimetière que les gens sont irremplaçables

Grandi avec une mère qui faisait seule le taf d'un binôme
J'me sens endetté, besoin de lui offrir tout un royaume
Pour ça, il y a pas de miracle, quoi qu'il arrive, faut pas que je chôme
Donc j'irai braver des océans sans craindre d'être noyé
Le futur m'effraie, la charge des gosses à mes frais
Conscient que le courage ne suffit pas pour exister

Tout mettre au frais pour leur offrir un avenir ou subsister

J'ai tenté souvent mais j'ai chuté
C'est comme si la chance du haut d'un toit me parachutait
On crie la misère mais on se tait devant les juges
Dans ce combat sans adversaires, je n'y voyais que le déluge

Ou des P4 devenir droit comme des fils de bourges
Ce qui faisait l’éloge des libertés préparer la guerre
A l'unanimité mettre des peuples au cimetière
Oui j'ai préparé les armes
Répéter mes gammes juste pour sécher mes larmes
Et si mes péchés se comptent en kilogramme
Il reste juste des mots a peser plus besoin de cellophane

Et pour l'atteindre il faut du temps
Ainsi moi je ne connais plus le sommeil
J'ai trop entendu : Laisse tombé!

Je te dis j'ai préparé toutes les armes

Dry,"La vie nous trompe, on est cocu, mais on l'aime quand même
On veut vivre des années, car quand on aime on n'compte pas
On s'laissera pas mourir, y'a trop d'bouches à nourrir
Le temps défile à toute vitesse, mais moi j'cours à mon rythme
Percer, c'est long mon frère et des fois c'est nuisible
Pour faire le blé, moi j'irai plus vite que la musique
Oui j'aime ce monde, j'suis dingue comme le mari d'une pute
J'ai beau faire des phases, dès fois j'vois qu'ma vie ne rime plus
D'ailleurs, fuck les jeux d'mots
J'préfère les jeux d'foot ou les jeux d'môme
J'suis comme cet ancien tueur qu'on traite de péquenot
J'préfère le silence, me taire que parler bêtement. Un
Pur produit bâtiment mes sapes sentent le ciment. J'vaux
Rien, on m'a dit gentiment sans faire de sentiment. J'm'en
Tape mon regard en dit long donc j'mets des lunettes noires
J'men tape de vos vies, me demandez pas d'être honnête. Moi
J'remercie Dieu d'être en vie, d'être père, d'être envié, ouais
Fier d'être entier, sans cassure, sans dentier
J'veux voir ma fille, son rire, ses dents d'lait lui dire
En tant qu'père que son sourire la rend belle
Belle comme sa mère, belle comme la mienne
Les seules personnes pour t'épauler dans c'monde si ça merde
M'en veut pas, si dès fois j'ai la tête ailleurs
Car dans mes rimes, j'y mets mon temps, mon sang, ma sueur
Moi, dans l'rap j'suis naufragé, j'ai connu toutes les vagues
De la Mafia au Wati B, ma voix résonnait dans les Fnac
Mais bref, j'attend toujours et Dieu sait qu'j'suis têtu
Depuis qu'on m'appelle l'Intouchable le mouvement lui s'est tu
En parlant d'Intouchable, j'crois que ce nom m'a porté l'œil
Mamad et L.A.S mon cœur est toujours en deuil
Avec du temps et quelques balles, peut-être ça m'passera
En tout cas personne vous remplacera
Ma gueule en plasma, on dirait qu'on m'a cloné
Mais à leur yeux j'ai plutôt l'air d'un clown que l'air de Clooney
Eh, j'ai l'cœur plié, froissé comme mon linge
Dans l'crâne c'est l'zoo quand j'l'ouvre t'entends le cris des singes
J'me dis des fois que la rue a fané, en elle j'n'y trouve plus de charme
Les p'tits adolescents ne respectent plus les gravons
Parce qu'ils sont grands en taille, pensent à avoir les bras longs
C'est pour mes karlouchs, mes arbouchs, mes manouches
Mes gars louches qui s'camouflent, prennent la mouche quand y'a la hnouch
Les chtars ont laissé des frères dans des sales états
Le regard vide, ça l'fait pas, rien qu'ils pétillent comme Salvetat
Les sales pétasses ont fait qu'y'a eu beaucoup de pétages d'emploi
Le pied est devenu la bédave, devant les juges les salles se comblent
La taule recrute, la mort aussi, y'a beaucoup d'candidats
Trop d'frères dans le banditisme, chez nous trop d'autodidactes
Amoureux d'la vie, on est fous, sado-masos
C'est ça dans ma zone, rien faire ce serait dommage, gros
Mon cerveau s'endommage trop, le shit m'a cramé des neurones
Je cherche toujours mon rôle, j'suis un bon acteur comme De Niro
Sauf que j'ai pas l'César
J'suis comme un enfant soldat qui laisse parler ses armes
Dans la course j'suis loin mais j'peux pas laisser ça
Les derniers seront les premiers, j'vais pas t'épargner, c'est ça
Ouais t'as pigé, c'est maintenant ou jamais
J'veux marquer les esprits comme Omar ou bien Jamel
J'avais besoin d'parler, j'ai trop été discret
Oui j'ai vu leurs disquettes, jamais tapé l'17
J'aimais taper l'bifteck que la Mama faisait
Maintenant j'vais chercher l'mien, mon épaule commence à peser
J'suis un homme de terrain, j'ai tout fait
J'ai fumé la vie sans crapoter et j'ai toussé
*Toussement* : j'ai toussé
J'ai pris des bras, car les portes, j'les ai poussées
Résultat des courses, j'm'accroche à mes bourses
Tel un ours polaire, mets des gifles salaces, donc laissez passer
Gros, j'étais la rue maintenant j'en suis qu'la voix
Mais ici on t'fait taire si tu l'ouvres trop comme Balavoine
Moi, j'pense à ma 'sique, j'pense à ma vie
J'pense à Many qui s'fait fumer par son meilleur ami
On danse le Mia, entre les ricochets
Par d'répit dans cette Dounia, même à l'heure d'raccrocher
Approchez, amateurs de sensations fortes
Demain si j'peux, gros, même sur Mars j'me téléporte
Dans un monde où tu vois clair que quand t'es ébloui
Laisse-moi juste fermer les yeux, espérant l'Paradis
Ici on part à dix pour finir tout seul
Mais où sera le réconfort de mes potes quand j'serai dans mon cercueil?
Les nuits d'deuil pour mon contigent, c'est l'quotidien
Si l'bonheur pense à moi j'le remercierai quand il vient
Mais vois, sur Terre l'homme s'habitue à tout
Aptitudes ou pas, attitude bad en bas des tours gros
Certains sont capables du meilleur comme du pire
Sauf que moi c'est dans l'pire que j'suis le meilleur
On s'shoote tous à l'adrénaline
Quitte à faire des O.D., nous jamais on déviera d'la ligne, gros
Ma ligne de mire n'est que le roro
Ou le diamant, pourquoi pas être à l'affiche dans un grand rôle?
Et comme tous mes textes sur papier
J'vais toucher l'monde, et l'intouchable enfin le palper
Saleté de vie, où l'on succombe à l'orgueil, à l'envie
Pour cet enfer, les gens s'tuent pour prolonger l'ennui
Toutes les nuits des altercations, des confrontations
Détonations quand mon père fait ses invocations
Aurai-je le temps d'dire adieu à mes fans?
À mes soces, tous mes frères qui noient mes mélodrames?
Vous remercier j'm'en lasserai jamais
Mais mieux vaut le faire maintenant que jamais",Sans arrêt,2013

Dry Branch Fire Squad,"He packed up his guitar
And drove Wednesday through Sunday
And sometimes played three shows a day
The modern lone rider, he dreamed of Ohio
And his doe-eyed Arabian bay
And how they'd go racing out on the hillside
In the cool closing twilight of day
Old friends together in thunderous freedom
Just the man and the wind and the bay.
Well, sometimes they'd ride down by the river
And the bay always stopped there to drink
In the still of the evening
The horse seemed contented
And the man used the time just to think.

And in the cold winds of winter
He's drawn to the barn
By some irresistable force
With carrots and a blanket
There's nothing more binding
Than the love of a man for his horse.

The call of the highway, how it would beckon
He kept going back out of course
And in the deep of the night
When the miles were the hardest
He just figured he drove for the horse.

And in all life's relations one thing stays the same
Never take more than you will repay
So we count the score even
'cause the miles he had driven
Were for miles that he rode on the bay.

They grew old together, got too old to ride
But just look at the seeds that they'd sowed
They'd walk out in the pasture, stand side by side
And stare off at the hills where they'd growed.

And of all God's creations here under heaven
There's many I can't understand
One beautiful mystery that I at least witnessed
Was the love of a horse for a man.

There the angels were crowded and the sisters would shout out

It was there he took the weight off my load
And he freely removed all my sorrow and strife

As he told how the father above
Gave his only son Jesus all the lost ones to save

Come to Jesus he'll lighten your load
So often he preached of the life giving bread
