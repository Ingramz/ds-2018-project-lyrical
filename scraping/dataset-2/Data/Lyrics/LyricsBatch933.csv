Rino Gaetano,"Essence benzina e gasolina
Soltanto un litro e in cambio ti do Cristina
Se vuoi la chiudo pure in monastero
Ma dammi un litro di oro nero

Ti sei fatto il palazzo sul Jumbo
Noi invece corriamo sempre appresso all'ambo
Ambo terno tombola e cinquina
Se vinco mi danno un litro di benzina

Spendi spandi spandi spendi effendi
Spendi spandi spandi spendi effendi
Spider coupè gitti alfetta
A duecento c'è sempre una donna che ti aspetta

Sdraiata sul cofano all'autosalone
E ti dice prendimi maschiaccio libidinoso coglione
Non più a gas ma a cherosene
Il riscaldamento centralizzato più ti scalda più conviene

Niente carbone mai più metano
Pace prosperità e lunga vita al sultano

Spendi spandi spandi spendi effendi",Spendi Spandi Effendi,1977
Rino Gaetano,"Cittadini lavoratori alle ore

Beneamato segretario sarà con noi
Ma che fortuna grazie alla luna

Capofortuna stasera è con noi

Dimentica i tuoi problemi imbarca i tuoi remi lui pensa per te
Inaugura mostre e congressi autostrade e cessi ferrovie e metrò
Sorride ai presenti commosso se punta sul rosso sa che vincerà

Se gioca a tressette è campione se fuma un cannone si sente un pascià
Reprime rivolte e sommosse e cura la tosse alle cinque col te
Sostiene già tesi avanzate e tutta l'estate la passa in tournée",Capofortuna,1978
Rino Gaetano,"E al mattino al mio risveglio 
Cerco in cielo gli aironi 
E il profumo bianco del giglio 
Cerco in tutte le canzoni 
E in un passero sul ramo 
Uno spunto per la rivoluzione
 
Cerco il filo di un ricamo 
Un accordo in la minore 
Per gridare forte t'amo 
Se ho degli attimi di rancore 
Cerco te e la tua bocca 
Nei tuoi occhi trovo amore 

Cerco la mia malattia 
In un bar e nelle carte 
La mia dannata periferia 
Cerco gli occhi di chi parte 
Di chi si ferma e chi va in fretta 
La sincerità nell'arte 

Cerco il punk in una lametta 
La felicità ed il dolore 
Nel fumo di una sigaretta 
Se ho degli attimi di rancore 
Cerco te e la tua bocca 
Nei tuoi occhi trovo amore",Cerco,1978
Rino Gaetano,"Dans le châtaeau
Qu'on aperçoit sur la montagne
Tellement macabre

Oui, je viens bientot
Je viens pourquoi? Parce que

Rino Gaetano,"Gianna, Gianna, Gianna sosteneva, tesi e illusioni
Gianna, Gianna, Gianna prometteva, pareti e fiumi
Gianna, Gianna aveva un coccodrillo e un dottore
Gianna non perdeva neanche un minuto per fare l'amore

Ma la notte la festa è finita, evviva la vita
La gente si sveste, comincia un mondo
Un mondo diverso, ma fatto di sesso, chi vivrà vedrà

Gianna, Gianna, Gianna non cercava il suo pigmalione
Gianna difendeva il suo salario dall'inflazione
Gianna, Gianna, Gianna non credeva a canzoni o UFO
Gianna aveva un fiuto eccezionale per il tartufo

Si potrebbe andare a Stoccolma 

Tutti insieme ma andiamo a Stoccolma 
Tutti insieme ma con calma 

Sulla nave che porta a Stoccolma 
Donne bionde con fiori e ghirlande 
Tanti dischi tante bande 

Dai andiamo a Stoccolma 
Dove se mangi stai colma 
Dove potrai dire con calma 
Io sto colma a Stoccolma 

Sulle strade che vanno a Stoccolma 
Non c'è buche né fango né melma 

Sulle strade di Stoccolma 
Noi viviamo in un mondo di melma 
Dove ogni mattina è una salma 
Quindi andiamo a Stoccolma

Rino Gaetano,"Il cavallo con più rabbia galoppava fuori porta 
E lasciava il suo ricordo nella nebbia 
Le persiane ormai serrate inventavano la notte 
Solo il fiume vomitava I suoi rifiuti 
Vacche stanche di muggire proponevano sbadigli 
Hanno ancora tanta nebbia da smaltire 
È già l'ora è puntuale intrasento il suo profumo 
Sono già le otto, ora legale 

La troverò sopra il mare
Sulle labbra la potrò baciare 
Là arriverò quando è sera 
Quando il sole tramonta in riviera 
Vecchi gozzi alla deriva si preparano alla pesca 
Con le reti rattopate nella stiva 

L'onda avanza a passi nani, agonistica col molo 
Mentre il vento già scommette coi gabbiani 
È il crepuscolo sul mare rosso, il cielo va a brunire 
E qualcuno si avvicina alle lampare 
È già l'ora, è puntuale intravedo il suo profumo 
Sono già le otto, ora legale 

La troverò sopra il mare 
Sulle labbra la potrò baciare
Là arriverò quando è sera 
Quando il sole tramonta in riviera 
La troverò sopra il mare
Sulle labbra la potrò baciare 
Là arriverò quando è sera 
Quando il sole tramonta in riviera",Anche Questo E Sud,1979
Rino Gaetano,"Io scriverò se vuoi 
Perché cerco un mondo diverso 
Con stelle al neon e un poco d'universo 

Mi sento un eroe a tempo perso 
Io scriverò se vuoi 
Perché non ho incontrato mai 
Veri mattatori e veri ombrellai 

Ma gente capace di chiederti solo come stai 
Io scriverò se vuoi 
Perché ho amato tutti i sessi 
Ma posso garantirvi che io 
Non ho mai dato troppo peso al sesso mio 

Ma con chiunque sappia divertirsi mi salverò 
Che viva la vita senza troppo arrichirsi,mi salverò 
Che sappia amare, che conosca Dio come le sue tasche 
Io scriverò perché ho vissuto anche di espedienti 
Perché a volte ho mostrato anche i denti 
Perché non potevo vivere altrimenti 

Io scriverò sul mondo e sulle sue brutture 
Sulla mia immagine pubblica e sulle camere oscure 
Sul mio passato e sulle mie paure",Io Scrivero,1979
Rino Gaetano,"Brutta pasta 
È il problema mio 
Fatta a posta è la via 
Ma con gli anni, gli inganni, sai superarli potrò 

Spesso il gioco è più basso che non immagini io 
Sempre il gioco è la vita mia che poi finirà 
Ma se c'è Dio, ci sono anch'io, buon Dio lo sai 
E c'è Dio di notte ti sento ci sei 

Di che pasta sei fatta amore, che animale sei 
Su che tasto suoniamo noi, per creare il poi 
Ma se il gioco è più basso, no no no, non è più il mio 
Tuttavia il coraggio che ho, te lo verserò 

Ma se c'è Dio, ci sono anch'io
Buon Dio lo sai 
E c'è Dio, di notte ti sento, ci sei 
Ma se c'è Dio, ci sono anch'io
Buon Dio lo sai 
E c'è Dio di notte ti sento
Ti voglio, ci sei",Ma Se C'E Dio,1979

Rino Gaetano,"E su sei sempre il più e giù sei un uomo in più
E su sei sempre tu e giù non ci sei più
Dalla mia casa in mezzo al verde vedevo palme e bambù
E giù sei un uomo in più

Avevo un'automobile che sfiorava i centotre
E su sei come un re
Partimmo di mattina soli io e lei
E giù tu non ci sei
Che lei mi amava si vedeva dagli occhiali fumè
E su sei sempre un re

Ma facendo l'amore puoi stare anche giù
Perché facendo l'amore su e giù sei sempre su
E su sei sempre il più e giù sei un uomo in più
Attraversammo spiagge strade preti e gruppi di gays
E giù tu non ci sei

C'era un uomo che imitava lo stoccafisso flambè
Su e giù proprio come te
E conquistava la sua donna facendo il verso del cucù
E noi lo sbattiamo giù

E già come da noi

Perché facendo l'amore su e giù sei sempre su",Su E Giu,1979
Rino Gaetano,"Femminile profumata elegante dolce bella e generosa
Estroversa un po' truccata ottimista intelligente e misteriosa
La donna mia

Mentre il tempo passava sulla nostra età
Mentre mille canzoni finivano già
Mentre il sole d'autunno pigro si svegliava

Fra me e te un mattino qualcosa nasceva
C'era aria di festa e fra i colori anche il blu
Forse c'era dell'altro ma c'eri anche tu
Le auto piene di gente che rideva
E le cose cattive solo nei films che si vedeva

Scusa Mary scusa Mary
Ma eravamo innamorati più che mai

C'era il dopoguerra e c'era anche il boom
Mentre il tempo passava sulla nostra età

E un negro di nome Martin che hanno ammazzato

Tutto questo però c'è lo hanno raccontato
Venne il sessant'otto e poi le barricate
Mentre sempre l'autunno era più caldo dell'estate

E mentre i Beatles si sciolgono dopo Let it be
In Grecia Papadopulos balla il sirtaki

Scusa Mary scusa Mary
Ma eravamo innamorati più che mai

Domenica senza macchina per l'austerità
Mentre il tempo passava sulla nostra età
Louis Armstrong e Neruda non ci sono più

Rino Gaetano,"Ad esempio a me piace la strada
Col verde bruciato, magari sul tardi
Macchie più scure senza rugiada
Coi fichi d'India e le spine dei cardi

La donna nel nero del lutto di sempre
Sulla sua soglia tutte le sere
Che aspetta il marito che torna dai campi

Ma come fare non so
Si devo dirlo ma a chi
Se mai qualcuno capirà
Sarà senz'altro un altro come me

Ad esempio a me piace rubare
Le pere mature sui rami se ho fame
Ma quando bevo sono pronto a pagare
L'acqua, che in quella terra e' più del pane

Camminare con quel contadino
Che forse fa la stessa mia strada
Parlare dell'uva, parlare del vino
Che ancora è un lusso per lui che lo fa

Ma come fare non so
Sì devo dirlo ma a chi
Se mai qualcuno capirà
Sarà senz'altro un altro come me

Ad esempio a me piace per gioco
Tirar dei calci ad una zolla di terra
Passarla a dei bimbi che intorno al fuoco
Cantano giocano e fanno la guerra

Poi mi piace scoprire lontano
Il mare se il cielo è all'imbrunire
Seguire la luce di alcune lampare
E raggiunta la spiaggia mi piace dormire

Che è fatto di libertà

Che non approvava il progetto del metrò

L'ascensore lì non c'è

Sotto una vecchia sequoia 
Ballava il samba e cantava per me

In un armadio provava il suo show 
Teneva un quiz a puntate 
E chiuso tutta l'estate restò

Il caimano distratto 
Imitava il gatto e faceva bau bau 
Perchè studiava le lingue 
E voleva alle cinque il suo tè

Tu non sei un emiro in gilet 
Mi consigliò senza imbroglio 
Di non bere petrolio alle tre

Perché non sanno ciò che fanno 
Ed i parlamentari ladri 
Che sicuramente lo sanno
 
Beata è la guerra
Chi la fa e chi la decanta 
Ma più beata ancora 
È la guerra quando è santa 

Beati i bambini 
Che sorridono alla mamma
Beati gli stranieri 
Ed i soufflé di panna

Beati sono i frati
Beate anche le suore 
Beati i premiati 
Con le medaglie d'oro 

Beati i professori
Beati gli arrivisti 
I nobili e i padroni 
Specie se comunisti 

Beata la frontiera 
Beata la finanza 
Beata è la fiera 
Ad ogni circostanza 

Beata la mia prima donna 
Che mi ha preso ancora vergine 
Beato il sesso libero 
Sì ma entro un certo margine 

Beati i sottosegretari 
I sottufficiali 
Beati i sottaceti 
Che ti preparano al cenone 
Beati i critici e gli esegeti 
Di questa mia canzone",Le Beatitudini,2003

Come un sogno di follie venduto all'asta

Rino Gaetano,"Mentre la notte scendeva stellata stellata 
Lei affusolata nel buio sognava incantata 

E chi mi prende la mano stanotte mio dio 
Forse un ragazzo il mio uomo o forse io 

Lontana la quiete e montagne imbiancate di neve 
E il vento che soffia, che fischia più forte e più greve 

E che mi sfiora le labbra, chi mi consola 
Forse un bambino gia grande o io da sola 

Passava la notte, passavano in fretta le ore 
La camera fredda già si scaldava d'amore 

Chi troverà i miei seni avrà in premio il mio cuore 
Chi incontrerà i miei semi avrà tutto il mio amore 

La luce discreta spiava e le ombre inventava 
Mentre sul mare una luna dipinta danzava 

Chi coglierà il mio fiore bagnato di brina 
Un principe azzurro o forse io adulta io bambina 

Mentre la notte scendeva stellata stellata 
Lei affusolata nel buio dormiva incantata 

Chi mi dirà buonanotte stanotte mio dio 
La notte le stelle la luna o forse io",Sei Ottavi,2010
Rino Gaetano,"Esta es la historia verdadera de sombrero 
Caballero de la pampa 
Amigo del pueblo, amigo de Dio
Ándale manito hermano con coraje y corazón 

Nacque già sopra un cavallo 
Aveva un fucile ed un mantello nero 
Lo chiamano Pedro Felippe 
Però per la gente è solo Sombrero 
Teneva timore de Dios 
E il pelo cortato e il cuore caliente 
Viveva sempre da solo 
Col suo sombrero ma amava la gente 
E sparava correva rideva giocava 

Cantava una canzone 
Una storia di sangue e una storia d'amore 
Quando sparava era fermo 
La mano sicura puntava al cuore 
Rubava ma solo per dare 
La roba del ricco al povero nero 
Nessuno l'ha mai incontrato 
Ma ogni peone ama solo sombrero 
E sparava correva giocava barava 

Forse cercava un amigo 
Una birra un mantello o chissà che altra cosa 
Si seppe molto più tardi 
Sombrero cantava e cercava una sposa 
Sembra che erano in dieci 
Quel giorno a seguire nella pampa sombrero 
Un colpo di fuoco nel cuore 
Spezzò la vita del caballero 
Che amava soffriva rideva moriva 

Nessuno l'ha visto morire 
Per questo la gente sa che non è vero 
Negli occhi di chi ha sofferto 
C'è una speranza un amico sombrero 
E cantando le sue canzoni 
Le storie di sangue le storie d'amore 
Anche se lui non c'è più 
Ha lasciato al paese un po' del suo cuore",Sombrero,2010
Rino Gaetano,"A te che sogni una stella ed un veliero 
Che ti portino su isole dal cielo più vero 
A te che non sopporti la pazienza 
O abbandonarti alla più sfrenata continenza 

A te che hai progettato un antifurto sicuro 
A te che lotti sempre contro il muro 
E quando la tua mente prende il volo 
T'accorgi che sei rimasto solo 

A te che ascolti il mio disco forse sorridendo 
Giuro che la stessa rabbia sto vivendo 
Siamo sulla stessa barca io e te

A te che odi i politici imbrillantinati 
Che minimizzano i loro reati 
Disposti a mandare tutto a puttana 
Pur di salvarsi la dignità mondana 

A te che non ami i servi di partito 
Che ti chiedono il voto, un voto pulito 
Partono tutti incendiari e fieri 
Ma quando arrivano sono tutti pompieri

If you ain't got no dough

If you ain't got no hos
Then what you here for?
If you ain't got no smoke
Then what you here for?
If you ain't sittin on chrome
Keep it rollin, keep it movin

I'm here to get them sevens on twentys, more guns than cash
Blunts than hash, be glad I ain't down to my last
I turn to a different person, face under the mask
Or either out on the grind or I'm up in some ass
Gettin them hos, fuck that, I'm gettin that dough
And stackin it up, a nigga front, I'm slappin him up
Backin him up, beef ain't no patchin it up
I'm clappin you up, while morticians wrappin you up
I'm laughin it up wit hos that be happy to fuck
Packed in my truck, passin up a half of a dutch
I'm slappin they butts, can't wait to get them back to the hut
I'm here for Other People Money nigga, that's what's up

Old deal, slash by and competitive type
I'm better than Mike, the Jordans is up in the shelf
Next to a few rings and a couple of belts
Got a black widow chick, she be lovin me well
You could hate me, shit, cause I'm lovin myself
A glutton for wealth, these young niggaz fuckin they health
All excited over pussy, like it's somethin to sell
y'all dudes is geeks, y'all really don't influence the streets
The streets influence the slang that you fluently speak
Confusin to me, tryna be somethin your not
When them slugs pop you the one duckin them shots
I go hard like them youngins that be huggin the block
I go hard like Humphrey wit a glove and a glock
I'm somethin ya not, quite frankly you could love it or not
Certified number one nigga up in your spot

A'yo remember Candy? White too dope camry
Big booty wit the small panties
Used to smuggle yay' for the homie Randy
Got the plushed out crib off the water in Miami
She almost had me, I was gone off the fatty
In love wit the way she called me daddy
Had she, known about the city where I'm from
And I ain't goin home til my bankrole's done
Motherfucker's think pimpins for fun
I ain't done til my greenery's weighin a ton
And we could smoke big weed, just lay in the sun
Hellafied when we ride, weed makin me buzz

Rio Jazz Orchestra,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

For love that can, not live yet never dies.

Demasiado bueno para ser verdad
Tan bonita, tan coqueta, tan sensual
Qué casualidad que solo así conmigo,
Solo así conmigo

Me decías amor
Yo no soy así esta noche fue especial
Normalmente tardo años en llegar
A entregarme como me entregue contigo
Me entregue contigo

Prometías que jamás te irías
Me decías que eras solo mía
Me jurabas que era lo mejor de tu vida

Y un día vi
Que no solo me decías eso a mí
Que tus labios eran míos y de otros mil
Que tenía razón mi corazón, esas noches que dudo de ti
Tengo que aceptar que yo lo presentí
Pero fue terrible cuando descubrí
Que con todo el mundo siempre eres así
Tan linda, entregada y tan fácil

No te culpo, no
Eso es algo que se trae por vocación
La necesidad te llama la atención
Así eres no te juzgo mas me despido, me despido

Me acerque y sudandome las manos, invente algo que hablar para ver mover tus labios
Y lo demás ya lo sabes y sobrando
Pero no sabes que yo sabia, lo presentía desde ese día

Y mira así te adiviné, ya eres parte de mi vida
Y acerté cuando dije seras mía
No lo grite, solamente lo pensé con tantas fuerzas
Que el mismo universo de seguro me ayudo

Y adiviné que soñabas como niña y eras una gran mujer
Pero lejos me quede cuando creí que solamente te querría
Me falto imaginación pues hoy te amo
Y ya te quiero para toda la vida

Fue tu manera de mirar, de reír y respirar
Lo que me hizo alucinar y enamorarme al final

You left me, without a warning, yes you did,
You know I, need you so much, so much.

This is what I get for being true.
This is what I get, for taking all you put me through.
But I'd do it again, 'cause I'm still in love with you.

Now I'm alone, and I got those teardrops in my eyes.
I told myself, this would happen, many times before.
Now I find myself, looking at the world, face down to the floor.
This is what I get for loving you.

Riot,"They all, were losers,
And none had a dime.
And they all drew pictures,
Of what was stored in their minds.
Questions and answers,
Filled with fables and rhymes.
Headed west was a '49er,
To stake his new shrine.
Some never made,
Their dreams come to life.
Many men fell,
From a gun or a knife.
They grew old and weary,
And ashamed,
Of the stories they told,
And the wealth that they gained.
But the road, was a rough one,
Wind and hills were their foe.
And no man, was a low man,
They were too young to know.
Headed west was a 49er,
Get rich quick, live life finer.
On and on and on, the story goes.
Some never made,
Their dreams to life.
Many men fell,
From a gun or a knife.
They grew old and weary,
And ashamed,
Of the stories they told,
And the wealth that they gained.
Now rich man, and poor,
Aren't equal to one.
And they follow the stars,
Once the journey's begun.
Shines the gleam, in their eye,
And the song in their heart.
If the land don't shred his mind,
It'll tear his soul apart.

When the moon is black
Never turn your back
On the castle walls

The suite of armor shines
Through the ruins of time
I can hear them call

Mountain is burning
The seasons are turning
It's time now we planned our attack

A medieval call
That's right for us all
Now there is no turning back

A rise with the sun
Is fashionably done
Driving them into the sea

A medieval fall
A death to us all
We must win this one victory

Take me higher
Burning your way through the night

Take me higher
The battle is ragging in flight
You'll have victory on wings of fire

I horde invasions
The battle it rages
Long into the night

The warrior is falling
His destiny calling
His blood drained from his mortal life

The castles afire
Flames breathing higher
Buning a hole in the sky

His brother must fall
Freedom for all
Shouting out one victory call

Like a storm, from inside
Like thunder from a friendly sky

Though I can see you, through your disguise
My souls in prison, I'm locked up in chains

Fewer still who remember why
They ain't still ready to fight but I've had the world
At my feet
And I know it's right

Feel the kiss of twisted metal
Like a drink running hot in my veins

So I'm sending my foot to the floor

Looks to me you can't go home again
So I'm riding alone
Maybe the lights are on - but nobody's home

So long to my brothers
Later on once again you're left behind
Are you lashed to the mast
Or will you drown in the chair
Where I found you last ?

And the velvet shimmering limousines
Like a kiss from the queen of the damned

And cool summer rain soaked the land

Meanwhile to the east and again to the north
Shiva awaits in the sand
Smooth as leather - unchained by the blade
A face made of stone will remain
Who will remember the love that we made
And hand writes a word and the word is genocide

Kill not your enemy
Love not your friend

One in ten survive
Cries of the damned flood the land
Another leader more dead than alive
With innocent blood on his hand
Gunfire by dayligth - murder by night
Run to the hills on the voyage of your past
Memories faded by night
Nowhere to go so they learn how to dance
Their hands speak of days left behind
Your murderer's your saviour by strange circumstance
A lesson in lies for the children of the damned

To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds

ペテン師が天使演じる別天地に
うずまいてる雑音クラクション
プラスとマイナスとゼロ
散らぱったバスワードそろえろ！
ヒント見てピンときてビンゴ！
キラッと光って「パンパカパーン」
ペパーミントの香る頃、
心が咲くでしょう、
つむじから咲かせましょう。
今 この時もそのために
あるサブリミナル。
咲いた あざやかな五色の光線
咲いた 満ちあふれ出す光合成
咲いた 春夏秋冬 季節こえ
花咲く世界の Future Punk
咲いた 火照る大陽に焦がされ
咲いた オシベメシベ交われ
咲いた 咲き乱れて幸あれ
花咲く世代の Future Funk 咲いた
僕らはどうやら暗い夜に
そっと咲いちまったアサガオ
でもお花畑は広いし、
面白い、心地よい、
苛立ちもしょぼい。
向こう側での出来事
こそこそ隠れる退屈なゲイ
すぐさじ投げ、うそ泣きなゲーム
現実がシンキロウな例だね。

Rip Slyme,"愛があれば
全て許されると思ってるでしょ
乗せられては また踊らされてる
もうズルいじゃん

君のことで
聞きたいことがあるのに
未だ まともに聞けない
無垢な笑顔 それが手なの?
悪魔なのか? 天使なのか?
ズルいよ 全てがわからないよ
幻みたいな天使が笑う
風に吹かれて胸が騒ぐ
気づいたときには全てをさらう
君のホントの心探す
ただのボタンの掛け違い?
いつまでだってすれ違う
わからないままにのまれて行くだけ
また会える
愛さえあれば
幸せになれると信じてるでしょ
騙されては また泳がされてる
もうズルいじゃん
でも それがいいの
うん それでいい
そう そこがいいの

怖くて 踏み込めない
許すことしか 探ることしか
できないなら 飛び越えない
壊したくない 雪解けは遠くても

ほっといたら消えちゃいそう
物欲し気にアピール中
突っ込んだら逃げちゃいそう
落ちそうで 落ちなくて
イケそうで イケナイ関係

翻弄されるがままね
鏡に映る様に 逆サイにブレる想い
本能の赴くままね

Ripcordz,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1988

You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Where do they all belong?

Of a sermon that no one will hear

We so foul and profound
Blowouts, CD's sold out, the illest no doubt
When ""Celph Titled"" roll out, immaculate respect

""Uzi's"" and ""Tek's"" protect your neck with a teflon turtleneck
Bitch there ain't a diesel cat that could face me
You don't really want to run your mouth and make me
Summon the gods with my mystery chant

And perform the running-man for my victory dance
Murder motherfuckers mostly over money with guns to they tummies
Hollow-tips that leave you stiffer than a mannequin dummy
Record a demo while the ""Demigodz"" make new songs

Your better off running the triathlon with parachutes on
A real bug-nigga, and that's how I'm better known
You make beats, I'd rather rhyme to a metronome
Other crews got ego's but can't floss right
I'll run them over have em' smoking the exhaust pipe

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

Already proved that all my rhymes are wicked enough
They sleep when you on the mic your fucking ""Jigglypuff""
A big kid jail-fuck, I don't want to grow up
And I don't care what he says yo he can suck a know what

I'm bigger than that, smile when you kicking my raps
Have conversations with your girl while she sits on my lap
Yo stop talking about they girls man it's starting to get old
Well, um, no tell they girls to stop leaving they clothes

The reason I flow, is not to just get us indoors
Pops in barber shops like my son is better than yours
'Cause and effect, ""Rise"" is the effect and the cause
All those who came before I just perfected they flaws

Perfect with clause I have to be look at my town
Neglecting the laws of gravity, I'm not coming down
There's cops on the ground, that look like dots on a map
From the level of where I'm at when I'm dropping, you whack

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

I rock rhymes that blow ends, drop lines like gold friends
Pull dimes that start trends, while your trying to make amends
Your girls be like you want it, all fives and no tens
Actually the wrong one, you bust with small guns

I look like an MC who murders the spot
Like ""Derek Jeter"" looks like a smaller version of ""The Rock""
Bitch please, I never ever met a dick-tease
I'm so cool that when I spit free's my spit freeze

""Old Yeller"", I'm known to leave a fella
With more cuts and scratches than the ""Shook One's"" acapella
You want to fuck around with ""Esoteric""
And blown on some bullshit like working-dice-credit

When rappers try, they usually step and die
Then MC's get the message like a number I don't recognize
Your call her back, pop minds they hear me freestyle
And spend the next seven days hittin' redial

Well well well well well well
Hey yeah ay ya ya

I keep the planet under my spell, under my reign
I stay on tracks, while throwing rappers under the train
I'm numbing your brain, stunning you while tonguing your dame
I appreciate her, everything that's under her brain

When reciting it's lighting with thunder and rain
A ""Demigod"" that's beyond your small blundering brains
Fortunate fame, really it's just one in the same
That I obtain while your still a bum begging for change

Trying to front like your new and really nothing has changed
You ain't underground, your locked in a dungeon with chains
Your not a thug 'cause' you rock your little ""Lugz"" and a chain
I'm a slug, nah fuck that, I'm double the pain

Your hussling game is lame, couple bucks and a name
Maybe some buckets of champagne with sluts in the range
I'll fuck with your brain and flex so your muscles are strained
Until your nothing but a punk clutching crutches and canes

Judas did it for the money and so do these world leaders
They cheat us like George Bush at the polls
They hearts must be cold like the winds of the poles
Either that or they lack soul spilling red blood for black gold
Human sacrifice, make me wonder bout nine eleven
What they doin' in the heavens on that space station
And we buggin off grand theft auto
For the PlayStation, what you got faith in
The book of revelations, or media publication
If you ask certain people they all fabrication
Congratulations, to anyone who found they life's purpose
The earth is perfect but the world is flawed
Mistakes are a part of life just learn from yours
They making weapons out of germs for war
AIDS bombs straight through your front door
And I'm sure they got a cure, what they hiding it for?
I've learned greed is a whore with abcess sores
I wouldn't go in her raw, or even touch her
Up in hell's kitchen trying to get a little supper
Hunger pains is a mother, but whatever don't kill us make us tougher

I'm out for presidents to represent me
And I ain't talking bout Bush, he got paper cause his fam is crooks
Man they push more weight then Jay-Z
Off the books and Dick Cheney stay in beef like P, caught in a jux
So felonious, masonic monks and I ain't talking bout Thelonious
Look at the signs, study the times
To make the stock market climb the army get on the grind
Punks jump up in a war get creamed like calomine
On the blocks youths slang rocks like kids in Palestine
It's all unraveling like a dutch, pal o' mine
Get your shit straight, cause death spreads quicker than hate
Gossip in the hood or see-I's upstate
Kid it's easy to get busted down, trusting in clowns
Don't trust every body cause their flesh is brown
I seen devils darker than Wes Snipes banging them pipes
Sixteen heated rounds like a heavy-weight fight
Taking the life of the innocent, scandalous place we livin' in
Tuff love, making plans with omnipotent
Cause we true soldiers, and gettin' older
I got a queen who got my back lifting the world off my shoulders
It's all about family, once you start overstanding me
They can't control us........................................

From the cradle to the time that your able to watch cable
My fam pray to save you my son these are the days you
Oughta cherish, with faults greater than our merits
We launch assaults from which the salt of the earth could perish
Mostly over which parrish or mosque you attend
Why let religion tear us apart we all men
Or are we the worst kind of animals?
Lifeless mechanical, selfish tyrannical
Like their leader, with heaters aimed for the slaughter
Powerful because he has the same name as his father
Both engaging, in insider trading and nepotism
They so concerned with the weapons system
When will the lesson hit them
There's only so much atmosphere around this astral sphere
So if your blasting there something will happen here
Thunder claps the air, poison gas that's clear
Invades our oxygen, venomous toxins in
Your blood like bites from venomous moccasins
Men have been talking in, riddles for too long
Proving who's strong not planning to move on
We used Saddam to bruise Iran
Confusion ensued to who we'd choose to bomb
Conducting operas, fuck giving choppers ta'
Them cats who's gats are now busting shots at ya'
They trying to topple your regime, the gestapo with the cream
Got plots to cop nukes from russian mafia
By who's poll is George Bush popular?
That's not my leader cheater never would have fought for ya'
You just the lesser of two evils
Who both want the first holocaust since Hitler called jews evil
Why do people need biological weapons
They must want to get in final conflict armmagedon

So high that they broke

Will you fear these empty fairytales
Or will you believe them?

You better pray
That this sleeping giant never wakes

If we just take a step back
A bigger picture we might view
Perhaps the man in the gutter
Is not so different from you

Come in, all of the cold
Forget all that you know
Because there's always been room
By the fire for you, oh
Come in, all of the cold

Rise Against,"I watched the rise and the fall of the common man
I lived to see your steps walk back
I watched the walls all crash down, crumbling
Just to be rebuilt while we slipped

We threw suds in the oceans winding
We promised peace but the peace won’t last
‘Cause now we forged new brakes so nervously
Waiting for this harmony to pass

I stand guard and roam
Like a sentinel
I see it all

I’ve been awake too long
Wish there was something that could close my eyes
To all that I see
Awake too long
It would be easier to fall asleep

We fell in love but the love kept running out
We follow roads but the roads all end
We lived and learned, and learned to live without
Falling from the matters we assemble

I’ve seen the eyes of the widows left behind
I’ve seen the child of a violent man
And never once did our leaders apologize
For battles they began

I can’t look away, or pretend not to see
And so I say

I’ve been awake too long
Wish there was something that could close my eyes
To all that I see
Awake too long
It would be easier to fall asleep

Asleep

Maybe I would dream if I could sleep
Maybe I’d see what this could be
Instead of what you know
And is there bliss in ignorance?
Is this our demise we can’t prevent?
Should we fall asleep?

Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate.
Learn to let go, learn to walk away.

True colors shining through,
As we are stripped of our exteriors.

No siento nada por ti

Y he esperado tanto tiempo
He pensado en tanto tiempo
Que he perdido, que he perdido

Ni tu cuerpo junto al mío
Ya no recuerdo hoy tus besos mujer

De lo que pude aclarar

Sniff a line/ Conquering Lion/ 225th in line/ If we say
We're ""Pro-War""/ Only in the fight for peace/ Man, that
Means no war/ Think the price of life is cheap?/ But
We're saying ""No More""/ Righteous recognize the beast/
Fireman'll baptize/ Burn 'em the light and heat/ Forward
To the power in a phrase like/ ""Acts Of God""/ Prophet
Said he saw the flood waters rise/ And the flow was hard/
I was really shocked to see/ The truth was exposed as hard/
While the media was focused/ On the words by Kanye/ What
Was it I just heard the President's Mom say?/ People here
Are frustrated/ Still got a long way/ Fed up but remember/
Self Destruction is the wrong way

Too much ratat.../ Keep it pon lock if you're gonna use one/
(Remember that)/ Ratat.../ Strictly self defense or for
Revolution/ (Remember that)

They think I'm crazy/ But di tables have to turn/ They
Think I'm crazy/ But di fya have to burn/ They think
I'm crazy/ But di children have to learn/ They think
I'm crazy/ Wow, wow, oh

Rakaa tell dem seh fi bun dem, bun dem, bun dem, bun dem,

It's Dilated with the Prophet/ Capleton the Fireman/
Visions of the future's clear/ Reign Of Fire in his hand/
Crown Prince Rakaa/ Preacher's son with a higher plan/
Coconut and carrot chalice/ Looking for the kaya man/
Babylon is vexed with us/ They should read Exodus/ Moses
And the burning bush/ Incense in Leviticus/ Lamb's Bread
Sacrament/ Check out 1st Corinthians/ Shipped of to
America/ All through the Caribbean/ No it's not an
Accident/ Gangbangin and the dope/ Guns and crack are
Lynching youth/ Swinging from a hangman's rope/ Addicts
Wanna shoot up/ Pop pills/ Wanna drink and toke/
Automatics spit hot/ You can still se the smoke

Rita Chiarelli,"Oh, God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son""
Abe said, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on""
God said, ""No"" Abe say, ""What?""
God say, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me comin', you better run""
Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?""
God said, ""Out on Highway 61""

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run""
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61""

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61""",Highway 61 Revisited,1992
Rita Chiarelli,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord

And buddy, that was good enough for me

Stay away too long and I can't do without you

But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy

I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Rita Coolidge,"They said, ""What do you think you would do
If she told you that she'd been untrue?""
I'd say, ""I won't say I won't be sorry, no.
It sure was love while it lasted.""
They said, ""How will you feel deep inside
When the love you believed in has died?""
I ain't sayin' it won't hurt me
It sure was love while it lasted
I'll be livin off of the good times
That you've given me to face

Rita Coolidge,"Like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
and by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
he said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
she cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Rita Coolidge,"Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby, you're my flame

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy-o don't you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his Missus,
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle

What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever,1972
Rita Coolidge,"She's a little bit of the sunshine
Just before the rain
A little like this quiet night
Before the cold winds came
She's a little bit like the weather

And a whole lot of my pain

[Chorus:]
Whiskey, whiskey my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Milk of mercy please be kind
Drive this feeling from my mind

Don't you know, somehow her smile
Can make the day begin
She'd take away this mask of grey
And let the sun shine in
Now I find I've been blinded
By the cold and wintery wind
She disguised behind her eyes
Oh what a fool I've been

Rita Coolidge,"You ask me if I'm happy now
That's good as any joke I've heard
It seems that since I've seen you last
I done forgot the meaning of the words
If happiness is empty rooms
And drinkin' in the afternoon
Well I suppose I'm happy as a clam
But if it's got a thing to do
With smilin' of forgettin' you
Well I don't guess that I could say I am

Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper
He's been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from comin' through
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come true
That's the way that I've been feelin' since the day I started falling

From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learnin' hard to live with losin' you
You wonder if I'm better off
With freedom now to do the things I choose
With all my times my own and
I got nothin' left but sleepin' time to lose
There's no one here to carry on
If I stay out the whole night long
or give a tankerous damn if I don't call
I'm livin' like I wanted to
And doin' things I want to do
And nothin' means a thing to me at all

They met along the highway to Aomeri where danger in the forest loomed
Shashiko dressed in silks and dreamed of heroes
She was carried in a hammock draped and veiled
Her father was a cruel and brutal warlord who fearful kept her in a shell
Seito he was but a lowly servant but his master knew him to be true and brave
When he happened on the scene of her education he sent her captors to their graves
Seito guarded Sashiko to her palace he had no thought of ransom to conceal
She took him in and washed his cuts and bruises and laid him softly down to sleep
When morning came she rose to tell her father
Of the stranger who had ruined the kidnap plot
But jealous and enraged her father seized him and chained him in the dungeon dark
Sashiko's tears flowed like the river Edo as she pleaded Seito's freedom face to floor
But the warlord turned his back and would not hear her

Rita Coolidge,"I have never loved a lady
Never touched no silken knee
Macon baby, you drove me crazy
You were so easy to me

Lay me down in Georgia pine cones
Whisper to me through the trees
You're the one I always dream of
You're the only one I see

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer holds the answer
Only you can set me free

Never see your face in sunlight
Moonlight sends you straight to me
You never even got my name right
You were so easy to me

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer give me the answer
Only you can set me free

Slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer give me the answer

",Slow Dancer,1998
Rita Coolidge,"I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste
A flannel for my face
Pyjamas, a hairbrush
New shoes and a case
I said to my reflection
Let's get out of this place
Past the church and the steeple
The laundry on the hill
Billboards and the buildings
Memories of it still
Keep calling and calling
But forget it all
I know I will
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
What's been going on
Now that you have gone
There's no other
Tempted by the fruit of another
Tempted but the truth is discovered
I'm at the car park, the airport
The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding
I'm wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion
It's no story I could tell
At my bedside empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish that it would stop
I bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you
But it's not my conscience
That hates to be untrue
I asked of my reflection
Tell me what is there to do",Tempted,1998

Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight, let the flight begin

I don't want to waste a waking moment; I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
In my time I've said these words before, but now I realize
My heart was telling me lies, for you they're true

All the memories we can't leave behind oh we must have been out of our minds
I thought I loved another not you how foolish I thought the same too
They both turned out to be the wrong kinds oh we must have been out of our minds
[ piano ]
Let's forgive and forget the past we've known
And reap together the wild seeds we've sown
Surely they can forgive us and find that we must have been out of our minds

Rita Coolidge,"If you could see me now
The one who said that he'd rather roam
The one who said he'd rather be alone

If I could hold you now
Just for a moment if I could make you mine
Just for a while turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now

I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom from my chains
Lying in your loving arms again

If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere through the lonely nights
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now

I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom from my chains
Lying in your loving arms again

",Loving Arms,2000
Rita Coolidge,"Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before

Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again

Ohh I'm so glad I finally found you
You're that one in a million man
When you wrap your lovin' arms around me
I can stand up and face the world again

Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you
How can you ask me am I blue

Rita Coolidge,"I wanted it all right from the beginning
The more that I saw of what could be mine
So young and so faithful, too hungry and blind
Sure took a fall, I wanted it all

? was where I could get it
Into the streets where it's easy to use
Taking my brother, getting down on the blues
Sleeping in homes, I wanted it all

Fires keep burning just to become ashes
You change your mind as fast as lightning flashes

I wanted it all up to the last minute
I took you for real and you took me apart
Two gamblers felt perky, one had the cards
After the ball, I wanted it all

You're telling me all what you believe in
Searching for someone there's nothing to give
You say I'm empty handed and I don't know how to live
I don't believe you at all, I wanted it all

Rita Coolidge,"Woke up late again this morning
'Cause I was late again last night
In the mood that I was born in
And my skin was feelin' tight

I took a short cut to the city
Had myself a drink or two
I got over feeling shaky
But I'm still ain't over you

Good God, I might as well forget you
You ain't never comin' true
Seems like ever since I met you
I've been gettin' over you

I don't crave no conversation
I don't need no sympathy
All I want now is my baby
And my baby wantin' me

So take me any way you want me
I'll take you any way I can
I don't want your sack of candy
Just a little sweetness now and then

I got to get myself together
With someone who wants some too
Maybe I can learn to love him
While I'm gettin' over you

Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with love, when you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one

We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in love
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and win
So hold on tight, let the flight begin

I don't want to waste a waking moment; I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
In my time I've said these words before, but now I realize

In bridges he burned or the way that she died

Preambles around the town

'n beats his feet till his feet is beat

Watch him go! - and he can - 
Like a real- nach'-l man
High Stepper is Shorty George
Black pepper is Shorty George

He dances to pay the rent
And to see that you're solid sent
Mister can you spare a penny?
Lady can you spare a dime? 

He makes, I don't know how many
'Cause he's dancin' all the time.

Rita J.,"There's a season for the kings to leave
We're watching, watching
The revolution, those screams
Time is running, running
The revolution, those screams
And we're waiting, waiting

Is it the very end of something
Or is it just the beginning

Bitches at the front door
I got power, go to war
Leave me money, soldiers so I'll lay'em down, kill the poor
Tyrants want the greedy whore
Shake'em down, gimme more
The rich they paid protection plays the underscore
Give me yours
Grab onto the screams and wars
The private lives are at the core
Visions soar in my mind
All seeing I was blind
Blocking out the sunshine
Eternally, we be fine, globally
We decline anytime we mistreat
Murder everywhere we turn
Birth of a nation
Slaves on plantations
Traps keep us facin'
Distracted, rat-racin'
Poisonous, we taste it
Uncover truth let's face it

I'll be in the basement
Rallying for placement
Changing lives is basic
The future's now don't waste it
Get up off the matrix

(Oh oh oh oh)
Is it the last time, we talk together
The last time, we watch each other
The revolution those screams
Time is running, running
The revolution those screams
And we're waiting, waiting

Kings season,
Retreating slowly
Kings season watching scream rising

Is it the very end of something, or is it just the beginning
Watch it burning, watch them falling
Watch it burning hey hey
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I'll be in the basement,
Rallying for placement, changing lives is basic,
The future's now don't waste it, get up off the matrix.",Kings Season,2012

Como é que faz pra gente ser feliz e rico ao mesmo tempo?

Todo remédio que me cura tem uma contra indicação
O que faz bem pra alma pode fazer mal pro coração
De quem tem pressa de chegar
Ai quem me dera um dia 
Ficar de papo pro ar
Tirando um som de uma viola 
E quanto mais a gente ganha mais a gente vai perder
Porque essa vida tá ficando um osso duro de roer
E então, acho bom lembrar
Que o passarinho na gaiola não esquece de cantar
Que uma criança nunca briga se ela aprende a brincar e amar
Como tem que ser

Quem não chora dali, não mama daqui, diz o ditado
Quem pode, pode, deixa os acomodados que se incomodem

Minha saúde não é de ferro mão
Mas meus nervos são de aço
Pra pedir silêncio eu berro, pra fazer barulho eu mesma faço, ou não

Mas pegar fogo nunca foi atração de circo
Mas de qualquer maneira
Pode ser um caloroso espetáculo, então
O palhaço ri dali, o povo chora daqui, e o show não pára
E apesar dos pesares do mundo",Jardins da Babilônia,2000

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

Não conheço mim, mas sei quem é eu, sei sim

Pois ele tinha toda razão
Você não quis ficar comigo
Agora eu não quero mais não
Olha, meu querido
Seu amigo
Me contou que uma fulana
Assim do nada, de repente, apareceu
No fim quem se deu bem fui eu

A vida tem disso
Na beira de um precipício
Eu tava lá
Querendo não querendo pular
Na hora H um anjo chegou
Me deu um beijo e se declarou
Tchau pra você

Seu amigo é um cara bacana
E sempre foi afim de mim
Você não, não, não pense
Que é tão bom de cama
Sua fama é assim, assim
Você não sabe
Você não é mau
Mas seu amigo é bem mais legal
E não esqueça que agora sou eu
A namoradinha de um amigo seu

A vida tem disso
No fim tudo faz sentido
Então até mais
Não adianta olhar para trás
Encontrei alguém que me ama
Fique em paz com sua fulana

Rita Lee,"Nós, os malucos, vamos lutar
Pra nesse estado continuar
Nunca sensatos nem condizentes
Mas parecemos supercontentes
Nossos neurônios são esquisitos
Por isso estamos sempre aflitos
Vamos incertos
Pelo caminho
Nos comportando estranhos no ninho
Quando a solução se encontra, um maluco é do contra
Mas se vai por lado errado, um maluco vai do lado

Malucos, a nossa vida é dar bandeira
Ligando a luz da cabeceira,se a água pinga na torneira
Malucos, a nossa luta é abstrata
Já que afundamos a fragata,
Mas temos medo de barata

Nós, os malucos, temos um lema
Tudo na vida é um problema
Mas nunca tente nos acalmar
Pois um maluco pode surtar
Os nossos planos são absurdos
Tipo gritar no ouvido dos surdos
Mas todo mundo que é genial
Nunca é descrito como normal
Quando o papo se esgota,
Um maluco é poliglota
Mas se todo mundo grita,
Um maluco se irrita

Malucos, somos iguais a diferença
E todos temos uma crença
Seguir a lei jamais compensa
Malucos, somos a mola desse mundo,
Mas nunca iremos muito a fundo
Nesse dilema tão profundo

Malucos, a nossa vida é dar bandeira,
Ligando a luz da cabeceira,se a água pinga na torneira
Malucos, a nossa luta é abstrata,
Já que afundamos a fragata,
Mas temos medo de barata",Hino Dos Malucos,2003

Anunciei por aí
Por e-mail, por correio veio toda a verdade
Já mandei no megafone
Pra toda gente escutar
Notícia que se espalha
Paira em qualquer lugar
Li no outdoor, pus na canção
Deu no cinema
Que a vida vale a pena
Na matinê, no botequim
Na madrugada
Vida que vale a pena
Já escutei
E repeti por aí
Coloquei cartazes nos murais
De toda cidade
Já berrei no microfone
A todo volume no ar
Palavra que se espalha
Pluma no vendaval

There´s a land that I heard of, once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream 
Really do come true
Someday I´ll wish upon a star
And make up where the clouds are far 
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That´s where you´ll find me

Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh, 
Why cant´t I",Over the Rainbow,2003

Para matar o meu amor e matei

Would it make a difference, would we understand
Find no resistance, just love, joy and peace

When I heard my child in prayer.
She said, ""And for me some scarlet ribbons,
Scarlet ribbons for my hair."" 

All the stores were closed and shuttered,
And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair. 

Through the night my heart was aching. 
And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons. 
Scarlet ribbons for her hair. 

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

Only to me, spoil me with your bad (ass)

If they find out, what will they make of it
So I say that every kiss like a sanction
You ain't missin' a thing

I stay silent and let you chime in
You want me to talk?, fine then
Someone broke your heart?
Let me find them

Until I'm at your place at the late night
You make me smile, stop doing that

You are a lot, I guess I rap for you

I feel insane
But when I'm with you, my feelings change
I love you, I really hope you feel the same
You know what I am, you're holdin' my hand

You are what I miss and we all need this
Love and affection is all we miss
From the world but with each other

Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me honey
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me honey
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

I'm gonna love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That will do you how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah
Imma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air And you lean forward
Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me on it
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back, go quick
'Cause this here is fatal attraction
So I take it all or I don't want shit

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya

Only to me, spoil me with your bad (ass)

See the rain is makin' me feel painless
This relationship is so dangerous
If they find out, what will they make of it
So I say that every kiss like a sanction
You ain't missin' a thing
With other niggas who sing

Instead of whinin' about what I've been findin'
I stay silent and let you chime in
You want me to talk?
Fine then
Someone broke your heart?
Let me find them
But I hate fights and now I got stage fright
Until I'm at your place at the late night
You make me smile, stop doing that

You are a lot, I guess I rap for you

For real it's the game
I feel insane
But when I'm with you, my feelings change
I love you, I really hope you feel the same
You know what I am, you're holdin' my hand
No one else can so I'm your man
Your palm reads bliss
What are we miss?
You are what I miss and we all need this
Love and affection is all we miss
From the world but with each other
That's all we get

I hardly wanna slip the awesomest kiss
Call me whenever, call me forever

Rita Quintero,"Life is sweet, knowing you found
What you've always been looking for
That's how I feel about you
Everything that you do

It's ecstasy
True moments of passion never die
When I hold you in my arms
And hear to tenderly sigh

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake, make no mistake

I don't know
Exactly what I was looking for
But once I held you I knew
Nobody else could ever do

In the heat of love
Decisions we make may not all be real
But one thing I know for sure
Is that I love you so

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake

Wanna make something real
Show me how you feel, baby

It'll never be the same
Not this way again
With someone new

But someone new
Will just have to do
'Cause you never loved me at all
You told me yourself

Why'd you stay with me, baby?
You'd let me take the chance
Left me making plans

For nobody, nobody
You said you were waiting
For your heart to fall in love
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

But they say, time heals all wounds
I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart
Heal my broken heart

'Cause I loved you and I was true
You know I've been carrying a failure's cross
I did everything to win your heart
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

And they say, time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart

And what of the nights
When you looked in my eyes
And you told me, you loved me?

You made me feel in my heart
It was real not a spark
But a flame burning inside
Who can put out this fire inside?

Time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal

And I hope the time can heal my heart

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Rita Springer,"I'm captured, I'm constrained
I'm in love with Your name
I'm undone and I'm insane
Only You can satisfy

Oh, amazing love, oh, amazing love I've found
Oh, amazing God, oh, amazing God come down

I'm surrounded, and I am safe
I'm bound by cords of grace
I'm broken but I am strong
Only You can satisfy

Oh, amazing love, oh, amazing love I've found
Oh, amazing God, oh, amazing God come down

I'm convinced and I’m sure
I'm abandoned solely for

Oh, this amazing love, oh, this amazing love
Oh, amazing love that I've found

Oh, amazing God, oh, amazing God
Oh, amazing God come down, come down

Oh, amazing love, oh, amazing love
Oh, amazing love come down

Rita Springer,"I have to believe 
That He sees my darkness 
I have to believe 
He knows my pain 
I have to lift up 
My hands to worship 
Worship His name 

I have to declare 
That He is my refuge 
I have to deny 
That I am alone 
I have to lift up 
My eyes to the mountain 
It's where my help comes from 

Oh yeah 
He said that He's forever faithful 
He said that He's forever true 
He said that He can move mountains 
If He can move mountains 
He can move my mountain 
He can move your mountain, too 

Oh, I have to stand tall 
When the wind blows me over 
I have to stand strong 
When I'm weak and afraid 
I have to grab hold 
Ahold of the garments 
The garments of praise 

I know, I know, I know 
Cause He said that He's forever faithful 
And He said that He's forever true 
He said that He can move mountains 
If He can move mountains 
He can move my mountain 
He can move your mountain, too 

I have to sing praise 
When the hour is midnight 
He unlocks these chains 
That bind up my soul 
My sin and my shame 
He has forgiven and made me whole 

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Cause He said that He's forever faithful 
And He said that He's forever true 
He said that He can move mountains 
He said that He can move mountains 
He said that He can move mountains 
If He can move mountains 
He can move my mountain 
He can move your mountain, too 

I have to believe 
I have to believe 
He's got everything under control 
I have to believe 
Lord, I believe 
Help my unbelief 
I have to believe in You 
I have to believe",I Have to Believe,2005
Rita Springer,"Too alarmin' now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes

He's ordinary

Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero

Rita Springer,"Looks like tonight the sky is heavy
Feels like the winds are gonna' change
Beneath my feet the earth is ready
I know it's time for heaven's rain
It's gonna' rain
'Cause it's living water we desire
To flood our hearts with holy fire
Rain down, all around the world we're singing
Rain down, can you hear the earth is singing
Rain down, my heart is dry but still I'm singing
Rain down, rain it down on me
Back to the start, my heart is heavy
Feels like it's time to dream again
I see the clouds and yes, I'm ready
To dance upon this barren land
Hope in my hands",Rain Down,2005

Rita Wilson,"There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart.
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start.
I see no need to take me home,
I'm old enough to face the dawn.

Just call me angel of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.
Just call me angel of the morning angel
Then slowly turn away from me.

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow.
If morning's echo says we ve sinned,
Well, it was what I wanted now.
And if we're the victims of the night,
I won't be blinded by light.

Just call me angel of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.
Just call me angel of the morning angel
Then slowly turn away,
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day,
Of the years, baby baby baby.
Just call me angel of the morning angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby.",Angel of the Morning,2012
Rita Wilson,"Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams
That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes
That I am not gonna be the one to share what
Seems to be the life that you could
Cherish as much as I do yours

Oh I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters, just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind

Oh I could say I need you but then you'd realize
That I want you just like a thousand other guys
Who'd say they loved you With all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

And I do cherish you
And I do cherish you

Smiles have alter to tears
But tears won’t wash away the fears
Have you never ever gonna return

To this ? we burn
Keeps my crying baby for you
Keeps me saying baby for you
So won’t you hurry come on boy see about me
I have given up my friends just for you

No pee shall I find until you come back and be mine
No matter what you do or say I am gonna love you anyway

Rita Wilson,"Faithless love like a river flows
Like raindrops fallin' on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes

Where the night grows in
Like a cold dark wind
Faithless love like a river flows

Faithless love, where did I go wrong?
Too many stories, too many heartbreak songs
Where nobody's right, nobody's wrong

Faithless love will find you
And the misery entwine you
Faithless love, where did I go wrong?

Well, I guess I'm standin' in a hall of broken dreams
That's the way it sometimes goes
And every new love never turns out like it seems
I guess the feelin' comes and goes

Faithless love like a river flows
Like a raindrops fallin' on a broken rose
Down in some valley where nobody goes

Faithless love has found me
Thrown its chilly arms around me
Faithless love, faithless love like a river flows",Faithless Love,2012
Rita Wilson,"Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin to L.A.
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town

Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Find the sunshine, leave the rain
They said this town were a waste of time
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine

Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues

You know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
Play around you'll lose your wife
You play too hard you'll lose your life

Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues
