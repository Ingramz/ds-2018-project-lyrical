Jimmy Castor,"Komo Sambe Kong Kong!
Woo wooo woo

He lived in the jungle where he was born the king
His great strength made him lord of everything
No creature crossed his path and lived for long
His name, so legend tells us, was King Kong
His height was never measured but was great
The jungle shook beneath his mighty weight
His arms were muscled, sturdy as a tree
His chest was thick and wide as it could be

Komo Sambe, King Kong 
Komo Sambe Kong (King Kong)
Komo Sambe (King Kong)
Komo Sambe Kong (King Kong)
Komo Sambe

He didn't dance or party
He spoke at times, but hardly
One woman heard his love call
But he was too big and too tall

whooo woo woo woo woo
Whoo woo wo woo woooo

One day while Kong was sleepin' on his back
A tyrannosaurus launched a sneak attack
They fought, first Kong went down then up again
The fight went on, no one knew who would win
Kong reached and seized the monster with both hands
And summoned all his strength at his command
He stretched the creature's mouth to lift (?) the split (?)
Then like a child began to play with it
He beat his hairy chest and looked around
Five miles away they heard his roaring sound

Komo Sambe, (King Kong) 
Komo Sambe Kong (King Kong)
Komo Sambe (King Kong)
Komo Sambe Kong (King Kong)

He didn't dance or party
He spoke at times, but hardly
One woman heard his love call
But he was too big and too tall

Whoo woo woo woo wo wo
Who wo woo wo wooo woooo

From everyone he knew he got respect
Whoever failed to give it he'd correct he, he, haw
No creature crossed his path and lived for long
His name, so legend tells us, was King Kong

Jimmy Castor,"Watch me now
Fill the room
Into something
Gonna make you move

Don't know what
We're running from

Day or night

Clap your hands and stomp your feet

Man, he's crazy about that rock and roll

Makes you jump, it makes you roll

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Wake up in the mornin' fix you somethin' to eat,
'fore I go to work I even brush your teeth
Get home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got yourself a rag tied 'round you're head.

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Your tender kiss,
And the wonderful things we would do.

Now I run my hands
Through silvery strands,
You left me blue turning gray over you.

You used to be
So good to me,
That's when I was a novelty.

Now, you've new friends in view,
You've found someone new,
And left me blue turning gray over you.",Blue Turning Grey Over You,2005
Jimmy Cavallo,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Jimmy Chamberlin,"With every breath you take
Life begins again
And every time you whisper
Death starts to descend
You're all alone until you close your eyes
And you can see the beauty in your life
It begins again again again again

We sat alone one night
And you were crying to me
A fear held me so tight my soul
Of what the future held
And what the world was bringing to me
This matter of the future in my head again

A vision came before me
Crystalline
And now I see it clearly
Two bright lights

Be just be
Hovering and wondering
Whispering in choral dreams
Of all the kings and all the queens
Presidents and vanities
All of you and all of me
All and all and everything
Be just be

I saw you standing in the sun today
We'd lived our lives and loved the truth
Our dreams came true for us just like you said
Now our souls can truly begin again again again again
Now you see me
Now you see me
Now you see me",Life Begins Again,2005
Jimmy Chamberlin,"A life comes our way
A death comes our way
Which is the safer place
I'll tell you 

Who are we to complain
When God takes things away
Is it enough to confess
Some sadness

I gaze into the sun
My green eyes burning

I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels

You and you are true
I can't meet you halfway
You and you are true
I can't meet you halfway

I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels

Simple cares they escape me
If I walk away don't hate me
I got to see where the pain will take me

I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels

I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels",Loki Cat,2005
Jimmy Chamberlin,"Never in my life
Have I felt so right
All I do
Is the truth

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel

As I walk outside tonight
With the stars as my guide
Knowing where to go
It's my Heart that tells me so

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel
Love is real
Love is real
Love is real
Love is real

And in time I found myself
With some stories and some wealth
A place for us to meet

Jimmy Chamberlin,"When things are spinning down
And people put you out again
The darkness sets you up
The world's no place for love it seems

New waves are coming
New waves are coming

When despair takes your hand
All you do is worry
Clocks are ticking faster and faster
There's no other plan

New waves are coming
New waves are coming
New waves are coming
New waves are coming 'round

Soon a place called yesterday
Will be gone forever
And a new love of today will come and you will (fly)",Newerwaves,2005

And though you're gone I find,
I'm still in love with you. 

Shadows fall, and I recall,
The love that you once had for me.
Miss you so, when lights are low,
I think of things that use to be. 

You're always in my heart,
Although you're out of sight,
Lonely teardrops burn,
As I toss and turn,
Another sleepless night.

Sweet to my ears is the song every bluebird sings,
Each rosebud kissed by the dew,
All this is mine and heaven too.

The sentimental breeze, the dreamy streams that flow,
Every country lane and every street of stone
Are highways of adventure made for me alone.

Deep in my heart I will carry this song with me,
You bring a love so divine, all this is mine

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

When I was just a little boy only six years old
I asked my daddy what big things my future hold

The facts of life you will start to understand
Nobody knows just what tomorrow may bring
So I want to tell you now, and listen while I sing

Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell

Now I'm a lonely man trying to make life on my own

Just like the river, I've been running ever since
The day I was born in that broken down little town
I'm wondering now just what my gain will be
'Cause it seems to me, happiness I'll never see

Jimmy Cobb & His Orchestra,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",I Cried for You,2005
Jimmy Cobb Quartet,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Jimmy Cobb's Mob,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes

Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

Jimmy Coe,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near

Jimmy Coe,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Jimmy Cook Big Band,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2010

In her own mad mind she's in love with you.

She's some kind of demon messing in the glue.
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you.

In the beginning it was compliments everyday
You said, when we first started out
I would go out my way
But one day, you claimed I don't appreciate you
And I don't know how to treat you
We don't do the same things we did no more

What I don't really understand is
How could you offend, take that
I would be that take a man, who take control of you like that
Don't you know better than that (than that)
Can't believe your're actin like that (like that)
After all I've did for you you've come to me like that

Every time we take one step forward
You take 2 steps back 
Everytime it's right you bring left back (oh, oh)
Girl you really oughta think about it
Cuz there's really no doubt about it 
You know I've been there for you and that's the truth

Don't understand where you're comin from
cuz love's sacrifice
sometimes I feel like what you did now
don't wanna go with this for life
you claimed I no longer wanna rub you
and I do not wanna touch you
We don't play the little games we did before

Did you ever take the time to think that maybe
I was just going through things
Just because you're a woman you're not the only one 
Who's been missing
What about you rubbin on my shoulder 
Telling me I love you
You don't do the things you used to do no more

Don't forget last Tuesday night
Making love with candlelight
Remember, how about those many times

Make sure you'd never know
Couldn't let it show a sign
Want you to trust me

Tell me why the hell can't you see
That you're only gonna mess it up
You've done enough, you gotta stop
You're gonna lose what's good for you

When love, takes me over
Its paradise
When love, takes me over
It's always nice

Touch pon di ends
And a incense, herbs and oils
Scrapbook newspaper
Clippings and files
A view of di countryside
Remind me of nine miles
Where di trees are green
And di people smile
After few water crackers
And some warm milo tea
Rub massage home made
Coco butter skin cream
Interior design of
Ights gold and green
And the vibes are pure
And the thoughts are clean

She collect her own
Dividends weekly
So mi know ah no money
Mek she seek me
Cool me down
And tie mi knotty dem neatly
Draw close
While whispering sweetly
Mi teach her each and everytime
That she link me
We haffi bun
A five bills bag a stinky
True she roots and culture
She win me
I even had to
Introduce her to Cindy

VERSE (Mr. Cheeks)

VERSE

Well I was sitting
By an open fire place
In my flavorite dungarees
I play a few strums
Upon my guitar
And It sounds so good to me
Big skunky blunt a blaze
And plus
My flavorite stooks beside me
I glance over
Just so I could see her
But my locks got in the way

Cool breeze a blow
Through the weeping willow
She always leave
A fragrance on my pillow
When I'm ready
She will always follow
Me to the place of
My old sleepy hollow
Soft silky voice is
So sacred and hollow
Cause out spoken noisy
Streams run shallow
Reach to the stars
When I launch the Apollo
Could a land up ah Sao Paulo

Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California

A thousand miles away from home sleepin' in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
Get off get off you railroad bum he slammed the boxcar door

Well he put me off in Texas a state I dearly love

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Jimmy Day,"Way out in the island with the coconut tree
With the pearly shells and the tropical breeze
There's a hillbilly girl from Tennessee
My hillbilly hula gal

She's had enough of the hills and me
So she's taken to the lessons in Waikiki
I guess she's right where she wants to be
My hillbilly hula gal

She dances with wahini's in the islands now
She's trying to do the hula but she don't know how
She's got the poniola's in her own corral
She feeds them grits and gravy at the old luau

The Blue Grass hills and the Mountain Dew
Wait till she leaves Honolulu
She better come home like she's suppose to do
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she looks twice as good in a little grass skirt
Than overalls and a tore up shirt
But corn don't grow in lava dirt
My hillbilly hula gal

There's smiles on the faces if the island boys
Cause her southern drawl gives a big enjoy
She can't churn butter when she's dipping that poi
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she never used to give a hoot for coconuts or taro root
She's a country gal living in the islands now
She's trying to get the hula girl to show her how

When she gets through with this fantasy
Just come on back to Tennessee
Back with me where she's suppose to be
My hillbilly hula gal, my hillbilly hula gal

Jimmy Dean,"(Big John, big John)
Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six-foot-six and weighed two-forty-five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Now, they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man

His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time
I guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line

Jimmy Dean,"Many people look through their wallet or their pocket books and, way down at the bottom, past the credit cards and baby pictures and so on, you usually find a little 'ol piece of dog-eared poetry. I was cleaning out my wallet the other day and ran across a whole bunch of I.O.U's, some of 'em thirty-five years overdue. And you know the funny thing, all these I.O.U's are owed to one person and I kinda felt like that maybe now would be a pretty good time for an accountin'.

Mom, I sure hope you're listenin'.
Sweet lady, I.O.U. for so many things...
A lot of services, like night watchman for instance...
Lyin' awake nights, listenin' for coughs and cries and creakin' floorboards
Ha ha, and me comin' in too late.
Boy, you had the eye of an eagle and the roar of a lion,
But you always had a heart as big as a house.
I.O.U. for services like, uh, short order cook, chef, baker...
For makin' sirloin out o' hamburger an' turkey out o' tuna fish,
And big ol' strappin' boys out of leftovers.
I.O.U. for cleanin' services,
The daily scrubbing of face and ears...all work done by hand.
And for the frequent dustin' of a small boy's pants
To try to make sure that you led a spotless life.
And for washin' and ironin' that no laundry could ever do.
For dryin' the tears of childhood 
And ironin' out the problems of growin' up.
I.O.U. for services as a bodyguard, 
For protectin' me from the terrors of thunderstorms and nightmares
Ha, and too many green apples.
And Lord knows, I.O.U. for medical attention,
For nursing me through measles, mumps, bruises,
Bumps, splinters and spring fever.
Oh-oh, let's not forget medical advice...important things like, 
""If you keep on scratching that, it'll never get well."" or
""If you cross your eyes, they're gonna stick like that."".
And probably the most important advice of all,
""Boy, you be sure you got on clean underwear, in case you're in an accident.""
And I.O.U. for veterinarian services,
For feeding every lost dog that I dragged home at the end of the rope,
And for healing the pains of puppy love.
And I.O.U. for entertainment...
Entertainment that kept the household goin' through some pretty rough times...
And for wonderful productions at Christmas, the Fourth of July, birthdays...
And for making make-believe come true...
And you did it all on such a limited budget.
I.O.U. for construction work, for building kites and confidence, hopes and dreams and...
Somehow you made them all touch the sky...
And for cementin' together a family 
So it would stand the worst kind of shocks and blows...
And for layin' down a good strong foundation to build a life on.
I.O.U. for carrier charges...
For carryin' me on your books for the necessities of life
That a growin' boy somehow, well, they just gotta have.
Things like, ha ha, a pair of high top boots,
With a little pocket on the side for a jackknife.
And one thing, Mom, I'll never forget...
When there were two pieces of pie and three hungry people...
You were always the one who decided, well, I'm not really that hungry anyhow.
These are just a few of the things for which payment is long overdue...
The person that I owe 'em to worked very, very cheap...
She managed by simply doin' without a whole lot o' things that she needed herself...
My I.O.U's add up to more than I could ever hope to repay,
But you know the nicest thing about it all...
That I know, that she had marked the entire bill 'Paid In Full'
For just one kiss and four little words...Mom, I love you!",I.O.U.,1991

Jimmy Dean,"In '43 they put to sea, thirteen men and Kennedy
Aboard the P.T. 109, to fight the brazen enemy
And off the isle of ol' Lusana, in the strait beyond Nehru
A Jap deatroyer in the night cut the '109 in two

Smoke and fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

And on the coast of Kolombangaro, looking through his telescope
Australian Evans saw the battle for the crew had little hope
Two were dead, some were wounded, all were clinging to the bow
Fighting fire and a-fighting water trying to save their lives somehow

Smoke and fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, they thought they had the best of a mighty good man

McMahon the Irishman was burned so badly, he couldn't swim
Leave me, here go on, he said 'cause if you don't we'll all be dead
The PT skipper couldn't leave him, a man to die alone at sea
And with a strap between his teeth, he towed the Irishman through the sea

Smoke and fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, they thought they had the best of a mighty good man

He led his men through waters dark, rocky reefs and hungry sharks
Braved the ennemy's bayonets, a .38 hung 'round his neck
Four more days and four more nights a rescue boat pulled into sight
The P.T. 109 was gone but Kennedy and his crew lived on

Now who could guess or who could possibly know
That this same man named Kennedy

Would be the leader of the nation, be the one to take command?
The P.T. 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again

Smoke and fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
But JFK and his crew lived on

Which proves it's hard to get the best of a man named John

But I saw him a-cryin like a little whipped pup
Because of love

It can lift you up, it can let you down
Take your world, turn it all around

Found that's stronger than love

Trouble their mind day in and day out

Her young close to her breast,then I thank God

Jimmy Dean,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1998

And the auctioneer felt it was hardly worth his while,
To waste much time on the old violin but he held it up with a smile,
Well it sure ain't much but its all we got left I guess we aught to sell it to,
Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

And then he cried one give me one dollar,
Who'll make it two only two dollars who'll make it three,
Three dollars twice now that's a good price,
Now who's gonna bid for me?
Raise up your hand now don't wait any longer the auctions about to end,
Who's got four Just one dollar more to bid on this old violin?

Well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low,
From the back of the crowd a gray haired man,
Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday

And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Now, they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man
Big John

How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire
Doesn't it seem like we've been here before?
Over an ocean the heavens will open
Nothing lives up to the visions we see
Everything's clear when you step through the mirror

Carried away to the fog in the distance
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share
Hot balloons of open air

Step out of rhythm and fall into place
Try not to think of the hours I wasted
Open the shutters, now how can it be?
When did this picture become so unreal?
Moving along on an endless supply
Somehow I feel like the only survivor
Try to remember the moment we spent 
Lost in the rain as we floated together

Carried away by the dream that we're sharing
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?

Of a half forgotten dream

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out

Like a minor lament In my ears

A hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No sadder was he than I

On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon

To hold her hand and then it's ten to one

Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice

It's too late now there's no gettin' out

Charming and debonaire

So rare You have a way that's beyond compare

If it started raining soup his family'd all have forks,
If they was to cut a woman in two, he'd get the half that talks.

Unlucky Luke, unlucky kid,
Why he broke into a betting shop and he lost four hundred quid.
Now his parents never loved him like they did his sister, Kim,
They could tied a kipper 'round his neck to get the cat to play with him.
And he cried the day that he was weened 'cause he knew even then,
It'd be twenty years before he was near anything like that again.

They put his cradle on the ??? near the door,
So the folks downstairs could hear him when he fell out on the floor.
Now the saddest day of Luke's unhappy life, beyond a doubt,
Was the day he went to hospital to get his tonsils out.
He was on the operating theatre trolley sleeping sound,
When a short-sighted nurse came past and turned the trolley 'round.

Unlucky Luke, no wonder he hollers,
His sick aunt died and in her will he owed her forty dollars.
Now Luke married Charlie's widow, a lady with no manners,
She had a figure like a hippo and face like a bag of spanners.
She told him she'd four children in the cemetary by the creek,
She forgot to tell they was down there playin' hide and seek.

Unlucky Luke, at the age of fifty-two,
Had a wife, a girlfriend and a tax demand and all three were overdue.

So he phoned up the Samaritans but the Samaritans hung up.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,

Jimmy Dorsey,"Down on an island in the Southern Seas,
There lives a lassie named Minnie Breeze;
And all the natives agree that she's
The hottest thing in Trinidad!

When Minnie dances, I guarantee
With every move of her vertebrae
The temperature jump up ten degree!
In Trinidad that isn't bad!

Aye aye aye, they call her Minnie from Trinidad,
Aye aye aye, they all love Minnie from Trinidad,
Aye aye aye, and all the natives would be so sad
If Minnie ever left Trinidad!

Although the natives love Minnie so,
Minnie had herself a steady beau;
A fellow known as Calypso Joe,
And Minnie swore they'd never part!

But fate stepped in only as fate could,
Min won a contest for dancing good,
So she went away to Hollywood;
When Joe heard that it broke his heart!

In Hollywood Minnie traveled far,
They changed her name to Minnie La Mar,
And pretty soon she became a star,
The siren of the picture show!

But one day Minnie got awful mad,
A guy got fresh and she said, ""You cad!
My heart belongs to my Trinidad,
My Trinidad Calypso Joe"".

Aye aye aye, they call her Minnie from Trinidad,
Aye aye aye, in Hollywood Minnie met a cad;
Aye aye aye, but there is only one native lad
Gets chinny with Minnie from Trinidad!

So Minnie gave up her dough and fame,
And she went back to from where she came;
And when she got there she heard with shame
That her Calypso Jo was dead!

When she heard that, she almost died,
She got a gun to try suicide!
But as she started to shoot, she cried,
""I think I'd rather live instead!"".

But now the natives are mighty glad,
'Cause Minnie came back to Trinidad!

Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye,
Aye aye!

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2006

And the stars begin to flicker in the sky
Through the mist of a memory, you wander back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

Though you're gone, your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat, lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

Jimmy Dorsey,"A boy found a dream upon a distant shore
A maid with a way of whisp'ring ""si senor.""
Each night while guitars would softly play,
The tune seemed to dance 'round the words that he'd say:

Amapola, my pretty little poppy
You're like that lovely flow'r so sweet and heavenly,
Since I found you, my heart is wrapped around you
And loving you, it seems to beat a Rhapsody.

Amapola, the pretty little poppy
Must copy it's endearing charm from you.
Amapola, Amapola, how I long to hear you say ""I love you.""

And sailed from the one his arms were longing for.
He vowed he'd return one sunny day,
Once more to repeat what his heart had to say",Amapola (Pretty Little Poppy),2007
Jimmy Dorsey,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [Rerecorded],
Jimmy Dorsey,"You marched away and left this town
As empty as can be.
I can't sit under the apple tree
With anyone else but me.

For there is no secret lover
That the draft board didn't discover.
They're either too young or too old
They're either too grey or too grassy green.

The pickings are poor and the crop is lean.
What's good is in the army.
What's left will never harm me.
I'm either their first breath of spring.

Or I'm their last little fling.
I must confess to one romance,
I'm sure you will allow.
He tries to serenade me,

But his voice is changing now.
I'm finding it easy to stay good as gold.
They're either too young or too old.
I'll never ever fail ya, when you are in Australia

And flying over Egypt, your heart will never by gypped.
And when you get to India, I'll still be what I've been to ya,
I've looked the field over, and lo and behold!

Jimmy Dorsey,"The breeze and I are saying with a sigh
That you no longer care
The breeze and I are whispering goodbye
To dreams we used to share

Ending in a strange, mournful tune
And all about me, they know you have departed without me

And we wonder why, the breeze and I
