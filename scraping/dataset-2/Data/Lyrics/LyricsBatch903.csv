Bausa,"Ah! 
Ah!

Mit elf Jahren zum ersten Mal mit Polizei Probleme
Geraucht, gekifft und gesoffen als ob ich dreißig wäre
Total auf Sendung im sozialen Brennpunkt und
Die Schule macht sofort beim Jugendamt Meldung
Kurze Zeit später waren sie bei mir daheim
Und steckten mich ohne zu fragen ins Erziehungsheim
Zur Begrüßung fliegen Steine und ich schließ' mich ein
Ich schwör' mir hart zu bleiben, ich schwör' mir nie zu weinen
Mit der Zeit fand ich Freunde, die wie ich waren
Wir wurden rausgeschmissen, weil wir immer dicht waren
Ich kam nicht klar mit dem Gedanken, dass mein Vater geht
Diagnose, Endstadium Krebs, tschau Leben!

Wie oft hab' ich mein Spiegelbild um Rat gefragt?
Nachdem als ich sechzehn Jahre war mein Vater starb
Danach hatt' ich nur noch Vater Staat
Für ihn war ich aber nur ein kleiner Sklave auf dem Arbeitsmarkt
Ich bin Tag für Tag nach zehn Stunden Drecksarbeit
Mit der S-Bahn ins Studio gefahren, um 'nen Text zu schreiben
Um 'nen Beat zu bauen, um 'ne Hook zu singen
Und habe jeden Tag darüber nachgedacht, mich umzubringen
Mama weint nachts alleine und das frisst mich auf
Geb' nicht auf! Hast du gehört, Mama? Ich geb' nicht auf!
Auch wenn sie denken, dass ich in die falsche Richtung lauf'
Ich nehm' mein Leben jetzt in meine Hand und mach' Geschichte draus

Das Leben füttert mich mit Dreck, um mich satt zu kriegen
Ich werd' ihn fressen und lernen seinen Geschmack zu lieben
Ich nehm' sogar noch eine Extraportion
Denn mein Hunger ist so groß wie die Entfernung zum Mond
Streu' das Salz in meine Wunden, ich genieße den Schmerz
Ich hab' Lungen wie ein Pferd und ein riesiges Herz
Auf dem Weg nach oben hab' ich viele sterben gesehen
Und trotzdem werd' ich geh'n als hätte ich verlernt, wie man steht
Ich werde arbeiten als hätte ich verlernt, wie man schläft
Wenn der Prophet nicht zum Berg kommt, dann kommt der Berg zum Prophet
Meine Story ist noch lange nicht zu Ende erzählt
Ihr werdet meinen Namen kennen die Legende, sie lebt
Alele",Intro,2017
Bausa,"Jajajaja
Mhmmm (ja, ja)

Ich flog von Indien nach Japan, nur um dich zu sehen
Und schwamm von dort aus nach Taiwan, doch du warst nicht da
Ich hab' lang auf dich gewartet, um dich mitzunehmen
Aber du warst mit einem anderen in Afrika
Ich bin die ganze Zeit am rauchen (Tabakwaren)
Und ich trinke, bis ich blau bin (Avatar)
Ich hab' genug davon, dir nachzufahren (yeah)
Nach all den Jahren auf der Autobahn, ey

Keiner weiß, wo
Du dich wieder rumtreibst
Und wie schlägst du grade wieder die Zeit tot? (Tot)
Wahrscheinlich liegst du unterm Sektempfang
Und rufst darunter den perfekten Mann

Du lässt dich gern bestechen
Mit ein bisschen Wein (mit ein bisschen Wein)
Schenkst jedem Kerl ein Lächeln
Und lässt mich allein, doch (und lässt mich allein)
Du kannst mein Herz nicht brechen
Es ist aus Stein
Medusa, Medusa (yeah, yeah)

Ah! Ich hab' gewusst, du bist gemeint
Doch das scheint dir nicht genug zu sein, du musst es übertreiben
Früher wusst' ich Liebe noch von Lust zu unterscheiden
Aber mittlerweile ist in meiner Brust nur noch ein Stein
Ich musste nicht mal wein'n, als ich wusste, dass du's treibst
Mit der halben Welt, ich fand es sogar lustig mit der Zeit, haha
Inzwischen weiß ich, dass die Wunde schnell verheilt
Und ich will dich nicht mehr haben, deine Mu, ist zu weit
Viele Männer wurden zu Steinen und du (und du)
Hast für sie Platz in deiner Zeile gesucht (jaja)
Doch es war nicht mal eine Seite genug
Und inzwischen schreibst du ein eigenes Buch - Bish

Du lässt dich gern bestechen
Mit ein bisschen Wein (mit ein bisschen Wein)
Schenkst jedem Kerl ein Lächeln
Und lässt mich allein, doch (Baby, Baby, Baby)
Du kannst mein Herz nicht brechen
Es ist aus Stein
Medusa, Medusa

Alles ist gut so wie es ist
(Alles ist gut so wie es ist)
Weil ich weiß, dass du mich auch vermisst
(Weil ich weiß, dass du mich auch vermisst)
Du kannst nicht lieben, weil du dich so sehr hasst
Doch im Großen und Ganzen 
Juckt es mich nicht, was du machst, woah

Du lässt dich gern bestechen
Mit ein bisschen Wein
Schenkst jedem Kerl ein Lächeln
Und lässt mich allein, doch
Du kannst mein Herz nicht brechen
Es ist aus Stein

Bausa,"Ich bin Superman, du bist mein Kryptonit
Ich bin wie ein Käfer, der auf dem Rücken liegt
Ich glaub', ich hab' zu oft versucht
Zu fliegen wie im Comicbuch
„Die Zeit heilt alle Wunden“, ist ein dummer Satz
Gerade, wenn du täglich Kummer gemischt mit Hunger hast
Ich bin kein Fan von großer Vernunft
Aber Mama hat recht, du bist nur eine brotlose Kunst, ey
Wie kannst du mich nur so versklaven?
Mit deinen Noten und Oktaven, es ist hoffnungslos
Ich baue weiter Pyramiden für dich
Ey, ey, ey

Egal, wie viele Worte es gibt
Sie nutzen alle nichts, ich hab' mir meine Chancen verspielt

Woah-oah-ouh-ouh-ouh
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Du bist mein Blut, yeah

Ich wehr' mich täglich dagegen, den Stift zur Hand zu nehmen
Und schwör' mir selber, ab morgen geh' ich 'nen andren Weg
Und plötzlich sitz' ich an Strophe zwei
Aye, ah
Ich kann dich lieben, ich kann dich hassen, es ändert nichts
Ich bin dein Empfänger, weil du mein Sender bist
Als hätten sie's uns prophezeit
Yeah
Viele denken, ich wär' ein Loser
So wie diese Schlampe Medusa scheiß auf sie!
Ich baue weiter Pyramiden für dich!

Hast du mich vermisst, Baby?
Ich seh's in dei'm Gesicht, du hast viel geweint
Und dich gefragt, wo Baui wieder ist, Baby, eh
Vertrau mir, ich bin ein guter Mann, sei du 'ne gute Frau, ey
Ich muss hustlen für den Traum von 'nem guten Auto und einem guten Haus, ey
Ich hab' verstanden, was zu tun ist, verstehst du's auch?
Es war ein langer Weg von schlafen auf Teppichboden bis zu 'ner guten Couch, ey
Ein langer Weg von Haut und Knochen bis zu 'nem guten Bauch
Ey, ich erzähl dir was

Ich wollte das niemandem sagen (eh)
Ich wollte das niemals erwähnen (eh)
Ich wollte das mit in mein Grab nehmen (ja)
Ich wollte das niemand erzählen (ne)
Ich hab' bei den Ratten geschlafen (ja)
Mit den Kakerlaken gelebt (oh)
Ich bin an der Flasche gehangen, Baby (eh-ey)
Bin mein eigener Schatten gewesen (oh oh)
Ich hab' mich im Spiegel gesehen (ey)
Und hab' mich nicht wieder erkannt (ho)
Ich hab meine Trauer vermauert und jedes Gefühl mit Tequila verbrannt (yeah)
Ich hab in 'ner Lagerhalle gewohnt und nicht geduscht und so
Und mich gefühlt wie ein 
Aber dann hab' ich Stimmen gehört (he?)
Sie haben gesagt, „Du bist mehr!“ (mehr)
Sie haben gesagt, „Du bist Baui!“ (Baui)
„Wenn du willst, wirst du Millionär!“ (woo)
Ich hab Weed verkauft, ein Mikro geklaut und seitdem bin ich unterwegs (he-hey)
Das musst du verstehen (oh, oh)

Sag mir, hast du mich vermisst, Baby? He?
Ich kann leider nicht chillen, auch wenn ich will, auch wenn ich will
Weil ich mach' Hits, Baby (Hits, Baby)
Was für Toto Lotto spiel'n? Gib mir einfach nur ein'n Stift, Baby (yeah yeah)
Und bei mir läuft, auch wenn ich sitz', Baby (sitz', Baby)

Ich bring den Ball ins rollen
Und rapp‘ beim scheißen in die Hose
Brudi, alles voll
Bitches sagen „Baui, verrat uns was das alles soll“
Ich sag was kann ich denn dafür, dass ihr alle wollt?“
Rapper in Deutschland wollen alle Gold
Wollen alle schnell auf dem Olymp
Obwohl sie 30, nicht fleißig und auch nicht fähig sind
Sag ihnen, mein Name steht für Gegenwind
Sag ihnen, mein Name kennt bald jedes Kind
Michael Jackson, meine Texte sind für mehr bestimmt
Maui-Baui, meine Texte sind fürs Meer bestimmt
Eure Mütter wollen Dates und eure Schwestern auch
So funktioniert dieses Konzept von Bau, ok?

Bausa,"Ich glaub', wenn es vorbei ist, bin ich scheiße froh
Am Ende sterb' ich sicher mehr als nur den einen Tod
Ich werde sowas sagen wie „Endlich hast du mich heimgeholt!“
Aber die Frage ist: Bleibt das so? Eh
Aus irgendeinem Grund dacht' ich, dass es simpel wird
Doch keiner sagt dir, was passiert, wenn man im Himmel stirbt
Oder wenn's nicht für den Himmel reicht
Wer entscheidet zwischen Himmelreich und Hölle? Oder ist das gleich?
Gibt's vielleicht 'ne Grauzone, in der man dann bleibt?
Wenn man nicht gut oder böse war, nur gelangweilt
Was gibt es da oben, das einen antreibt?
Ich werde Jesus Fragen stellen bis er mich anschreit
Ich erzähl' von meinen Sünden, bis die Engel weinen
Sind die Tränen der Engel Wein?
Was passiert, wenn man sagt „Es tut mir leid, ich will nicht länger bleiben?“
Kann der Himmel ein Gefängnis sein? Ah

Du bist so weit, weit weg (so weit, weit weg)
Ich weiß noch nicht genau, wie, aber glaub mir
Irgendwann sehen wir uns dann (ey)
Du bist so weit, weit weg (so weit, weit weg)
Ich weiß noch nicht genau, wann, aber glaub' dran
Irgendwann komme ich nach
Irgendwann für immer!

Eine Möglichkeit da rauszukommen gibt es nicht
Dieser Pfad ist eine Einbahnstraße hin zum Licht
Es dauert noch ein bisschen, aber irgendwann erwischt es mich
Tu mir bitte den Gefallen und vergiss mich nicht!
Weil ich nicht wusste, was ich machen soll
War ich die meiste Zeit der letzten Jahre hackevoll
Ich bin oft gefallen und hab' mich immer abgerollt
Die Leute soll'n sagen, was sie woll'n, ich mach' aus Kacke Gold
Der Schnee fällt heute nicht vom Himmel, leg' noch eine Bahn
Und danach sollen alle gehen, ich komm alleine klar
Ich hab' so viele Fragen, aber irgendwie hat keiner Plan
Es ist ein Geheimnis, das keiner weitersagt
Eh, ich lad' die Knarre und dann find' ich's raus
Hab' ich's drauf? Hab' ich's drauf? Hab' ich's drauf? Nein!
Meine Zeit ist noch nicht abgelaufen
Der Himmel muss noch warten, Bau!

Wo gehst du hin? Wo wirst du sein?
Wenn das Ende kommt, wer wartet auf der andern Seite und
Ist das Gras wirklich grüner?
Wer bringt mich rüber, eh
Wo gehst du hin? Wo wirst du sein?
Wenn das Ende kommt, wer wartet auf der andern Seite und
Ist das Gras wirklich grüner?
Wer bringt mich rüber?

Du bist so weit, weit weg
Du bist so weit, weit weg
Eh!
Ich kann die Sterne nicht sehen (du bist so weit, weit weg)
Zu viel Fragezeichen versperren den Weg (du bist so weit, weit weg)
Du bist so weit, so weit, so weit weg

Bausa,"Die Welt ist voll mit kleinen Chihuahuas die ranwollen an meinen Fressnapf
Böse gucken aus dem Fenster, Papas Benzer
Hängen immer nur zu sechst ab, Kopf gerade so über dem Lenkrad
Aber Hauptsache das Messer klemmt zwischen Gürtel und Pampers
Ein Babygangster, der leider keinen Respekt hat
Ist nur so lange frech, Mann, bis ihn endlich einer wegklatscht
Alleine rennen sie weg, Mann
Und nur ein Schwächling nimmt die Gruppe als Versteck an

Halten sich für unfickbar, doch das lässt sich ändern

Ich mag meinen Faustkampf so wie mein Steak
Blutig und ohne Beilage, weil ich einfach reinschlage

Und in den Medien tauchen Themen auf
Die jeden glauben lassen

Wenn's um Rettung geht, haben wir dicke Arme
Aber kleine Eier, als würden wir Testo nehmen
Sag mir, bin ich Teil der Lösung oder des Problems? (oh, oh)

Pendiendo de un hilo que me ata a su amor
Las quiero conmigo, o se me abre un abismo
Ya no existo
Vivo confundido perdiendo lo digno
Por amar a dos, amar a dos

Es que una me da su experiencia
Me encauza la vida
Con ella se aleja el temor
Mientras que esa chiquilla
Me da su inocencia
Y sin darse cuenta me resucitó
Y cuanta ironía, que historia la mía
Son las mejores amigas y bajo este acuerdo
La boca se calla y el juego que siga

Amar a dos
Es mi secreto escondido
Del fruto prohibido, vive un corazón
Amar a dos
Siempre camino en el filo
Pendiendo de un hilo que me ata a su amor me ata a su amor
Las quiero conmigo, o se me abre un abismo
Ya no existo
Vivo confundido perdiendo lo digno
Por amar a dos, amar a dos

Amar a dos
Hoy siento miedo, cuanto misterio oh, no, no

Poking they nose in our business, hoping that I don't come smoke 'em

I could fuck the culture up, probably rap

Speak when you spoken to and I don't have to read a fucking
Magazine or quotable to notice what you hoes will do

And show up at your residence, light your front door up
Get scared, life ain't fair

Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain

Black the fuck out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizarre can show you what violence is all about
And this Dr. Dre beat done brought it the fuck out
Run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
And blow your brains the fuck out!

Or maybe three or four of 'em

But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
Trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up
It's been two hours and six days and I'm still up
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill-up
Pick the new Cypress Hill up
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
And shatter his fucking lips with it

You build it up
You tear it down

You think you're a groove
Know how to move
But look like a clown

Without a doubt
When you get out
He's taking your place

Who's got a good face

Might as well be lead

All that he did
Is taking effect

To stop his chick
Spending his cash

She came and took

You can't relax
(Are you cuckoo)
Write a new line
Work overtime
To pay your tax

Stand in the queue
We'll see to you
If you're a success

You're in the hat
Just think of that
Same as the rest

Can't come too late

Bay City Rollers,"I phoned the local station
I kinda like the things they're playing
So I settled down to listen nice and easy.
The DJ plays our kind of music
He's asked us folk to choose it
But it all adds up to another
Night without you.

Now and then he takes a phone-in
And anyone who's feeling lonely
Can call him up
And make a little conversation
And in the night there's music playing
Soft behind the words he's saying
Would I like to make a dedication

This song I want to dedicate to you
And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me
The song will play on endlessly
I hope my dedication's getting through

I'm standing in this lonely city
There's not enough to keep me busy
And we can't meet til I can take
A short vacation
You'll never know how much I love you
Lying here thinking of you
And all I got is a late night music station

And to everyone who feels the way we do
As long as you're a part of me

I pushed the other guys too far

my soul forever.

We could spend our lives together,

Don't let the music die

I played the clown and Pantomime
Or was it just a dream that's gone
forever
Echoed voices from the past
Recall the songs I thought would last
And say ""Those times will never die""
And the love we share's the reason why

I remember all those days gone by
I remember all their faces,
The old familiar places

So much to say to forget

Yes it was real, I love New York
Yes it was real, I love New York
Yes it was, it was a real and a lie
Could it ever break you
Could it ever make you in New York
What's the time, as I think of her
Does it make a difference on the other side
She may well be sleeping now
So cover me up with the dreams we share
If we could sleep tonight
In this heated carpet magic city
Could she ever hear me now, calling out

Bay City Rollers,"Did anybody tell you how high the sky
Did anyone explore you, it's easy if you try
You say your life ain't easy
Living for the day
Your strength is in the knowing
That there is another way
Yes you are one, you are, you see
It's clear to me that you are still sleeping
Did anybody hear you when you said there's more
More the day, today assertion, did you find an open door
Journey through the high now
Let your spirit free
The present was tomorrow
It's so easy if you see
But only the young die old
Only fools are free
And time is a passing phase
So who holds the key

It's clear to me that you are still dreaming",Only the Young Die Old,1980

Bay City Rollers,"Headin' out of the city life,
Suitcase full of dreams
Trying to find some kind of memories
That didn't hold a distant scheme
Something she said I can't remember
But I answered her in turn all the same
And what I saw in her style
Well I'd seen it before
But somehow it looked quite different this time
Goodbye to all the friends I never had
Do you still remember me
Takin' care of all your business
You give it all away
And I wonder with all your broken dreams
and promises
If you ever knew me at all
For we are older now
But somehow you still look the same.
Say a prayer for the one you need
Too many here come back Saturday
Don't be concerned
There's too many words to say
Some things will never change
So many faces seemed to pass me by
I've had my share yes it's been used
Money talks, that's what they'd say to me
I'd only laugh at you confused
What used to be an old apartment
They've built a multi-colored jug-saw in the sky
And where the children would play
Well, they're not there anymore
But the rooms are nice with numbers on the door
But in her eyes there's a place for me
An open heart where I can hide away
Forget the changes
As life rearranges to something new
And will she wait for me
When all is said and done will she still be free
or will the chance be lost
Fro love is so hard to take
When dreams in the night are blown away
In her hand lies an opened book
She gives a sign then she turns the page
And in her smile she knows how it all will end
But in my eyes she sees
We're strangers in the wind",Strangers in the Wind,1999

I will never ever dater her
It's a shame how I'm barely getting love in this city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fucking with me

Pray to God they forgive me
They say when you blow up don't forget me

Ever since they made the lighter

Walk into your function on point I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her

Times like this make me clench my fist
Then I'm caught up in the midst of the musical bliss
Guru, blow a kiss to the ladies in my corner
Caress the mic, and kick my game like I want to
What?  You never see the brother Guru falter
Respect is due; praise me like the altar
The crew - we're as true as they come, son
We come from ill life experience, and take rap serious
Feel the music

We can make it, everybody

Just free your mind; sit back, relax, and unwind
To a higher plane, we're going

 Mmm is this really the end or is it a new beginning? 
 A new reality.. 
 Chorus: Guru + Baybe (repeat 2X) 
 So many misconceptions (don't be misled) 
 So many evil deceptions (oh I am) 
 I've come to give direction 
 For I am the lifesaver (the life) 
 [Guru] 
 Scooby doo wah scooby doo wee 
 Like a jazz player I improvise wisely 
 Free with the style, I flow like the Nile 
 but remember, don't mistake the smile 
 Deep rooted is my rhymin 
 Like ancient African griots, precise is my timing 
 But let me get to the essence of what I'm sayin here 
 Too many blood red streets with bodies layin there 
 The systematic fanatics are at it again 
 Tryin to kill me and all of us my friend 
 But don't bend to the mental strain 
 Against all odds, we must strive for essential gains 
 Be true to the life the Lord gave ya 
 And that's a message from the lifesaver 
 The lifesaver.. 
 Chorus 
 [Baybe] 
 Oh I am, the life (I.. am the lifesaver) 
 I am, the life.. yeah 
 [Guru] 
 It takes a more intelligent man to squash a fight 
 than to set one off, knowledge I'll let some off 
 Cause nowadays, everybody's a killer 
 And as for me, no other MC is iller 
 but still a thorn scrapes my heart 
 when I see another life that's been torn apart 
 over nonsense, no law, no order, it's evidence 
 that the money only takes precedence 
 Cause everybody wants power 
 While the innocent are born or die, during every hour 
 I scowl as I look upon evil 
 but I must have the strength, to spark awareness in my people 
 And we will learn to respect our neighbors 
 Another message from the lifesaver 
 The lifesaver.. 
 Chorus 
 [Guru] 
 People talk about the Armaggedeon 
 And nowadays everyone you know is packin lead son 
 Each day's another test 
 Aiyyo I better do my best, cause a lot's ridin on my chest 
 So when I lead you to the water, you best know 
 how to swim across, so you can reach the border 
 It's international, the message and the flavor 
 So here's some more important words from the lifesaver 
 The lifesaver.. (I am the life) 
 The lifesaver..

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

It's staring at the hallow, broken boy,
Who's lost and wandering these same old streets,
And every night I wander here alone,
A night that we won't meet

Why time can wash away love like,
It was made of sand,
And it's wonderful
The pain that comes with regret,
Sometimes you have to see the beauty,
In all of this loneliness

The streetlights flicker, and they fade,
Like every good intention that I've had,
And every face that passes through my mind,
And I'll be struggling with these same old dreams,
Until the concrete turns to sand,
And I'm swept up by the waves

I wonder when, when I'll finally understand,

Something that's this important,
Now I'd rather sink than swim
Sewer grates keep spitting up their steam,
Exhaling all the broken dreams I've flushed away

As the memory tied to it

Tried to forget that sickening stench
With everything I've got
You can't trust a heart that was cold from the start
You waste your time on it

And tell your friends that everything's alright

Should thank your lucky stars
For all the times you've been ashamed
You'll learn more from the harder times
Than times that you've been vain

The lesson you learned is priceless
If you can take a spin
You threw away your friends
As if drinks were all the friends you need

Cast your demons aside
Keep them close enough to know that your moving on

The fire used to burn
In your heart and in your eyes
You used to dream you used to care you used to love you used to fight
For anything at all
You cover up your bedroom wall with who u want to be
Now your afraid to be yourself so u search the mall for something else
You read magazines and watch MTV
You practiced it and everything
Oh your dressed to impressed but you look like a drag queen

[Chorus]

So keep your head up high
Stretch inches into miles
Because Brooklyn wasn't built in just a day
Focus on important things
Be your own gun like every ghost that held you down was gone
Keep them close enough to know that your moving on

Bayside,"If I knew it'd be this way
I'd do it all again
But I'd only change one thing
If I was give every chance change
I'd make it a point
To smile every day

So I'm cynical I guess
But whats left worth believing in

[Chorus]
Wicked are the ones who dare to think outside the box
I guess its
Righteous making money in the name of god
Think about what's right and wrong.
The same gray line we all live on
Oh, Sing out all the pain.

If this was my chance to shine
But I have to think twice
Cause it'd come as no surprise
If I did not know what to do
If I was caught off guard
Sometimes your luck because a curse that you can't forget about

So I'm cynical I guess
But whats left worth believing in
But you try, and you try.

By the light of blue and yellow neon signs
She wrote, “we’re gonna make it out one night”

Get a plan together, get your demons out

With a cigarette providing all the light

When I lit her candle I never thought to cry

And in the east, the dawn was breaking
And the world was waking

Wear sunscreen

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it
A long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
Than my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind
You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth
Until they've faded, but trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back
At photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now
How much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked
You are not as fat as you imagine

Don't worry about the future
Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing Bubble gum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind
The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. On some idle Tuesday
Do one thing every day that scares you

Saying, don't be reckless with other people's hearts
Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours

Floss

Don't waste your time on jealousy
Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself
Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults, if you succeed in doing this, tell me how
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements

Stretch

Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life.
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't
Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to your knees
You'll miss them when they're gone

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the 'Funky Chicken'
On your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
Or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it
It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own
Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
Read the directions even if you don't follow them
Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Some day a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out whenever I can

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings, they're your best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future

Understand that friends come and go
But a precious few, who should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle
For as the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young
Live in New York City once but leave before it makes you hard
Live in northern California once but leave before it makes you soft

Travel

Accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too, will get old
And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young
Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble
And children respected their elders

Respect your elders

Don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse
But you never know when either one might run out

Never mess too much with your hair
Or by the time you're 40 it will look 85

Be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it
Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past
From the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts
And recycling it for more than it's worth

But trust me on the sunscreen

Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Some day a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out whenever I can

Don't waste your time on jealousy
Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself
Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults, if you succeed in doing this, tell me how
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements

Stretch

Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life.
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't
Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to your knees
You'll miss them when they're gone

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the 'Funky Chicken'
On your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
Or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it
It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own
Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
Read the directions even if you don't follow them
Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Some day a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out whenever I can

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings, they're your best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future

Understand that friends come and go
But a precious few, who should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle
For as the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young
Live in New York City once but leave before it makes you hard
Live in northern California once but leave before it makes you soft

Travel

Accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too, will get old
And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young
Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble
And children respected their elders

Respect your elders

Don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse
But you never know when either one might run out

Never mess too much with your hair
Or by the time you're 40 it will look 85

Be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it
Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past
From the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts
And recycling it for more than it's worth

But trust me on the sunscreen

Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Some day a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out whenever I can

Everybody see it oh yeah yeah

Everybody see it oh yeah
He want you to feel good!",Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen) - The Speach Song,2002

When troubles come and my heart burdened be

Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, I despise 'cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

I said, war, good god, now, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing
Say it again, war, what is it good for?
Absolutely, nothing, listen to me

It's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No, you just have to wait,
You gotta trust, give it time,
No matter how long it takes;
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take.
How long must I wait how much more can I take,
Before loneliness will 'cause my heart, heart to break?
No, I can't bear to live my life alone.
I grow impatient for a love to call my own,
But when I feel that I, I can't go on,
These precious words keeps me hanging on,
I remember mama said,

Can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.

You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait,
She said love don't come easy,
It's a game of give and take
No matter how long it takes.

No love, love don't come easy,
But I keep on waiting, anticipating for that
Soft voice to talk to me at night,
For some tender arms to hold me tight.
I keep waiting; I keep on waiting,
But it ain't easy, it ain't easy when mama said

You can't hurry love no,
You just have to wait,
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes.

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home

You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.

His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

To make records with a mobile

Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight

I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was

Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory,1997

And you'll live as you've never lived before

On the 9th February 1935, in Buenos Aires--a polo

match, between a team of leading Argentine players and
the touring British side. The British ambassador said he
had never seen a social occasion quite like it. Even by the
standards of Buenos Aires society the gathering at the
polo ground glittered. The Rolls' and the Daimlers, the
hampers from Harrod's, the clothes, the diamonds, the
crystal, the wines, the procession of nannies from
England and France. The result of the match? Oh yes--
the home team won, but as the British ambassador
pointed out, that did not reflect badly on British
horsemanship. Three of the Argentine players were
educated at Eton.

You're a tramp, you're a treat, you will shine to the death, you are shoddy
But you're flesh, you are meat, you shall have every breath in my body

When I look back my eyes are filled with tears

Uncertain and surely hurting
Deserted by the blackbirds
And the staccato of the staff
And though you trust the light
Towards which you wend your way
Sometimes it feels all that you wanted
Has been taken away
You will walk
You will walk
You will walk in good company

I love the best in you
You love the best in me
Though it's not always easy
Lovely, lovely
We will walk
We will walk
We will walk in good company

Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends,
I know he'll (she'll) go with me until the end.

Everybody asks me how I know.
I smile at them and say he (she) told me so.
That's why I know, yes, I know,
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so.

Now if I call him (her) on the telephone,
And tell him (her) that I'm all alone,
By the time I count from one to four,I hear him (her) on my door.
In the evening when the sun does down,

When there is nobody else around,
He (she) kisses me and he (she) holds me tight.

And never get love
You'd better let love depart

I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad

You love me, then you snub me

We'll take the wackest song and make it better
Remember to let us into your skin
Cause then you'll begin, to master
Rhymin' rhymin' rhymin'

Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Looking for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience, I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckers on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage, and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no fronting just to say a little something
You suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothing
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My all-around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissing other people's [ass]
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attracting only women, got no time for little girls

Cause girls look so good but their brain is not ready
I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go

I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MC's back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did
I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction
You need protection when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe
You're a king, I'm a teacher
You're a b-boy, I'm a scholar
If this was a class, well it would go right under drama
See kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
Talking big words on the mic but still irrelevant
Especially when you're not college material
Wake up every morning to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott La Rock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MC's on the mic are fraud
Saying styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissing?
I am a musician
Rapping on the mic like this to me is fine
Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine
You can see that Scott La Rock and I are mentally binded
In other words we're both Criminal Minded

We're not promoting violence, we're just having some fun
He's Scott La Rock, I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone, relaxed and not tense
You waited, debated, and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See I have the formula for rocking the house
If you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth
It's that simple, no phony cosmetics for your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Say a rhyme for 87 not no 1983
Well versed, to rehearse, in my rhymes I might curse
Originality is first but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to making music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's 24 tracks
After years of rocking parties now I picked up the knack
Because everything that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?
I'm living in a city known as New York State
Sucker MC's gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians
Although our lives have been so uprooted
I haven't included, you can all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckers I be crushing
So now you are awakened to the music I be making
Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated
Don't get frustrated cause nothing has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ
You see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way

We pressed close to the moment
We were Siamese twins in ecstasy, in ecstasy

So we lay soul to soul as the archer of the night
United our hearts for our mutual delight
While the company derided me

Tie me up in your hair, I'm so easily led
Sink me deep in your oceans
Lock me up in your bedroom and lose the key
Oh, won't you lose that key?

Let me show you a sign pure as the virgin snow
Sail a while with me through my dreams
Hear the many enchanted themes
I will play for you in several keys of blue
Sing for you my swan song

Oh, strange, strange harmony
Oh, such a sad refrain
Feels like a thorn in the heart for me
Feels like I'm dying again

With our bodies on fire and our heads in a spin
We pressed close to the moment
We were Siamese twins in ecstasy

Let me give you the time to be your waterfall
We can bathe in the wine and the honey sublime
Till the last curtain call, till the curtain calls

Like the moon and the sun united as one
Like the nearly insane when the game is all done
We can't lose it all, we can't lose it all

Take me up for a ride, far from the stony ground
Glide the skies with me in my dreams
Hear the secrets of the themes
I will play for you in several shades of blue
Sing for you my swan song, swan song

Be Bop Deluxe,"The man who owned the heartache 
That lived on the stairs... 
Passed me in the night whistling ""Memories of You""... 

I stared, too frightened to move 
For fear my eyes shone a light 
On the darkness he drew like a cloak 
All around his shoulders... 

And the church on the corner 
Marked the time for the mother 
Who was giving birth to a child across the hall... 

And I waited half in anger, half in sadness 
For an answer to the call for help 
I had written on the wall 

And the rain fell like jewels 
On the heads of all the fools 
Who wandered crazed with their souls ablaze for me... 

And the blessing of the hour 
Was the twilight and the tower 
With its golden bell form the bottom of the sea... 

And the moon through the window of the bedroom 
Where lovers slumbered 
Made a silver dance of such dust beneath the bed... 

And I waited for a moment in the lamplight,

Listening to their hearts 
And the changing of their breath.

And movies in May

Going round in my head

With singing sad wires of council house mystics

And read the tea leaves,

To see us play our parts
We hoped you'd lend an ear
You hope we dress like tarts
But back stage we stand naked

All the make-up cleaned away
My poet sheds his pretty skin
And turns to face the day
And there's nothing to be done
No nothing to be said

Last night I felt immortal
This morning I feel dead
And the love that gave
Its blaze to my heart
Now brings a haze

Be careful, I'm an axe victim
Hung up on these silver strings
Like wings, like time machines
Like voices on the winds
We hit the road to Hull

Sad amps and smashed guitars
Played badly at The Duke
To almost no applause
But someone made it worthwhile

When shining with bright eyes
They gave me full attention
And took me by surprise
But today the feeling's gone

No, faded like a ghost
Last night I saw the future
This morning there's no hope
And the words that I sung so clear
Are now clouded by my tears

Please, be careful, I'm an axe victim
Hung up on these silver strings
Like sails, like seagulls cries
Like church bells in the night

I'm not the girl that I was before
Feel like I'm lying each time I walk through the door
Sleeping in my own bed feels like a sin
It's hard to sink back into my life again

Your clothes are all scattered through my room
Just like my memories of you
I want to tell you what I've done

But the tears in your eyes are beginning to run
I wanted to love you like I said I would
I know you don't believe me but I tried to be good

Now I feel trapped in a room that's not mine
Looking at all the things you left behind
It's strange to go through so much
And come home to all the same old stuff

I'm not the girl that I was before
Feel like I'm lying each time I walk through the door
Sleeping in my own bed feels like a sin
It's hard to sink back into my life again

I'm not the girl that I was before
Feel like I'm lying each time I walk through the door
Sleeping in my own bed feels like a sin
It's hard to sink back into my life again
