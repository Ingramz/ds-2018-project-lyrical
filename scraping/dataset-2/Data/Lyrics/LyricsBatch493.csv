Johnny Clegg,"Copper sun sinking low
Scatterlings and fugitives
Hooded eyes and weary brows
Seek refuge in the night
Chorus
They are the scatterlings of Africa
Each uprooted one
On the road to Phelamanga
Where the world began
I love the scatterlings of Africa
Each and every one
In their hearts a burning hunger
Beneath the copper sun
Ancient bones from Olduvai
Echoes of the very first cry
""Who made me here and why
Beneath the copper sun?""
African idea
African idea
Make the future clear
Make the future clear
Chorus.....
And we are the scatterlings of Africa
Both you and I
We are on the road to Phelamanga
Beneath a copper sky
And we are the scatterlings of Africa
On a journey to the stars
Far below, we leave forever

I feel weak and strong at the same time

Beyond the dying of the light
She takes me
Beyond reason and the trinity
Beyond the sun and out of sight

That girl is feeling
Trapped by that ring on her finger
Ushadile (she's married)
Some man thought he shot her down,
But he only winged her
Ushadile (she's married)
Trapped by the ring on her finger...

Such a dangerous affinity
In such a deadly disguise
Hot summer nights and other promises
She carries in her married eyes
Oh no, uh no, oh she did it again
Oh no, uh no, she did it again

So you come around here
And you do it again,

I will show you something to see
It's a picture of a man, I used to be

But these days I'm running through the dark

In the badlands, oh, give it to me

African shadow man
Tell me the future if you can, tell it to me
There's magic in your hands
Touch my life and set me free

I am a refugee in a world that once was mine
Hunting my tomorrow on the edge of time
But these days I'm running through the dark

Johnny Clegg,"Oh no, you've gone again
I feel like Daniel in the lion's den
Stone cold in the afternoon
So alone in the empty room
They say that four walls do not a prison make
I'm trying to find a way out but there seems no escape
When I feel the hidden power that lies inside your sound
Like the ghost inside the atom that spins it round and round
There's magic in some words, some things you can't explain
That conjures up that feeling of the sun inside the rain

[Chorus]
When the wind is blowing like a lonesome train
I reach out and touch you and I call your name
When the night is lonely and I fear the coming day
I reach out and touch you
And I call your name -- ngibiza igama lakho

Oh no, don't let the sun go down
I'm so low, I feel underground
There's no easy road and no easy way
To say the things I have to say
'Cause I know that time is a distance and distance is a space
I've come so far to find you, it's you I can't replace
When I feel the hidden power that lies inside your sound
Like the ghost inside the atom that spins it round and round
There's magic in some words some things you can't explain
That conjures up that feeling of the sun inside the rain

[Chorus]",I Call Your Name,1994
Johnny Clegg,"Something broke the place where the rain is bornb
Something stole the promise from the light of dawn
People, people were everywhere struggling to get their share
Honest cruelty in the eyes of the innocent
Squeezing one more harvest from this tired earth
They call to you, but the wind just blows away their words
Didn't believe in miracles, didn't believe you'd come
Didn't see any reason to carry on

Chorus:
But in my african dream, you touched my face
Raised up my children and gave them grace
In my african dream you wiped away my tears
And whispered the promise of a thousand years

Children with eyes like souls ready to fly
Looking at me -- for some kind of sacred sign
Who will teach the young, the names of the ancient ones
Who will tell them from whence they come
I have no answer, don't even have a prayer
All I can do is close my eyes and hope that you will be thre

In my african dream you blessed the rain
Let me stand proud, eased the pain,
You raised me up,
Gave me love, filled my cup.

Old man sits in the shade of the thorn treee
He says ""these thorns are all that are true
Life is suffering, suffering is life,
Be happy with the small things that come to you
They will come to you, come to you.""

Chorus
",In My African Dream,1994
Johnny Clegg,"Shine a light, shine a light

Oh you've got to careful in this world a little sister said to me
Beware of the silver tongue which hides a gun and a tyranny
It will speak in words of water
It will drown you in its lies
You must be like the fish in the river
Ad learn to swim against the tide

CHORUS:
Some of de man give light in de darkness
Some of de man he give a cry
Some of de man he gonna live through the season
Some of de man he gonna die
Yo yo mam ye!

The wheel turn around
Give me no rest
She want to hear me cry
In the darkness
- Shine a light!
I drop to the ground
And hope for the best
I'm going through the eye
Of the hurricane
- Shine a light!

Oh it's such a sad feeling to see the swallows in the sky
It's like you leaving me behind without saying goodbye
I've got to be like a bird in winter
I've got to learn how to fly
And if you ever leave
I'll also take to the sky

CHORUS

Speak to me slow slow
What's going on
I don't know
Someone's on the run
Speak to me slow slow
Has it all begun
I don't know
If he'll make this one
Speak to me slow slow
What's the time
Idon't know
Can I save this life of mine

CHORUS



",Shine a Light,1994
Johnny Clegg,"Chorus
Take my heart away (repeat)

To be the sound of wild geese calling
To be ten seasons in a night
To dance the sun beyond the tides of war and peace
To put silence stained by crimes to flight
I need to heart-break-loose-the wind
Dedela umoya wami, baba
(set my spirit free, father)

Chorus

To see your eyes shine like two desert stars
To see life burning with a mission
To break the empty circle of living and dying
To leave a child with a vision
I need to heart-break-loose-the wind
Dedela umoya wami, baba
(set my spirit free, father)

Chorus

Sing me the songs that won the battle
Sing me the first and the last man's glory
Sing me the songs that taste of freedom

",Ibhola Lethu,1995
Johnny Clegg,"Rain falling like a symphony
On the roof top of my heart
There's a movement in the whispering deep
Before the new dream starts
I see your eyes shining like a neon light .
Smiling in the dark - What made you so strong ?
-What made you so strong ?
I've seen you dealing in the market place
Buying political regrets
And you've been walking on the water again
But your feet never ever get wet
But you just say...

Chorus: Afrika kukhala abangcwele
(Africa your innocent weep)
I light a candle for the innocent ones
I light a candle for our love
Say a prayer for peace on earth
For the daughters and the sons

And your life is like a cheap street fight
And you're laughing in the dark - What
Made you so strong ? (repeat)
I've been waiting all my life for this
To see how the deal gees down -
There's an AK 47 on the dashboard
And mercy's left this town, and you say...

Chorus: Afrika kukhala abangcwele !

",Africa,1996
Johnny Clegg,"Long ago there was a sound in the night
Kwela man, singing under the street light
A cheap guitar, he gave his sorrow a smile
And he sowed his songs in the alley ways mile upon mile

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela
Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela
Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Living low with the Pennywhistle, tea-chest base gang
I followed him home and he danced as he sang
But now he's gone, not even the slightest traces
Of a Kwela song and the street is full of empty spaces

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela
Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela
Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
You gave it your life

Nobody knows, did he survive the winding road?
Did he find a song that took him back to the heartland?
Here I stand, lost in the memory
Of a Kwela man, singing in the long gone twilight

When I followed you home Kwela man
You filled my soul, Kwela, Kwela
When you sang your song Kwela man
You gave it your life

Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man
Ye hum ho la la Kwela, Kwela
Ye hum ho la lo Kwela man

Dying to get through to you

Living through a war in peace time
To get through to you
On your face, love, days and sorrow
So long we struggled on

Pockets of love still hold out in the ruins
Old memories sent me reinforcements
But they were ambushed on high ground
I'm living through a war in peace time
Dying to get through to you

Waiting for you to come again
To hear the words spill from your lips
""the system has fallen""

Mass action on the radio
Like a great river ebbs and flows
Carrying us to the final close
When the system has fallen

I know that you are tired and weary
Seen too much to believe any more
But we have to keep moving down that long road
If we want to reach that far shore.

Chorus:
We're on our way home to find our freedom
And I'm on my way home to find you my friend

And breathe life into the land again.

[we are still hoping and we still believe
We wil reach our final destination]

Hey! you! if you dance in the shadows
The shadows will cover you
And paralyse all the hope in your eyes
That you'll need to bring you shining through
Could you believe that I am your brother?
Could you believe that I am your friend?
And although I don't speak the language you speak
We could be closer than you have ever dreamt.

To find my stolen jewel.

A cheap guitar, he gave his sorrow a smile
And he sowed his songs in the alley ways mile upon mile

But now he's gone, not even the slightest traces
Of a Kwela song and the street is full of empty spaces

Did he find a song that took him back to the heartland?
Here I stand, lost in the memory
Of a Kwela man, singing in the long gone twilight

When I followed you home Kwela man
You filled my soul, Kwela, Kwela
When you sang your song Kwela man

I'm a foot without a shoe, I'm the fuzz without a clue
I'm a ship without a crew, I'm lost without you
One and one that can't make two, carrots looking for some stew
A lawyer with no one to sue, I'm lost without you
I'm the sky that's lost it's blue, I'm the beer that just won't brew
I'm a stamp that has no glue, I'm lost without you
A hound with no fox to pursue, I'm a cat that's lost it's mew
A star without an interview, I'm lost without you

Johnny Clegg & Savuka,"You are a dreamer of dreams walking a lonely shore
Dream if you will but remember there are iron laws
However much you seek to solve this mystery
No one ignores the iron vice of history
All those gone before dreamed to escape
They tried to fly over the palisades

Standing at the gates
This is Jericho
And the walls reach up to the stars
And outside we were singing psalms
Such a strange, strange place
For we are the prisoners
Of the prisoners we have taken
And the prophets' dreams are now forsaken

Sing me the songs of a world that I once knew
Recall the legends once so proud and true
My people used to live here not so long ago
But they fled into the night and I was left alone
I guard these walls for you and me
Dream on, sail on my memory

Standing at the gates
This is Jericho
And the walls reach up to the stars
And outside we were singing psalms
Such a strange, strange place
For we are the prisoners

And the prophets' dreams are now forsaken",Jericho,1989

Faces melting in the african rain
So many seasons of silent war
So many drowned before they reached the shore
Nothing is clear to me any more in this sad and strange landscape
I've got no defense, I've got no attack
I can't leave, I can't stay and I've got no way back
Hard to deal with the way things have been
I can't lie but the truth is so extreme

Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine
Hide me deep inside your borders in these dark and troubled times
Remember me my innocence before I drowned in the sea of lies
Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine

Too many seasons of quiet rage
Too many young people just wasted away
Too many futures hanging in the balance
Too much owing nothing left to pay
A lonely flag flutters in the breeze
For the hardened hearts who still want to believe
Am I the witness or am I the crime
A victim of history or just a sign of the times
Across my heart questions and shadows still fly
But in the dead of the night I know where the answer lies

Woman be my country, 'till my country can be mine
I have no flag, I sing no anthem, I no longer carry an armalite
Bathe me in you sweet rivers, anoint me with your touch and your smile
To your colours I give my allegiance, I lay it on the line

Ngikhathele ngifile zindaba zakho

Here we stand waiting on the plain
Darkness has taken the last outpost of the day
Somewhere gunships hunt their illusive prey
And I know inside you feel the same way

And the jackals howl inside
I see you walking with your head down
Tomorrow is always betrayed
By too much hope displayed

Seen too much to believe any more

If we want to reach that far shore.

And paralyse all the hope in your eyes

Could you believe that I am your friend?
And although I don't speak the language you speak
We could be closer than you have ever dreamt.

Before the new dream starts
I see your eyes shining like a neon light .
Smiling in the dark - What made you so strong ?

I've seen you dealing in the market place
Buying political regrets
And you've been walking on the water again
But your feet never ever get wet
But you just say...

I light a candle for the innocent ones
I light a candle for our love
Say a prayer for peace on earth
For the daughters and the sons

And your life is like a cheap street fight
And you're laughing in the dark - What
Made you so strong ? (repeat)

To see how the deal gees down -
There's an AK 47 on the dashboard
And mercy's left this town, and you say...

Fill my soul, Africa, don't let me go, Africa

And in the jungle afternoon, he plays polo when he's bored

For with guns you cannot fight a foe that dwells within
But the battle had begun and a soldier he's become
Who can sing his litany?
It's a beggarman?s prayer or a string on the wind
Will that be all that lingers on the memory?

And who will remember that African December?
When he knelt before the colors and swore to do or die?
And he kissed his frightened lover, beneath the glowing embers
Of that dark, strange heaven, that ancient sky
Now he's gone to dust, just like all good soldiers must
But the mournful mutter of the battlefield still lingers in the air

Goodbye gentle ladies of the old order
And farewell to your islands carved upon this continent

Let me stand proud, eased the pain,

Life is suffering, suffering is life,
Be happy with the small things that come to you
They will come to you, come to you.""

Chorus
",In My African Dream,1994
Johnny Clegg & Savuka,"Shine a light, shine a light

Oh you've got to careful in this world a little sister said to me
Beware of the silver tongue which hides a gun and a tyranny
It will speak in words of water
It will drown you in its lies
You must be like the fish in the river
Ad learn to swim against the tide

CHORUS:
Some of de man give light in de darkness
Some of de man he give a cry
Some of de man he gonna live through the season
Some of de man he gonna die
Yo yo mam ye!

The wheel turn around
Give me no rest
She want to hear me cry
In the darkness
- Shine a light!
I drop to the ground
And hope for the best
I'm going through the eye
Of the hurricane
- Shine a light!

Oh it's such a sad feeling to see the swallows in the sky
It's like you leaving me behind without saying goodbye
I've got to be like a bird in winter
I've got to learn how to fly
And if you ever leave
I'll also take to the sky

CHORUS

Speak to me slow slow
What's going on
I don't know
Someone's on the run
Speak to me slow slow
Has it all begun
I don't know
If he'll make this one
Speak to me slow slow
What's the time
Idon't know
Can I save this life of mine

CHORUS



",Shine a Light,1994
Johnny Clegg & Savuka,"Chorus
Take my heart away (repeat)

To be the sound of wild geese calling
To be ten seasons in a night
To dance the sun beyond the tides of war and peace
To put silence stained by crimes to flight
I need to heart-break-loose-the wind
Dedela umoya wami, baba
(set my spirit free, father)

Chorus

To see your eyes shine like two desert stars
To see life burning with a mission
To break the empty circle of living and dying
To leave a child with a vision
I need to heart-break-loose-the wind
Dedela umoya wami, baba
(set my spirit free, father)

Chorus

Sing me the songs that won the battle
Sing me the first and the last man's glory
Sing me the songs that taste of freedom
Thread me through with your sacred needle

Johnny Clegg & Savuka,"Yashimbawula! (the watchman's fire is burning)
What happened to the diamonds in your eyes,
What happened to the hunger for the day's chase?
What happened to the electric smile

That danced across your face
We used to talk about changing the world
Now all you want to do is change your name
Come on baby don't surrender now

To the empty heart of these days.
We used to talk so deep into the night
You had the heart of a wild horse running
You bared your soul to me
And we both knew these days were coming

[Chorus]
These days -- blood in the heavens
These days -- fire and ice
These days -- burning streets and visions
These days -- of the loveless child

Yashimbawula!
You were the reason I came here
You will always be the one I am looking for
I can't stand to see the way

These days are pushing you against the wall
Got to get up, got to move out
Face the tide beyond the door
Outside there's a whole world changing

We can't stand here, trapped inside
Let's step out and test the weazther
Hang on baby, it's going to ge a rough ride through'

[Chorus]
These days -- searching for a vision
These days -- gun metal blue
These days -- changing my religion
These days -- heartless and cruel

Say the words and fill my sails
I will love you through the coming gale
We'll get through the darkest heart of these days
""It's killing time""

Who will watch the watchers?
Who will keep the keepers?
Who will love the lovers -- could you?

Johnny Clegg & Savuka,"You are the rolling ocean
You are the mighty sea
You are the breath that brings each new day to me
You are what you are, you are
You be what you are, you be what you are

Some came to conquer
Some came to understand
Some came to live their lives as best they can
Me, I looked up at the stars to find my way
But I was young and I got them mixed up
And so forgot my name
As I tried to remember you were standing next to me
While other came seeking power
You, you had come to set them free

You are the rolling ocean
You are the mighty sea
You are the breath that brings each new day to me
You are what you are, you are
You be what you are, you be what you are

Women of salt and earth
They tell the same story
They saw you walking wounded
Wearing rags of glory
And when you rejoiced they saw you smiling at your rejoicing
When you wept they saw you smiling at your weeping
When you smiled they saw you smiling at your smiling
And you said that's the way I've survived these years of dust and
Blood.

You are the rolling ocean
You are the mighty sea
You are the breath that brings each new day to me
You are what you are, you are
You be what you are, you be what you are

Suffer little children
Suffer sister, brother too
Suffer mother, father
That's all the world can promise you
In our hearts we feel it
A mighty dream is coming true
Hold on and we'll dream it
Keep it up we're going to push it through

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

In your heart believe what in my heart I know

And then the time will come
When all the waiting's done
The time when you return and find me here and run

I tossed and I turned
That old feeling's still the same
It was so real, I woke up cold and sweating
I wonder did I call her name?

In the dream she was right there with me
Right there with me in the bed
She said, ""Bobby, come and kiss me""
""Never leave me"" is what she said
But when I reached out to hold her
Oh, I woke my wife instead

Once again, once again, I had the dream
Six years since I've seen her
Ain't no doubt about what it means, no, no
I tried hard not to think about her
But all she left me was this dream

All she left me was the dream
All she left me was a dream

I dreamed I called her name

I dreamed I held my baby in my arms

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""

Johnny Costa,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

After it brought my lover near

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me

I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Seems a downright shame... 
TODD: Shame? 
LOVETT:
Seems an awful waste... 
Such a nice, plump frame
Wot's 'is name has... 
Had... 
Has! 
Nor it can't be traced... 
Bus'ness needs a lift, 
Debts to be erased... 
Think of it as thrift, 
As a gift, 
If you get my drift! 

No? 

Seems an awful waste... 
I mean, with the price of meat
What it is, 
When you get it, 
If you get it... 

TODD: HAH! 
LOVETT:
Good, you got it! 

Take, for instance, Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop! 
Bus'ness never better using only pussycats and toast! 
And a pussy's good for maybe six or seven at the most! 
And I'm sure they can't compare as far as taste! 

[Simultaneously]

TODD:
Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion
LOVETT:
Well, it does seem a waste... 

TODD:
Eminently practical
And yet appropriate as always! 
LOVETT:
It's an idea... 

TODD:
Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived
Without you all these years, I'll never know! 
How delectable! 
Also undetectable! 
LOVETT:
Think about it! 
Lots of other gentlemen'll
Soon be comin' for a shave, 
Won't they? 
Think of
All them
Pies! 

TODD:
How choice! 

How
Rare! 

TODD:
For what's the sound of the world out there? 
LOVETT:
What, Mr. Todd? 
What, Mr. Todd? 
What is that sound? 
TODD:
Those crunching noises pervading the air! 
LOVETT:
Yes, Mr. Todd! 
Yes, Mr. Todd! 
Yes, all around! 
TODD:
It's man devouring man, my dear! 
BOTH:
And [LOVETT: Then] who are we to deny it in here? 

TODD: (spoken) These are desperate times, 
Mrs. Lovett, and desperate measures are called for! 
LOVETT: Here we are, now! Hot out of the oven! 
TODD: What is that? 

LOVETT:
It's priest. Have a little priest.
TODD:
Is it really good? 
LOVETT:
Sir, it's too good, at least! 
Then again, they don't commit sins of the flesh, 
So it's pretty fresh.
TODD:
Awful lot of fat.
LOVETT:
Only where it sat.
TODD:
Haven't you got poet, or something like that? 
LOVETT:
No, y'see, the trouble with poet is
'Ow do you know it's deceased? 
Try the priest! 

TODD: (spoken) Heavenly! 
Not as hearty as bishop, perhaps, 
But then again, not as bland as curate, either! 

LOVETT:
And good for business, too -- always leaves you wantin' more! 
Trouble is, we only get it on Sundays! 

Lawyer's rather nice.
TODD:
If it's for a price.
LOVETT:
Order something else, though, to follow, 
Since no one should swallow it twice! 
TODD:
Anything that's lean.
LOVETT:
Well, then, if you're British and loyal, 
You might enjoy Royal Marine! 
Anyway, it's clean.
Though of course, it tastes of wherever it's been! 
TODD:
Is that squire, 
On the fire? 
LOVETT:
Mercy no, sir, look closer, 
You'll notice it's grocer! 
TODD:
Looks thicker, 
More like vicar! 
LOVETT:
No, it has to be grocer --
It's green! 

TODD:
The history of the world, my love --
LOVETT:
Save a lot of graves, 
Do a lot of relatives favors! 
TODD:
Is those below serving those up above! 
LOVETT:
Ev'rybody shaves, 
So there should be plenty of flavors! 
TODD:
How gratifying for once to know
BOTH:
That those above will serve those down below! 

LOVETT: (spoken) Now let's see, here... We've got tinker.
TODD: Something... pinker.
LOVETT: Tailor? 
TODD: Paler.
LOVETT: Butler? 
TODD: Subtler.
LOVETT: Potter? 
TODD: Hotter.
LOVETT: Locksmith? 

Lovely bit of clerk.
TODD:
Maybe for a lark.
LOVETT:
Then again there's sweep
If you want it cheap
And you like it dark! 
Try the financier, 
Peak of his career! 
TODD:
That looks pretty rank.
LOVETT:
Well, he drank, 
It's a bank
Cashier.
Never really sold.
Maybe it was old.
TODD:
Have you any Beadle? 
LOVETT:
Next week, so I'm told! 
Beadle isn't bad till you smell it and
Notice 'ow well it's been greased... 
Stick to priest! 

(spoken) Now then, this might be a little bit stringy, 
But then of course it's... fiddle player! 
TODD: No, this isn't fiddle player -- it's piccolo player! 
LOVETT: 'Ow can you tell? 
TODD: It's piping hot! 
LOVETT: Then blow on it first! 

TODD:
The history of the world, my sweet --
LOVETT:
Oh, Mr. Todd, 
Ooh, Mr. Todd, 
What does it tell? 
TODD:
Is who gets eaten, and who gets to eat! 
LOVETT:
And, Mr. Todd, 
Too, Mr. Todd, 
Who gets to sell! 
TODD:
But fortunately, it's also clear
BOTH:
That [L: But] ev'rybody goes down well with beer! 

LOVETT: (spoken)
Since marine doesn't appeal to you, 'ow about... rear admiral? 
TODD: Too salty. I prefer general.
LOVETT: With, or without his privates? ""With"" is extra.

TODD: What is that? 
LOVETT:
It's fop.
Finest in the shop.
And we have some shepherd's pie peppered
With actual shepherd on top! 
And I've just begun --
Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily, 
Have one! 
TODD:
Put it on a bun.
Well, you never know if it's going to run! 
LOVETT:
Try the friar, 
Fried, it's drier! 
TODD:
No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy! 
LOVETT:
Then actor, 
That's compacter! 
TODD:
Yes, and always arrives overdone! 
I'll come again when you have JUDGE on the menu! 

LOVETT: (spoken) Wait! True, we don't have judge yet, 
But we've got something you might fancy even better.
TODD: What's that? 
LOVETT: Executioner! 

TODD:
Have charity towards the world, my pet!

Yes, yes, I know, my love! 
TODD:
We'll take the customers that we can get!

I was high and mighty
And I told my heart
Where to stop and start,

Rearrange things,
Oh, what strange things
Love can do!

We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop 


At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop 


Pop! Pop! Pop! 




There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy

We remember all through our lives

Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)
Then slowly turn away
I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day, of the years

Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)",Angel de La Mañana,2006

Now she's gone and left me
I'm worried as can be
Oh I've searched this world all over
Wonderin' where she could be
I would ask that she forgive me
And maybe she'll come back to me

But I doubt it

Never mistreat your woman

Lost my fire

Completely numb, left with no satisfaction

I swear, I was not looked

Loves me back

In a heart shape come around me and then
Melt me slowly down
If love were a human it would know me
In a lost space come and show me 
Hold me and control me and then
Melt me slowly down

I'd sure like to spend the night with you

Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me
Stranger, could I believe in you

Maybe you keep rollin' like a stone
Maybe some old lonesome song'll take you by surprise
And leave you just a little more alone

Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground

I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow
I bless that happy day when Nellie lost her way
For I found her when the snow was on the ground

I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them in the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground

I wonder if I'm doing the best I could

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but
You wouldn't know me if I was
You'd say I was a stranger just because
You'd say I wasn't weak enough for you
You'd want me just to feel as you do too

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but
You shouldn't tell me what to do
I'll only take the brakes off if you do
And roll around like marbles on the floor
Please pick me up and roll me out the door

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but

I guess I'm happy as I am
Sometimes I find it hard to be a man
It easier just to play the same old game
Of trying to forget my bloody name

I could be somewhere else
I should be someone else but
How are you? I'm Mr,
I know what I'm called
It's just you got me
You've got me
You've got me stalled",Brown Trout Blues,2008

And I can almost smell you
But the winds are up at the walls again

I can hear you coming
Heaven helped you coming

Did you learn just how I loved you?
Did you see how far I'd been?
Would you meet me in an hour?
I could tell you what I've seen
What I've seen

Cold bread
Cold bread
We had

Would you whine in water
Pull your chips back in
So you crawl like a crab across black fries bridge
Suffer none to fade
Hit the homeward road
I'm a bowling green
A delivery boy

Have a heart that skips a beat
Oh come on
Roll along for free
In the middle of the morning
Swap your drinking nights with me
With me

[Chorus: x2]

I can live with dying
I can chew my bit
Play panic to my senses
And hijack my head
It's the rhythm of moving
And a rolling and a rattle
Its a giving instead
It's a well sprung bed
We can roll around forever
We can pray for all we've been
We can knock it hell for leather
We can call it all a dream
All a dream

For your outward bound
Remember what we found",Cold Bread,2008
Johnny Flynn,"There's a man at hand
There's a way between
The sinking sand
And a crooked dream
And collared off at the modern age of nine
Summoned off for walking down the line

[Chorus]
They lost eyes in old city streets
Where the funeral pyres burned the last of the meek

He filled his boots
And he tipped his cap
And a root to toot
With the boss and that
And told a girl of the summer by the sea
Said to her would you like to go with me

Wind is turned
And the Tonka trucks
And the singers changed
And the hard to soft
In with changes, always out with time
Nothing left but walking down the line

[Chorus]

Dragging loose less through the den
And I come out less with sporting wear
More to fit than you'd be feeling now
She is aware that he is always how

Then her sweetness and his sweeter scented
And her fury's swimming till the fury's bended
And lost in all might be to lost in time
What joy the darts might be to walk the line

Johnny Flynn,"There are ten thousand graves in Hong Kong Protestant Cemetery
Every one of them says ""born and died, and the rest might be history""
Walking there I'd cry
For my love was there to lie
I never knew shame to be so refreshing
I'd sing Georgia on my mind, she would be, I'd be progressing...

Was the day of the boats for the fellas in coats in the Navy
They'd be all around, change the face of this town cos they're lazy
1952 was the year that I lost you
I was with the soldiers in the school hall
Didn't know that you were ill
You didn't seem old

China so you so blue so who's aboard the boatsie stay
Some people are fixing the terrible 
Mixing the crew of all the sailors say,

Your life might be a a mess of lights
When your on your won

And these hungry voices make a lot of noise inside my head
Show me the way to the rubbish dump or the bins at closing time
I'd walk a mile just to catch a smile from a fish without its brine

Been hanging round the underground
Found a couple of crumbs down there
Was lucky and got some flirts
From a girl with long brown hair
She said her name was Mary May and
She liked the springtime, oh
She said she left the meal
Half ate she said she left the crusts of toast

[Chorus]
Leftovers is what I want
Don't need no fine cuisine
Give me a dime for bacon rind
Or slip me some of that old sardine

She'd been seeing a man named Jim
I said I didn't mind
Said the second place is just my style
I'd glasses for the line
I knew she was keen to come and
I knew I'd met my match
I was sure that I had locked the door
And she had dropped the latch

[Chorus]

I said ""bring your dark eyes honey""
She said ""you bring yours""
Said I don't take second glance
So she walked out the door
I walked after her it weighed me down
And asked her why she left
She said she only dealt leftovers
And that all else felt like theft

[Chorus: x2]

If you see her, say hello
She'll be out handing scraps
But don't be fooled, her heart is ruled
By forces off the maps

Crawl along the shore
Well must be someone's son
They thought
They should have thought some more

Sally saw the boy come near
Right beneath the sun
Breathing hard and cockle proud
And Sally's heart was won

Not a face she'd seen
All whispered through her ready lips
I'll be the best I've been

Grubby mitts, saving grace
Hope to live, or wait to die

Bring nature to their deviled lives

Aging in their passing fads

Johnny Flynn,"Shore to shore, got some land between
Island life is living from a cup of broken queens 
Hit the jackpot rolling through a pipe dream in a knot
And I'm missing what was pissing up the wall that I forgot
I forgot, I forgot

I am the bus driver, give me some grace
You've never seen me and you don't know my face
She was no Hattie Carroll it was cold, it was blue
And it only happened despite me or you
Me or you, me or you

Smoking paper to the crimson flashing bars
Drinking cocktail wine or cottage cream and passing strangers' cars
Live in one room housing with a roof to meet the sky
Spelling Jesus won't you please us 'cos you seem a damn nice guy
Damn nice guy, damn nice guy

We listened to passengers stamping old songs
And we lose what's to lose when you haven't done wrong
Drums too slow for a funeral beat
No strumming of strings and no stamping of feet
Of feet, of feet

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me
And it's not so hard to see you smoking fags and drinking tea
It's the crummy lost at seasick with a floating on the waves
To join the other flotsam with the ripped up queens and knaves
Queens and knaves, queens and knaves

There lies a lady, she's gone and she's gone
She'll be a fine lady before too long
But I hit her head and she finished her walking
She shouldn't be dead, she was too busy talking
Busy talking, busy talking

They can fill a cup or two and still disturb the peace
It's never made it all the way from shore to shore, from west to east
I read that independence was a lightness in your step
You walked away, I felt so heavy at the start of every day
Every day, every day

I've been waiting an hour and the bus hasn't come
I've been cursing my God for the lack of the sun
I've been ruined by destiny, lowered by fate

Johnny Flynn,"I knew no vices and I knew no sins

And oh underground, I was that far from the tree

We're all digging if you wanna know
Fixing, digging, far too slow
Far too slow

We dug for money, we shoveled four tons
And the end wasn't funny, though we'd all had fun
Limping and broken, the tunnel fell in
I've been limping from tunnels since my original sin
Birthright's a trouble, my father dug too
He got where he was going at the age of 62

We're all digging if you wanna know

A new pair of boots and a chisel in your name
Says we could be in the same hole attracting the same blame
If I knew the way to the ornamental tree
I would tell you, we'd be jailbirds, I'd be winking twice for free

Do you suppose they'd swap their blood for wine
Like you swapped yours for ink, for ink

You wrote me oh so many letters
And all of them seemed true
Promises look good on paper
Especially from you, from you

The weight of all those willing words
I carried all alone
You wouldn't put your pen to bed
When we hadn't found our own, our own

And soon I'll eat his flesh
I'm alone again before the altar
Shedding all my old regrets

The last of which I'll tell you now
As it flies down the sink
I never knew a part of you
You didn't set in ink, in ink

The letters that you left behind
No longer shall I read
Your blood's between the pages
And I can't stand to see you bleed

And I'll soon forget what was never there

Leave me holding, leave my soul

Nothing I don't need at all

Yay from the bins, in the parks
Made off with the raps after dark
Never left a trail, never made his mark
When he gave me the raps after dark
Calling all his friends, never made him sad
With all the things he never had
It only made them feel so bad
For having the things he never had

If you stay in that box overnight
Don't get out till it gets light
There's not much lost of the secret life

See his footprints see his stones",The Box,2008

And the glowing mold of fear

Slapping sense to its peak and a hard strung out week

You just the same never burnt but lit
With a world at war and my thoughts on you
I didn't care to fall, there wasn't much to do

And the worst and best of all we knew
Stayed out to rust in the morning dew

Churlish May when the year was fair
Gone full circle when things went square
Ate my meal an un-noble beast
Left me to pay not a movable feast
Look I got nothing, dunno where I am
Got a fistful of questions, not an answer to hand

And the worst and best of all we knew
Stayed out to rust in the morning dew
Morning dew
With a blow me down the road, dead in the wood

Further from you now, then the roots from the leaves
Drunk on the wood, never seen any trees
My ore's out the water and the lake that I'm sailing
Is your dear father's daughter and it's cold and I'm ailing
Are you drowning me slowly, was the school meant to teach
Are you leaving so slowly, where's the shore, where's the beach?

And the worst and best of all we knew
Stayed out to rust in the morning dew",Churlish May,2010

Who are choking on what
And the will to hold on
With their principles pinned
To the courts up above

Quit my lonesome blues'

And bathed the time in light
She came to the conclusion
That he hadn't won the fight
'Put your gloves back on,' she says
'And steady with your pride
You've dealt the eldest hand my love
But that part of me has died'

I'm a fortune telling concubine
I'm a troubleshot saloon

And you're light as a balloon
I'd rather chase my options now
And place you in the past
The future's not yet written
Though the die behind me is cast
The die behind me is cast

I don't know anything about you
But I'm sure that the doors of perception
Are true in their ways
In the face of it all
In the stark-staring face of it

I'll tell you where I've been

That the fibre of wind is as new from my lip
As was ever and more and ever will be

Stand enthralled of that, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of Sweet William's embrace

William's wanderings took him abroad
Showed him the lay of the searcher's long road
To the place he stood now 'neath the black laden sky
And the crook of his father had brought fortune nigh
Read the sign where he looked, Not the bull, nor the bear
Nor a burly red lion, or the tortoise and hare

For we in the love of an earth-bidden dance
Stand enthralled of it, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of Sweet William's embrace

The end of the world was the name of the inn
Said fair William farewell to the world and its sin
Its sin

Full balmy was the winter air
All wet with what might die
A wishing well, the ocean bear
A millpond in his eyes
A glance to see from whence he came
For William with a landlocked turn
Vermin what he stood to lose
The skin-shot snakes and earthy worms

His boots trod soft inside the inn
His greeted all was here
Abrasive lowly nods came back
Then bent toward their beer
They must know I thought Willy now
They've seen me come from miles
The thought was struck as whisky poured
And barmen gave all smiles

Then followed this a curious thing
The eldest of the host
Sang softly where he sat and drank
To love a worthy toast
His song was of a stranger
Summoned for his rope
In all would be to set us free
His song was strong and bold,
It went

For we in the love of an earth-bidden dance
Stand enthralled of that, which from heaven, perchance
Lets us move with the gifts we were given in grace
And smile in the arms of Sweet William's embrace

The river is always my home
Lord, take me away 
For I just cannot stay
Or I'll sink in my skin and my bones

The water sustains me without even trying
The water can't drown me, I'm done
With my dying

Please help me build a small boat
One that'll ride on the flow
Where the river runs deep
And the larger fish creep

The water can't drown me, I'm done
With my dying

Now the land that I knew is a dream
And the line on the distance grows faint
So wide is my river
The horizon a sliver

Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
And the big yellow sun leads me home
I'm everywhere now

To the wind of each breath by and by

There's a space in the heavens
There's a hole in my heart
There's a lack of fine dining gone to work on my art
And a flavour of fullness
Is an empty retreat
And the restaurant buffet isn't all I can eat

I'll suck on the colors that I find in the sea
The blues and the greens, they don't bother me

My soul is in the trees
It's in the sap that fills the wood
It's in the rings that tell her age
It's in the smoke that marks the days
It's in the fire in my heart
It's in the embers in the soot
It's in the place I put the ash
It's in the soil
It's in the grass
It's in the mouths of all the herd 
It's in the beetles and the birds
It's in the feathers that I found one morning lying on the ground
It's hallelujah, aye and oh
It's where I've been and where I go
It's in the people that I meet
It's kneeling silent at their feet
It's ever dutifully yours
It stems my pride
And opens doors

Seems I’ll do that old rag, takes me all kinds of ways

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

The poplars, and willows, and birds pass me by
The mould of the earth to the space in the sky
Free from my roots and I’m lost in the wind
Wind on the mountain, and the mountain’s my friend

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

Hemlock and yew have me toeing the line
Questions come knocking, I’ll answer in time
But the seams of the soil unravel with ease
Nose to the road and I’m painfully free

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile
I’ll see another star

Call me the wind in the hole
Blowing my way to the call
I’ll dust up the days 'til I’ve gone every way
No less and I’ve never wanted more, more, more

Lost on the bough in a golden refrain
Sleep goes away and the day comes again
But the rain on my cap has me chasing a roof
I’ll be this young choice 'til I’m long in the tooth

And I’ve only got so near (Illuminate me)
And I’ve only gone so far (Illuminate me)
And I’ll walk another country mile

And in of a man he was ashen and coal
Spoke quick, confusing, burdened me up
Left me for hollow when he'd had his sup
I bore all his load til the day that we met

And one glimpse of you bent the load from my fret
To my frown, to my stern, and then rocking me by
And a game and a cheer, on the earth, in the sky
So said I to the landlord
""I'll not see thee here""
And I'll wait for his answer

Til the load wasn't there and it never had been
And all was before was so distant a dream
Til I saw in my friend what had once been my foe
And the terrible landlord had all in his tow
In his wake and the call of his burning black ship
And the wind it was blown from his proud blackened lips

And I with my bellows cast clouds through the sky
So that his awful flames, they might moisten and die
And then I with a light shone on that which was there
As in light I did nothing, as in days I did fare
And so days in my ears and days all around

Proving death to the landlord and all he abounds
And the night she shone, too, until all that was now
Had been hoisted for viewing in all of the crowd
I was glad in the light that crept twixt new and old
And then polished with all, and so tender so bold

So said I to the landlord
""I'll not see thee here""
And I'll wait for his answer
So meek in that moment, thee in error til all
Of my friends and their friends saw in joy their loads fall

They fell in they fell out, they fell near they fell far
They gave all in a shout and put all to the stars
Lifting them as one load, such a burdensome thing
Troubling nothing that lives now, no and nothing it seems
Nothing that dances, nothing that's moved
In the old spinning circle of all that we proved

So said I to the landlord
""I'll not see thee here""
And I'll wait for his answer
So said I to the landlord
""I'll not see thee here""
And I'll wait for his answer

Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream 
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will

Johnny Frigo,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1999
Johnny Frigo,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1999
Johnny Frigo,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2002

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Johnny Frigo,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2002
Johnny Frigo,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

It's time to be kind to one and all.
It's that time of year when good friends are dear,
And you wish you could give more than just presents from a store.

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Give love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love.

People you don't know 
Smiles and nods hello,
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy.
It's that once of year when the world's sincere,
And you'd like to find a way to show the things that words can't say.

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day
The man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone who cares.
Give love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love.

What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs more love.

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day

Has room for your love underneath his tree

That I have waited for you
In a world of disappointment

Take my hand
And hold me close
And don't let me go

You and me you know we're just like family, girl

About what's been going on with your man

So what you really don't know in the end
Is that, I love you

It's like we're shadowing the scene and we can see far above all of the clouds
There was storms going on, lovers fighting at home, down on the ground
But because of where we were, we could not see the rain or hear the sound, yeah

Had to put my seatbelt back on
Please tell me something, even if it's just goodbye
Grab the parachute, let's jump before we die

What we did wrong that made our love not last (made our love not last)
I wish there was a way to figure out
Just what it was that made our love life crash (ooh ooh ooh)
I wish there was a way to find out (said I wish, I wish)
What broke our hearts and it would hurt us the most (ooh)
Oh I wish love came with a black box, a black box

I remember when you and I would always slip away
While everyone else was sleeping baby you and I was creeping
We never put our seatbelts on, we never played it safe
Nevermind the turbulence, it only made us brave
Girl nothing else mattered we only cared bout getting by
We were on top of the world, the way we frequently fly, you and I

What broke our hearts and it would hurt us the most (somebody tell me, oh oh oh oh)
Oh I wish love came with a black box, a black box

I was going through all the rubble, just to find out what got us in trouble
I would search through anything for you and me
So I could finally see what made you stop loving me
Exactly what it was that made us fall for all our love
So I could fix it and make you fall back in love with me,

What we did wrong that made our love not last

And your warmth become desire? 
Oh, what miracle 
Has made you the way you are?

From my tender sentimental woes

A prelude to a kiss

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999

Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quartet,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

Johnny Guarnieri Quartet,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Johnny Guarnieri Quartet,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1999
Johnny Guarnieri Quartet,"You say you're falling in love with me
That's why I sit here and cry
For that is something that never can be
And here's the reason why
 
For you're not the kind of a boy (girl) for a girl (boy) like me
'Cause I'm just a song and a dance, you're a symphony
You say that you never would doubt me
Well, I'm tellin' you, you'd be much better off with out me
'Cause I'm just the kind of a girl (boy) who would never play fair
And you're just the kind of a boy (girl) who would always be square
It's so hard to let you go but it's only because I know
That you're not the kind of a boy (girl) for a girl (boy) like me
