Raekwon,"1, 2, 1, 2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga

Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it

Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: ""I'll fuck yo' ass up!""
Now listen

Back, back and forth and forth

E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old

Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout

Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit

Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling vows
And lead me a round

Yakub, maker and creator of the devil
Swine merchant your time is near at hand
Fuck with me and your time will be now
Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever
You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases
Evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!",Gravel Pit,2008
Raekwon,"""Dropped outta school early so I could get me some paper
That's a good book, I don't mind you gettin knowledge about the game
You dig? So you won't have to have those young girls fool ya, you dig?
Trick ya outta your check, so you can learn about it
Don't try to play if you ain't ready for it
'Cause the game could be detrimental to ya boy.""

I Silver Surf the city circuit, forever lurkin on the street surface
I spit blood for blood verses
Plan span divided, we still stand conquer land
One man'll body slam Def Jam
Focus ya head cam, zoom in, we radio tunin
I know you're listenin so I keep showin and provin
Play the sideline, waitin for the right time to take mine
Street crime, nickel and dime rhyme
Fuck a peace talk, let the gun spark, on the streets of New York
I Shaolin strut through the city asphalt, FED UP
Hold ya head up, I'm circlin the block, keep ya eyes up
Wise up before you get sized up (tied up)
Play no game, speakin on my name you catch a clip full
From close range, diggin in your pocket, take the loose change

Punch the data in ya mainframe
You want it all, I want the same thing
Strive to maintain, live out my name
Hard to obtain, hard to explain, ain't nuttin changed
Leave the same way I came, Bringin motherfuckin Pain

Killa Hill projects, hi-tech street intellect
Best connect, blow your headset, fuck a mic check

Bring em round the underground, pocket full of sound
Ashes to ashes y'all niggaz goin down

Eat shit and die slow, battle ground no survival
You goin down, y'all niggaz fuck around
Shittin where you sleepin, so my rhyme Proposal came Indecent
Beef from the butcher, sink your teeth in

Fuck what you believe in, you real-fake
Fishin in the same lake, eatin off the same cake you blow face

Who go that ready cook, synthetic look, actin crook
Betty shook worm, tryin to shake the hook as the world turn
Nigga burn, once again the Super Sperm, rub it in
Your skin, like it's Lubriderm, time took to write this
The war will be fought by the righteous
Who stand criticized by his un Alikeness
Knowledge is the truth and it's priceless
Real like them Rahway Lifers, nuttin but time on my hands
Observe the black sands in the hourglass, fallin fast
In the savage land haulin ass, Days of Thunder
It's Road Rage, your days are numbered
What RZA put together let no man tear asunder (motherfucker!)

This is P.L.O., Killa Hill flow but you don't hear me though
Live in stereo, pumpin loud until your speaker blow
Ghetty-o slang pro, sling rap for cash flow
Keep it live from the intro until the outro

Killa Hill projects, hi-tech street intellect
Best connect, blow your headset, fuck a mic check

Bring em round the underground, pocket full of sound
Ashes to ashes y'all niggaz goin down

I'm on a suicide run, y'all niggaz know the outcome
Razor sharp tongue leave scars in your eardrum
Forty-five bar seminar, ghetto rap star
Slide like water rats through the Staten Reservoir
Swingin swords cut your mic cord, snatch ya rap awards
Commercial cats fuckin up the game, that's why I crash boards
Break laws, wired jaw, keep on tryin yours
Hardcore, something that my street niggaz is dyin for

Snatch your neck and the dope fiend, Golgo 13
Professionals wit no things, say no more
Check my Dogs at the Reservoir
Gourmet special of the day is n*gga Souflee, pusher gotta pay
And the games people play, John J. back around the way
Fish filet, Mister DJ, turn it up a notch
Hit the replay, for dirt bomb niggaz in the P.J.
To Klingon, bring on, the Good Times for Keyon
Hood rhymes that's be-yond ya thinkin
For eons, I've been hear to shine on the black minds
Tell you like the last time, year of the grimy n*gga
Rag time, bad sign, flatline

""It's easy to get into the game, but once you get on top
Can you stay there?""",Grid Iron Rap,2008
Raekwon,"Machine gun rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga, flash stacks
See through yellow lines
Rock a fly jersey in the summertime God
Magic marker rap, bleed Benetton
Relaxed, wrote this, comin at you crab ass culprits
Snatch ya ice off, chillin in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feelin like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris?
Melodic single darts, snap a nigga just like fish
You fucked up, some rich niggas you done test
Yo, select the wrong department, and niggas pulled up your dress
Style, molest that
Canal chain, nigga where ya vest at
Flex'll make me wanna bless that
Yo, Saddam Hussain niggas
Light the torch, we flamin niggas
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggas

Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan

Yo, super freak physique, like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf, everyday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, now I ride with my swoon
Well groomed, dance hall
Packed, full bloom
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the lye smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders God rush
Beams of light, stop ya breathin, it's huntin season
Honey eye-ballin down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws, cause tonight
[All] It's Your's

Stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blammed
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag...off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands..bitch, the RZA
I stand close to walls, like number four, The Lizard
And channel through so-lar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog

It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact'll blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
Explicit, I crystallize ya rhyme til you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put em high
Rebel I, outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4

Check out my beaver, baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the garden, gettin ski'd, row eight
We hold a belt Son, that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third
Yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smokin estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court
For your birthday, the babyface of rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the ""W"" and ""Spiegel"" books
Annheiser Busch kings came through, and stopped your whole jooks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful, like hearin the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room sheisty girl
Love to sit out this song, now watch your water break

Raekwon,"When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

Hey you get off my cloud
See me get raw with my southpaw style
Mover, puffin' on a fat blunt from Cuba
It's the Meth-Tical jet to Cal, I'm the Buddha
Monk on the hunt for machine gun funk
I gets you open like a slug from the shotgun pump
Double-barrel, yeah Meth bring it to them proper
Partner, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Straight up, you movin' too fast so baby wait up
Took one, added seven more now you eight up

Get on down, listen to the sound, come on
Few can ever get this ultimate legit
See you all up in my ass
But you don't know shit, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me
Meth-Tical, a rude descendant of the loud hip-hop
I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way
Have you had your meth today?
Huh, move it in, move it out
Stick it in, pull it out

Might show up, stun 'em and run 'em when they raggin'
Those who test it, respect it, the method
You know I can't be messed with, I'm hectic, accept it
I'll break it down, I get down for my crown
Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Tryin' to avoid the early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the curb
Check out the cloud, smoked out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad fly, flew south for the (winter)
Hey, enter the square if you dare
Without a flaw, I'm so raw that I'm rare
I'm goin' to the country, I'm goin' to the fair
To see the senorita, with flowers in her hair
And get mine, cause she love me long time

I smoke on the mic like smoking Joe Frazier
The hell raiser, raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swinging through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tic toc and keep ticking
While I get you flipping off the shit I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
you battle, you're saying Goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspector Deck's on the set
The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile
Rae got it going on pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'm gonna get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!
So if you wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more I got
Going to war with the melting pot hot

It's the Method Man for short Mr. Meth
Moving on your left, ah!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they putting shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame, my style'll live forever
Niggaz crossing over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a ""sue""
Nuff respect due to the one-six-oh
I mean oh, you check out the flow
like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dusting

Yo, you best protect your neck

First things first man you're fucking with the worst
I'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you stepped through to
The Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down that shit packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man
The Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason, unique rolling with the night of the creeps
Niggaz be rolling with a stash
ain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!

For crying out loud my style is wild so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejecting, styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give a order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes

You chill with the feedback black we don't need that
It's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style
the ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin
Slaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)
Coming around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare,
Tuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doing artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For trying to blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meaning of dope
When he's looking for a suit and tie rap
that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

I smoke the feet of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, Ya head, get shrunk

Bitch stop my momma serve, free lunch from the church

Unglove the news, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze

Gold and platinum frisbee's on my wall, lookin' properly
But come-ly, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers

Attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souflee saute for the day
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A, Leg Leg Arm Head
Spread like plague, we drink Hennessee by the jig
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof, Absolut, mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng boost, I got yo' neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickle sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus, when the whole world need us

Is it appetite for destruction
Slap a murder rap on this production, I touch somethin' trust nothin'
Iron Lung, Twisted Metal
I see em duckin' my dart gun, bustin', from every angle
Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow
That be code named Agent Orange, killin' you slow
It's only right you pay homage
To those that's bout to blow like that shit up your nose, solid
As a rock when I strike target, verbal
Be screamin' on you like a drill sergeant, her-bals
Got me where I wanna be right now, don't know the time

 Is you bustin steel or is you flashin? Hmmm
 Talkin out your assHOLE
 You shoulda learnt about the flow and peasy afro
 Ticallion stallion, chinky eye and snot nosed
 From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
 I keeps it movin, know just what the fuck I'm doin
 Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
 Slip the cardiac arrest me, excorcist hip-hop possess me
 Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
 burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
 The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
 You don't like it dick up in ya fuck ya
 (allow me to demonstrate) That's right, you corny-ass
 (the skill of Shaolin) rap motherfuckers
 (The special technique) Better go back and check
 (of shadowboxing) your fuckin stacks
 (Shadowboxing) Cause your naps ain't nappy enough
 And your reefs ain't rugged enough
 Bitch
 Verse Two: The Genius/Maximillion
 I slayed MC's back in the rec room era
 My style broke motherfuckin backs like Ken Patera
 Most rap niggaz came loud but unheard
 Once I pulled ut, round em off to the nearest third
 Check these non visual niggaz, with tapes and a portrait
 Flood the seminar, tryin to orbit this corporate
 indsutry, but what them niggaz can't see
 must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
 Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
 Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
 We reign all year round from June to June
 While niggaz bite immediately if not soon
 Set the lynchin, and form the execution date
 As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
 Amplify sample through vacumn tubes compressions
 cause RZA, to charge niggaz twenty G's a session
 Verse Three: Method Man/Johnny Blaze
 When my mind start to clickin, and the strategy
 is mastered the plot thickens, this be that Wu shit
 I don't give a cotten-pickin FUCK
 about a brother tryin to size a nigga up, I hold my own
 Hard-hat protect your dome
 Look at mama baby boy actin like he grown
 No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
 Killa bee, that be holdin down his honeycomb, loungin son
 Wu brother number one, protect your neck
 Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
 Hard times and killer tactics, spittin words plus
 semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
 novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
 shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
 To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
 Hand on my nutsac, and spittin lung-ghies
 At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
 When it come to RZA tra-cks I don't know how to act
 Real rap from the Stat, killa hill projects
 How to be exact, break it down
 All and together now
 Things are getting good looking better now

Yo check yo yo, check the script
Me and the gods get it ripped
Blunts in the dip, forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing, at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had begin to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha!
Not knowin', exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect, to come across, a crazy gunner
""Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough""
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said ""No!""
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
In his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave.
Girls screamin', the noise up and down the block
(Hey, Rakeem!) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete
I picked him up, then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones who have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughin' all the time
I taught him, all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words

After laughter, comes tears

Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something gots to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said be for real
She's not even worth it, to go raw deal
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power you
Twenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt
I'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin' you
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story
But he carried on, with the same old stuff
with Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck
Both tried to be down with O.P.P.
Ain't nothin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now
No life to live, doc says two more years
So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears

I'm the Osirus of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
It's like this ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine

I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies
And hypotheses can't define how I be droppin' these
Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous, ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect view through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumblin' patrolmen tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow swingin' swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds I pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performin' live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
It's my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan, into the fire
Transform into the Ghostrider, or Six Pack
In A Streetcar Named Desire, who got my back?
In the line of fire holding back, what?
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped, and they trying to twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned, for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm, what the blood
Clot, we smoke pot, and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got ta tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loot my voice on the LP, my team is on to slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid, what?  Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team, and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage, and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought, I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony, defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For, judgment day come'th, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tune spit the shit immortal combat sound
The fake false step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, cap off squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthetics
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sippin' on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring king

Watch for the wooden soldiers, see-cypher punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like Flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair, in particular
My beats travel like a vortex, through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Or terminal, like Grand Central Station
Program fat baselines, on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck I'm duckin' five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls engraved in plaques
Those who went back, received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn, as close ones gone
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles away from came one
To represent the Nation, this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel-Ah-Rief take the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save shell from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

Yo! Yo! Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lampin' like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy Green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar court by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission hold the
Fuck up, Allah fasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, Black Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese
Is that so?  Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Hey yo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul off
Connect thoughts to make my man Shai walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York gank adviser world tranquilizer
Just the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While, my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see ya, the number one traffic
Sit down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God

No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds

On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought Fubu
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
Eighteen karat rap between noodles

Up at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up
I saw ? sippin' Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin' off the hip
I sit took, three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin'? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead King, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen, couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ""Any Means Necessary""

John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all be shot

Code name Charley Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check

Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin' and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin', feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself

Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

This is grown man talkin', coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin' on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Native, he used to beatbox, thousands'll listen
Yo, that's before, the Wu got on, him and Allah Just'
And RZA, came to the Island one morn'
A nigga could dance to slow music, outdrink any nigga
On the benches, while we hitting reefer, he sold loosies
Five foot seven, a legend was born, Russell 'Ason"" Jones
I know him for his braids and lessons
A wise man with knowledge 120, kept a flag on his chest
A right hand, you quick, serving you Remy
Yo, let's toast to the fallen, lost forgotten
Aiyo, if niggas could hear me, then roll up some broccoli
Ason, the heart of a lion, a purified mind
The way he did it, with a mic and some wine
I would never forget the days we used to sit back
Days I be all up in the crib, listening, holding, align him and yo
I just miss this nigga
And now I understand the meaning of love, when I kissed the nigga

Made man wit the grey Shands wrapped in the blue

Pidgeons and goons survivin' them prisons
Corest divisions, that separate and lay in cocoons

While bodies get found in lobbies, chopped up decayin' in rooms

They found a two-year-old strangled to death
With a Love Daddy shirt on in a bag on the top of the steps
Police blowin' niggas, narcs and judges

And went off, told him that he can't sling his raw
When he fell, yo, he broke his wrist, his bangles flew off
His Balley's was scuffed, then he blew a kiss
Bleeding out the side of his ear, niggas was staring
And the silk shirt was ripped off, Punch cut his hair
Razors was bloody, he kept hitting, Dred grabbed his shirt
Showing his stomach, the kid had zippers on him
Bitches was flipping, they grabbed Tasha, caught her for a Louis
Snatched her titties right up out the bitch bra
No selling over here, Jack, heard the Dred mumble
'You be dead in a week' then he stumbled back
Little young Keyon rushed him, yeah, shorty was a vet
Gillette soldiers, shorty hit the neck
Blood squirted, look like laundry detergent, the Dred fell out
Right from there, he gon' need a surgeon

With my leathered down coat and wallabee Clarks
Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist
So much excitement in the air, I was crisp
Money suitcase, Louis joint (yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)
Go make it happen, black God and get rich
Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit
They made a right on me, them last two dicks
Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car
They spun around again and blast they shits
I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5
You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed yo shit
I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car
Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit
Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down
What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip
It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)

I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the breaks
Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates
Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead
Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said
""Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car""
""Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar""
He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the cannister
Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher
On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell
Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell
Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth
That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs
Same cops known for exorting pimps and booking whores
Aimed glocks at me and Rae, cuz they was looking for
A few MC's wanted for a string of break-ins

To know starts the spark of the flow
Wisdom activation of the Nation moving
Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters

The fo' fo' make a nigga run like Ochocinco
In my mink-o I'm a protege of pimping
Living for the slipping, [?]
Marijuana shipping, champagne, lobsters, stripping
Getting trained not to listen, maintain pop the clip in

Why run nigga?
It's gon' come nigga
But 'til the day it does
I'm a hold my shit down, take it in blood
Outsiders get no love",Sooner or Later (Die 1 Day),2010
Raekwon,"Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I've dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and
Tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative

This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno' who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo's smilin' they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin' a jump or running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a southpark writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparal girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said ""take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said,
""I got way too many blues for any more bad news""
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it,
do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Endening that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it!?
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, its like that y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Aye yo
I don't cop Timbs, that's lived in lenses
Kid, Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benz's
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nike's
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
Got made code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Know what time it is, man?
Did ye shit all day, man?

Everything that goes up, just know that it might be coming down,

Let me tell you something unknown!
You gotta be more careful of the things that you wish for!

Damn, she's mean
Anything is possible,
But you've got to just put Him first!

I'll understand if someone explains.

Refuse to go back between

I invested in well and their success is as special as hell.
To many black clouds broke out the day I caught myself I smoked out
Wish I had a moment to sell!
A moment to sell
A moment to be what you wanna,

I'm fresher than a peppermint and cold as a cough
When I pull up in that foreign and I break boys off
Super ballin' is a product of a hard knock life
No more Ramen noodle spread, no more struggle and strife
From a Buick to a Beamer, ambitions of a dreamer
Motivated by Mob Figgaz and Andre Nickatina
I'm gettin' paper while you're in the shade drinkin Zima
I'm a schemer, you just waitin' on your check from FEMA
Been evadin' the subpoena to appear in court
Different hustle every season like I'm playin' a sport
""Life is too short, wouldn't you agree?""
See, the best time I ever had in my life was free
My best friend wasn't real, he came with a fee
Reduced time for your sentence come with a plea
Livin' in the free world and I'm blessed
Paper chasin' is my quest, I grind with no rest

Girls lookin' at you, you useless (word?)
When everything is wrong, it look like it'll fall
I'm on the job, feet first with direction and all
I like coca and then gotta come home and stroke her
Take time, clean my rims and go lock' her
Just wanna lay up, damn
I need two minutes to rest, go 'head and take the Lex' out, scram
Then it's beef in the jump off, 'cause I needed one off
It's like you drew your gun on me in a gun off
Shit won't change, so move with it (move with it)

Dear Mr. President, have you seen FEMA?
Have you seen the lower 9th Ward, post Katrina?
Niggas scufflin' tryin' to find something tangible
The MP's is treatin' all the youth like animals

Why niggas on the TV in the spot like cozy

Dallas, Alabama and Miami got a problem

Soldiers in Iraq pray to God for a miracle

If not, you can bet your ass, danger's comin'

Backyard moonshine steel methadone laboratory real
Can I keep it crystal clear?
Chipped tooth type of people
Illiterate pigs who wanna see you killed type of evil
Confederate flags, I see 'em
In a truck with the windows down
Why is he playing Beanie Siegel?
""Cause his daddy was a dope man
Lynard Skynard didn't talk about moving keys of coke man
Ain't no such thing as a free bird
Billy's got that street work and he's packing a nasty heater

Still doing donuts in the gravel parking lot
Gold ropes, cousins in a group home

She split up, had a brick, I peeped those
Her jeans was fitted, hair twisted, long as a fuck
She looked Indian, titties was plump
Had juicy lips, dimples, imprint on her pussy was mad thick
She grabbed my dick, hopped in the window
We in the Monte Carlo, bravo, uncle named Pablo
Gun connect, and he had his poke in Los Cabos
Good money, honey was strung, playing Luther in the background
Spanish version, my bunny was horny as fuck
Working the kid, we burst later, lay in the bed
Duvet sheets, my face hit the spread
Then time me, I'm not the kind of nigga, I was cool down at night
Drop my gun, shorty, my nigga
Body was sexy, ""Lexy, come here, nigga, take off your drawers
Let me suck your dick, nigga, it's yours
Got real watery, Corey, damn you got good dick
You forty"" spit on it, position your jaw
Call me 8-Ball, this pussy like China, climb the Great Wall
Then she came like volcanos in the late fall

Lady Miranda, she half black and white like a panda
I met her at the BET Awards, in Atlanta
Glamor girl, shopping in Bloomingdale's, skin pure
Keep a fresh manicure, hands with the cutest nails
Wall Street banker, hold accounts with Jewish now
Big businessmen, who own stocks in computer sales
Meanwhile, I'm checking her jeans out, imagining
Her fat bubble, riding my dick, making her scream out
She got a mean mouth, her lips is like soup coolers
Hotter than niggas riding around with six rugers
Miss Beaulah took a day off with a rich jeweler
When she came back she had a suitcase full of Fig Newtons
I met her at a villa in Vancouver, blowing her man's buddah
Bumping Mary J. and that Grand Puba
Check the 411, from a smooth operator
Got some pictures of her naked, I'll send them to Un later

Ay Dio mio, mamacita ass bonita
Remind me of the nights of Del Rio
I met at the Cotto fights, playing my seat though
That night, the linen was white, me and my hijos
Live from Puerto Rico, San Juan, where niggas sniff pedrico
Look at your man wrong, finito
Girl you know how we go, you getting my grown man on
Fuck with you primo, maybe I'm hands on, I'll massage your ego
And be the love of your life, you know your people, a thug and his wife
Gave a look, she was touching my ice, so I looked at my dick
Like don't worry, we fucking tonight
She boricua, cinnamon skin, sign is Libra
She like wife beaters and men that like to eat her
Then I meet your feet up, meet me in room 112, light this reefer
You act right, and after tonight, I might keep ya",Miranda,2010
Raekwon,"Yeah, them niggas talking bout y'all always want some lyrics, right?
Real lyrics, well here we go, I'm a tell you a little story
That's right, watch this shit, nigga, here we go, y'all, your ass
Yeah, we write for days, hot shit, uh-huh
Dope, drugs, sex, murder, King James version

Aiyo, needle was left hanging, in the arm of a pimp
He walk with a limp, had bitches on the payroll
He gave the seeds candy and his family was poor
Drove a '68 Caddy with the fur on the door
The other macks ain't have jack on him, not even Goldie
Slowly, he would rise, kept his runners with the police
Jim Brown was his man, his brother was Muslim, they tried to convert him
And turn righteous, but the streets got the good of him
Big hats with gorgeous stones, honey designed the slacks
With two attempts on his bottom bitch, her name was Precious
Silky skin, priceless pussy, she took karate
Her bubble ass got Pretty Chipp rich
You can smell her perfume on every street corner
A sexy motherfucka with the mean face on her
Precious, sported bulletproof dresses, defending caring sex
Thirteen smith, this boo that study her lessons
She was the key to Pretty Chipp riches, bitches is fortune slang
Control the south side, her name rings
Lookout for the black cherry pussy extortion
Any other hoes get pregnant, bet they get an abortion
Back at the pub, at the Alice spot, bumping the sounds of Curtis
Playing Live in the jukebox, this broad named Cookie
In the purse, fifty thou' in cash
Passed off to Chipp, told him count it fast, another 10 in my bloomers
Fuck the rumors, it's lies, baby, you my daddy
Bitches never saw me jumping out of Dirt Dog's cabby
I'm a loyal bitch, and chicks can't stand me, pimps
They know I'm ill, that's why they never put hands on me
From Fillmore Slim to Goldie, Pretty Toney
Frank War told me, C.C. get that money
My potentials, credentials, my mouth stay hot
Like Chinese mushrooms, wasabi with spicy lentils
The other day I brought a little gat, where I keep near my lower back
Cause these niggas don't know how to act
At the Apollo, Ray Charles told me
Bitch just get in the car, cuz I want you to swallow
I jumped in, and his bodyguards follow
He was quick, I spit the nut on his '74 wallos
He wanted to invite me to Chicago, I said 'nah, daddy'
He pushed me out and lit up a Marlboro
(Nah, papi) Cause I'm from New York
He taught me the talks, he taught me the walk
Cause I'm Chipp's bitch, we dine and resort
Only nigga ever taught me, don't put swine on my fork

And that's the truth, rest in peace, papi
This Cookie, I still got another tall Goose for you daddy
I'm a stick in the grave for you, baby
Fuck them other pimps, they ain't got shit on you, daddy",Pimpin' Chipp,2010
Raekwon,"Yo, behind those mahogany walls
Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I""m charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw
Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call

Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

Man I thought we told y'all niggas before, Wu-Tang is for the children
P.O.'s violate your dirty urine
These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling
I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in
Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon
I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing""
Spray shots, clap civilians at the dealing table
Off of the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions
Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul
I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle
Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label
I'm a soldier, I stay on job, me, eye a coka
Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over

Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing

I live the Streetlife, why, I'm that nigga
Label me a beast, call me U-Godzilla
When I rumble in the jungle, I go gorilla
Step on the set, Inspectah Deck you
Dead in your face, straight RZArect you
You highly mistaken, I'm hotter than Satan
Catch me in the kitchen with blood on Chef apron
I'm known to, Cap a Don, big gun in my palm
I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill
Give you something, you can really feel
Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real
The world's worse like Dirt McGirt
Fuck a bitch raw dog, then dig in her purse
Yeah that boy's a Genius, I stay fresh like I'm straight out the cleaners
I walk hard like a criminal, holding my penis

Raekwon,"For the city, to get this money, Vegas, yo, yeah

Here's the rundown, Mustafa's getting money out in Youngstown
Get some goons together, a driver and bring them guns down
Heard he had his hands in some bricks, plus a few pounds
Hang with some wild Haitians, settle shop in the dude lounge
Niggas is migrating, he came from Cue Gardens
With a live situation, got it in preparation
When you get there, pick up the whip with the navigation
And follow all the clowns til you get to your destination
(We here Tone, got our masks on, we bout to run up in
I know you ain't talking bout the house, with the broken henge
65 Alpine Drive, it's looking shady
So I hopped out, pulled the glock out, plus the 3-18
Hit the living room, I've seen a ripped up sofa, a shattered coffee table
Broken lamps, and a flipped up stroller
The place was ransacked from front to back)
Yo, Trife, what you talking, black?
(Yo, Starks, cut the bullshit and tell me, where the office at)
Take a left and head, down the hallway steps
Pass the painting on the wall, the third door on the left
The safe is on the wall above the fireplace near the decks
Look inside the top drawer, and get the key out the chest

Damn son, aiyo what's taking this nigga Trife so long (I don't know)
Oh shit, yo Bull, get down, get down, get down
Look at Stark pulling up, son (aw man)
I'm a try to kill this nigga

Aiyo, hurry up I see a car pulling up, windows tinted
Can't really tell who's in it, but, I know it's a rented
Down south plates, Atlanta or, one of them states (yo the cameras on)
Man, I wanna see what's up in those crates
Should I pop off, take his top off, before he get to you
Bully like (Yo, chill, chill, this is what we gon' do) aight
(Go ask for directions, right, I'm a go around the back
Wait for them to come inside, I'll hit these niggas with the mack)
OK, before it even get to that, let me see where Trife is at
Hopefully he on his way, and no one gotta die today (bang bang)
Two shots go off (Homey trapped inside, quick put the mask on, Sheek)
Fuck it, Bully, let's ride
Shooting out the sunroof, missing and shit
I was too high, still think my Dutchie was lit
Trife running out the building, busting, cussing
Blood everywhere, you had to see this shit (disgusting)",Youngstown Heist,2010
Raekwon,"I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existed
My patience led the way until the greatest love listened to me
I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches
It's like the sixth man, sits on different benches
It's hard squeezing life in a sentence
And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint
My entrance is what's between

When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene
Alchemist cut the record down to the bone
And with a record like this I take the world by storm
Sky blessed, the land of the brave
Understand where I stand, my hand is made
From B R double-O K-lyn in the planet
Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became

Panic on my first campaign, but when the words fell to place
I was certain to reign, I hit the purple, 
Then step in the circle and start flexin'
Weatherman invented, now storms change directions
Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now
I always shared pretty good for an only child
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong

Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on
They on welfare, you got health care
They used to have their priorities elsewhere
I took rims and tires and traded them
For a ticket to an island, that's where
I wrote this rhyming where I first saw my vision
Buy a better living, a place to raise kids in

So I think like I rule the world
On the brink of something bigger, building schools
For boys and girls the thought of home gets me out of my bed
I said you got them tools? 
Get them shits up out of the shed, come on 

I'm like the interstate of rhyming the Jack Dempsey emcee
All my shit costumed out eventually money is made, fly blades
A woman with brains, a black nigga reign
My lifestyle as a prowler a rich owner, loaner
Used to pump at coffees shops had my bitch 
Who sell with me rolling up fly ass and still classy
Asking questions like, ""Why you wait on that glass?

Why you splash me?"" Yo, it's only nigga shit
I'mma teach you like how I was taught too
Hold the phone, ward two, seeing all kinds of great fossils
Colossal juice, ? the house, act fly
Got you, no need to walk backwards, fuck with the taxes 
I speak credibility, the story to másses
Yo, a diplomatic winner, Nike boots
A scully good denim jean on and ?

They say you only live once, I disagree
You only live twice, your life enable your seed's
So I lean on blacks and feed em the deeds
So when I die they got a foundation on my publishing B
Plus the words that I speak, plus my family jewels
It ain't all blood diamonds, but ? experienced fools
And I be rhyming cool, but my philosophy's deep
Like a dear John letter, so read em and weep

And the wolf smells blood, you can feed em to me
We can meet in the street, draw heat, but what happened to peace?
He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech
Jesus, diarrhea, I mean holy shit
Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit
Communion had the wine, made the sign of the cross
And I will live in the past, chalk it up as a loss
Went from ""Please listen to my demo!"" to stretch limo

To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel
But I can't go out like Timbo slice
Like Geena Korrano, a cyborg determinate
Mano a mano, still Ronald McDonald over one billion served
But it's up to me to get what I deserve
So I handle my biz and hustle harder than the norm

Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck

Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap

Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego

Listen to Wu Tang
Trying crazy suits on 
Stuntin' in our high top Louie's
Shorts is the coogies
Open up the door when you take her to the movies

When you meet the parents you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the wierdo
Next show they gotta up the zeroes
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old

The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'
You looking good fly color Asian

She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia
Till she caught me getting numbers not her's

When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why (oh why), You must be mine

Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck
Grabbing em on set

Take that queen assure to ya

Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes

No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss

So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling

Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you's a cannibal
And stopping me, is what you cannot do
Either get in the game, get out the way, or get ran right through

Is straight from a rich nigga genie

Silk drawers, fronting in my key lime pie Wall-o's
And I still got a half a key indeed, Frank Lucas shit
Hidden in coffins, flying over seas
And if you ever try to ruin my night
I'm a make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite
Shot caller, laying in big laws
Rock of Gibraltar, my pinky joint, killer like Orca
Daytime hawk, a nasty street author

But the theme of the story
Is yo, checking how they came for me

(This is it, B)

Kinda brief from the gold teeth era,
Bro dreaming on C.R.E.A.M.
Complimentaries and beef
I'm from the wild side, a militant was made by the foremost elite
It sound good, brung my rifle shit, clean
Met the others, lit a blunt, begin
I'm like Nicole Kidman in the wind, niggas is wild, niggas is eat
Then I chanced it, blood can always beat mud
Mud is part of being thug, I guess it's advance, we from the street
This is me, I'm ready to beat, whatever, we gon' off' it
One time alone, yo, they pricked up Unique
Meth standing there, rare hustler hair, right in front of the building
Them niggas do them killings out there
This is deep, me, Rebel, U-G, he walked in the room
Scarf rap, pair of Timberlands, beat
This the potion, roll the scroll out, speaked and another walked in
Knowing now this is a thief
We from the same voc's, this is like a pot roast
Hottest niggas who rhyme, I know them from the time,
This is not 'posed to happen
Peace Black, we wasn't cool
Threw the piece back, everything good, I lit the leaf, captain
Got a mission, to make sure the world recognize our position
I'm standing near the kitchen
Shit just might work, I lit the stink, this could be the realest shit
This could be the realest flip quick
Everybody stand up in militant, army jackets down
I said to myself, this the realest clique
True champ, we gon' rep it through, keep it cool
No boot camp, no hard work, just some loot, family
All in, ball til you fall, loyal as ever
I grab my leather, I'm a lay til you call

I park, Rae, Ghost, then lit up the bong
It's nightfall, nothing here, nothing to fear
Just got things to touch on, then he walked up weird
Walked in frail as stale, his eyes were soft
His face was pale, I looked at him kneel
Just wanna talk, you a deer, starting chasing him
He jumped in the tree, had grass in his ear
I'm a kill you nigga, you gonna have to come down
Little did he know I was a leader, a full bred eater
Jump in new V's, shopping, had the fever
Next stop Starbucks and Spiegels, Jags had diesel
Then she walked in, fly little diva
Niggas on the scheme for you gleam, they come from your school
A bunch of snake bites, they bitch smacked Shareen
She slid in the '09 Beemer, with that sex whore Sabrina

With the big pimple on her temple
Any more knowledge is college, you gave enough to be bounced now

Can't dress for nothing, she fronting
Took a piss, roll up, let's twist, pulled down my pants
Good look, and shot through her tits

I know his fucking family, fuck 'em all
I used to love brothers, now I hate 'em
Mostly them gator boys, who stunting and they never seen Nathan

Head off the rip, grab the whip, rest maturely
Hanging around the vets in the sweats
Since '97 we was rolex-ing the extra
Fuck around a hundred texts
Flash flex, cash, drugs, money and sex
Dumb check smashing

Watching the game from a bird's eye view
They say it's hard to keep trust so my third eye grew
Chakras open, binocular scoping, sour smoking
Hoping my best buzz ain't only in it only for the tokens
Cause they say if who you joking with, chokin' potent with
Tag team the joker chicks, the ones who do some bogus should
Act cool on the strip, but want to put two on your hip
Macking jewels in your whips, booming your hits, screwing your bitch
Froze under my toes, bitches where my penis is
Kicking it since the womb, now you see what the fetus is
And what the fetus is? Would these niggas feed us shit?
Rob a nigga for his number 2's to put my feet in, shit

It's the elephant in the room
Created by a collision of the sun and the moon

I'm astonishing, honestly my future looking promising
As my skin tone and a crystal clean onyx is
Darker thoughts let the beats break like a Amish's
I'm a stroke of genius like Mickalene Thomas is
Hip-hop and body rocking and doing it dude
I am the living definition of improving the groove
I use the same tools to shoot that Kubrick used
Take your hero to the river, give them two b-rick shoes
Who lose? If you really ain't nobody till somebody love you
I say you ain't nobody til they speaking highly of you

Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge, hell a block away

Kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The 10 commandments, I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests from the cop raid
All can relate, from the streets to the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down, I'm predictin' a heatwave, forecast your whole body

Ey yo tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry snaking
Black Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin
Caught me in the airport gust that I was thinkin'
On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances
Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you
It's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol
'Cause I'm a suit case king
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin
No wage bet, we stay winning, play it again, yo
Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again
Round knife, fork, under the tents, coming to rents
Get out the way or let the shotty dispense
Revenge killers who make the events iller

Verse One: Prodigy
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
KnowhatI'mean? Have a situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover, while I be dippin in the Range Rover
All jeweled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sippin Asti Spumante
Niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really yeah
but keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You want to bust caps I get, all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back, the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely, 'cause niggaz want to toast me

[Verse Two: Havoc]
Yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the con-sequences
Count up my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
Sling do my thing organize fiend servants

See LK pushing for that King of New York
Few million dollar cribs
Liberace jewel box, go ox
Ostrich leather shoes, the egyptian socks
Tailor made shoes built like a brick house
Six foot nine, son
The guard had to duck in his house
Keep a trail of bitches, I'm talking three on each side
The head of this to the kid
Walk with black pride
He a monsoon mastermind
Flyer than the Isleys
Put a pop in your pudding
But not the Cosby's type
I'm talking big guns and Cadillac coupes
The New York monsignor's just scared of his suits
And his truth is like loyal lions, ready to feast
At the first drop of blood that falls down from the beast
Roam these streets with iced out case for the syndicate

Sling remarkable razor lines
Organized crime brung shotty's under the trenchcoat
Black Bugatti with gold spokes
Folks get heart attacks
Sitting on top of the glow
Money in garbage bags
Washing up the restaurants, nightclubs, etc
Pinky ring work for small isle and I raise the bezela
Women on they're night strolls turning tricks and they train a go
Nothin' stoppin' my function
Got coppers on the payroll
Lawyers and judges quick to toss cases when I say so
King of New York with pesos
Leaving 'em foaming, mouths stitched
Eyes wide shut but speaking on my firm
When will they learn
Loose lips will get your flesh burned
Puffing on a Cohiba Cuban
Them rubies got some bullets with they're name on it
And I'm itching to send it through
City is mine with war on my mind
And take to throw my design
Yes, it's mine, I claim the spot cause I'm

Headlocked and bitch spit in the mouth while she screaming
Tie her to the cross in the church and write ""Demon"" in blood
On the titties, no remorse for life
He wild for the night, son, gun and knife
Living trife reckless, hang a man by his necklace
Then mail it to his family with blood still on it
Few black roses, maybe a finger or two
He out to be the King of New York
And he gon' do exactly what he put his mind to
He a crimeboy, he's diligent
Silverback gorilla and he's killing it

The light goes
The sacrifice
The glory of the ghost controls the soul

Time to surrender your physical being
So I can hear your touch and smell, and start seeing
Life as a precious gift given from God
So I can enjoy my scene and start healing me scars
Take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly
Come on Lester Cane, you better show me
You're a man of your work, a criminal conduct
You gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up
He took the knife, the look on his face got calmer
I watched him take his life like a suicide bomber

It's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word
I'm a G and my bond will never swerve
I dreamed about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it
Now I'm face-to-face with a death angel
Thinking about the lies that I took with no strife
Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life
But it's for a good reason
My spirit needs to be replenished so I walk on my soul and be delinquent

Lifeless, his body left stuck in a chair
It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there
I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth
Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers
Be a simple man, but along a ruthless killer
Crime born syndicate, another sinner
Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken
Or leave my seat in this cold world, my heart's aching

Man up soldier, no need to back it up now
I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes
Jewels on, thinking clusty
Me and the father ain't rusty
What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore
Did you lie to your brother Cane or died I die in vain?
You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
You a general, love the life you find in the city
Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want
Think about it, me and you is one force
There's no limit the way they can take it, time is ticking, jump up in my corpse
And be true living king that you are, you need to live again
So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
Drink the finest wines and dawn on exotic moods
Tell the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels
So you hesitating - I didn't hesitate but you
When it was my time to go, I'm cocked it and show and prove

Raekwon,"Ayo gas station Sammy, rich nigga live in Miami
They killed him and lived with his family
He was drunk spazzin' on a young nigga with cash
They did the best to him, whooped his ass
Bloody out, his ear was ripped, they know he loved his music
They poked him twice, his gear was ripped
Ninja style, niggas whipped him with a Benz belt, broke his arm
Crushed his Audemars with whelps
On his face, they was slappin' him, fake ass rapper
Old ass gun, pussy get Tinactin
Medicine face, nigga, they opened his mouth
A few gold fell out, wheel him out
He thinkin' he a gangsta?
Quit playin', listenin' to Sid and them
Because he sat up in bed to bid with 'em
Fishcakes, bubblegum shrimps in his Timbs
He had 12 and a half on, only wore 10
Niggas is lame, and I'm sayin'
All that hard, no damn frame, how you playin'?
Thought you bubble with the big Willies, flyin' in fast cars
And get busy, now he sittin' there lookin' dizzy
Don't look at Chef, nigga look at your rep
What dinosaur game you playin', they playin' death
Tax man comin', you can feel it
Besides, hold the ratchets in both arms
They gave it to him, peel it

Kill niggas, let it die, live with the feelings
We don't know no other way, just get millions

Him and his horse, Ganny and Ronald, two wild sopranos
Runnin' through ice, and niggas fall back
They bumped in the crunch, out of Eglinton
Selected niggas coal black
Used to wash them niggas up for chump change
Somethin' was strange, feds was listenin', ran out of the gun range
Son I feel vibes, not knowin' this was the time
To get away, but they rolled on alive
Black freeze out of the bushes, came deezed
Big three pound, four of them were beams
When they rushed him they cuffed him, we cussed them
Yo what the fuck?
You doin' life, little nigga, who the sucker, what?
Black was mad, he went for the cop's mag
They started susslin', the shot rang, that's bad
Black fellow was mizzed, like 33 Ds
Let off 100 shots, went mad

Came back, large par, ain't nothin' sweet
My dome is yellin', ""Go home!"" but I ain't through
So many years in my career, it's a long route
Thinkin' when Cap skinned his face on the plaster
We was dusted back then, I smoked the last of it
And jumped into the Acura, sleepin' in Sibble's, what it do?

Eating spaghetti, drinking on Dom Pérignon
With two other goons laughing, probably joking bout the murder
I calmly approach them with the burner
When they realized the real live G was about to serve 'em
60 pieces blew through his jaw, closing his curtains
Now it's total chaos, the people running for they lives
The other cocksuckers tried reaching for their hammers

Niggas seen us comin', blew a flat
Pulled over to the shoulder
Popped the trunk to see if it's a spare in the back
A van pulled up, with Florida tags
Three men jumped out with guns drawn and they all wore masks
Snatched me up and handcuffed me
Hit me with the butt of the gun
I'm thinkin' to myself, ""The war just begun""
Thirty minutes in the ride, the mask came off
A chick was driving, two in the back had Russian accents
Askin' who my connect is, where he rest shit

Let me tell y'all a story, man
Listen man, from here

I'm tired of fishscale wars stayin' in all green
New Balance sneaker, white wranglers on the scene
We was youngsters, 80's babies getting in shit
Stolen cars, fell from monkey bars, flippin' and shit
Little thieves fresh out the P's
Broke heads is sled, slidin' through, two' five in my sleeves
Eggs and cheese, young niggas, by any means
We was saved watching Malcolm and Martin
Hold them things police, freeze, niggas is jettin'
No time for off track bettin', we was wetting niggas
Take these gunshots, sippin' rum shots on the roof
Hibernating blow with ease
Better needs, the father seeds
Cutting school, dippin' but truancy Ds
Influenced me with trees
Blue and cream, sat back, all I know is how to dream
Check the theme, watch the playboys run with kings

Now it's all about good livin', raising my children
I done seen the flames, escaped from the hell storms
Credentials of a high chief, blowin' on that potent broc' leaf
My old earth got a chance to see a black man run the white house
She shows her bright teeth, oh what a beautiful sight
But still some livin' strenuous through the struggles are unbearable
To ease the pain and eagerly seek the preacher for parables
To stop the rain and hoping somewhere to bring some sunshine I'm
Livin' proof that it's possible, any obstacle, you face it
Can be erased son, don't let it conquer you
Throughout my journey had some snakes in my past
But I couldn't let 'em strike me and catch the Devilish germ from 'em
But the lesson was valuable, yeah, I learned from 'em
If they ain't godly, they wicked, there's no concern for them
Know in a good space, more connections with more cake
Before I let some' come between a nigga I burn some'

Laid there, two chains on, where's the throne
I was slick, like poets who know his shit, cold as shit
Thugs that stay loaded then blow throughout the global quick

Good values and all
And his father was in the ministry
God fearing man with a mother that's so beautiful
The angels would serve her
What's her name?
It's Alberta
This little boy quickly became a man
From blowing in his father's church
To making his own band
Called the Moonglows
Sensational with his vocals
That drove the ladies crazy
Panties got thrown at his shows
But he was far from happy
He wore a smile just to hide it behind them doors
Him and his father constantly colliding

Destined for greatness
Counting his blessings
Young'uns struggling with pressures
That the fact that his pops was a cross dresser
But he still loved him
You know the bond between his son and father
That only pushed him and forced him to sing harder
His main man Harvey Fuqua gassed up his car
Believed his sound
And took him down to Motown y'all
That's where it all happened
Success in the palm of his hand
But unfortunate the fame wasn't enough
He wanted more out of life
Took it further and found himself a wife

There goes another happy home down the drain
That night life had him speeding through hell
Scarred by the death of Tammy Terell
Couldn't believe it, he spiraled downhill
Secluding himself
From the music and the press
He was sick and really getting depressed
Time passed so he bounced back on track
New and improved
Even got himself a new wife too
Everything is on the up and up
Got his act together spiritually he claims
You could see the glow up on this fella
Tried to make amends with his father
But the hatred is too strong
Revolver in his palm
The warning that death was close
His mother screaming out ""Honey don't do it!""
One shot to the chest made Marvin lose fluids
April 1st he died on the spot
The scene was so horrific
How a father could kill his own son

Got the Mac in his mouth, he yellin’

Purple cloths is on me salute my presence
DNA is worth a fortune but I've still seen a life of peasants
I gave y'all style taugh you how to be fly
Go 'head and grace the sky
Gave you wings to soar like you oughta
Forever may not exist in the flesh but my music will
All praises due to the most high
With my toast shocked the world
Wasn't Casper when I said I came through when I rose to blow half a billy goat
Just because I'm living this life I'm accustomed to it
Floatin' in them fly cars damn I'm supposed to do it
Pretty women fall in love with my expensive taste, luxury, lust
Physical touch by this ace, handcuff 'em
That's a no no 'cause I don't trust them as far as I can throw though
Gold diggin' vixens who's in love with the coco
But fuck it, you know I'm here for this dough though
Let's pop another bottle of Dom and watch our gross grow
I love it

Clarity, stones in my bracelets, watches and rings
From a rich nigga's perspective you know what that brings
Hatred, what am I supposed to do when I'm so used to shittin' on 'em
Do I stop because a jealous ass coward wants me to
Or do I go harder and buy more diamonds and blind his crew
Fuck it, I guess I do that 'cause I love to make 'em blue
Gettin' 'em back stayin' fly, stayin' high
Do what I wanna, no more strugglin' just to get by
Yes, fresher than a new born baby's ass
New money, got my ex wishin' she was never in my past
I laugh, enjoy these fruits from my labor
But still feel the strain and pain that be from my labor
Spent my time to achieve all of the fortune and fame
And for myself makin' a name
But deep inside I try to cover up the scars to be a shinin' star
I guess that's just who we are

I played the beat then I tried at this
Cuban links on my neck and I just put a presidential on my wrist
This year you haters gonna acknowledge this
It's G-Rapo and Raekwon
Told the homies this wouldn't take long
My verses always just as real as a true story it's based on
Chopped the blow on the table plenty times
In the lines that she puts her face on
And this is not by accident
Anything can happen if you simply imagine it
My OG put a torch to the blunt then he's passin' it
Believe in something, stand for it, or take a knee and stand like Kaepernick
Anything to get the point across makin' a statement
You'll only go as far as you take it
20 years later and we're still slappin' that purple tape shit
Greatness so close I can taste it, face it

Smokin' chronic, no medicinal

We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room?
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more K
'Telligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate
Tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronounce-iate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Tea makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
Five-seven MB, yo, metallic green

Seize them old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on

You know about me, you relatin'

The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs

Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like the Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
Ill-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy
Hit y'all with their ""Okie-dokie""
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddammit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

Old-school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lacks the principles
Got mo' clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical

When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
We're the unpredictable, torture over your physical
Drop a bar, used to pour water over the cereal

But one Nation under God, that's indivisible

I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on

It's only Logic, we got 'em mobber than the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty, unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame

Survival of the fittest in cold days with no money

Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No.9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me, perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in see-saw
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on an open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school
Wu B This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these roots

G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Whole style is mentally strong, the strength of your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning
Regardless, I speak logic, clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

Em tua comparação
E até me acho
Talvez uma exceção

E tudo que eu podia mudar, eu mudei

Dinheiro pediu para arrumar, arrumei
O carro você leva para lavar, eu lavei
O filho você pode buscar, eu busquei
Cachorros leva para passear, passeei
Bebidas você tem que maneirar, maneirei
Pediu uns sons lá para cantar, eu cantei

Melodias, frases, poesias
Teu olhar, traduzia
Sem pudor, também dizia
Que ela vai pedir mais
Que ela vai pedir mais
Só um pouco mais
De amor

E não ter obtido tudo que ela quer
Ela faz uns pedido tipo sabe qual é

Que gosto refinado que ela tinha
Eu tenho até pensado como pode ser minha
Eu lá maravilhado e do nada ela vinha
Com todo anotado e me mostrava a listinha

""Amor, pode fazer?
O que? Claro que sim""
Depois de concluído, registrava o seu sorriso
E na sequência eu já sabia
Que ela vai pedir mais
Que ela vai pedir mais
Só um pouco mais

E lá nem sobra tempo pra poder falar besteira
Não de crise financeira e nem de inflação

Os MC de lá não são modinha
E a cada verso-linha é a serviço da libertação

Se liberta da ideia do trabalho como obrigação

É minha lei
Pronto, tá, então tamo
Executando os planos
Tive observando
Vamos nessa meus manos
Não pensem que eu me distanciei
Só precisei de silêncio
Meditar que nem sensei

Pra falar sobre o que sei
Sobre o quanto dediquei
De como é o recomeço
Pelo tanto que andei
Reconheço que errei
Dessas não me arrependo
As forças que encontrei
Essas que te recomendo
Relendo

Entendo tudo como um processo lento
E do fundo desse mundo penso
Quando acendo um incenso
Vagabundo, me convenço
Que o bagulho é denso
SP R-A-P, sou massa
No consenso, ou tenso

E eu domino o terreno
Fogo no seu reino
Sou um Incend Green
E meu verso incêndio
Tentam me alcançar no radar

Feito golpes de muay thai
Ou do Mike Tyson

O Rap é minha lei, também, parça
Provoca e não disfarça
Maloca, realidade viva
Em cada batida que toca, foca
Na vida e na voz
De quem nunca teve voz
E rima diz quem 'tá com nós
Quando geral bota a mão pra cima
Revolução, cultura em erupção
Com a magia no sorriso
No acorde da canção
Não foi por nada
Que apareceu na minha casa, tio
Chega na sua casa, mais do que nada
Como nunca se viu
R-a-p é minha lei
Sem vacilo onde andei
Retratei
Já falei
'Tá tranquilo
Eu sigo, me ligo naquilo que sou
Representativo comigo onde vou
A bola é perigo no beat e no flow
Escuto o que digo é o motivo do show

Então me passa o microfone

Batida, rima, verso, flow, ouve aí
Cheguei chegando, diversoficando
No muro implantando o som
Arquitetando que nem Gaudí
Servi o exército do Rap, também
Usei de farda, calça larga
E a camisa do Wu-tang
É triste ver o que tem acontecido
Os MCs que não respeitam ninguém
Envaidecido, se sente sempre o superstar
Bem convencido

Não vou vê-lo dar o último suspiro
Pelo nariz sem cabelo

O apelo do porteiro que o viu crescer
Pelo monitor, o vê, no elevador descer
Um carro parado em frente
Uma ligação eu desço
Reconheço um coração de mãe
Com a sua mão no terço

Pelo amor ou pela dor
Pode escolher o preço

Benzia com arruda e com palavra poderosa

As a single tear falls down
They haven't caught the culprit

Of men who act rotten
But we're on the trail of the fool
That put the last nail in the coffin

Rotolerò ""like a rolling stone""
Staccherò a volo di falco e cosi

Salto nel blu a testa in giù
Evitando di toccare il fondo
Poi di colpo su nel cielo blu
Legato alla vita lancio la mia sfida con un grande salto
Ma questa voglia di esplorare il vuoto
In fondo cos'è e forse il vuoto che
È dentro di me

Tra vortici, geometrie lascio al vento le mie energie 
E chissà quanta laggiù avrà bisogno anche di me

Mein Kopf zwischen Vernunft und Wahnsinn

Noch das letzte Glas Gin, noch 'n letztes Mal chillen,
Ich höre nur auf'n Rhythmus, noch 'n letzter Song,

Wär das Bett ein Kontinent, wär mein Zimmer der Erdball.

Kein Plan wohin ich meine Jean' die letzte Nacht wegwarf

Nur der der viel besitzt, kann auch viel verlieren, paar
Penner kaufen Klicks obwohl sie nichts verdien' dran
Ich laufe zu Fuß meinen Weg per Moonwalk
Während jeder meiner Gegner bei Facebook rumstalkt
Man erntet was man sät und sät man Unkraut
Entsteht auch auf dem besten Boden im Leben kein Wunschbaum
Ich lebe Zeitraffer umgeben von vielen doch einsamer
Am Weg nach oben ohne Beifahrer
Konkurrenz bleibt Standard
Und nicht auf mein'm Raster
Ich lasse mir von keinem andern mehr reinlabern

Und ab jetzt.",Vergiss den Rest,2013

Mit dir ist es Killer, denn du killst die Hektik
Mit dir ist es immer- immer cool auch wenn ich Filme mit dir guck

Ich schaffe meine Laster aus dem Weg und
Lösche alle anderen Girls aus meinem Facebook

Ey, ey, lieber du auf der Couch, als nen Pool voller Frauen
Ich atme lila Rauch ein und puste ihn aus
D-D-DVDs laufen nebenbei, ohne Sinn ist uns egal
Denn wir fahren unseren eigenen Film
Abends lade ich dich ein auf das perfekte Dinner
Morgens bringst du mir das Frühstück ans Bett, wie immer
Bei Kerzenschimmer chilln und trinken wir Tee
Den ganzen Tag haben wir geredet in deinem Lieblingscafé
Ich bin fresh gestylt, du aufs maximale aufpoliert
Wenn du den Raum betrittst erblasst jede Frau vor dir

Wir hatten zu wenig, aber davon reichlich
Die Air Max tot, aber trugen uns weit weg
Heute im Mercedes AMG, alles Hightech
Was bringt mir die Scheiße, wenn ich darin allein sitz'?
Worte hatten recht, weil sie ehrlich gemeint sind
Versprechen einen Sinn, denn sie wurden gehalten
Doch hier ist die Liebe keinen Cent mehr wert
Denn sie hält nur so lange, wie die Spotlights scheinen
Warum willst du weg von dem Glück, was du hast?
Es wäre perfekt, genau so, wie es war
Ich halt' den Moment fest, solang ich noch kann
Doch er verschwindet im Schatten, geht das Rampenlicht an
Es wird nie sein wie früher, wir nennen uns noch Brüder
Und sehen uns maximal einmal im Jahr

Zerschneidet nur weiter das Band

Wieder stellen Teufel ihre Fallen, doch es nützt nichts
Spaziere durch das Feuer ihrer Waffen, denn Gott schützt mich

Sie wollen Krieg mit uns, doch reden alle zu viel
Sie wollen uns destabilisieren
Doch unmöglich, sie wollen alle den König
Doch Fallen ist tödlich, ey

Dämonen hinter mir, ich glaub’, ich brauch’ sie

Sie, auf sie kann ich zählen, denn sie zeigen mir, wer ich bin (bin, bin)
Nur auf sie kann ich zählen, denn sie zeigen mir, wer ich bin (bin, bin, ey)

Sie erklären mir die Liebe, doch erklären mir den Krieg in derselben Sekunde schon seltsam
Viele der ersten Verbundenen sind dann die ersten, die wegfallen
Lieber ’ne Horde von Dämonen um mich, habe gelernt, sie zu bändigen
Viele reden über fünf Ecken, sie wissen sich nicht zu verständigen
Ey, mein Leben ist ’n Zeitdiagramm, was bleibt mir am Ende?
Ich schleife aus Stein ’n Diamanten, schaff’ meine eigenen Werte
Werfe Melodien in die Atmosphäre
Tausend Fragen als ob ich ratlos wäre

Wieder bei Null als Verlierer, doch alles hol’ ich mir wieder
Jeden Platz, mit dem ich mich jemals in den Charts positioniert hab’
Während ihr Bierglas nach Bierglas in euch reinkippt, bin ich grad

Geschmiedet im Dunkel der Nacht und leb’ von der Kraft, die mir mein Schatten gibt
Gesichter so hasserfüllt, so viele wollen hoch, aber schaffen’s nicht
So trag’ ich die Narben auf meiner Haut wie eine Rüstung und glaub mir, du knackst sie nicht

Hebe meine Fäuste hoch und kämpf’, auch weil ich’s nicht anders kenn’

Die Jungs komm’ im Benzer, komm mit ’nem Ferrari
Sie fahren nach Florenz, komm, wir fliegen nach Bali
Sie springen aus dem Fenster, machst du’s ihn’ nach?
Nein, scheiß drauf und spring vom Dach
Du wirst gefickt vom Tag, dann fick ihn noch härter
Sie spielen auf Bronx, dann spiel auf Favela
Doch stopp in dei’m Kopf diese Fragen und Sorgen 
Denn wieder mal sind alles nur Worte denk dran! (Ay!)

Die Welt soll ein Schaufenster sein
Doch ich laufe nur daran vorbei
Sie wollen oder trauen sich nicht rein
Warnen dich vor Gott und der Welt, lass sie reden und nimm es

Zwischen serbischen Zeichen von Krieg an den Häuserfassaden
Fremd meine Sprache, keinen Plan, was die Leute erwarten
Sie fragten mich „Was willst du werden?“ Ich sagte „Ein Star“, träumte von Raben
Jeden Abend in die Kirche, denn Mama sagte „Sei dankbar für das, was wir haben!“ (Mama)
Dein Vater ist grad in den Zwanzigern, darum, wer soll deinen Nintendo bezahlen? (Papa)
Seit damals wollt' ich meine erste Millionen bis zum nächsten Millennium sparen (aber)
Doch Fahrräder knacken und Gras ticken reichte nicht mal für die Pennymarkt-Marken
Millennium kam, immer noch arm, träumte von Raben
Zweitausender Jahre, rauch' Bong wie ein Junkie, in meiner Wolke
Bau' Beats, die zwar klingen wie Scheiße, doch ich fand sie bombe
Tausende Texte am hintersten Tisch meiner Klasse 
Vom Hurendirektor direkt auf die Straße, Schande!

Und ich war frustriert

Um sie auf irgendeinem Album zu platzieren
Keiner will sie und die Manager raten mir sogar davon ab zu produzieren
Steh' frustriert jeden Abend vor Bushido-Plakaten, träume von Raben
Keinen Cent in der Tasche, die Jobcenterschlampe ist krass überfragt
Null Unterstützung für mich ohne Arbeit und Staatsbürgerschaft
Mach' Konzerte vor leeren Clubs, hab' diese ganzen Blamagen so satt
Vor dem Schlafen Bilder von ihrem räudigen Lachen, träume von Raben (ah)
2010, ich bring' Tapes auf den Markt, nur mit MySpace als Promo
Das erste Mal Kohle verdient, die ersten Schlampen liken mein Foto
Doch Steuerbeamte kommen rein in die Wohnung, erst kam die Drohung

Ja, das Leben ist so schön, aber so vergänglich
Deine Freundin schläft wie'n Engel und während du sie wärmst
Träumt sie, wie ich sie in einem RS7 bange
Wir wollten das Spiel
Gewinner berichten, Verlierer vergessen sie
Gold und Platin
Oder live eine Kugel in'n Kopf, so wie Kennedy
Wir wollten das Spiel
Kauf' Mercedes CLA für Madre Mia
Sie hat viel mehr verdient
Seh' alle Diamanten der Welt, doch vergleiche die Werte nie

Sollte ich gehen, dann schreibt auf mein Grab ja nichts sentimentales
Selbst komplett durchlöchert von üsMG bin ich dankbar für alles
In meiner Wolke, drum schreibt auf mein Grab ja nichts sentimentales
Hab' alles erreicht, sogar mehr als ich wollte, drum danke für alles!

Dank ihnen für alles
Ich bin unterwegs, jede Minute neues Business
Dank ihnen für alles
Verschlinge Immobilien, so als wären Häuser Pringles
Dank ihnen für alles
Hab' lieber Geld als Schlampen, Bruder, gleich teuer ist es
Dank ihnen für alles
Viele kommen gratis mit 'nem brandneuen XLX
Dank ihnen für alles (ja, Mann)
Für Lisa Morales
Dank ihnen für alles (danke, danke)
Für Gina Gonzalez (danke, danke)

Sie verkaufen ihre Werte für paar Cent in der Tasche
Doch ich habe lieber Klasse als die Ratten hinter mir
Endgegnerlevel in dem ewigen Spiel, schieben Hass, weil die Luft nicht reicht
Der Druck sie zerreibt wie die Reifen den Qualm unter meinem brandneuen SUV
Wir sind noch lange, lange nicht am Ziel, alles schon zu weit, weit weg von ihnen
Glaube mir, niemand kann mir nehmen, was meine eigenen Hände aufbauen, denn ich bleib' hier
Wie aus Kevlar, jede Narbe, die wir tragen, macht den Körper zu Granit
Und jedes Lüftchen, das du Gegenwind nennst, meinen Kampfgeist motiviert
Hau mir lieber ab, aber ganz bei mir, meine Blicke durchdringen den Rauch von dem Hazejoint
Egal, ob du angreifst oder wieder wegläufst, merk dir, man hat dich im Visier!
Stehst im Weg genau bei den Falschen, zwischen mir und meinem Ziel
Stell dich auf direkt zu dem ander'n und dann friss mein Magazin!

Die Brüder vom Balkan sind dankbar, denn ich brachte ganz West-Wien ins Game

Wenn wir den Club verlassen, heißt es, King Kong war da
Frauen sind so vergesslich, fühlten sich gestern noch belästigst
Heute wollen die Schlampen alle ein Kind von mir haben
T-rex unterm Arsch bei einunddreißig Grad
Nackensteak auf Nacken des schwulen Besitzers, weil er mich mag

Un recuerdo en torno de tu nombre
Tan distinto a mis oídos pero el ensalmo
Ha sido roto en mil olvidos

Cómo cambiaron las cosas
Y aquí estamos lado a lado
Como dos enamorados
Como la primera vez

Cómo han pasado los años

Y aquí estamos frente a frente
Como dos adolescentes
Que se miran sin hablar

Si parece que fue anoche
Que bailamos abrazados
Y juramos un ""te quiero""
Que nos dimos por entero
Y en secreto murmuramos
""Nada nos va a separar""

Rafael Ferro,"Yo, Wyclef, It's time that I confess (Refugee Camp) to all the girls
(Don't do it, don't do it)
To all the girls I loved before
To all the girls I cheated on before
To all the girls I loved before

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me pain, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend
Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend

Break it down right here

One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

I'm not a ho
(You don't believe me though)
I know you're diggin' this
Is it OK if I play my guitar right about now, is it alright?
(You don't believe me though)
Alright (you don't believe me though), alright
People in the back, is it OK if I play my guitar right about now?
Alright, alright, alright, alright
People on the side, is it OK if I play my guitar right about now?",To All the Girls,2005

True moments of passion never die
When I hold you in my arms
And hear to tenderly sigh

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake, make no mistake

I don't know
Exactly what I was looking for
But once I held you I knew
Nobody else could ever do

In the heat of love
Decisions we make may not all be real
But one thing I know for sure
Is that I love you so

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake

Wanna make something real
Show me how you feel, baby

Life is sweet, knowing you found
What you've always been looking for
That's how I feel about you
Everything that you do

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake, make no mistake

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, no oh
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Our love is one of a kind

Rafael Padilla,"Sólo al pensar
Que cuando no estás me siento diferente

Cuando estás en mis brazos
Quiero amarrarte a mí
Y no entiendo
Cómo puedes estar, estar sin mí
No, no, no
Yo quiero estar contigo
No sé por qué, dime por qué

Ya, ya no puedo más
Ya me es imposible soportar
Otro día más sin verte
Ven, dame una razón
Si es algo que no tiene solución
Es otro día más sin verte

Es otro día más

Nada que hacer
Palabras tal vez que puedan detenerte
¿Qué tengo que decirte
Para qué no te vayas?
No te separes más de mí
No
Hazme el favor y dime
Dime qué puedo hacer, mi amor
No, no, no
Te tengo y no tengo nada
Estoy tan cansado de estar separados

Ya, ya no puedo más
Ya me es imposible soportar
Otro día mas sin verte
Ven, dame una razón
Si es algo que no tiene solución
Es otro día más sin verte

No
Quiero estar contigo
No sé por qué, dime por qué

Rafael Padilla,"I love you
It'll never be the same
Not this way again
With someone new

But someone new
Will just have to do
'Cause you never loved me at all
You told me yourself

Why'd you stay with me, baby?
You'd let me take the chance
Left me making plans

For nobody, nobody
You said you were waiting
For your heart to fall in love
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

But they say, time heals all wounds
I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart
Heal my broken heart

'Cause I loved you and I was true
You know I've been carrying a failure's cross
I did everything to win your heart
But you never loved me at all
I was just your friend that's all

And they say, time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart

And what of the nights
When you looked in my eyes
And you told me, you loved me?

You made me feel in my heart
It was real not a spark
But a flame burning inside
Who can put out this fire inside?

Time heals all wounds
And I guess you made up your mind, baby
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal

Time heals all wounds
Time heals all wounds
And I hope the time can heal my heart
Time heals all wounds

Time heals all wounds
Time heals all wounds
Time heals

Rafael Ricardo,"Un verso bien sutil y dirigido
Delicado y sensitivo
Quisiera componer yo
Le ruego mi señora que comprenda
Que no sé si usted se ofenda, comprenda que el amor no tiene redes
No hay nada que lo pueda detener
Y si usted es la mujer que me conmueve
Respecto al dueño que tiene
Pero se lo digo a usted
Pa' cantar entonces una canción
Y que en plena reunión, usted me esté entendiendo
Y el mensaje que allí mandé yo se quede entre los dos
Aunque mil estén oyendo
Pa' no herir susceptibilidad si ante la sociedad
Usted tiene su dueño
Y sabiendo que me entiende, ya la cordura guardar
Hasta cuando sea bueno
Y cuando la quiera saludar digo una clave que los dos sabemos
Con su segundo nombre puedo hacerlo
Quizás diciendo el color de su pelo
No importa que muchas puedan tenerlo
Pa' que se rían cuando usted se esté riendo
Y si es casó, de acurdo nos ponemos

Señora ya sabrá que no es deshonra
Ni pecado hacerle sombra a quien no se tiene amor
Pero guardemos siempre los preceptos
Y que el mundo ignore esto es mejor para los dos
Y aunque me esté muriendo por tenerla
Y su actitud me dé la aceptación
No olvide que hay un hijo ya en su senda
Que no merece una frente ni mala reputación

La verdad es que a mí celos me dan
Cuando la veo llegar con su señor marido
Y sé bien que con él esta ya por prejuicio social
queriendo estar conmigo
Sabe Dios que si peco, es quizás
Por querer sin pensar a un amor tan divino
Y por eso él considerará, si es malo entonces hará
Cambiarnos de camino

Y si yo la quiero saludar
Digo su nombre y menciono otro pueblo
O en una fiesta que nos encontremos
Entono la canción que ya sabemos
Pa´ que se rían cuando usted se esté riendo
Y si es casó, de acuerdo nos ponemos",Señora,2001
Rafael Santos,"Ese muchacho que yo quiero tanto 
Ese que yo regaño a cada rato 
Me hizo acordar ayer 
Que así era yo también cuando muchacho 
Que sólo me aquietaban dos pengazos 
Del viejo Rafael 

Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 
Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 

Se ponía triste al verme llorar 
Y me daba un pedazo de panela 
Y entraba en discusión con mi vieja 
Por que la pobre le reclamaba 
Que porque diablos me maltrataba 
Que dejara al muchacho tranquilo 

Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 
Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 

Recuerdo la cartilla abecedario 
El primer día que al pueblo me mandaron 
Porque era día de fiesta 
Recuerdo que iba tan entusiasmado 
Por que desde que me habían bautizado 
No llegaba a la iglesia 

El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 
El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 

Ese fue el día que le escuche al padre 
Que dios a todos nos tiene en cuenta 
Y con deseos también de quedarme 
Pa' allá en la nocha de la caseta 
Y me tocó quedarme en la puerta 
No tenia plata para pagarles 
Por eso es que la vida es un baile 
Que con el tiempo damos la vuelta 
Pero el tiempo acaba la fiesta 
Y me voy solito pa'l valle 

Yo aprendí a trabajar desde pela'o 
Por eso es que yo estoy acostumbrado 
Siempre a vivir con plata 
Y con toda la plata que he ganado 
Cuántos problemas no he solucionado 
Pero nunca me alcanza 

Pa' pagarle a mi viejo la crianza 
Que me dio con esmero 
Pa' pagarle a mi viejo la crianza 
Que me dio con esmero 

Porque en la vida hay cosas del alma 
Que valen mucho más que el dinero
Porque en la vida hay cosas del alma 
Que valen mucho más que el dinero 

Por eso Rafael Santos yo quiero 
Dejarte dicho en esta canción 
Que si te inspira ser zapatero 
Sólo quiero que seas el mejor 
Por que de nada sirve el doctor 
Si es el ejemplo malo del pueblo 

Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy",Mi Muchacho,2009

Raff Ravenscroft,"Winding you way down to baker street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away 
And forget about everything

This city's dance makes you feel so cold
Its got so many people but its got no soul
And its taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it had everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now

Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're crying you're crying now

Way down the street there's a light in his place
Opens the door
He's got that look on his face
And he asks you were you've been
You tell him who you've seen 
And you talk about everything

He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down 
In some quiet little town 
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone

The sun is shining its a new morning

Raffaele Ciavarella,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,

Raffaele Riefoli,"Anni come giorni son volati via 
Brevi fotogrammi o treni in galleria 
È un effetto serra che scioglie la felicità 
Delle nostre voglie e dei nostri jeans cosa resterà? 
Di questi anni maledetti dentro gli occhi tuoi 
Anni bucati e distratti noi vittime di noi 
Ora però ci costa il non amarsi più 
È un dolore nascosto giù nell'anima

Cosa resterà di questi anni ottanta? 
Afferrati e già scivolati via 
Cosa resterà? 
E la radio canta una verità dentro una bugia 

Anni ballando, ballando Reagan-Gorbaciov 
Danza la fame nel mondo, un tragico rondò 
Noi siamo sempre più soli singole metà 
Anni sui libri di scuola e poi che cosa resterà 
Anni di amori violenti litigando per le vie 
Sempre pronti io e te a nuove geometrie 
Anni vuoti come lattine abbandonate là 
Ora che siamo alla fine, noi, di questa eternità 

Cosa resterà di questi anni ottanta? 
Chi la scatterà la fotografia? 
Cosa resterà, oh?
E la radio canta 
""Won't you break my heart?"" 
""Won't you break my heart?"" 

Anni rampanti dei miti sorridenti da windsurf 
Sono già diventati graffiti ed ognuno pensa a sé 
Forse domani a quest'ora non sarò esistito mai

Raffi,"There are lots of things for me to do
On my way home, I'll tell you a few
I can watch a squirrel climb up a tree
Or make a buzz like a bumblebee
And that's what I might do today
On my way home

When it's pouring, and it rained outside
Sometimes I wanna stay in and hide
But with boots and raincoat, I'm okay
Splashing in the puddles, don't get in my way
'Cause that's what I might do today
On my way home

When it's cold and snow is on the ground
I can go to the hill and slide right down
Make a snow angel or build a snowman
Have some hot chocolate and do it again
And that's what I might do today
On my way home

And when it's hot I'm in sneakers and shorts
I can play tag or build some forts
I can walk alone or with my friends
Making up a song that never ends
That's what I might do today
On my way home
Yes that's what I might do today

Raffi,"Joshua Giraffe was born in a zoo
He lived there, too, for two years
And a half he hasn't had a bath
My mommy doesn't lick me
Even when I'm sticky from
Candy floss, candy apples, popcorn
Soft drinks, jelly beans and gumdrops
And there must be something better
Than living in this cage
But I'm really not too sure
Because I'm rather short of age

Joshua Giraffe was feeling kind of sad
Things were going bad
How little of life he had
Wasting away with no room to play
Trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo
So he went next door to the elephant
And asked him what to do
I'm wasting away with no room to play
I'm trapped in a zoo, with buffalo poo
The elephant was very old and gray
And he had a huge balloon bottom
He said, Never fear Joshua
A vision will appear

That night a dream came to Joshua and
Joshua saw animals, like crazy monkeys
And a whole pile of
Hippypotostropasuses
And flitty moths, frogs size twelve
And sleazy lizards
And a tribe of nasty saviars
But Joshua wasn't afraid
Because he sang himself this song

Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo
Nothing can go wrong-o
I'm in the Congo

Even in his dream he knew
He'd never get away
Not even for a day
Then a peanut hit him on the nose
Joshua Giraffe was back in the zoo
What could he do
Awakened from his dream
He'd never be the same
Because of things he'd seen
He'd seen
Alligators, crocodiles, tree sloths
Anacondas, cobras and
Large winged moths
Orangutans, baboons eating grapes
Gibbons, rude mandrills and just plain apes

But Joshua was lucky
He had some special friends
And that day they went to the zoo
But he was up tight so they waited till the night
And they chopped his cage in two
He discovered he could fly and
He soared into the sky with them
Wrapped around his neck
And they haven't come back yet
So if you see them get a net

That's right, they haven't come back yet
But when they do, they say they are
Going to free all the animals from their cages
No matter how new or modern
Even some pets, too
So if on your way home today
You happen to find

A baboon basking in the balcony
Or a lion licking a lemon in the lobby
Or a python perched in the pantry
A wildebeest in the W.C
With a turtle twirling in your tub
Don't be afraid, just say you're a friend
Of their friend

Beginning, today
To do whatever needs to be done
Let's get on with the job!

World has turned over many times
And it transformed the history of men
In the will or the skill to fight
We're ready to take part
But now further direction is required
Tonight a battle has been join
We will not fail
Regrettably, we know believe that only force will make them live.

I just wanna say this right now
That regardless of what they say about it
There's nothing new, only different!
Never forget this, the future is to those who take it
All I say is that noting is easy, and the best things are the hardest.

That isn't enough, it is madness!

Some men see things as they are and say why?
I dream things that never were and say why not.

Epic battle has ended,
Thank you, good night and farewell.",Le Banquet,2012

But look into the mirror of life

You've had your years on earth

Magnetic fields are disturbed sometimes.

Is the flying dutchman real,
Are they transferred from space and time in another sphere?

We searched for ages for the place
But no one yet has found a way through the haze, no

Myths and legends wind 'round treasure there to find
A whole civilization died
And all they knew, it sunk with them in their grave

The scientists found out some theories about
An earthquake dragged it all away,
Maybe this was meant in tales 'bout the flood...

The earth has changed its face and took our fruits away
We know, the people there were wise
Was mankind's cradle lost before our time?

I've heard from a neighbour, he saw them at home.
They stood before his window watching him, so

Yeah, they study our life.
Before they get in contact with us they must know who we are.

Do you know 'bout the U.F.O.'s

For peace it shall be too late

Not a friend of debates

Your daddy's in the east
Mother's tears made pictures wet
Turning sleepless in her bed.
He's leaving, he's leaving now

It's too late
Too late to turn around, your last goodbye

Fighting the aggressor back
Right is on your side

The system filled her head with lies
Do I care if she's alive
Or if she dies for my victory?
As long as I'm a TV-star
My conscience wouldn't go so far
She's leaving, she's leaving life.
Some say we fight against ourselves
Their weapons made by our hands
If it's sure I've lost already
Now I hear my wife, she's calling
Don't leave me, don't leave me now

Forget about the time

And from the first sight to the last
The world is tumbling into vertigo

I can lead you, ways to explore you
Ways you'd never find
I can make you mine if I want to
You'd make up my mind
Feel these healing hands
Eyes of fire, magic pendulum
Makes you dizzy at first sight
Now my time has come

Oh, something touched you deep inside
Oh, take hold of a distant light
Oh, hypnotized, feels like vertigo",Vertigo,1994
Rage,"Now, as I had a look at you
It took a heartbeat and I knew
That the candle of my life was burning shorter.
You turned me 'round to face myself,
To make me trust in what I am,
Now, after all that I have done it makes me wonder I'm around.

Now the night has gone, better days to come,
All this time I have been afraid, it is not too late.

All this time while we talked my thoughts collided.
All this time I could have seen but I was blind,
All this time.

I thought I'd never see the day
That in myself I'd feel this way.
We are the meaning and we know,
Forever different, the same.

Now the night has gone, better days to come.
All this time I have strained my mind, waiting for a sign.

Time is like a river that is running out to sea.
We can't touch the ground, so grab a blade of straw.

When you hit the shores of love you cannot die.",All This Time,1995
Rage,"I've seen it coming, it's got to be.
No illusions at the turning of the century.
All our wishes - forever free -
all destroyed because somehow we lost the masterkey.

Leaving my dreams far behind,
got no ambitions in time if only I'm so

Black in mind, When there's no point in making it.
Black in mind. When there's no hope for love, I'm so
Black in mind. When these madmen are wasting it.
Black in mind. I don't want to be sacrificed for

a territorial war. Leave me alone, I'm so black in mind.

You made me want it, too blind to see
that all it gave me were illusions of reality.
My eyes got used to the things they've seen,
now where's the difference between my life and the TV screen.",Black in Mind,1995
Rage,"(Music and Lyrics by P. Wagner)
It was the year of madness and insanity.
There was no other cure for my disease
The overdose - I took it Rcause I had to flee,
It was nearly a journey that had no return,
The fever burned, I was gone - delirium.
There I was striding to heaven and they were calling me
From beyond and I heard : ³Dont look back !²
But I did and my eyes, they can¹t forget that sight
Rcause all water and land was dead.
Destroyed, denied, all tears undried,
The crawling chaos comes,
The twilight died, eternal night,
The crawling chaos comes.
A giant maelstrom, absorbing what we¹d left back,
The desert of cadaverous, mortal loam
And jungles of decay and decadence, where once
Had been the homelands of my people,
Temples of my ancestors, they were gone, dead and gone
Then the cracks in the ground, they were breaking up
And all water was streaming in,
Manifesting the sight of the dead Berlin
And London and Paris were graves.
",The Crawling Chaos,1995
Rage,"From the beginning you learned that we all have to die.
You got so used to the fact that you don't wonder why.
you don't ask:
how does it feel to someone when the moment has come?
When all is taken away, an existence is gone, who'll be his guide?

Take his soul and take his mind
and his opened eyes stay blind.

Forever - you know there was someone inside,
the smile on these lips don't seem right.
Forever's a very long time.
Forever - these cheeks growing colder and grey,
a smile that is fading away.
Forever's a very long time.

You know it happens a thousand times every day.

You can't imagine you might be the next, you don't want to care.
But Lady luck is a bitch, won't stay at one place twice,
wipes a curl from your eye and kisses you goodbye, bye bye...

Leaves your soul and leaves your mind
and your broken eyes stay blind.

Forever....

So take good care of what you say.
It might be coming back one day.
So take good care of what you do.
This chance might be the last for you.

Forever - forever and ever, forever's a very long time.",Forever,1995
Rage,"I've been sitting, wondering. Where am I to go?
I spend time on too many things, turn my tides too slow.

I never felt so sick, that's all I know.
but when I hit my strings too loud
Then I will let my demons out

My RAGE - there's danger in my smile.
My RAGE - no, this is not my stile.

In the suburbs of my mind lives a gang of four
joining me from time to time in my mental war.

I never felt so mean, that's all I know.
But when I hit my strings to loud
then I will let my demons out

My RAGE...

Now I will let my demons out...

They are all so negative, but now I'll get them down,
I'll answer with my RAGE...",My Rage,1995

Soldiers killing for their thrills,
Making war just for the sake of war.

Leave me be, misery!

Weep with the children and stave with the prisoners
Before you scream for revenge.

Sorrowful women with tears in their hollow eyes 
This is no justice, this is the price of war.
The price of war

Some came running to the military,
Misled by a false ideal,
Believing guns could solve a problem, still
Blind to see they only kill.

Ripped off from the middle,
Ripped off from head to toes.
Ripped off, multikilling,
Ripped off, guts and bones.

Weep with the children and starve with the prisoners
Before you scream for revenge.
Sorrowful women with tears in their hollow eyes

Waking up my deepest horrors,
Capture my thoughts, make me blind.

It has come to my side.

And I have set you free.
You're always right behind me,

Now that I've set you free.
Look always right behind you,
You know the devil's sent me to you.

Almost is possession now,

Maybe I can find a hold.
I run against myself 'till I find the end.
