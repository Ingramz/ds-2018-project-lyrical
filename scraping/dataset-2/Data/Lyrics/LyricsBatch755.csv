Mukala,"Maybe I was six or maybe five or three
Eating Popsicle's on my grandpa's knee
Watching football on his big TV
Thinkin' I can do that, how hard can that be?

Then I heard the ice cream man driving down my street
I had to go outside before he drove by me
Saw that big white truck and all of that ice cream
And I thought to myself, I though to myself

Wish I could be anything I want to be
Wanna be a fireman, wanna be an astronaut
Wanna sail the sea just like a sailor, but it's not the end of the world
So baby don't get upset it's just a little regret, I'm a big boy now

Wearin' big boy clothes, drivin' down my street
In my rodeo, workin' the same old scene
Tryin' to make a go if you call me on my cell, we'll do lunch sometime
I feel just like an Edsel but you learn from your mistakes

",Regret,1998

Ki jaise tujhko banaya gaya hai mere liye
Tu abse pehle sitaaron mein bas rahi thi kahin
Tu abse pehle sitaaron mein bas rahi thi kahin
Tujhe zameen pe bulaya gaya hai mere liye
Tujhe zameen pe bulaya gaya hai mere liye

Kabhi kabhi mere dil mein khayaal aata hai

Ki ye badan ye nigaahein meri amaanat hain
Ye gesuon ki ghani chhaon hain meri khatir
Ye honth aur ye baahein meri amaanat hain
Ye honth aur ye baahein meri amaanat hain

Kabhi kabhi mere dil mein khayaal aata hai
Ki jaise bajti hain shehnaaiyaan si raahon mein
Ki jaise bajti hain shehnaaiyaan si raahon mein
Suhaag raat hain ghoonghat utha raha hoon main
Suhaag raat hain ghoonghat utha raha hoon main
Simat rahi hai tu sharma ke apni baahon mein
Simat rahi hai tu sharma ke apni baahon mein

Kabhi kabhi mere dil mein khayaal aata hai
Ki jaise tu mujhe chaahegi umr bhar yoohin
Uthegi meri taraf pyaar ki nazar yoohin
Main jaanta hoon ki tu geir hai magar yoohin
Main jaanta hoon ki tu geir hai magar yoohin

Mukesh,"One night, backstage at Irving Plaza at a Madball show

Lars: Hey yo Ill Bill – will you sign this for me?
I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

REPEAT CHORUS

Lars: Hey yo Bill, we should do a track together
Bill: Word, word, let's do that
Lars: Wait, we just did",Ib Tum Paas Mat Aana(Dialogue)Meri Takdir [Raaste Ka Patthar],2006
Muki,"I don't want to know about evil, 
Only want to know about love; 
I don't want to know about evil, 
Only want to know about love.

Sometimes it gets so hard to listen, 
Hard for me to use my eyes.
And all around the gold is glistening, 
Making sure it keeps me down to size.

And I don't want to know about evil, 
Only want to know about love; 
I don't want to know one thing about evil, 
Only want to know about love.

Waiting for the towns to fall.
I'm waiting for the cities to crumble, 

Waiting till the sea a grow.

Yes it's getting hard to listen, 
Hard for us to use our eyes.
'Cause all around that gold is glistening, 
Making sure it keeps us hypnotized.

I only want to know about love; 
I don't want to know about evil,

Mul-Ty,"I've spent a lifetime looking for you
Single bars and good time lovers, never true
Playing a fools game, hoping to win
Telling those sweet lies and losing again.

I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Looking for love in too many faces
Searching your eyes, looking for traces
Of what... I'm dreaming of
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discover
Another heart, lookin' for love

When I was alone then, no love in sight
And I did everything I could to get me through the night
Don't know where it started or where it might end
I turn to a stranger, just like a friend

I was looking for love in all the wrong places
Looking for love in too many faces
Searching your eyes, looking for traces
Of what... I'm dreaming of
Hopin' to find a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discover
Another heart, lookin' for love

You came a'knocking at my heart's door
You're everything I've been looking for

No more looking for love in all the wrong places
Looking for love in too many faces
Searching your eyes, looking for traces
Of what... I'm dreaming of
Now that I found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discover
You, oh you, lookin' for love

In all the wrong places
Looking for love in too many faces

Refill prescription to the radio land
Tatoos and interviews, another way to say
You've grabbed us by the balls and taken us away
Halleluja, another video
Surgically removed, reimproved, its the way to go

I was raised on cigarettes and jazz
Cheap drive-in movies and soul
Now I live in basements and flats
Where did the simple life go?

Talk show, talk show,
Talk about nothing that you really wanna know, talk show
Freak show, peep show,
You're on the cover of a magazine, in between
There is a scene that you really wanna know

I was raised on alcohol and blues
Front porches and the front page of the Sunday news
Now I live in silicone crowds
Where did the simple life go?

MullMuzzler,"I remember
A time when I was free when I could fly away
Sky's the limit
I sang my song it was my dream and still is today

Changes come
Changes go
Where they lead I just don't have a say
Don't have a say

Do you remember
The time I traveled sing my songs to all the world
You were stronger
But that's all gone and that's okay, you're still my girl

Seasons come
Seasons go
Where they lead I just don't ever know
Don't ever know

I know you need me here to see you through
I'm gonna make your eyes shine like brand new
I'd sacrifice all that I have and more
Forever until death do us part

All those pictures
Painted by your hand I still remember
How beautiful
Nothing's changed you're still the one I'm dreaming of

Just this morning
You awoke and took my hand I smiled inside
How long we have here
Left to us, we'll do our best and enjoy the ride

Good times come
Good times go
When they've gone how will we ever know
We ever know

I know you need me here to see you through

MullMuzzler,"I never saw it coming
Somehow the heat of battle
Sure dulled my senses to the real world
Or was I dreaming?
She held my hand and knew me
She looked right through all I knew

Lie quiet, let the rain wash over me now

Inside the royal chambers
She's staring out her window
Tears well hidden by a crimson veil
This is the poison
Clutching a Turkish dagger
By the moonlight I feel it begin

I'm wounded, let the pain wash over me now

Loneliness again
Sits here alongside of me
Gotta make my way
To where the waters heal my wounds
I know this is where I'll stay
Too jaded by her deception
A trust I thought to believe
I just want to rest
And live out the best of my days
When I reach Avalon

Walking to my window
I'm feeling weak and so betrayed by all I've lost
I'm left here
To comprehend this strange barrage of lies

By the dawn's early light
The war had raged through the night
I turned to her I thought I heard her crying
I could see by her face
Before she laid to me waste
That there was someone she's dying for
Someone else out there besides me

I'm fading, let the fear drain away from me now

My fear's been broken
As the healing waters poured over me
And I begin to feel
Feel its magic strengthen me
I know this is where I'll stay
Can't take anymore deception
I just want peace in my heart
This calm I am feeling
I've never known until
Until I reach Avalon

Lie quiet, let the pain wash away from me now

No beginning or end
All of the roles we pass on through
I looked inside and I saw
My soul's my guide, I need to walk with you
I know this is where I'll stay
The world I've left behind
Has no place in my heart
I can finally rest
And live out the rest of my days
I'll never leave Avalon",Shores of Avalon,1999
MullMuzzler,"I feel my future
Tied to my past
Why don't we go and leave this world behind
Watch me as I wonder
Aimless through this mystery
Counting all the times
You've fallen to the cold
You were always there for me
Always said a prayer for me

MullMuzzler,"A thousand years of sleep
I've missed the rising sun
Wish I could change this
Always the same
With each one, every night
I'd watch as the light
Slowly fades from their eyes

Oh so long
Long ago
What he took
Then gave to me
There is no end
It's not what I thought it'd be

Left drained felt impaired
The eyes drew me inside
Hypnotic waltz from his stare
Letting go

Oh I still love
With the night will arrive
The cobblestones
Light misty air
The brief caress
Our sweet affair

Oh so long
Long ago
I was just like any of you
A Simple Man
There was nothing I could do

But I've grown so tired
There's no need to hold on
If you hear me
Just wanna be
Be the man I was

Please believe
If I could
I would change
One thousand years
And still I am
Looking like the day
This all began

Oh so long

Then gave to me
Take it back
And give back the man in me

I'm going where there's no desire
Goin' on where I'll stay higher than now

Múm,"Ay, we just supported Nas
Whose world is this? Bruv, of course it's ours
Saying I ain't been the same since I caught the scars
They don't fade, I ain't ashamed
Watch us fall from Mars
Cos it's the fallen parts and all the dust settles
And we all call on ours fast as we pluck petals
We let the love pour into our brain
Another day doing more to maintain
Saying finally those tears in my mother's eyes
Tears from the other side
Tears of joy, her little boy's got his mother's pride
You don't know nothing 'bout the rain 'til you come inside
And watch it trickle past the pane as the summer rise
'Cause ain't no love inside
My heart
Except for my mother and my diehards
I stay firm
Little brother keeps my mind sharp
If I lost yours come and find ours

I've got pleasures
Becoming pressures
They make me want to drift away
They make me want to drift away

I wasn't running from the beast, I was running from myself
Running out of street, she was worried 'bout my health
Wasn't worried it was beef
Wasn't worried it was girls
She was worried it was me and my mother couldn't tell
Something bigger than the world
For me and Ryan
Now he could see that I've been crying
Tell a little lie and say there's something in my eye
And from the second he could see that I've been lying
He would think I wasn't trying
Telling him, look honestly I'm dying
To be the bigger man, the one that you're relying on
I keep it strong
So I tell another lie 'cause it's the only way to keep me from denying
So I tell him brother listen
Listen, when the sun don't glisten
All the days turn grey and the love goes missing
Hate won't fade and the front row hissing
You're the only one that keeps my heart wishing

I've got pleasures

That was me and my Jean
That was me and my Jean

He was a scribble of boy
All hair and mischief
A two-foot tale of trouble
The bee's knees
A cartwheeling chatterbox of tricks
Completely fearless
I had to carry a first aid kit
My band-aid boy
I had my heart in my mouth wherever we went
He'd do backflips into the pool when he was tiny
And the lifeguards would get all stressed out
He was a proper Mowgli
He embraced everything
Took things apart to see what made them tick
Such busy fingers
He would empty sugar packets onto the tables at restaurants to draw pictures in
He used to draw on anything
Fantastical creatures with ferocious fangs
And now he draws with words and I find lyrics on my till receipts and bills
He was never still and barely slept so neither did I
I could never understand how he could watch TV upside down while kicking a ball
His eyes shone with wonder
Music flowed through him like a current
He'd upend a stool to use as a microphone
Singing away for his grandparents
He turned the world upside down and we're richer for it
He was and is a compete joy
The world is his

Night has always pushed up day

But I won't rot, I won't rot
Not this mind and not this heart,
I won't rot.

And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall,
And remembered our own land,
What we lived for.

But there will come a time, you'll see, with no more tears.
And love will not break your heart, but dismiss your fears.
Get over your hill and see what you find there,
With grace in your heart and flowers in your hair.

And now I cling to what I knew
I saw exactly what was true
But oh no more.
That's why I hold,
That's why I hold with all I have.
That's why I hold.

I won't die alone and be left there.
Well I guess I'll just go home,
Oh God knows where.
Because death is just so full and man so small.
Well I'm scared of what's behind and what's before.

Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck

And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's hand

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill

So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store

There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""

Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind

But it was not your fault but mine
And it was your heart on the line

Tremble for yourself, my man,
You know that you have seen this all before
Tremble little lion man,
You'll never settle any of your scores
Your grace is wasted in your face,
Your boldness stands alone among the wreck

Don't leave me alone at this time

Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals

And darkness is a harsh term don't you think
And yet it dominates the things I see

It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But you say 'That's exactly how this grace thing works'
It's not the long walk home that will change this heart

And yet it dominates the things I see

Lamenting the fact that he can see

Starving himself of goodness

Means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees

Better not to breathe than to breathe a lie
'Cause when I open my body, I breathe a lie

I will not speak of your sin
There was a way out for him
The mirror shows not
Your values are all shot

But oh, my heart was flawed
I knew my weakness
So hold my hand
Consign me not to darkness

So crawl on my belly til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all the way
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace

So crawl on my belly til the sun goes down
I'll never wear your broken crown
I took the road and I fucked it all the way
Now in this twilight, how dare you speak of grace

I'll never wear your broken crown

Called to be wrong for those below

Wanting change but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of the man who's built his life on love

As we walked the city streets,
You never said a word.

Your eyes were full of spite.
I was desperate, I was weak
I could not put up a fight.

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

You were strangely less in pain
Than you were cold.
Triumphant in your mind
Of the logic that you hold.

You said no one would ever know
The love that we had shared.
As I took my leave to go
It was clear you didn’t care.

And where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

And I hear of your coming
And your going in the town.
I hear stories of your smile,
I hear stories of your frown.

And the darkness can descend,
We can relish all the pain.
But I know that’s what you love,
'Cause you know I love the same.

Hang the villains and the crooks

Where memories and prophecies are slain,

Mumford & Sons,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie la lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

Lie la lie",The Boxer,2012

And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart will never be still

So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

Seal my heart and break my pride
Nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind

Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got

When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you've always denied

Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""

Who durst defy the omnipotent to arms
Nine times the space that measures day and night
Rolling in the fiery gulf
Confounded though immortal, but his doom
Reserved him to more wrath, for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate
At once as far as angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round
Regions of sorrow
Doleful shades, where peace and rest can never dwell

Peep the math

Mau Mau be about land and freedom

Reperation and apologies, for Africa to America oddesseys

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

It be about, the devestations of the social doministic thought

Keep a brown man down sport

They wantin to keep our (?) set nigga

The way Franz Fanon put it, you lucky I ain't ""wretched"" yet


[Big Black - Mos Def]

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Doin this for my clan that ain't around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down


[Smooth Black - Charli Baltimore]

Black Chevy, Mau Maus, gats ready

BLAOW BLAOW, black deadly, femme fatale

Underground, rats in this rat race

and black race cats sell out to the blackface

and rag grin, laugh not my light skin

be S-M-O-O-T-H from pH

UHH, backseat strappin in

cause I'm the only bitch with Big Black and them


[Chorus]

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, gun ready

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

Well how black? BLAK HEART, BLAK MIND, BLAK SOUL

Mau Maus (HOOTIE HOO!) We was born to roll!

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, aim fire

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

How black? BLAK WOMB TIL WE REACH THE BLACK HEARSE

What's black? - SHADE OF THE UNIVERSE


[Mo Black - Canibus]

Yo, yo

Yo when Mo Black start to black out bitches pass out

Stick my black dick in they mouth and dig they back out

Black monk like Thesalonius, the government got a black phobia

That's why they tap my black Nokia

Black fathers, black mothers, black brothers

handcuffed to each other, goin upstate in black buses

Black thugs, wrap drugs in backwoods

Smoke til they got black tongues, black lips and black lungs

Blak iz blak, wack MC's get smacked

Forced to go home and dial 1-800-I-CAN'T-RAP


[1/16th Black - MC Serch]

Aiyyo who that? Yo right there; blue eyes, and black hair

Kill 'em with a rhyme, or the bottom of my Nike Airs

So quick son pick one, you don't want me to finish

or I'll quickly take you to 1950 and do you like the British

Head on a spear, contusions ear to ear

For Africa Maxima, I'ma drive you out of here

Mr. 1/16th, born to kill your self esteem

Born from part devil, part cracker from Queens

Knowledge that we drop, you don't even build with

That's like me winnin a rap Grammy, givin it to Lyn(?) Smith


[Chorus]


[Jo Black]

Yo, yo

Everything black is wack and shit

Blackheads, blackmail, black cats and shit

Funerals, niggaz gotta wear black and shit

Black cars, black clothes on they backs and shit

Blackballed, if we don't kiss they ass and shit

Blacklisted see ya nigga, and you're gone that's it

White bitches, they wanna be black and shit

Tan lotion on they white flat ass and shit


[Double Black]

Aiyyo all the Mau Maus gather up and let's attack

because they're tryin to fuck with our images

and I think that shit is crazy wack

And as a matter of fact, they want us niggaz

to smile and laugh - I guess they never seen a bloodbath

Brothers and sisters are dyin, babies are bein taken out

So what the fuck they want me to rap about?

About how happy I am, to be livin in the slum

where little shorties walk around totin big guns


[Chorus]


Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll

Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll


[Hard Black]

Nigga, nigga you think these rhymes?

You think they fuckin rhymes? This this this this PHILOSOPHY

This the end of redneck-ass catastrophes

Puttin a plunger in the, ass of my history!

Forty-one shots of reality for the generations to come after me!

As it be, hell hath no FURY like a black man scorned

Nigga BLAK IZ BLAK, you've officially been warned

Nigga - you've officially been warned

You hear me? You've you you've OFFICIALLY BEEN WARNED

You've been TOLD nigga, you've been fuckin OFFICIALLY been warned

If all I did was wrong
What good is love when it can break a lonely heart?

I still got the ring
I gave you last year

I swear the tears you shed

Won't happen again so don't come crying
Saying you need a friend
Why did you leave me hanging in the den?
Wanted to write but I couldn't find a pen

You didn't even care

And nothing more to share

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Mundell Lowe,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1992
Mundell Lowe,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1992

Is bored 
With me
Manhattan, I'm awf'lly nice
Nice people dine with me
And even twice
Yet the only one in the world I'm mad about
Talks of somebody else
And walks out

With a million neon rainbows burning below me
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar
Here I sit, above the town
In my pet pailletted gown
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor
While the crowds at El Morocco punish the parquet
And at '21' the couples clamor for more
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal eagle nest
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life

Alone with my sorrow

And as long as were together 
I don't mind?

And if we go to Mexico,
Will it be a new leaf?
We'll watch the evening disappear
Into the arms of the night thief

On the pale drawn face, that was wrinkled and old
A newspaper coat, hanging loose 'round his throat
And the shoes on his feet, strips of leather tied up with rope
His uncombed hair, and eyes that would stare
At the people passing by, who didn't know or didn't care

[Chorus:]
This poor old man he's all alone
He's got no money or no home of his own
The back street's his kitchen
The footpath's his hall
And the chalk on the brick work
Are the pictures on his wall
He lays down his head
On the pavement that's his bed
And when he sleeps, his dreams fade away

He walks down the street, with his hands in his coat
Looking down at his feet, for a dog-end he could smoke
He thinks about food, good drinking and good fun
As he searches through the dustbins, his life almost done

His uncombed hair, and eyes that would stare
At the people passing by, who didn't know or didn't care

This poor old man he's all alone
He's got no money or no home of his own
The back street's his kitchen
The footpath's his hall
And the chalk on the brick work
Are the pictures on his wall
He lays down his head
On the pavement that's his bed
And when he sleeps, his dreams fade away

He walks down the street, with his hands in his coat
Looking down at his feet, for a dog-end he could smoke
He thinks about food, good drinking and good fun
As he searches through the dustbins, his life almost done

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

Spare a thought for me

Or as unchanging as the sea
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me

Don't think about the way things might have been

To put you from my mind

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

And when that rumbling shakes the walls
You can hear that devil sing

You cut off the past
Buried him here
Deep in the belly of the mines
Blasted the wall sealed the tomb 
Lived out those short days secure in your crime

Many years have passed
But still we trudge on
So we will till the end of our days
Many have come and many have gone
But there's one who never strays from this place

And when that rumbling shakes the walls
You can hear that devil sing

Murder by Death,"There's a shred of guilt in every one of us
And a pain we felt in watching you all suffer

For all that we could've done
But we wasted everything now
Now we're done.

I preyed on my own people
I took them for all that they had
I laughed at their helplessness
I left them for dead
Now I'm tugging on this line
But I can never gain any ground
And for the selfishness I displayed
There is a punishment that I've found
",Raw Deal,2006
Murder by Death,"I steal a look between the blinds
I unwind 
She sleeps in comfort in my arms
She is plain but she is mine
Our child is silent but awake
I run my hands through his hair
I teach him manners and how to stick up 
For himself when things get bad

I tell him son never throw the first punch
And If you must fight, make it clean

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, will all be forgiven?
SHIOLA, SHIOLA, Am I strong enough to start again alone?

The taste of home is filling up my mouth
Is it wrong to love a family of ghosts?
Her door is open the windows are all up
She says ""come inside""

I live alone more or less
I summon wife, child, and happiness
Build them up from the dirt and clay
I have to believe that all will be forgiven

SHIOLA, SHIOLA, will all be forgiven?
SHIOLA, SHIOLA, am I strong enough to start again alone?
SHIOLA, SHIOLA, my heart is overflowing
SHIOLA, SHIOLA, with love and anger coiled into one
They take and take
But never get their fill
I try and try
But fail against my will
I wait and wait for that hand to sweep me up
And take me down that road
",Shiola,2006
Murder by Death,"I've taken a hit or two
I've given quite a few
I swing my firsts and the cities all fall

I've broken a law
I reckon I only missed a few
I watch these long days pass through the bars
I curse the brass

I've had a cracked rib or two
I guess I've busted more
I've laid a couple out on the coolin' board

Sometimes you walk the line
And sometimes it walks you
You get quick to anger
Quick to put a knife up to another man's throat
I cannot still the hell that's in these hands

When they came to take me
I didn't fight just let them win
A man died in my cell
Damn the guards sure gave me hell
I'd love to see them horsemen ride 
So law and order stand aside

Oh this woman and gin, woman and gin
Go together like the devil and sin
Her legs are like wheat her lips are like wine
Gonna meet her at the end of the county line

Boys! (Yeah!) Post the lookout!

Mothafuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
'Cause whether your for or against this

When I spit with murderous intentions
Everybody goes, everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons

When you walk out the door, see once I flash mother fuckers
Better do the one shot dash or be one shot ass
J to the A Y to the drive by to your hood
Screamin' bye-bye to you, Why would you fuck with me?

Something to do to a nigga, 'cause you is a fool nigga

Strip and rip a hoe, way like Bo

Relaxin', sittin' back sellin' good tracks

And again and again when I rock the jam

On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love

A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

Appelle moi je débarque dans l'heure
C'est pas qu'une nuit d'hôtel
C'est dur de marcher tranquille, on a reconnu nos têtes
On sera jamais dans leur bails communautaire
J'suis high comme une OD, t'es fly comme une hôtesse
Tu te nourris de la douleur un peu comme Amy
Tu m'aimes et tu me fais plus de mal que mon ennemi
Bébé jamais je ne leverai la main sur toi mais mon cœur cogne
Ton corps contre ma bouche c'est comme le fusil de Kurt Co'
Tu sors après minuit car le diable t'a offert un carrosse
T’enlève pas l’élastique de ton chignon pour te faire un garrot
T'aimes sentir et gémir, sentiments chimiques
Tu m'as boudé pendant des mois quand j'ai sorti ""Égérie""
M'accusant de révéler au grand jour notre intimité
Mais qui peut t'imiter? Qui? Tu continues de m'intimider
On s'dispute en voulant l'inverse, on profite même pas du moment
Je vois bien que tu me mens, même quand t'es là tu me manques

I should've danced with you
What kind of man would that make me?
O.D, O.D, O.D, O.D, O.D, O.D

Le cœur veut rien savoir, alors on le supplie
L'amour on n'le fait pas, l'amour on le subit
T'es vraiment qu'une p'tite conne, tu dis qu'j'les séduis toutes
Quand t'es pas là j'suis un junkie, j'attend qu'les aiguilles tournent
Ton absence est la pire des présences, un avenir déplaisant
Une dépression qui s'abat sur notre navire de plaisance
Complètement déboussolé, Est-Ouest, Nord-Sud
Croquer la vie à pleine dent, condamné à une mort sûre
Sans ton reflet dans mes yeux ma vie ne ressemble à rien
Passion secrète pareille à une nuit de noce en mariage
Se faire des marques et des frissons qui font saigner la lèvre
On se fait du mal mais tes cris n'sont pas des appels à l'aide
T'es plus connue qu'moi t'es folle tu m'demande si j'fais ça pour briller
Je n'sais pas pourquoi les hommes détruisent tout ce qu'ils veulent s’approprier
J'pourrais t'offrir des fleurs mais les tiges seraient déjà mortes
Tu commences ta petite crise, le litige c'est ton déshonneur
Comment oses-tu mettre des bribes de notre histoire dans tes ceaux-mor?
Chérie chaque fois que j'écris c'est des crimes que je désamorce

I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons
(We all we got!) Used to be creative on Halloween (how you gon?)
Stop a hotter teen went from nada to a lot of things

But yo, what da hook gon' be (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need, is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin 'round and I'ma rip

People always saying man it must be nice
No hi no nothing not a simple house life
Understand the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no ""inch"" be expecting the ""foot""
Unless you want a foot (whoo!)
I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew
Let the girls do me while you do you
And um, all I need is JD beat to be banging
And I'll come up wit these verses that I'm usually slanging
I be ripping man

Murphy Lee,"Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark, oh-Who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fucking with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
Cause we's be in the big league

It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

Look me in the eyes and tell me if you don't lie

Wreck it just like a hoopty with insurance
But it seems I'm behind schedule with broad troubles
Twistin' and pulling
I'm like shorty help me (come on)

So I take advantage
Kissin' in gentle places trying to get myself established
I'm comfortable, want to be in that moe
With no control
Concentrating on my every lick, her every blow
Yep, I'm still blowed, but cooler than two below
And how I got that rubber on, her ass'll never know

She must've been a vivrant thang, a vivrant thang, ay

You ain't got nobody else to blame, nobody but yourself
You know what I'm sayin', mad truth to that

Let me pretend that I'm a lawyer and explain the situation
Facin' three-to-one five across state, humiliation
St. Louis set it off, phone calls was long distance
(Ay yo, it's four birdies in Houston), c'mon, send some one to get 'em

Who would do it for a grand?
Eighteen, only thing on our mind was that killer money
From Missouri to the T-e-x-a-s
Two cats strapped it tight, right up under her chest
One-way trip on Southwest but she didn't make it that far
Metal detectors went bizarre, one-way trip to the car
Your honor, she got a baby that'll drive my granny crazy
A long distance lawyer that keep on tellin' us ""maybe""
And we all raise her baby, takin' care of her daily
This law shit is crazy, never cease to amaze me
It's different from the eighties, ninety-five to lately
They givin' out time like dogs givin' out rabies

Why my Cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that muh'fucker too
It's a Midwest swang, y'all and they ain't gotta trip (they ain't gotta trip)
While we swing and dip
'Cause we keep that thang on our muh'fuckin hip
It's a Midwest thang

What you think we live on a farm? Nigga be for real!
We got Benz's Rovers' and Jag's, Hummer's and Deville's
Got a green S-Class, ain't broke the door seal
Shit ain't been the same since I signed Fo' Reel
This shit got ill, when I hit 4 mill
Five and counting, dirty six at will
Did seven on the slide, 8 worldwide
I'll be on my third Bentley by the time I'm at 9
I hear 'em crying, ""You gon' sell out?"" Ya damn right!
I done sold out before and re-comped the same night
Straight hopped the next flight, too icey for sunlight
Dunkin' without Sprite, yea you heard me dirty
I'm from the Show-Me State, show me seven I'll show you eight
Carats in one ring, heavily starched jeans
Representin St. Louis everytime I breathe
In the city I touch down and I bob and weave, ay

It's a Midwest thang, y'all and they ain't got a clue (they ain't got a clue)
Why my Cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that muh'fucker too
It's a Midwest swang, y'all and they ain't gotta trip (they ain't gotta trip)
While we swing and dip
'Cause we keep that thang on our muh'fuckin hip
It's a Midwest thang

I sport my beeper on my boots, that's why I be a buzz when I kick
Maybe it's on my lips, it's chaos when I spit
Quarter man, quarter schoolboy, half Lunatic
Quarter rubber, quarter dick, other half in yo' chick
Keep a quarter of some sheeeiit, I'm the Pooky of the backyard
All colors and all types like a junkyard
Hot young boy with hot young ways
'Cause I connect three blunts and be high for three days
You can tell by the way I walk I ain't from 'round hurr 
Probably couldn't tell 'cause I ain't walkin' nowhere 
I got a old-school Cutlass, with a hole in the air
TV's everywhere wood grain to steer (stare)
I don't care, hell naw I ain't cuttin' my hair
Ten and a half in them Airforce 1's, gimme two pair ugh
I'm from the Lou' and what I do is a Lou' thang
One rapper, two rings and three chains

Me and Murph' some ole country boys that ride V-12 horses
Saddle up and put spurs on my Airforce's
Back porches made for hide and go seek
We got space out hurr, we can ride and chief
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody approachin' us
By the time they catchin' up, we smoked it up
And my eyes be red, my lips a lil' dark
The Lou is more than the Rams, Cards and lil' Arch
My dirty's love to spark, and love to sparkle
Love, on me Vokal coats with matchin' cargo
We racin' down Skinker, see how fast our car go
Granny be like ""Ay-yi-yi"" like Ricky Ricardo
I know you wanna know why we do what we do
You cats ain't got a clue why the Cutlass blue
Brand new twenty-two's on new UV's
With one, two, three, four, five TV's

It's a Midwest thang, y'all and they ain't got a clue (they ain't got a clue)
Why my Cutlass blue
And I got them thangs on that muh'fucker too
It's a Midwest swang, y'all and they ain't gotta trip (they ain't gotta trip)
While we swing and dip
'Cause we keep that thang on our muh'fuckin hip
It's a Midwest thang

I'm sittin' on the front porch, writin' a hood rhyme
Waitin' on my connect to deliver that good line
Wish I would find, one seed in my weed
Sticks and shit, if I do somebody bleed
Pull right here, eight pounds of Chinamen
Two stay hittin' some blunts and Heineken
Hidin' in the back was the popos
Kicked in my do'do', man they some ho ho's
They put the gun to my ear, you know the Lord don't fear
Nann nigga, nann ho, let's keep that bullshit clear
They had me face down in the skreet
Errbody watchin', thinkin' I'ma pull the heat
And leave the D-tects with a leak in the skreet
And that, pussy ass nigga that set me up my peeps
Gon' give it to this nigga like NYPD
Beat the case, fuck coke, now I'm back on my granny porch hustlin'

It's a Midwest thang, y'all and they ain't got a clue (they ain't got a clue)

Murphy Lee,"St. Lunatics and we here now, we never give up
Swallowin Cris' 'til we spit up, put your shit up cause now
We navigatin, wood grain, hood slang, collaboratin
God over satan, no debatin, so I'm celebratin
This new life, off the block buyin stock
Divin off the dock in Bangkok, I used to slang rock
And it was so hard, but now the wallet sport a gold card
Bitches goin nuts when the rims hit the boulevard
Hustle hard, the whole inside glowin
From the T.V.s, diamonds went from hard to see to 3-d
Double VD, bubble Lex with the CD
Puffin seaweed, I'm free, hit the slope and ski
DC to France, finance is too advanced
Wit' plans to cause a trance, money stands yellin ""romance!""
I never stop comin, gunnin, runnin and sunnin
With Cuda spinnin them hun'neds on hun'neds spinnin and blunted

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin
""What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the Infinite?""

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin
""What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the Infinite?""

Five deep in a Yuko', we struggle by toes, we still ghetto
Float St. Louis, fake insurance, with no petro
Nuts are heavy, Teddy Peddy tell 'em to let go
'Tics are ready, Kevin Law tell 'em I said so
I let go, sixteen out of sixty-four
And the forty-eight bars left'll have you keekin for mo'
Women be like ""who do y'all think y'all are?""
I'm Mr. pull up in big trucks, I'm far from a star
Cause I'm the sun, the reason why the day gon' come
One out of five reasons why they hatin on us
Tracks is like a gas tank, I fill 'em on up
And my shows is robbery style, they givin it up
I'm like a Michael Jackson concert, a milli' and up
And these haters are like a comedy, be buggin me up
They women treat me like cows, they be pullin my stuff
And to get that up outta me more, they be suckin me off

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin
""What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the Infinite?""

Now you know Mo, I stay equipped with a zip
And the soles of my Air Force One's on e'ry trip
And on e'ry whip I choose those D's to roll
(What them niggas 'round the corner gon' start shit for?)
When they know, oh, he keep a stash in the Nav'
Pop a half and take out your Ave. on my behalf
My whole staff love to laugh and count the money
On the couch, hands in our pants like Al Bundy
I love smoke ganjä, Monday to Monday
And e'ry other day a nigga fuckin with gun play
It's ok, since all the dogs out
All my broads out, doin they bought the bar out
And we rollin, Henny holdin and blunt rollin
Money foldin, been in more rings than Hulk Hogan
It's official, Nelly Hummer clean as a whistle
You boys signed to Fo' Reel, you doin your thug thizzle

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin

Real niggas ride wit' us
You haters gotta ride the bus
Smoke 'til when my brain gon' bust

Real niggas ride wit' us (and dime ladies)
You haters gotta ride the bus (we drop crazy)
Smoke 'til when my brain gon' bust
Bank account so plush, the FEDs on us

Kyjuan's a preppy hippy, cross the bridgy of Mississippi
I slang thangs, make bread, easy like Jiffy
Call me a cool nigga or a Mr. refriger'
Kids ask me (""Mr. can you get crunk and jiggy?"")
I reply quickly, bottle of Andres or Crissy
Smoke backyard or sticky, my man, watch me get busy
I wake up with two dimes, both named Nikki
I'm a playa dirty, no passion marks, no hickies
Cats make me sick when I roll through why'all city
Lookin like angry mad, face mad, teeth gritty
You gon' make me go back into my days of you-City
Cornrows, penny bros and new Dickies
Ah shit, when situation looks shitty
I got that thang with me, plus I Puff like Diddy
You niggas can't hang with me, or pop the pain with me
So wrap somethin' mo' and hop in the Range with me

Check, check
No picture me rollin, Optimo, glocka four-four
Four-do' Range Rov', mink with matchin Kangol
Whole hood like ""oh"", freakin 'em out they mind
D's with diamonds on 'em, jackers, I know they want 'em
Not, you see the watch, Rollie or G-shot
You hear me four, five blocks before you see me, that's the knock
I need not speak on that, I speak on Zack
And how he better fix my shit or give my eight G's back
Salute the rugged, flip screen, you gotta love it
Navigational system behind the ten, duckin the public
Take my chain off to thaw out, battle four out
We fill, the fattest wad a hun'neds you ever saw out
Son break the jar out, twist the muskie
Only real niggas ride and smoke, patna trust me
If I'm lyin, bad mouth, slap then crush me
Cuss me, suplex lamb, grab the nine and bust me
'Cause only

I'm like the battery, I come through every door on a cell (Duracell)
Mr. energizer, forever ready to make a mil'
Fuck that Cris', let it spill, I hit the gas, and make it peel
I'm smokin' twenty inches of Parelli, wha, up off the wheel
I hit the jewelry store at noon, slight case of the chills
I got the face too damn chunky 'cause it's still read ""twelve""
Well hell, not a shit starter but I be startin' some shit
Half the time I'm in the club, half the niggas gettin' pissed
Me, got they miss, I done, caught they wrist
And they be thinkin' you cockblockin 'cause you gave her a kiss
I walks over to your bitch and asks her ""who's is this?""
(yours Nelly)
Tell 'em one more time just in case he forgets
I be the sleepy eyed, kinky guy, the chinky eye
Comin' be like I, ay, EI, ready the guy
Nigga hella high, country grammar, yellin ""EI!""
Fuckin' your cutie pie, forty-nine, not gettin' none

You shoulda' seen this ladie's face when I walked in the bank
I'm the school boy, I'm Hollywood, smellin' like dank
Lookin' like I don't know left from right
Holdin' a check, got the whole front desk like ""Murphy's set for life!""
I agree wit' em, I exchange sacks with seeds in 'em
Drivin' eighty in the rainiest Rov', TV's in 'em
I'm St. Lou, plus true to the arch equals I'm real
I'm Hollywood, plus true to the heart equals a mil'
I'm killin' y'all, matter fact I'm killin' myself
In a category with T-Boz, I'm feelin' myself
It gets no better, Slo says it gotta get better
Gotta get wood, gotta get dubs, we gotta get leather
I'm like, what, real playas roll on dubs (Lunatics like)
And haters can't kick it wit' us (and our blunts tight)
We smokin 'til our brain gon' bust
Gettin' head in the back of the truck, City what up

For sure, we gon' hold that down for St. Louis no doubt
My nigga Kyjuan gon' kick this shit out right here
We the Lunatics, no doubt
They wildin, they don't know

Ay yo
St. Louis is small but we still do it all
We hit the mall, we drink it all, we always gon' smoke it all
Get hit, we shake it off, at the club yellin ""take it off""
My success is takin off, I'm always workin, never takin off
I done that, did that, who her? I done hit that
Cats be trippin off them rats, I ain't really with that
Makes me wanna sit back, I relax and think back
To when I used to click-clack, makes me angry when I flash back
Mo, you should get back, I mean this, hang with the meanest
Remain the cleanest, always smoke the seedless greenest
You've seen this like reruns, pop-a-lock like reruns
St. Louis where we from, you ain't never heard a weak one

You got to stand up and get it together, roll with the punches, whatever
Get in our way, destroy ya, make you wish you had never, ever
Fucked with the real crazy, pyscho sick move the lady
Sunnin so nut and shady, kid pass me the three-eighty
By my sack, cock and load it, your world I'm a rock and roll it
My business, you shouldn't a told it, to end I'm a forty-four
They switch guns and they go for show it, your pupils is dilating
This rap is so beautiful watch The Source give it higher ratings
The 'tics just can't be faded, to nothin that's star related
More than just duplicated, Kenjuana's to celebrated
Got damnit we finally made it, haters they gotta hate it
Bought my house off and finally paid it, often intoxicated
Just call me the Don-dotta, original rider, rider
Your mama just gotta, gotta, take her home and here ""splatter, splatter""
Splatter, splatter, I'm from St. Louie

S-T-L is where we stay, in the middle, no coast

But at home in St. Louis, yo I's are walkin' like Herschell
I be like (oh, oh, oh)
Wit' a pocket full of bus tickets, lookin at booties thinkin I must hit it
Why must I live like that, what you expect?
Young dude done paid bills with them advancement checks
Honeys screamin they want more than sex, I'm like ""why me?""
Find out it don't even take that Lex to like me
I be the young dude, Mr. drop a top a bubble Benny whipper

A weed head slash Henny sipper
No I'm not ballin
I'm tryna' get it how I live and how I live is how I get that shit
I'm like nine-nine-nine-na-nine-nine-na-nine short of a mil ticket!
(Chachi'll take it) and say that Bill did it
But I'm a be real for real and deal wit' it
And get mine in the summertime like Will did

What you thought I was gonna do, bitch and scream, fuck my dreams?
Walk off the team like Rodman?
Move the scene, nigga what you mean, not now playa I'm swabbin
I put four silver dollars up on a white castle out in Cochran
Get them things out and cock 'em, anything bubble I'm poppin
Anything stumble, I'm droppin, whatever you rollin, I'm toppin
If it's fully loaded, I'm coppin, wheww
No more slanging rocks, I rock rocks, you duck cops, I cop drops
You buy cock, I buy stock, touch mine, you are not
I'm Rocafella with hard knocks, dome shots 'til I get popped
Used to ball on the blacktop now I balls on hardwood
With enough finance stability to finance a small hood
Call it Nellyville nigga, and guess who the mayor
My whole towns chronic'd out so we drug aware
I'm playin truth or dare with dime pieces, and they nieces
Showin me there's more than one way that they can eat a Reeses
Can I repeat this, man, you niggas need to see this

Twenty inches on the car, gotta lock the doors
'Cause these groupies and these haters are scan-da-lous

Fuck shoes, I want the whole fuckin' alligator

Size twenties that could kick it like a soccer player
Been a player since Freeze Pops, nigga, Now 'N Laters
I used to be well connected like an operator
I used to rub on some of the teachers and administrators
Woulda' hit it, but yo, I'm not a good cooperator
That's why the, that's why the people want to get me for pollutin the sky
Factory full a bud got the whole city high
St. Louis peoples can't cooperate without (Without)

By the daily, as a child they couldn't fade me
Brotha' my league's speakin' the truth, I'm only eighteen
Do the math, killed a pig, chicken and cow
My third eye's so versatile it make me smile
At myself dammit, I'm in the backfield like Emmit
My life is a movie got dammit, give me a Grammy or a meal ticket
I ain't picky until I get it, we can still kick it
Gimme a minute to handle business, 'cause I'm real wit' it
Soon as I'm finished, yo, we can deal wit' it
Bill wit' it, Lunatic skills to make a mil' wit' it

Got money to go, fuck somethin', we want it all
Done worked to hard to see it fall
Seven years to get our name on the wall, Cuda called
That did it all, 'cause we cool now, pockets grab for now
I'm like Jordan in ninety-five, no Bull now

Hold on, so I can tell 'em who I is, a young school boy with one kid
I think I'm five-eight, but yo, maybe I'm five-six
With my boots off, I prefer my booties in boots off
You get in my bed, you better take pants, shoes off
Now, and not right now but right now!
And I ain't backin down, she can get up and bounce
The Young Dude, quick to roll up an ounce and head south
Don't even have drive, I can sit on the couch
And wrap somethin, and put on a beat and rap somethin
They call me Mr. get all mad and smack somethin
I'm wild dude, you could probably find me on side two
If not I'm a holla like Ja Rule, get a dollar from my boo
And go and by a juice or somethin
A virgin rapper, I ain't gettin loose for nothin

Without you I'd be lost 
I'd slip down from the top

Girl you'd never never know

Without you without you

Without you woman 
The world comes down on me 

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small 
Let me be me all along 
You let the fires rage inside 
Knowing someday I'd grow strong 

Without you without you 
A sailor lost at sea 
Without you woman 
The world comes down on me 

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die 
But with you by my side 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But with you in my life 
You're the reason I'm alive 
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain 
But I could never climb alone 
I could start another day 
But how many, just don't know 
You're the reason the sun shines down 
And the nights, they don't grow cold 
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young 
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life 
I'd slowly wilt and die

Got a lake, a pool.. and a jacuzzi baby
But it's still McDonald's.. and a movie baby
That's so crazy!

[Ali]
Check
I'm at the bar, industry party, caviar
Denim suits, superstar, Cigarello cigars
Spittin bars to this footer in stilettoes

She boughetto, that mean she bourgeois and ghetto
Bourgeois 'cause her shoes alone cost a grand
Ghetto 'cause she cuss too much and talk with her hands
She say she don't fuck wit rap since Mase got saved

But baby got back like mace got spray
You know the bourgeois type, ass boombastic
Mabelline queen, titties all plastic
Niggaz front with they tank on empty

They ask for e'rythang 'cause the top off her Bentley
I roll the truck slow, the gas; I ease on it
I got a trailer on the back, four-wheeler with D's on it
Got the leather with the G's on it, gangsta gangsta
Gotta get it get it good and...

[Hook: Murphey + Ali]

I got plenty war stories, plenty hood medals

Did alotta wrong with alotta good fellows
But I got my shit together (Hello!)
I took my hustlin ways from them scufflin days
To eight million copies on my resume

I moved right out the hood, 'cause I don't like the hood
I tell all my people to think twice in the hood
The police; man they don't even lie
'Cause they got Spud and Boone and 'Trelle up in Riker's

And I just like what the money can get
A little head e'ry now and then so honey can spit
Chrome tips, a hundred an forty four of them shits
And a big ass crib cuz...

[Both Hooks]

[Ali]
A boughetto pimp loose and I know it 'cause I come to party
late, smellin like weed, no matter who throw it
I'm in the curl cap, didn't get paid but done a rap
Dem ain't Rolex diamonds - what the fuck you done to that?!

Throwin trash out the Benz on the highway
But the old school still spillin all in the driveway
And if it stop, never a towtruck pull me home
Fuckin I keep the socks, had the jewelry on

I'm like a pimp in the 80's, a Reverend Run
Preachin it to em, gassin em up like Chev-e-ron
Got the D's the beeps and the televis-ion
And my Sprint (Brrrrr..) like a boughetto telethon

But I'm bourgeois forever 'cause I got it to spend it
Ghett-o, put rims on the car that I rented
Trump money, but it's still the motel and Kyjuan

These streets, is way too crucial
I just don't know, 'bout fuckin' with new hoes
These streets, is way too crucial
I just don't know, 'bout fuckin' with new hoes

I keep the same flock, treat em good
Get they mind right, and take em out the hood
Fuck a new ho, I keep it real though
Buy em new clothes and shit, but, um, no dough

[Ali]
Like Presents, she worked at the liquor sto'
So I don't pay for blunts or them bottles of Mo'
She got the hookup, she loves to bone
She love the way the new Q sittin' on chrome
She love the way the hood, talk about it
How it used to be rowdy, calmed down and got bout it
I can't doubt it, it's deep more than just sexin'
It's conversation buildin' the Earth based on lessons
Pussy ain't shit without a brain behind it
Got these queens actin' like hoes simple-minded
Never overzealous, I gasp at what a lady tell us
Keep it peace to God, love Allah, never fellas

Like Moon she conservative, stackin' the funds
Manage Foot Locker so I keep Air Force Ones
We sit and talk, net game, net lost
Portfolio, she a broker I bought
Two cribs in Spanish Lake, one in Burlington down
She put me on at no fees, just me around
It's sufficient, ate your momma Diva in the kitchen
Veggie burger with cabbage, fresh water lavish
She study and meditate, part-time student
Work a lot, only I can hit the spot
Showin' self-control, controllin' my soul
Easy come, easy go, but all women ain't hoes

Like Crane that's my boo, I got nothin' but love
She got a fat ass she work at the gentlemen's club
Straight freaky, straight kinky, straight wild
She like to ride but she love dogs with style
Only if her son ain't home, even though we grown
That's somethin' she want him to come to on his own
So we do a lot at Radisson and Embassy Suites
Sometimes we don't make it, end up in the backseat
She go to Fontbonne, low cuts to class
Keeps the boys horny, and the faculty mad
But it's real with me, do you I got the back
Cause me and you connectin, it's hard to find that

[Verse 1: Kyjuan]
I really hate to see her leave but I love to see her walk off
Imagine what her *oooo* looks like with her clothes off
I'm rolling with the top off, see tops come off
When the streetlights go off I heard shots go off
I'm a humble show-off I'll be beating when I roll off
Pumping Jill Scott number seven in front of the seven-eleven
Grab some magnum protection gonna be some sexin'
Wrap some hemp and L's its gonna be a session
She stressing the fact that we gotta stay at the best western
I ain't cheap and that's on everything 
Put her pants to her knees don't take off everything
I pay for her chains staying near her cain's 
Sipping on her cane I'm forgetting everything
My name Kyjuan, yeah Kyjuan left none
Boy she wouldn't have been with me if you wouldn't have left her
I left her sexed her stressed her and left her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
My sex steno cus I'm taxing it I smack it a little
Stir it up like mother fuckin coffee then back to the middle
Lift over some pounds some way my hitters nod away 
You damn near caught a Charlie-horse to make your dick stay in the hole
Oh we fuckin now pumping like all my pow
Ass up face down I'm going to town
Round and round here I go pumping for nothing
Cus she wiggle and wiggle and wiggle just know when I'm coming
I'm like *Ohhhh* I can't take it no more
Move it one more time and watch my knees buckle
She tip drip type quit to get her dirty, hype, and aroused
Always see her nipples through her blouse *Owwww* 
Watch it wiggle just like the Harlem dance
Look at all that ass in those *itty-bitty* pants
Damn, hey Ms. Parker I make that ass come on down like Bob Barker

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Baby girl shake it like a paraplegic please believe it (Wooo)
Knees bent, and back arched just how I need it
Call her ""Billie Jean,"" I like the ""Thriller"" before I ""Beat It""
Conceded when she shake it but I like it like that
Throw it at me even harder just to see me react
See if it's wack, in fact see what Nelly about
I thought that ass was a fluke until I went to her house
You see mama got ass too, her sister Keesha and Sue
Her cousins, aunts and nieces start walking in by two
Like who's trying to keep they composure now
I'm feeling it can't nobody hold me down
Nobody told me how crazy groupies and coochies can get
In the back side under the stage trying to hit
And I'm like ""Baby girl I ain't that kind of guy""
Let me at least let me go get a condom I ain't trying to die
I might be high but I'm not that damn high!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ali]
Oh lord my dick hard call the nurse (why?)
It's getting worse fat asses I gotta flirt
It was me Mo and Murph, Kyjuan was with his earth
Playing pussy it hurt, smoking, passing the smirks
Popping bottle after bottle I'm like ""Here we go again""
Posting it up in the club thinking ""Is he got a win""
My chrome shoes went from Barry to Larry Hughes
Emmitt's 22's now its Jordan's I cruise
But anyway Fo Sho I'm from the show me let me show you
To drunk and out of town trying to kiss you like I know you
In the middle of the dance floor caught the man's attention
Wiggle Wiggle do your thug's hydraulic suspension
Did I mention long Ohhh, ""What the fuck is going on?""
Your body banging ma' I got to take you home
Cool lets break, to the house on the lake
Man this is great I'm dealing with high stakes

Zoop, zoop, zoop zoop zoop

You can find me, same city, same state
Carryin' more weight, fishin' wit more bait
More license plates than your DMV
Takin' more total request than your MTV
Every, gaga, they call me Dada
The rookie want to signin' bonus for that pu nada
But my, salary cap won't allow me to give a nada
I guess she be a free agent until she find another
Call it fresh, for the D's on my ATVs
And if I squeeze niggas fallin' like they last name Keys
Dirties please, watch me as I switch my steez
First name GMC, last name Denali
Why the change? Yu-kon not fuck wit me
Eight batteries, four pumps where the trunk should be
I hear the conversations, about Nelly he overrated
I'm feelin' like Chris, slightly a little violated

Now what you lease I pay cash for, lit up like the dashboard
Went from the PJ's to livin' out past Ford
What the cash for? Me to spend
Like the rims on the Benz while you pretend nigga I fuck twins
From the back end back to the club and backed in
Went to the back end gotta announce we back in
The place where my crew go
Iced out Jesus face and Parasucco
Bread sick I need your Pluto
Black Menudo, in the candy black two-door
Bmw Sport, check the Ra Report
What you thought it was a widle? Yea, them seats swivel
Cats be killin' me talkin' ballin' and can't dribble
Bits in the Kibble, ménage trois was civil
Crystal y'all, head from all, 18 ta' 80 bar
Hit the mall nigga, and shop 'till we fall
And the bitches y'all be lovin' won't even bother to call

I'm comin' down down, baby, duck when you see me
When Kyjuan comin' the spray, yo it ain't graffiti
No I don't eat bullets, but I'll feed the needy
Throw up a L, but I won't smoke a L at the city
Truck is big, tires is meaty, yes indeedy
Excursion, lime-green so I know that you'll see me
Ky-Weeze done brought them cars out
No doubt, like numba' 3 on Free City CD
It's not a game, I went from a GS to a LS
And LS don't mean low self-esteem
So clean, cats think I sip Ajax suit Vokal
Nights mis-match, hard from Zat
I smoke herb, but what's the harm in that?
Hey Mr. Officer, where Clarence Harmen at?
Only got caught once, where my warnin' at?
Been in St. Louis all my life, ain't seen a farmer yet

(Back in 1993) Was when a school boy decided to be an MC
(See some said no, others said fa' sho)
And now we comin' back down, this time in a six fo'
Zoop zoop, open ya mind up for this lineup
No, we don't pitch but rich is how we wind up
Situations, entrepreneurs get dollars and new toys
(Wait 'till they get a load of my Impala!)
We back back, matter fact goin' down down
You people need to calm down, Spreewells only goin' round
Actin' like you neva' seen a car dance befo'
They be askin' how does it feel like D' Angelo (how does it feel)
Picture wakin' up, all weed, bomb weed
Palm trees, no kickin' it on the beach
Have to work all day, dirty, 3 P.M. To 3
But at your local ATM you can find Murphy Lee

From any state, it don't matter, from here to Montana
From white girls named Anna to old ladies named Nanna
They holding up their banners and running with their cameras
Can I get a flick, you're damn right, miss
""Can I take a hit"", ""Here, boo, like this""
Chronic's sticky like gum, I guess that's how it comes
Don't worry 'bout my funds, I play around it in one

When you've seen that Hummer but that was last summer
This year I'm more blunter, more up close and personal
It's just gon' get worse now
From Prada to Vokal
The Tics are too versatile
Can't worry 'bout certain sounds
That come out these haters' mouths
I realize they can't help it just stay where you're bowing down
Some more you can't get these pounds
Unless you gon' smoke it now

Nelly's chain's so long, got him walking with a limp
Ali is throwing money in the front row
And her body's screaming slow down but where the hell is Slo
Of course we be them up, close, live, and in person
Might look like the type that be robbing them purses (like oh)
But I ain't, I'm the young dude, I be rhyming them verses
Worked hard since ninety-three, that's how I got signed to Universal
Now the girlies take their thongs off
And it be crazy in the club when that Lunatic song go off
I be that 'pull up right beside you, beating bad' type of Tic
I'm a 'hold up traffic to touch her ass' type of Tic
Lunatic, that's what I am, that's what I said I am
I'm trying to be a millionaire, I bet I am, I bet I am

(Like oh) It's them boys' on them Porches in Air Forces reading Sources
My choice is old school's over them Rolls Royce's
Of course, this Tic shit live like EA Sports is
Dribble in the club, I lay up with two draft choices
Hit the center, touch the point guard, she hit the joint hard
Oh, wee, oh Lord, she don't want no more
Cutlass is four door, stash for the four-four
Smokes' one four-four's, what them oh's go for (like oh)
Three-fifty's or more, three-fifty stick in the floor
Brand new Azure smashes, G's and C's all in my glasses
'Tics fantastic, we get booked more than matches
Imagine me without those two headbands

Feeling dapper like Dan, yes, fresh like Mannie

Pullin' 360's
Don't even call me
It's such a mystery
My Scooby Dooby

[Chorus]

Bring back my baby so
We can be like old days
I cannot take much more of
You and your silly ways
I'm trying to reach you
But I'm not Ms. Cleo
I thought I knew you
You got my so confused
Scooby Dooby Doo

[Murphy Lee]
You know my 7 digits
You know my address Solo
Come and visit
I'm just keeping it realistic
I'm young so I'ma kick it
From Atlantic to the Pacific
Forget it, I admit it
Now only leave it to me so
Now listen
Meet me in Oklahoma
We take a private Jet
To West Bahamas
Mami wherever you want to 
Just don't trip
We can dip
Just let me make it legit
Permission slip for permission to slip

[Chorus]

[Murphy Lee]
Come on Solo
You know I ain't your average young dude
You know I can go wherever whenever I want to
So if I could stop illusion
Mystery and confusion
Frequent flier miles
From St.Louis to Houston
I would do it
See most girls be kinda mad
Like Usher I got it bad
So introduce me to Dad
So we can read the sums
Make clothes with you moms
Thumbs up like the Fonds
Murphy Lee and Solange
Come on

Who did it?, it was me I suppose
J-D in the Rollz and Luda's in the Cutt Supreme
Skatin down old Nat, Gat tooked and lean
I split ya spleen, as matter' fact I split ya team
No blood on the sneak's, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
Im allergic to 'doc perscribed anti-histemines
Oink Oink, Pig Pig, do away with the pork
Only siguar needs a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, Im loose with banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when i shoot the cannon
The Wooley mammoth saber-tooth, bitch bite your tounge
I wont stop until Im rich as them white-boy come
I pull up in the black Lotus, you're plaque's are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waiting for my cue to corner pocket eight balls
You rackin' 'em up, Im big paper like pancakes, stackin' 'em up
In fact Im slappin' 'em up, Cadallacin' the truck

This is Mark, oh-Who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with

It's hella ass, some with glitter and exotic tats
You know my stats, superfly, MAC

I want to take her home, the reefer got me in the zone
Intentions to bone, we all alone, by ourself
This ain't a strip club, but she act like it
Ever seen her, bowling pins dawg, she stacked like it
Now I'm at the bar, chicks treating me like a star
In my face, asking questions, and can they ride in my car
I'm law, so authorities can't pin me for shit
Hey baby, see me and you, we can pack it up and split
Let's go, forget Motel 6, we can go to the Mariot
I see it in her eyes, man a girl getting very hot
I'm packing like a 357, so I keep magnums
Keep it real, cause you will never find out if you don't ask em, Is we tagging?

If your ass is fat and you know it, clap your hands
Wearing those pants, I'll be damned if I'm iss my chance to advance

They keep spinning and spinning, hey man, What do you call it?
Got a 1-5 jersey, on the go with them wheels
Look at it wiggle wiggle, she say it's all in the heels
You a damn lie girl, I think it's all in the skills
And for real, I think you practicing on what pay the bills
You be confused man, I look picky as hell
Never trust a big butt, that smile like Ricky Bell
What the hell?, Murphy rather pay to get out of jail
Cause if she tell me to pay, somebody better pay my bail
Matta fact, I'ma pay myself, my own money
Mr. long money, even after I loan money
I own honey's mentals man, I'm in they mouth so much
God damn, I pay for dental plans, man

Get it, get it girl, it's your world, I'm a squirrel, (squirrel)
Searching for a nut, so more than scissors I cut, (cut)
You can be a slut (slut), hoochie lady, or housewife, (wife)
A real man gon' want to hit it, it's hanging out, right? (right)
Ladies don't get offended, when he tell you that you're thick, (you are)
And he wouldn't mind coming over about six
If you like the smooth, let him, you don't dig em? Don't sweat 'em
You want 'em? Play like your panties and t-shirt and let 'em wet 'em

Hey yo, my ladies come in  Dueces like  Staley  and  McAllister
Came up with the 'Tics, they help me not fall like banisters
Sammy Sosa's got traded for Ken Griffey's
And when we roll, the L's stay lit, like Missy
Plus I stay busy, like kids, I call  it biz
And if it is what it is, I'm on your head like wigs
I'm a rapping Taye Diggs, I give the women they groove back

Work in the mornings, school in the evening, weekday to weekend 
Teachin reasons I'm the one you believe in 
Demolish ya def, acknowledge yourself 
Now you rock a small belt from my nutriential belt (Luv me baby) 
I'm the god mami, teach you what you need to be taught 
And these feelings that I brought, ma they all in ya thoughts 
You can't love nobody 'til you love you

Turns out, it was this chick I'd like to 'Ooh' wit it

Now I'm tryin' to figure out if I'ma fool wit it
She used to be the cheerleader type, school spirit
You know the pom-poms, back flips, split wit it
I know a lot of niggaz tried but they didn't get it

Or maybe they had the game they just didn't spit it
Or they won't admit it, 'cause they carry too much pride in it
I like to slide in it, flip it and dip it and take a ride in it
Hide in it, might flight glide in it

You know I did it, 'cause I'm cool wit it
A lot of niggaz talkin' shit but I'm cool wit it
Walk in a party, lotta gawkin' but I'm cool wit it
Look outside, see what I'm parkin'? you can't fool wit it

Not at all, you can't fool wit none of that young mate
Why is you trippin of the 24 Escalade
Powdered baby blue wit the Gucci Lou interior
A-ha, slide on young playa

Yo Murph, you cool wit it?
Yeah, man I'm cool wit it
But is you cool wit it?

You sure you really cool wit it?

Baby sister got a car and she cool wit it

My granny don't like rap but she cool wit it
'cause as long as I got a job then she cool wit it
To my grandaddy name and he cool wit it
Told me boy don't blow yo money and be cool wit it

So in other words Derrty don't be a fool wit it
He said don't wind up in the motherfuckin' news wit it
And help the family when you can and they cool wit it
Separate the hatas from the friends and be cool wit it

I'm Murph Dert mu'fucka I'm so cool wit it

From a correctional facility in Missouri
And may be recorded or monitored

[City Spud]
Yo nigga, this City
Answer the phone next time
You probably gonna call right back but
Alrght, one

[Murphy Lee]
(Don't blow it)
City spud said what up
And to give you this message

(Don't blow it) [Repeat: x2]
Ali said peace
And learn today's lesson

And Nelly said there's
Goin' be a party down south

[Chorus: x4]
For the nigga mention my name
I let him know the deal
City nigga, the same nigga
You thought was a lame nigga

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Now Murphy Lee is really ready
Fully prepared and well done
I told you that I'd give you my all if I sell none
Expected to sell plenty
Lotta more than Kenny
Big as ""Coming To America"" since I came and sent it
They saw he got his own money
""That boy got his own money!""
So please don't try to take nothin' from me
I'm talkin' consequences, all my conses see quince
Will literally take yo face off for the tiniest reason
I'm eas-un, eas-un on down down down down down
Makin' my rounds, I'm like a new Santa in town
Clown, calm down
I got issues like magazines
I'll leave you washed up, cut and cooked like Mama greens
You only cook every once in a while like lima beans
Me, I'm there all the time behind the scenes
Livin' my little dream (Uh-oh!)
Smokin' on Cali green (Uh-oh!)
Me, Mike Veen, federal in tinted limousines dirty

[Chorus: x4]

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
Come on derrty be for real
I can let you know the deal like a salesman
I could get you out of these bars like a jail bail man
But nah, I'm a rapper I'ma put you in bars
Judge Murphy recommend then niggas put em in charge
You practice lookin' hard and you missin' preseason
So when it's game time you on the side chearleadin'
I'll have you breathing in and out like Ali
Haters like Marley, he hot like tamales
I'm the same dirty
That came wit them boys in the Range dirty
And it's strange how we 16 mil in they change dirty
Exchange the Range for the six fo' that sit low
Haters sick though, mad 'cause they didn't like us from the get-go
I tip-toe through beats, complete style unique
16's in the hallway, probably take you a week
I critique my lifestyle, I change my game 'cause of fame
It's a shame to see results in you mentioning in my name

[Chorus: x4]

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Many many many many
Many mention Murphy Lee name like I'm a reference
I'ma make yo ass S.A.T. is you try to test me
I hang where the best be, never been on jet skis
Been to D.C. and LA like Tyrone Nesby
Though, most definitely I'm worldwide like Pepsi
And I take care of my whole household like Jeffrey
So why you haters wish to mention my name, man?
Can't understand I'm just doin' my thing
Yo I change for nay-nada nudda mothersucker
I'll sell music instead of drugs, fans instead of cluckers
Ya dig? I'm original like a black man wit a gig
And not eatin' pig is why I had to split ya wig
But they might, and he might
You know they watchin' the person who watchin' the person
Jockin' my Johnny Cochran you cornball
All of em stick like a corn dog
48 bars I'm on why'all, I warned why'all

[Chorus: x4]",Don't Blow It,2003
Murphy Lee,"[Chorus]
Noow just to prove I ain't different from you
Derrty I ain't nothin' to do
I just want to take a break
No stress
No play
I just want to lay and
Chill at the crib all day
No, no, no, no,
It's time to get that ass off of the couch
Get up!
It's Friday night you gotta get the fuck out
Get the fuck out!
Okay, I got nothin' to say
Cause we been chillin' at the crib all day

[Verse 1: The Professor]
We chiefin' laid back, loungin' like 3 pimps in the shade
Me, Murph we take a pair we at it again
Well OK, you should have nothin' to say
We guarantee it goin' be another hit man, ok?
For your reference, I been inside the house since 6
Bakin' up bars of rap, chiefin' and munchin' on chips
Now should I go dip? debate what style and color to get
We go out, we don't go out, this strickly parkin' lot pimpin'
That there sounds like a nice game plan
Nice thangs wit thick frames, no need to think twice man
Pick up some bud, pick up my boys, wipe off my dubs
Hittin' on chickens and buckets, so what they rollin' on hubs
I'm honkin' my horn like a animal straight from the barn
So what if they foreign? Prince don't discriminate not 1
(Outrageously, my baby mama pagin' me
I been at the crib all day so it's crazy see)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: King Jacob]
Now, usually I get my way
Hit my hay, yeah sip my drank
Call up a chick to come strip if I say
Let the phone just ring while I pick my place
Smashin' in John Madden whuppin' everybody ass
And it's a fact, Green Bay sendin' em Packin'
Man it's goin' on a three day thrashin'
Fuck this for real why'all, I need some action
Aw man, Murph don't want to drive the Benz
But he's too busy tryin' to dodge his friends
I just want to go back outside again
Get high again, sippin' Heineken's
Grab my 22 inch wired rims
Hit the street, got bitches pilin' in
Wait 'til this nigga get through ironin'
Jacob up, fuck this game I'm retirin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
St. Louis
(Murphy Lee, what size drawers ya need?)
A 36-38 cause 40 be too big
And hurry up so I can get out the crib
(Babysit!)
I love my nieces and nephews but I ain't got no kids!
And shit, hurry up before the bank close
(Boy you ain't goin' to no bank, you prolly gonna see sum hoes)
Ah, I guess my sista know a brotha
I'm a nasty mothersucker cause I'm poppin' wit cornbread and butter
Cause there ain't nuttin' like booty in the daytime
Look at it wiggle, sunshinin' on the waistline
And matter fact fuck the whole nine
The whole time I'm thinkin' bout this party goin' downtown
I had to get my ass outta the bed (ah get up!)
Ain't nothin' like a lil' last minute head (ah you right)
Plus I see this girl like twice a week
And my granny made macaroni-n-cheese
So I'm out

Murphy Lee,"[Hook - Murphy Lee]
Hey Maa, what ya need, what ya like?
You can get it from Granpa Gametight
She looks at me and she says..
""I wanna go outside in the rain""
So I took her...So I took her
I packed all her bags yes I took her
I took me a drag then I took her

[Verse 1 - Murphy Lee]
To be pacific she in summin fitted when I visit
""Murphy why you gotta go?"" Oh, just so you can miss it
She like me for my huggin' and kissin' and how I listen
And how I, talk wit precision, how I make my decisions
She like my, Pimp Juice potion, my motion in the ocean
And how I, keep you hot but the johnson be frozen
How I treat you in the mornin', mami you know how I be
Gotta job, not a hobby, so I'll walk you to the lobby
""Can I at least see you later?"" Now you know I gotta party
People askin' who ordered, they just victims of me and 'Cardi
They ain't the same when they get out the hood
Man I offer a fish sandwich and show em the goods
I kick fine lines, sometimes got cool things to say like
Fuck tomorrow what you doin' today?
""Ah, you a baby"" Hey hey, compliments? okay
Anyway I'm Murphy Lee, you wanna plaay?

[Hook - Murphy Lee]

[Verse 2 - Murphy Lee]
I'm like a new deck of cards, dert hard to deal wit
Can't live without me and I'm hard to live wit
My toilet don't take no shit
Plus most women need Murphy Lee like a makeup kit
I'm too nice, my future read two wives
I'm too right wit two dykes in the mirror of a new bike
I'm so the da the da the da
That the women don't mind comin out they drawers and bras
For the young brotha, the Young Dude, we young dudies
Yours truly, baby you and Murphy Lee the Skoolie
Homeboy! still cool, movies in the jacuzzi
Eatin french fries, wit belly warmers and wives
See I try to do right but the women keep callin'
They like bill collectors, they won't stop callin'..

Sometimes I feel like I'm from Georgia
'Cause I got G-A-M-E
I'm a pimp that's fo' sho then I Boom like Benny
I only seen a few but I've been through plenty
And that plenty don't believe that I'm 20
I got this lady 31, she be like ""damn he young""
Like Pamela, I deal wit her AND HER SON
I'd be hittin her AND HER BLUNT
And when it cost too much, I'd buy her friends AND HER LUNCH
See I'm summin like a playa man, summin you know nuttin about
Lost the words man, nuttin it ya mouth
My women like to say ""Down South""
Yes Yes, I guess the Midwest would the middle of my chest
Love the attention that the ladies provide
I'm a Sagittarius that need a nice variety
I'm Bad Boy like Mike Lawrey, call the fireman
All my workin' ladies be in on Saturday

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Check, back in '93 I had it all
I was a kid, yo I grew up on the ""Player's Ball""
Shiit, born in the 80's man, St. Louis Hailey Ann
Showin' my jewels to prove I was the ladies' man
Shake all the ladies' hands, feel on the ladie's pants
I'm doin' the latest dance, makin' the hatas glance
I'm wit the older crowd, big brother showed me how
To make my mama proud, look how it turned out
Well lemme get back on my bullshit
To be a playa yo you had to learn to push it
Yo, 'cause it was crazy how we hooked up
I looked up, found my face in her butt like ""What the fuck?""
""Stop, what you doin? get yo face out my fanny""
Tuckin' her shirt in so I wouldn't see her panties
We laughed, and that was a beginning of a past
That keep on huntin' my ass, now who the asshole..

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I don't really think
I don't think that you..
I don't think you say ""my ways""
I don't think I want to stay..
I don't think that you can say, your way
I've done made a lot of mistakes befo'
Yo my girl, I think I better go..

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
Yo, yo, yo..verse 2 is how we set it off
It took ya derrty 2 years just to get it off
Shiit, and even though it wasn't bout that
'cause we was young and I knew I'd be the first cat (eh-eh)
And I got proved wrong, and I knew all along
Cause 2 years lata someone said they was the first to bone
Now I got a circumstance on my hands
Supposed to be her man, first one in her pants
I stayed wit her, spent much years, days wit her
Laid in the shade wit her, sit and played spades wit her
I always knew that it would happen again
So on the side I always kept about 2 or 3 friends
Two wrongs don't make a right, but yeah right
I was in love, you what it took to keep it tight
A year later, the shit didn't shape up
I caught her on the Kastle lot straight shakin' her butt
Whut?

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I don't really think
I don't think that you..
I don't think you say ""my ways""

Yo my girl, I think I better go..

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Verse 3 is how I fell for it
If a happy home at 70, you gotta go through hell for it
I answered calls and chanced it all
Knowin' damn well we wasn't advancin' at all
Now we back at Mickey D's and movies
Chicken from Popeye's, ""I know a biscuit come wit this two piece!""
Her attitude used to urk me, sweet as can be
Booty like pie, but bah, please dessert me
And I'm not gonna be able to do it
And she knew if we spent time together we'd be right back to it
Yeep, she be like ""spend the night"", I be like ""damn right""
But when I wake up in the mornin' man I see the light
I got the same circumstance on my hands
Instead of bein' a man, controllin' what's in my pants
I left, I thought it'd been the end of the mess
But she still call my phone to death, I need help..

I got oatmeal hormones ma, I'm instantly horny
I mean, the way you carry yourself
I mean, if I wasn't you I'd probably marry myself
I'm in ya eyes, did I say ya ass? I mean ya eyes
Face bangin' haven't even got to ya thighs
I mean the walk-to-walk is like the Matrix
I could sit a drink on that ass if I had nowhere to place it
Face it, how could anybody dislike you?
These others girl are cool, but not quite like you
I mean, ayyo I focus on my pass a lot
But relationships like Twista, gotta hold ya spot
I mean, and you know that my time is skimpy
If I'm the only in yo heart then it's probably empty

I be the sun, you be the moon let the kids be the star
I know who you is, you know who I are
And when the do' close, you know I ain't goin' that far
You got keys to erry house, keys to erry car
And hell yeah, I need love too like LL
I must be on Neptune, 'cause love is for real but still
You not from much and, so girl it ain't no rushin'

But see havin' a steady girl is a different world like Freddy
Love is deadly, in the shower singin' melodies
I'll make it up if ya let me girl..

Murphy Lee,"Hello, hello
I'm Murphy Lee and I'm Zee Lee, yo
And I'ma muthasuckin' L you N A T I see, say what?
Yo and I'm here, 'cause I'm here
Yo, plus I'm here, cause I'm here
Yo, yo, I'm 'bout to tell you what I like

I'm with five individuals, they say we not original
We all started underground like Digital
Now the haters lookin' pitiful, we humble and un-spittable
But lyrical, we still sh-sh-shit on you

I got a number two, Nelly got her number too
We call a tip, girl, you prolly call it a switch-a-roo
We be at Amoco, D's on that cantaloupe
Wit my folk's pocket full of bread and toast

In my Timb's and coat, do it big in the winter time
Prolly full of Air Force Ones up outta Finish Line
And I call myself normal, casual or formal
I still be blank like a carnival

But y'all won't let me be or see
'cause I'm so D F that I'm considered a G
I be H I off J's, K's and L's
Um, M, N, to the O's, they can't tell

He's a regular guy
(I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy

You see I'm young with information, I don't play like Station
'cause it took education, dedication and patience
To get a record deal, fo' real, this ain't no fluke
To you, we like a fat dude playin' a flute

Like my granny do in the troop instead of the James Brown
Look at all these boys reppin' the same town
Come from the same moms and owe dues
Aunties and uncles, man, they went to the same school, yeah

St. Louis ain't that big
Ayyo, we stay on the hill and steal a 30 ball to get to the crib
And I can do it on a quarter tank, a quarter of dank
It's ya home, wake up and maybe go to the bank

And I think you people need to open up like mail
If you can't tell Skool Boy, normal as hell
So don't let the TVs confuse you
'cause if you didn't knew, now you knew

He's a regular guy
(Ya, I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy
(Yo, I'm just like you)

I ain't different from those that think I'm different
Still enjoy fat checks overtime, I'm just like you
I ain't changin' for nobody, mixin' up your talent wit yo hobby
End up wit no jobby

I guess you got personal problems
The bigger you are, they start openin' up ya personal closet
A Ram 150, man, still couldn't dodge it, dislodge it
Take advantage derrty, live off ya profits

You right, I ain't ya average lil' dude
We had the number one song when I was still in school
Shoot, I can say it though, I'm glad that we made it mo
No neva bein' in class, song pop up on the radio

And it's a beautiful thang
To turn street money to legal money and beautiful change
Yo, I gotta use my beautiful brain
And understand when I'm sprinklin', man, in my rain

He's a regular guy
(I can't lie, girl)
I can't deny
(Yo, I can't deny neither)
You know he drives a yellow wagon when he's passin' by
(Yo, you see me rollin' in that thang?)

His pants is always saggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
Got money but never braggin'
(Ah, say wha?)
'Cause he's not that type
Party people I'ma tell you what he's like, he's a regular guy, oh

Murphy Lee,"(feat. Toya)
[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
When I first started back in 1989
I was trying to claim games, I was barely writing rhymes
I was 7 to 8, a little nigga with his head straight
Never got to school early, always went to bed late
Grew up with the older dudes, do what your brother do
It's just so he happen to rap, ""Man you think you cool?""
Ali was my motivator, rapper slash educator
Kept these boys dedicated mama like we better had made it
'cause my first name's paid, my last name bills
Even though I got a record deal I paid bills still
And erreybody changed to sell us
I wish the fans would understand to except us and just us (?)
I know we blush, on a well-equipped bus
And money we got enough, at least enough to not fuss
We still got stress like you
So in other words little dirty we just like you
ya know!

[Chorus: Toya]
They thought he changed up since he came up
But he's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his game up 'cause the fame stuck
But it's the same ol' Murphy
Might have switched his friends up since he done been up
'cause it's the same ol' dirty
Might have switched his rims up on his benz
But he's the same ol'.. Murphy

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
I know you ain't acting front-why (?)
My fans are like the police they be asking for me
Ask them do they know me they probably say who cares
Tell 'em I'm with Nelly they getta coming in pairs
The fame thing is the same thing as the devil
People who see you never put on you on a hell of a level
I once wore scuffed up Air Force 2's
And this girl said, ""That ain't Murphy Lee look at his shoes!""
See these kids are so smart recognize you from head start
They be like ""I know that ain't you up in Wal-Mart""
Can't a brother buy his own draws I'm not a star
I'm a grown ass boy I'm not staying the in car
But people gonna recognize, they know who you are
Well if they see me today, they gon' be cool tomorrow
'cause I'm a be at Circuit City buying DVD's
And hungry eating fries at your local Mickey D's

[Chorus: Toya]
[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Yo, yo, I'm still the same dirty, dirty I still make mistakes
I know my birthday was the only day a dirty saw a cake
I'm humble like an African King I appreciate things
Let me refer you on what's happening then
In 93, had an idea we really believed in
94, 95 we began critiquing
In 96, I think we signed some bullshit
97, yo we had the number one hit
98, had to vacate to get our shit straight
Signed with Cool-to-love to get rid of one of the headaches
In 9-9, it's when them boys got signed
and if Nelly don't sell a record then it all goes down
0-0 through 0-1 we weren't below no one
and no one could ever take from or want more done
0-2, Lunatics sold damn near 2
So in 0-3, we gon see what Murphy Lee gon do

I'm still a sucker for cornrolls, you know I never changed that (nah uh)
Your body is banging mamma, but where your brains at? (Come on)
I'm still the same cat when I was young I was running with bad boys
But now I'm older hope they saw I'm running with bad boys (that's right)
Here come another man

Baby you impressive let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here momma you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see you're thong
My pocket's full of dough shake your feathers till the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly man somebody better warn them

I like them thick with their mind right (Awe)
Banging personality conversate when the time right (Naw)

They be like he the man when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the lap
I'm just a juvenile (Wha)
Because I be about G's
Keep your women wizzy man they say they have my babies
I'm young like Tucker like the cash and the money (I'm going to eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See I'm starving like Marvin girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin

Yo, turn the club 'to a jungle gym

If you know any freaks act like one of them
Get crunk again, have fun again, dirty
Err'body leave ya guns in the cars
And err'body run right to the bar
Get ya something staright or the bubbly
We ain't Bubba but it's finna get ugly

[Verse: King Jacob]
Yo, Vokal is so extreme
Strut up in the club wit the rest of the team
Thinking 'bout my dubs the compress is so mean
Got on blue and gray today, so fresh, so clean
Had to hide my eyes from the Disco beam
Just enough sight to find a Disco Queen
Just enough light to fire up this mo heat
Got just enough ice to not be low key
Look, I'm King Jacob you ain't gotta know me
But ya, you so real so you gotta know me
Addictive type and my baby moma OD
Descriptive writing made a million dollars for me
I'm just a Young Dude, young and doing young

[Verse: Murphy Lee]
Hey yo I'm Murphy Lee the trouble maker
I'm in the club with my house shoes on
Don't like being in the house too long
Having dreams about buying the bar out
I don't own a dog so sometimes I got to let my cars out
Hit the lawn on my humble abode
My car dusty but it rassle the road
See I used to have ""freetime""
Now my life like a ""Nextel"" and it's not ""free OP"" time
I'm three times, four minutes away
Peace to printed shirts for the LA in the ashtray
I ain't been in this car for a month
So I think I'm a call this a throwback blunt
Hit the corner bumping Old School, ready to drink
Cause my stomach full of Barbeque Tofu
I knew two people at the door
So I EIP, parked it and ordered some more

[Chorus]

[Verse: The Professor]
Hey wait, hey hey, hold up, is it my turn yet?
I been waiting the many let me introduce you to 'prentice
Plot - me in the club and it's 3 AM
With Murph and Jake so drunk I had to lean on them
Disgusted, I snapped myself up, this ain't no fun
I took a girl by the fat girl and smoke my one
High as can be, back on the scene, what do I see?
Dance flo' hiding her plan, they taking off things
Daisy Duke shorts unzipped with the thong inbetween
Girl, you got the fattest ass I ever seen
I give you, what you need dick, weed, but you gotta be clean
A fat ass ain't err'thing except if burning up slings
King I stumbled in to him, he still want to drink
A thick chick took him away and gave gim head on the scene
Blinking, looked over my shoulder and tried to spot Murph
Spotted three dimes that swooped him up, Menage time

Shit it's the new Fresh Prince and all I'm missing is Jada (hey)
I got a hard drive all I'm missing is data 
Please give my number to ya sister I been missing to date her
I hate to hate a hater
In fact I hate to hate
Hatin' is hatein' you should never hate congratulate
Look here my attitude is just that you may never know my mind
Or know just what I'm thinkin' if I don't let you inside
Yeah inside my mental I know you meant well
I'm out of time and out of training days like Denzel
Never the gangsta type, more lke a hustler (man)

No the dertty ain't movin nann East West coast

Some of em' lie me humble, others like me to boast
Please, my whole life is off of bets and numbers
I take a G-4 land to that H2 Hummer
Leave a 745 in LA for the summer
Got the world wide cell to check the e-mail
Plus 41k plan in ATL got 8 females
I see em' all from 8 to 12
The only player who can ball without his ACL
Who may not be original but still a dunn da da
I'm gone take his beat and flip it, I'm gone make it hotter
You go head and take the train and I'm gone take the chopper
I'm tired of niggas fronting like they top gun shockers (this is)

Shoot, they thought a dirty wouldn't make it this far
Now I'm supporting my family they liking who I are
Schoolboy hard worker they consider him a star
I guess that's why they look at us as if we from mars
Singer la ling I deal wit bars like a weight trainer
Hustlin' got me bigger like weight gainer
A once remainder, St.Louis entertainer
My women love me later, how could a hater blame her 
Shoot, I'm just that dude that kick bars for a living
Get rich and trick collect cars for a living
Houses on hills, wit great lakes in the back
Bowling alleys and basements, beds bigger than Shaq's
Damn look at the leather in that old school Lac' 
Baby doo doo green, I wonder who al' do that
The original rude dude, considered to cool 
Probably know me from touching your booty at school (Bling)

Fuck a two-step, like a band march
On the good foot, for your hood boy

Bitches better pay ya ties, we keep a rappin' veteran
Dirty knockin' let me in, known for kickin' the door dog
Think that you better niggas show me, let's have a stomp-off
Go hard, stack your cheese up until you can't see the sky
Haters be hatin', love to hate me but wanna be this guy
Catch him at his foul play, hawk him like a hallway
Chalk him and mash him, happens often, matter fact, all day

I need her loving and I'm not to blame now

(Love, love) they got it early in the morning
(Love, love) they got it late in the evening
(Love, love) well, I want that, need it
(Love, love) oh, I gotta gotta have it

She's got loving like quicksand
Only took one touch of her hand
To blow my mind and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat and I can't sleep

Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na 
Listen hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving and I'm not to blame now

(Love, love) they got it early in the morning
(Love, love) they got it late in the evening
(Love, love) well, I want that, need it
(Love, love) oh, I gotta gotta have it

You're lazy just stay in bed
You don't want no money
You don't want no bread

If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw, no
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live you don't want to cry no more

Well my trying ain't done no good
I said my trying ain't done no good
You don't make no effort no not like you should

Murray Gould,"Can you remember, remember my name?
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
And cold spirits of ice
All my life I am the echo of your past (echo of your past)

I am returning the echo of a point in time
Distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your, all your life shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
Perfect strangers

I know 
I know, I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Oh, is aching with the dead of the night
Oh oh precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
Perfect strangers",Perfect Strangers,2014
Murray Gould,"If you're leaving close the door.
I'm not expecting people anymore.
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.

Had a friend once in a room,
had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
we found a reason for the things we had to do.

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.",When a Blind Man Cries,2014
