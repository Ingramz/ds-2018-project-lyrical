Daryl Hall,"Please return, come back, I've been saving your place
Too much time has elapsed, unreality, memory erases
And the rules and the rights and the wrongs don't apply
Far apart, so together is destiny weeded to fate

Now, I write the script, you direct my dreams
We're along on the beach for the passionate scene
And it's a drag to wake up with you, saying to me

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

I'm bored and alone and it's weakening me
One night out and I'm looking for trouble and finding it's easy
You know we all make mistakes and we all need the touch of a hand
In the right kind of place, in a time of need

I could pick up the phone, but the talk ain't cheap
I pick up on the thoughts that you're sending to me
And I wait for the day I hear you saying to me

I say baby, how does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

And in my dreams I hear you saying to me
Saying baby, how does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel?
How does it feel to be back?

Daryl Hall,"My friends wonder why I call you all of the time
What can I say
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, no, I know that I'm right
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
(Because your kiss) is what I miss when I turn on the lights

I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time, 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want
Regret what I've done, regret you, I couldn't go on

And if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I'll only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why

(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist
(Because your kiss) is what I miss when I turn on the lights

I really miss you babe

(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life

(Because your kiss) your kiss I can't resist

Daryl Hall,"Make an amendment to the constitution
To preserve the state of our union
Stop believing what you say to me
There's a tragic gap in credibility

When the light is gone from your eyes
And re-entry may be denied
Do I want to expatriate
Or I, I live in the United State

Inflationary insecurity
'Cause a love ain't worth as much as it used to be
Clean break, running away
Should I work it out some way

When the light is gone from your eyes
And re-entry may be denied
Do I want to expatriate
Or I, I live in the United State

Watch the tress in the wind when it's starting to blow
Is the reason to leave, is it treason to go
Just appeasing you is the wrong thing, I know
Break away

And re-entry may be denied
Do I want to expatriate
Or I, I live in the United State

Just one oversight and no, that didn't last too long

Listen, you're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, your imagination
Imagination's got the best of you

Don't know what you're looking for
What's this thing about, ""True blue""?
You know I ain't no danger boy
You're the one I like to touch, touch you, you

When the mood is right, change the light
And the moment's gone
Better turn around 'cause the light doesn't last too long

You're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, your imagination
Imagination's got the best of you

Imagination, your imagination
Imagination, use your imagination

But your act is driving me away

Hold the moment
Fall through the night

I scratch

It's not what you say girl

Stop
What more can I say
There ain't nothing gonna get in the way

I've been waiting waiting waiting
Before you I was given a lie
You opened up my life
Will I ever be the same again
Will I ever talk this way again

City scene ain't no big deal
Soul deep so ya say
None of that takes my breath away
Oh I always seem to see
Both sides when they disagree
And neither one seems right
Too much city life
Is messin' with my inner lite
And everybody's too cool to believe

I wasn't born yesterday
You should know by now
So let's set the record straight
And we can carry on
I wasn't born yesterday
I'll find out
I ain't innocent
Lots of room for me to doubt
I never learned to cry

So far so extreme
If I'm jaded, you're naive
But behind that cynic's steady gaze
There's a wide-eyed lover drink for days
Oh I don't want to be
One of those guys who only sees
The joke behind the lie
Too much city life
May I don't know wrong from right
But baby I ain't too cool to believe

I wasn't born yesterday
I don't die for love
Just let the record speak

Never too late

People don't read so easy
Never wanna say what's on their mind
Go from dreams to dollars
Then they wonder why the truth seems so unkind
They just hold on tighter and tighter
Running down the road that they know so well
Never wanna change the order
Too quick to say that time will tell

Let it out - unlock the box
Let it out - unravel the knots
Let it out - if you've got something to say
Let it out - get it out of the way

Why be an artful dodger
Come cool kind of fool who can slide on by
There's a whole lot of art in sadness
So make it worth your while if you're gonna cry

Let it out - if you've got something to say
Let it out - get it out of the way

Loosen up baby

I can't see you when I look at you
Only see you in my memory
When I find you it's just outside my sight line
Between experience and fantasy
Don't bear up to close inspection
Close inspection of the cold hard facts
Blow in and out of my life like a spirit
My eye can't see you but my mind reacts

Only a vision in the corner of my eye
Only a vision that I see out of the corner of my eye
Only a vision

Said you loved me
Heard that plain as day
I should lose this
Vision fade away
What's holding on to me
Just some state of mind
Feeling's coming on
One more time
Close inspection
I've checked this out again and again
And it won't respond to cold hard facts
Then you blow in and out of my life like a spirit

Only a vision that I see out of the corner of my eye
Only a vision girl

Still the chill remains

Has been found again

And we'll be right as rain

Wind up tearing our peace apart
Do their best to destroy our future

Never had a chance to start

And men in power places are resigning
'cause even in high seats the woman is still fighting with the man
And tho I thought the time of the tough guy was just about over
Here comes another savior to stir the soldiers in the field
But what do the generals think about while the soldiers are dying
'cause the rallying cries don't reach 'em

Before you try to become a part of me
I'd think you'd want to anyway

But can she talk you into leavin'
When your heart tells you to stay
Just when I thought the era of the guru was over
Here comes another savior to stir the soldiers in the field

I can do hard time
But it scares me if I'm outta sync
With you

I'm going to extremes
To show a gentle man
You know I'm not as hard
As you believe
Try for you, and cry for you
Never call me heartless, when I try
The hardest

[Chorus]

This time
I won't turn away
From the love that's here
The love I needed
This time
I won't let you down
I won't play around
I swear my dear

Ain't no doubt
People live in fear
Turn away, no see, no hear
Sayin' I don't know
What happened officer
I want to be the perfect witness
Baby do we care to see it?

Show some heart
Maybe come a time
When love will come apart
We're living here
I will make it clear
Silence is a lie
To tell the truth, I'm tryin'.",This Time,1993
Daryl Hall,"How many hearts can
Have everything
Never ever found the one and all
The fire it brings
I want to try more now than I
Dared before
I've got to know what passion is
Girl I've got to find the love
Day to day, nothing there
I had to let go
Heard a call that I resisted 'cause it
Had no soul
When you get, and never give it
It's so cold
You're something else, oh I know

[Chorus:]
I've got this wildfire that only grows
Every day it's in my soul
This wildfire, it's burnin' deep
It's burnin' deep, burnin', burnin'
Wildfire
It didn't take long
All my life is not too long
This wildfire is burning bright
Burnin' bright, burnin', burnin'

All around me
There's a fire that's catching on
Make a burning field of dreams
Little spark of light touched
And grew
Fed by all the love
That I'm feeling here with you
No one can believe it, but
They can see
That since we've been together
You've made a change in me
Being alone is so wrong, it's so cold
When something's right, ooh I know

[Chorus]

We gotta live to give, live and
Let love
Be here in the moment with the
One I want
'Cause being alone is so wrong
It's so cold
When something's right, I know.",Wildfire,1993
Daryl Hall,"When we kiss that way
I search for words that might explain
How can a love go so deep?
Girl, it's in my blood, it'll always be a part of me

If we stay together
Or if we go our separate ways
I know, love will last forever

The sun may someday lose it's light
The moon may not shine one night
Your heart will always have a home
It is written in stone, written in stone

Seasons go by and minds have changed
But I will never doubt why I feel this way
It goes on, so strong like a solid rock
Even when the moment's gone

Nothin' last's forever
But one thing's sure to stay the same
Our love, the love is getting better

The sun may someday lose it's light
The moon may not shine one night
And I know just how the story goes
It is written in stone, written in stone

True love is timeless and unconditional
You don't need to read the writin' on the wall
I can see the future, happiness won't fade away
The sun is in the sky just like it was yesterday
Love will last forever

The sun may someday lose it's light
The moon may not shine one night
Your heart will never be alone
It is written in stone, written in stone

Got true love, it's timeless
But it'll grow through smiles and sadness
Won't you work with me?
Our love, it will be forever

If I know sometimes you might not believe it
But baby, I'll do my best to show it, let you see it
Time might not be so bad
But I know we'll come out ahead, girl

'Cause love is timeless
Timeless and unconditional
You don't need to read the writing on the wall
It is written in stone
Happiness won't fade away

Daryl Hall,"A young hog in the hood playin' chase 
Smile on his face 
Havin' fun 'cause it ain't nothin' like this place 
And you don't want to race 
Fool I got the new ones on 
And we can run from the corner to the Newman's home 
And after that we goin' go raid the plum tree 
And stick ball down where those bos be 
Mom's got the door open bumpin' Marvin Gaye 
Let's get it on all day everyday 
At night I pray 
Lord just let me make it 
And if I die before I wake then my soul you take it 
Never fake it 
My older brother taught me game 
And sometimes even let the young soldier hang 
As a lock 
My only duty was to soak 
And pass it on to my comrads and closest folks 
All friends I knew about it as a child 
I stood proud have you ever seen a ghetto smile? 
I'm at the junior high actin' bad at the dance 
The slow jam got me with a woody in my pants 
And my baby with me 
Her Momma used to babysit me 
And back then she was just plain old pretty 
But nowadays it seems that she done grown 
Jeans fitting and her perm gotta hella long 
Would I be wrong if I whisper and take her down 
And maybe play housesitter with her like the Pound 
It's goin' down about now in the Northern Bay 
The OG's put it down and make they pay 
Flip a 6-8 'stang with the blew out braids 
The only homey in the hood ridin' on thangs 
And as I peep it thangs have got a little deeper 
And everybody and their Momma done bought a beeper 
And then they post on the lake gettin' loose and wild 
You know the scene it's the ghetto smile 
At 18 I graduated and now I'm grown 
About time for the dog to get his own bone 
I left home got a condo out on Quailridge 
And like a king is how this young playa live 
Swimmin' parties in the pool with my dope to roll 
Wasn't trippin' off nathin' we was all folks 
Hillside in the house and we gettin' perved 
Freestylin' gettin' on my neighbor's nerves 
I love the hood so everyday I'm back to visit 
And swoop the young so that they can come through and kick it 
And peep the game just as I did as a kid 
And watch the savage get his cabbage and place his bid 
And even though we fight we still remain game tight 
Handle business and always open for forgiveness 
It ain't nothin' like a homey you ain't seen in awhile 
So when you meet him greet him with that ghetto smile",Ghetto Smile,1996
Daryl Hall,"You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet

You know you could've been some perfume

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

Well you could of been anything that you wanted to

And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man

As she rechecked her make-up to protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear that she was his for a night

And my bark is much worse than my bite""

It would have worked on any other man around
He looked her up and down

And my bark is much worse than my bite""
He said, ""Leave me alone, I'm a family man

Some hearts are better left unbroken

Is true love once in a lifetime

Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know

Or what the wind says when she cries
I'm speeding by the place that I met you
For the ninety seventh time tonight

One day I'll go
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you

I watched the stars crash into the sea

Didn't I do the best I could now

All alone, I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
May come today or it may come tomorrow
But it's for sure I've got nothing but sorrow

I thought your conscience would kinda bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you?
Hold on a minute!

Gave you all the love I had
Now didn't I, didn't I, didn't I?
When you needed me, I was always there
Now wasn't I, wasn't I?

Don't you leave me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
I'm trying not to cry out loud
'cause all this cryin' it ain't, it ain't gonna help me none!

What did I do, girl, to cause all this grief?
Now what did I say to make you want to leave?
Now wait a minute!

I gave my heart and soul to you
Now didn't I, didn't I, didn't I?
And didn't I always treat you good
Now didn't I, didn't I?

Thinkin' about all the opportunities this window has to offer
From the twenty third floor to the filing cabinet east Manhattan to
[FDR is beautiful ?] an I'mm watchin' all the cars passin'
An a couple stars twinkle so I started laughin'
And a couple walked by an they looked so happy
I booked this room at this place called the last resort
All my bags are packed I got my jacket an my passport
A first class ticket to the after life you dig me
Now is you is or is you ain't with me
An I fully understand if you got other plans
But I can't see you hand in hand with another man
I been on autopilot since we last spoke
And I don't want to board this flight on a bad note
I want you think about it but either way I'm goin'

She looked me dead in the eyes
And took me by the hand
Kissed me on the cheek an said baby I understand
You don't have to leave plus I'm scared of heights
So just put down your luggage forget about this flight
You an I you know we been through a lot of things
But it's no reason to start trippin' an arguing
She said you are my king I place no one above you
And I dont have to board a plane for me to show you
An all this talk about the after life is kinda creepy
So lets just go lay down and talk I'm gettin' kinda sleepy
I kinda smiled and we both walked to the window I pulled it shut
And started staring at the sky I wiped a couple tears away
An then we looked at each other an
I could see the starts twinkle in her eyes
I told her about the couple I seen earlier
She said I'm sure they're cute but they're not you and I

And say that I love you

Daryl Hall,"There's no decision
You look my way
I know that expression and what it says
It'd be so easy
The light is right
Forget in the moment who we are tonight
My body's singing and the music's strong
No conscience speaking ain't nothing wrong

[Chorus:]
Give it up
That's the way it starts
You've got to know old habits die hard
Give it up

Remember what I said
That kind of lovin' used to happen every day
Temptation makes a fool out of us all
I made my up
It had to end
But I've got this indecision when you're close again
I want you so bad baby
I can't deny
And those old fantasies are stealing across my mind
I thought by now that the flame had gone
I realize that it's still holding on

[Chorus:]",Give It Up (Old Habits),2014
Daryl Hall,"(Words by Daryl Hall & John Oates
Music by Daryl Hall)

You and I have separate lives girl
You and I go different ways on roads that cross
When love and loss is ruled by fate
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay

Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you

I'll try to find a way to encourage you
It's easy to convince myself
Cause I can't believe you'd wanna be with somebody else
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay

Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you



",I Don't Wanna Lose You,2014
Daryl Hall,"You must be thinkin' something
But you ain't sayin' nothing
You remember me
I used to be your boyfriend

There ain't no point in reason
It only gets defensive
Why should we ruin the purity of the moment

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the funny thing is everyone thought
We were forever

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid that I gotta laugh
And the other thing is I really thought
That we were special

Maybe I should feel guilty
Is that the American way
But I just look at myself
As if I were above me

You must be thinkin' something
But you ain't saying nothing
You remember me, I have been here always

It's a laugh, what a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the funny thing is everyone thought

That really tore my heart
I remember the look in your eyes, it really ripped me apart
Oh the look
One last time
It can't be the last time
I gave so much to make you mine
How can it be
It?s the second time around I've had this vision
And I don't like it, no

One song I'm writing for you
And if you can't take me with you girl

Love in the late afternoon
There'll be no words when I leave you girl
Just a Melody for a Memory

And if you can't take me with you

Her eyes went black with the blue

The sooner the better
The cold distant phone calls

You give yourself to men who take your love.
Then smile and watch them walk away...

Baby hair a blowin' in the Sunday morning air

We've seen a million faces
All staring at you and me
But just like Humphrey Bogart said
Before he passed out on his bed
Here's looking at you kid
And the rocky road ahead

Heavy rain, lightning too
Heavy rain when I'm with you
You know the thunder comes like a lion's roar
But it leaves me now
When you walk out the door
Listen to that northern wind
It's singing a sad old song
A melody so sick and tired
Been blowing much too long
Ain't it time to feel the weather change
You know it's overdue
Love is gone, we can't go on
Pretending old is new

Rain down

And the daylight comes
As a sweet surprise

Filling up my eyes

Guess I'm just that kind of man
Looking for an answer to why I'm in this place I'm in
Walking through a door that's closing
While another slams in your face
Neighbors say that you're imposing
When you walk in an open space
Tell me who, tell me why

[Chorus]
Only love can make me happy
Only love can make me cry
Only love can sanctify me
If you can doubt it can you tell me why

Try to find my tears within me
Try to be a logical man
Tryin' to help the world around me
But I'm so lonely I don't know if I can

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"They met on the dance floor in the old high school gym,
He fell like a rock, she kinda liked him.
And his heart beat like thunder, as they moved cross the floor,
When the music was over, she slipped out of his arms, and out the door.

Yeah a man loves a woman, but he can't understand,
Why she's sad when she stares, at the ring on her hand.
Or she sits in some club, where the long shadows fall.
Drops a coin in the jukebox, not the phone on the wall.

So close, yet so far away.
So close, yet so far away.
We believe in tomorrow, maybe more than today.
We're so close, so close, yet so far away.

That's what you need to solve all the mysteries.
Yea I know someone, who just heads for the sun,
She says ""I don't want to be wise, I just want to stay young"".

So close, yet so far away.
So close, yet so far away.
We believe in tomorrow, though we're stuck in today.
Baby we're so close, so close, yet so far away.

There's a restless look in your eye tonight.
There's a secret hurt in my heart.
And the dream that pulls us together girl,
Is a dream, that's gonna tear us, tear us apart.

There's a restless look in your eye tonight,
Oh, are you lookin' for some way out of here.
We gotta fight to keep it together girl,
For the dream, that keeps us,

So close, yet so far away.
So close, yet so far away.
Who would of thought girl that we'll end up this way.
Getting' so close, so close,

Afternoon in the homeroom, they're about to let you go
And the locker slams on the plans you had tonight
You've been messing around with your boyfriend, maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know who could put you right

In the lot, the boy that's idling by doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots he shares with you
And the long halls and the gray walls are gonna split apart
Believe it or not there's life after high school
And that's why

The student body's got a bad reputation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
You go back to school, it's a bad situation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What you want is an adult

Oh yeah

The teacher don't know about how to deal with the student body
And the underclassmen are flashing hot and cool

You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number
Memories that you won't remember

So you got a little education
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it will rub off on you

The boys are busy in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember

I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Sipping imaginary cola and drawing faces in the tabletop dust
His voice was rusty from years as a sergeant on ""this man's army""
They were old and crusty

She was twenty when the diner was a baby
He was the dishwasher, busy in the back, his hands covered with
Gravy
Hair black and wavy
Brilliantine slick, a pot - cleaning dandy
He was young and randy

Day to day, to day today
Then they were old, their lives wasted away
Month to month, year to year
They all run together
Time measured by the peeling of paint on the luncheonette wall

They sat together in the empty diner
Filled with cracked china
Old news was blowing across the filthy floor
And the sign on the door read ""this way out"", that's all it read
That's all it said

'Cause he can't get to sleep at all
And his favorite book, by the T.V. Light
Can't stop this matinee, he's played it over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

All those hard earned words, that he's fought from his pen
Have been forgotten in some empty hall
And those wide eyed looks, on those wiped out faces
Make some dreams of their places over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

Wouldn't believe in years
If he told you what the papers use to say
But that was in his hey day

Get back in his prime he had the fans in line
You should have seen him then
Now look at him

His hair is getting thin
There's one last show before the glory ends
There in the wings, waits his only friend
The record that he's prayed to over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

Now, he can't stop the music, oh no

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"If you had a dream did it happen
If you stop and think for a little while
Try to make up faces that once were real
Even though it seemed like a lifetime
Wasn't really more than a short ride
But it left me memories
That time can't steal

[Chorus:]
Oh my...marigold sky
Gold leaf reflections on the ocean
Yeah I was lost in the light
Like sand in a shell
She holds me

We were tryin' to be so enlightened
Movin' on from father, son and holy ghost
Trippin' on the passion, hooked on love
Was I ever yours were you ever mine
Did we ever loose
What we tried to find
Wasn't all that passion a dream enough

[Chorus:]

I realize, realize
When a love is lost! It's all so real
Broken heart needs oh so long to heal (oh no)
Though the magic happened some time ago
I know it's alive
It'll never grow cold

Needed your fun
That's over, water under the bridge

Why didn't you just throw away my number
When we were through

Do you need someone to talk to, like a long lost friend
Sympathy just ain't in my emotion

And when we read the book of time

War of words, no one survives
These words of war cut deep inside
War of words the truth, the lies
These words of war hurt more and more... More and more

Our passion's washed away and so the tide rolls in again
With the morning storm brings another cloudy day
Lt's getting harder day by day

And the rules and the rights and the wrongs don't apply
Far apart, so together is destiny weeded to fate

Now, I write the script, you direct my dreams
We're along on the beach for the passionate scene
And it's a drag to wake up with you, saying to me

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

I'm bored and alone and it's weakening me
One night out and I'm looking for trouble and finding it's easy
You know we all make mistakes and we all need the touch of a hand
In the right kind of place, in a time of need

I could pick up the phone, but the talk ain't cheap
I pick up on the thoughts that you're sending to me
And I wait for the day I hear you saying to me

I say baby, how does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

You and I have separate lives girl
You and I go different ways on roads that cross
When love and loss is ruled by fate
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay

Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you

I'll try to find a way to encourage you
It's easy to convince myself
Cause I can't believe you'd wanna be with somebody else
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay

Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"You know there's something you need
Right here and now
To fill the space inside of yourself
Money love or power
When you want to have the number one first run anyone
You're crazy 'til you own them

You ought to know better than that
The more that you buy the less you get back
It's a case of possession obsession
Gimme Gimme

The compulsion to count the percentage of time
Spent between two lovers
Can turn an hour into a crime
And all the good times suffer
Though you know it's only jealousy
You can't help but be
Haunted by your passion

Don't you know it's a matter of fact
The more that you take the less you give back
Just a taste of possession obsession
Brings a case of possession obsession

Everybody's trying to tell me what's right for me

Better learn how to face it
She's gone oh I, oh I'd

I'm worn as her tooth brush hanging in the stand
My face ain't looking any younger
Now I can see love's taken her toll on me

Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away

Someday we'll know

I watched my past crash in the sea
If I could ask you just one question
Why aren't you here with me?

Daryl Hall & John Oates,"People strain a lot
Stretch their brains a lot
To play their way to immortality
Some of them are very smart
And trying awfully hard
To make their mark and last eternally
Seems there ain't no people
Dumb enough to see

The sky is full of hawks
Who say that money talks
And only the rich are really free
They tell you that the fact of life
Is that you have to fight
For every cold hard coin that you can see
Well, there ain't no money
Soft enough for me

Now there is a mountain
It's big and it's wide
And nobody knows
What's on the other side
Oh, some people are curious
And some are afraid
But they're goin' over that mountain
Any old way

Over the mountain
Over the mountain
Over the mountain

And sometimes it shines

And ugly as sin

But you can't get in

Who did as he pleased

The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new, I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
She's sitting with you but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see
What you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she cat tamed by the purr of a jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love you ain't gonna get too far

Oh here she comes

I know what she can do
She's deadly man, and she could really rip your world apart

Wondering what I could make of my life, who'd be waiting,
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,
Crying at the top of my voice, no one listening,
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
You must believe me,
I can feel your eyes go through me,
But I don't know why.

I know you're going, but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,
All this time, I still remember everything you said,
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else.

I was singing a new song I wrote on the way into town

I knew right away she liked the words to my song
'Cause she stared at my big guitar, followed my fingers too long
And she had the likeness of a girl, I'd seen in a dream
But lights can do wonders with makeup and faded blue jeans

And the last thing, I needed was somebody messing up my mind
So I found a hundred reasons for turning around one more time
She could cause me to sing bad and fall out of love with guitar
And blow all my chances at being a big singing star

With one passing glance I could tell she was young for her age
'Cause she got to looking better as she got down closer to the stage
And as she sipped on her wine I could tell just the kind she would be
And somehow, I knew she was here to do bad things to me

And the last thing, I needed was somebody messing up my mind
So I found a hundred reasons for turning around one more time
She could cause me to sing bad and fall out of love with guitar
And blow all my chances at being a big singing star

Aiyo peep it, can you keep it down while I rock

She was high host, to the most hostess, no boastin
Back in '85, she was live, yo no jokin
A real go-getter, didn't try and sweat her
Fifteen years old and she was pushin a jetter

Oh yeah, where was I? Bustin, now I'm ready
Now it's '87 and Miss Thing is goin steady
She was schoolin, chillin 'cause her man was makin papers
Tellin all her friends that these niggas caught the vapors
He found her, phoned her, then yo we boned her
Soon came a smack then he act like he owned her
He used her, 'bused her, fractured her wrist
then the Tommy got slapped behind her back gettin dissed

Now she's in a jam 'cause, Stan was slangin rocks, but
look at me now, honey, 'cause this the morning after

Ah the show was phat, now it's back to the room, G
Yo mirror, this is where Loretta tried to do me
My neck was on her tongue, *?Ep's?* was gettin swung
Krayz was gettin biz with the friend that she brung
Then she took it upon herself to let me know she's in the mood-a
Then she licked her boot-a, oh shoot-a, I screwed her
I showed her, I rolled her, from here to North Dakota
I gangbanged the boots like a Brooklyn troop oughta

I went and break a slut like Donald Trump can break a million
Or zillion, I kills 'em, I watches All My Children
I'm hard as women, watch it silly stunt, just ask the pilgrims
I was strong from the get go, I'm not Lou Ferringo
I never caught the cooties from a fluzy or a bimbo
Like Cheeko, I'm the man, yes indeed, i got the smart, so
When I take a stand, just take a seat like Rosa Arts

I gave a crewcut to Sinead O'Conner
Your honor, I'm bad to the bone, word is born
'Cause me and Mrs. jones, we got a thing going on
Yes I am, my ?(gibitibibity)? bedroom will not end
To the diggity cows come home, take the Gitney again

I couldn't, damn, all of a sudden I had to shit

Slipped past my dick, drip drip like a faucet

Shippity bop, well hot diggity, where's the iggity? The bum siggity
Niggas want to know but check the flow my little trickity
I'm comin' with the Books so kid, it looks like it's a winner
Ya better get ya plate because I'm servin' raps for dinner
See I freak it from the sewer plus I'm quick to do ya posse
I'm swoopin' on the note just like I was a kamikaze
See they thought I lost my spot so they went and got real comfy
So now I gotta hit me hard and Bogart like Humphrey
Ya hypocrite, I'm rippin' it because I'm flyer
Ya phony, full of bologna like Oscar Meyer
See I attack a pack of rappers just for practice
I bust my tactics, I'm sharper than a fucking axis

(Set it off!) One two (Set it off!)
Yeah it's the Books in reverse, the next cap sendin' a big-up to my borough
I'm thorough, wetter than a ghetto from Medini-Bop
Takin' lessons, swayin' niggas on graffiti
Rockin' other slang ranger, bring a banger occasion
My nerves is achin', see I'm sick of niggas perpetratin'
But can't see this, I'm screamin' on they records like Beavis
Or Butthead, I bust heads like Amy
Fisher isser, blisser, hit you like an accident
And if I'm in your town you might meet me at the Radisson
Or splatterin', batterin' crews for lip chatterin'
It ain't nuttin' new, that's how we do, my crew is back again

[Chorus: x3]
Bak 'n' affek, how's that?
(People people people people)

Well here I go again, so dig the flow again, try not to bite
A bigger nigga with my left and then I flick em with my right
I'm outta sight, look how I do it, ya blew it if you missed a
Nigga on the microphone 'cause I can roll a sister
Word is bond, I'm on some nuke shit, new shit like this
Grab a piece of steel and shoot the Giff like Chris
Kringle, lost my jingle, don't it make ya shiver
Give a nigga what he needs so he can bleed when I deliver
Aah microphone check, what the heck?
I do that then because I used to catch a wreck
Wit it, that's the time I hot talk, spit it
For Christ's sake I'm in to hit the brakes and you're skiddin'
You nigga in, messiah did it, but y'all can keep that
'Cause now I'm on some other type of flow and best believe that

And all that, small cat, my format, deranged
Honey I'm back to run things 'cause some things is never changed, punk!
So if you're drunk, I freak the funk until you're sober
But still be gettin' chills when niggas know that winter's over
Kickin' the flam yo it's the man, tick tock, I jam like gridlock
My style is fender bendin' sendin' rappers to the pit stop
Good lord o' mercy, hit reverse if you missed it
And busboy give the speech 'cause like a preacher, baby I'm twisted
Kid I swing a dome-buster light, bone crush a smith
Bust up your lips then puff up a spliff
So yo, who be dat? Dat want to do me like this to get
booby trapped jack, 'cause my crew be strapped fat like dat

Chillin' stupid, 'cause there ain't no dooper who got wrecker than
The Boogie Banger, it could be danger so back, tootz
'Cause we're guys but niggas want to revise they rap books
What up kid? I can sell you rugged with the hip-hoppin
Throw it, like to see me from my nuts until my dick top
What a bummer, it seem to be no MC can get dumber than
Me one other, two niggas from the
Sewer, my shit is new without the magnesia
'Cause G, I be's the man from here to Indonesia
Aah yeah, you heard me, see I'm just another dirty dick
Drastically, casually I puff the erb to get zone like the Senate, so

[Chorus: x8]

Here I come so nigga don't be hatchin' it, I'm snatchin' it, niggas o'dose
When I catch this
Niggas in the dark, I spark at them like I was matches
I set up quicker, kick a verse with no distortion
I suggest emcees proceed with some caution
I hip, tip, grippin' tit because there ain't no
Way I'm gonna lift when I erupt like a volcano
I'm acid, my crew is massive, you're soft like jello
I'm gettin' props, a habit like Abbott and Costello
When I flaunt this, niggas want this, they'll be usin'
A squeegee when I'm bitchin' 'cause bitch I'm comin' to get your ass

Comin' to get'cha it's the D-Bats so nigga think back to the way I bring this
Or brung that, I swung that, now look at the way I'm swingin' this
Just like my name was Joe DiMaggio
And hell Dray! My twelve gauge spit shells like pizaggio
We can get it on and my word is bond and fuck who you be G
Your crew is easy just like Sunday mornin' when I'm yawnin' so
It's no sense in you losin' what you got kid
'Cause G I be doin' the mic like Mr. T be doin' the chopsticks
Ya gets done like no matter where ya from, jack
For fun, I'm nailin' rappers like a thumb tack

But what am I do is get somebody new to do it for me
I'm catchin wreck to prove a point, time is loot
and I ain't spinnin it in the joint but better yet
These days I'm all professional, some new [shit] I got
I check this nigga that I used to snatch jewels wit
back in the day but nevertheless the kid's ass' slingin gas
to pay bills to 'ford some pills that kill stress (I hear ya kid)
Now as for me G let's just say I learnt the rules
I paid my dues and now I cruise in my Lexus
No better time than the present to make him an offer
He can't refuse but might regret it, so I'ma set it

There's niggas down my slack, yes I'm the baddest when I wreck it
See I'm nicer than the rest, I guess I gots ta prove it
Ya cruisin for a bruisin if ya bite it when I use it
See I'm quick to shoot the giff, and if ya tryin ta stop it
I got mad skills like loose change in my pocket
I drop it from the East, at least I'm gettin mine in
Some niggas gettin jealous 'cause of the way that I be rhymin

Ooh, hello there, how the hell are ya? Sorry to keep you waitin
It's like nuttin when I'm throwin somethin rougher than menstruation

I kick tails that tips scales on the ricter
I dip-dip-dob wit more drive than the Harlem River
Oh what the hell, I smoked a half a el then ????
Pick up my grip then spark the clip and get puffin see
It's back to basics if you're wacked then niggas hate we

Drop the type of [shit] that make ya flip and get'cha swivacle

My raps they never collapse 'cause on the tracks, see I be bustin like

I'm back from hibernation and I'm ween to keep a rep

Give it a rest fool, straight balls of fire, boy I'm flyer than a cockpit
Hah I rocks [shit] and knock niggas out the blocks wit
Uncontrollable lyrical motions from my larynx
I'm slick, watch your tip 'cause my clique might slam ya next
like BOOYAA, no ya not true, don't mean illusion
Kickin a styles til '96, taking backs to the future
Plus I'm cool to fuck the brain, I drain a 40 for the belly
I'm aimin for the charts just like this was a game of scelli
Plus I'm sinkin ships, doin whatever makes the blow rock

They oughta be usin my trims for sperm and makin' babies
Hey ladies, I know A-B's, I'm makin' CD's

Comprendo, so let your friends know I'm losin' my noodle

I'm the slippery slang slipper, quick tp rip a QB
Shooby dooby dooby, I do that new G
So you be cool & The Gang and I puts my slang in
Hangin' loosely, oh yes G, niggas be tryin' to test me

Hear ye, don't look any further G, see he here is
Still mic checkin' (shit) still Dead Serious
Hello there, I didn't go nowhere, what up with the static G?
I be damagin' niggas' fronts like them creases in your cavity
For real though, jumpin' jallopy's huh, I'm robbin' that hockey huh
I drop these bumpy 'cause my style is knock-kneed
So me and my-a, I's flyer then the witches sweeper
Deep, as keep ya's drunk, jump into it like Aretha

I got the backs 'n' bones but now I needs some action

Aiyo you can call me Plato because my style is in there
And I'll dig in that anus, man, as if my name was 'swimwear'
See I rock a hoodie sweater, more wood than Woody Pecker

I jab you with the left and swing a hook without the phonics

Okey dokey, hocus pocus, I make the dopest MC call a timeout
Cos yo I rip the shit out when it's time to throw my rhyme out
I'm twisted, my flow'll make you dizzy like Gillespie
If ya test me I rip and flip ya script and then I jet-sy

Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch

A dog couldn't catch me ass out

She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average

Lookin' for a prey that we could rob on Broadway
Stickin niggas for their jewels if they're worthy
Made a couple of hits and then we jetted back to Jersey
'86 and '87 was the year
Had the Gucci hat, rock the rac-coon fur coat yeah
Keep em in disguise and nigga don't ya blink
See yeah Saturday, we robbed another nigga at the rink
The beats was always showin' up at my rest
Askin' ""Does a certain Drayzie live at this address? Yes?""
The spot was hotter than the sun, without a doubt
I had the choice to go to school and get the fuck out!
I hit the South just like a bandit 'cause I was stranded
Virginia State in '88, you know that's where I landed
I couldn't stand it, shit was feelin' strange
I made it outta range but yo, my shit was just about the dough

Yo bust a move, peep the flav
'Cause I'ma take you back to the days of brown envelope trays
Twenty-something years ago as I proceed to recollect
A newborn shorty had to 'ford checks off Bushwick
Bless the days, Pops shot to get forth the vock and fifth
Damn, fam got to shift
From the tenth flo' down four flights to the sixth
This was around the time smokin' reefer was the shit
But now the crib a little bigger
I was the first man in the fam so it's plans for a nigga
Had my clan from my building and my man from 8-11
Wit me when we hit the jams behind 2-57
Mom's babysittin', Pop's on the hustle
54 block was on lock, bust a knuckle
Game rip, some niggas slipped and got greedy
Believe me, another ""rest in peace"" in graffitti
But I couldn't resist a few fights and petty heists
'Cause now I'm 'cross town in the Heights
My nights are a little quieter but still amongst the schemes for the fun
Where sons run guns and blow slums with the dums
And motherfuckers don't care
I love the street game so I stashed the green leaf by the air
You couldn't tell me shit, evil was more eager than a beaver
Kept it fresh, double-parked in the Caesar
But I got deceased with this behaviour-type flavor
And do Moms a favor, go to school and get this fuckin' paper
So what's the caper 'cause now I'm all in
At Virginia State, now let the bullshit begin

It was '89 and yo, I'm stayin' out of fights
I'm runnin' with this nigga named Books from Crown Heights
Gettin' toe-up from the flow-up, we're drinkin' til we throw up
We're thinkin' we can blow up so to class we wouldn't show up

Well nigga so what? You fucked the holdup and went whatevers
Then bucked the leathers, son I got to get my shit together
Gettin' drunk, gettin' flunked in class is what's the function
Smokin' blunts-in, son we need to stop frontin'

We're goin' huntin', Virginia didn't have shit for us
That's why we broke out with Dice and blitzed into blue chorus
Gettin' busy, flippin' rhymes on the weekend
The deal we was seekin' from styles we was freakin'

But yo, now it's '91 and me and son we got to scram

Puttin MC's through style change
And if you want me then you got to come get me
I'm strictly fuckin niggas up like 1-50-

Two gun shots but it's sheisty, they want to ice

and a burner and I keeps the 2 ready
to hit you in your chest like Steve Young do Jerry
Rice, be nice and stock slice by umbilical

And son is rugged, you're gonna love it in an instant
See I smoke blunts but yo my pops smokes Winstons

Well it's the D-A-S, I can't forget the E-a
F-a to the X so when I flex why'know I bein

I couldn't care less for them, I'm too fresh for them
I just be wreckin shop and gettin busy, nigga check it
Never actin broke 'cause yo I sold a fuckin record
I'm too slick for dat, suck my big dick for that

When you make the sign of the cross, X marks the spot

Thicker than your blunt cos yo I be's the Brooklyn trooper

Bust the lingo Ringo stiggity Starr bingo

I'm starstruck like starbuck, the bad bro is mad though
I'm all that small cat like Tomko or Hasbo
I have no figgity fear yeah, it's me and mines
Masters of the microphone, makers of the super rhymes

Yo, well yo the shit sound clever, 
I'm down for whatever like nuttin nice
Big-up to DJ Dice wreckin shop when he cut 'n' slice
These 20 MC's, please! I never heard of some
We need to murder some like Colin Ferguson
But now ya heard us from the under so feel the thunder
Ya best ta come clean like J-Rule and Felix Unger
I'm buggin like gristle, see I suggest you
dismiss you, my style's official and that's the issue
I show the flow I go until it's time to leave
Believe I'm packin more rhymes up my sleeve

Verse 1: Dray, Books

Yo yo
Well biggity back from the gutter, ya beat the butter flow comin at'cha
Check the rapture that I miggity manufacture
Body snatcher, here to throw the pitch again
Gotta switch again because we back up in this bitch again (No doubt)
We roll like Michelin, the rapper's know the pedigree
Flowin steadily, yo Boogie Banger rizzy ready G?

I'm miggity made of snakes-n-snails and rock Wally tails
jiggity joined by the balls in case all else fails
Higgity hails from the land of gunsling and I tell ya one thing
diggity Das EFX we run things, hunting
down hardcore clowns and love singers
and I got more styles than Brooklyn got drug slingers (word up!)
Police oppress me, MC's want to stiggity stress me
Tickity talkin more trash than a Hefty
Heaven-to-Betsy when Dray spark the sess, we left
you faggot MC's marked for death

Chorus

Verse 2: Dray, Books

I line up rappers then I drop em like they're dominos (No diggedy!)
And naybody from their poppa to their momma knows (No diggedy!)
We got the flows to get ya hyper, plug up the mic-uh
phiggity-phone and then it's on because I'm just the type-uh
And ain't no diggedy, I flow until infinity, you must be kiddin me
ain't niggity nuttin gettin rid of me
Big up to PMD, forever gettin blunted
Flooded in the triple black Benz 500

I riggity rap like Saram from here to Pakistan
Me and my man came to kick styles out the can
Fridge you with the flow, yo it's the big chill
Ship all pounds plus stack my grants in a hill
So you better set the *?backra?* or ya head'll splat
I smiggity smoked the pot that called the kettle black
Provoke and get your jiggity jaw broke
be	-K-L-why-N we no joke!

Chorus

Verse 3: Dray, Books

Well yo the 1 is for them suckers, the 2 is for my shortys
the 3 is for my knuckers puffin els and crackin 40's
Diggy Das EFX you know the text we never slackin
We back and fliggity flex a nigga, check the rappin

Niggas be actin shady!!!!
so I got eyes behind my back and I biggity black the 80
Yo we crazy as they come smokin blunts by the carton

Fat like thanksgiving, drop some shit like a pigeon

Yo, the boogie banger, biggedy-black rover to ranger
Danger, I'm iggidy-off the planet like kramer
My iggidy-anger, slaughter, iggidy-out of order
Split your monkey ass in half like moses split the wiggidy-water

[Chorus: x2]
You intrigued by the way, we do our thing
Do what?
Pick up the mic, hot, and make you swing
Say what?
Pick up the mic, hot, and make it swing

Anything the squadron wants, bill it
Epmd out the box we be rocking
We hold the title, like priests hold the bible

God bless, to any MC who wanna test
Survival of the fittest, fuck it life or death
With ill maneuvers, rapper slash producer
Putting it down with e-dub, in the sewer

[Books]
Some riggidy-real thugs, sex hip-hop and drugs
Liggidy-left burnt rugs, drinking beers out of gold mugs
Slugs in the barrel, on name brand apparel
Briggidy-bringing drama like John Travolta in arrow

[Drayz]
But niggidy-no need for that, smith squeeze the gat
Ease em back, or niggas gon' biggidy-bleed, in fact
It's wiggidy wild shine like the head, of golden child
Corrupt styles, sinister smile, we taking bails to trial

Here we go
[ Chubb Rock ]
I arrive from the steps of Sinai cause I'm fly
When you're high from the lye
You see me mingle in the sky
The dim light superceeds the street cock fight
Straight heterosex, but I still dig Van, ya dyke
From the mic flip, metronome time skip, who will high-ship
The Brooklyn base scholar and them niggas past Islip
And ooh-ooh, I curse you with that Fugee-la voodoo
Will do you like Italian deli kids slicing prosciutto
I barb you like Bobbito, the airport, right through Heathrow
Release murder niggas like Ito
Pure hatred, cause he picked who he picked to mate with
Then laced it, bourgeois player two-faced it
Hey revamp the swing to parlay
How black power went sour, where's Brother Jay?
Where's the 'pink Cadillacs protected by' whoever?
The red and the black, green, Hilfiger nigga
Indians want to protect the Lone Howling Chief
So kids create beef

Beef
Back in the days when we had nothin but beef
At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids
When they have beef, you might die
Why?

[ Skoob ]
While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that
I'm with my soldiers in the Rover, never sober, fuck that
Yo dun, I run with wild Crooklyn niggas with gats
Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack
My niggas click back, kid, that's why we hold somethin
And break your punk ass down just like you stole somethin
When I rock with Chubb you block show me love
Nigga what, want beef, we drawin first blood

[ Krazy Drazy ]
Well, it's the riggedy-rhyme dropper, the hip-hopper, you know the name
I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefin in the game)
You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet
Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit
The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight
We wiggedy-wildin out, provin all these white folks right
We like some crabs in a barrel tryin to get on top
The Hit Squad, Chubb Rock represent hip-hop
So kill the beef

Beef
Back in the days when we had nothin but beef
At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids
When they have beef, you might die
Why?

[ PMD ]
Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988
I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state
Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminatin flows
Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes
Jealous niggas, gun triggers, fuckin up the game
But me you can't tame, an outlaw like Jesse James
We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest
Who's the best? But let it rest, because there's no contest
Temptation, accusations need to stop
Unify hip-hop, PMD, Chubb Rock

[ Chubb Rock ]
Now - I will come back to the groove
Now my man Common on wax slayin Ice Cube - anyway, that's cool
That nigga somewhere 'higher learnin'
And of course there's that famous beef between Parrish and Sermon
And that's cool, both those niggas killed Jane
And now there's Nice without Smooth - that's insane
And I heard they squashed that, and that shit should cease
Cause black mutha-uckas shouldn't beef

Beef
Beef
Back in the daa-ays
Beef
Beef
Back in this day there's beef
Beef
Back in the day there was beef

That shit got to cease

Remember you was schoolin me when you was only a seed 
Now it's time to school you 'cause see I'm a nigga that's true 
If we ain't see it in the streets, my crew, we heard it from you 
A few couldn't understand 'cause you was raised in the street 
To each his own, whiggity where you laid your hat was your home 
None see the shining sea, you been the star on TV 
See I only knew you by face til I met my nigga P 
Piggity put me on to you, tiggity told me to shine 
So when you had the time, iggity I had the rhyme 
Started runnin with them kids and keepin up with them trends 
I never took it as a diss 'cause me and you was just friends 
But now your man's got you on some other garbage 
C. Deloris Tucker got you thinkin murder charges 
Plus them same cats flipped on you, dissin you 
'cause you're sample says ""You ain't original"", I wanted to get rid of 
you 
But who would figure you would try to play both sides? 
You honey rides, you look at your reflection through my eyes, no lies

And naw man 
Now some people are tryin to ban you but they don't understand you 
Like me and my man do, when all the drama that you ran through 
(So thank you) for the Benz, thank you for the rims and Timbs 
Thank you for the friends, thank you for the ends that I spend 
Thank you for the weed and all the times you took me overseas 
and thank you for the dreams and all the fans that I please 
Thanks from all hardcore, thanks for lettin' me be a member 
and thanks for lettin' me rock your party, shorty just remember 
I'll be tender when you're weared, for you's a diamond in the rough

Verse 1: Dray, Skoob

I heard that one man's loss, is the next man's gain
I came to drop the shit like rain and bring the pain to your brain
We leave a stain, ain't prayin (why?), 'cause the game's for kids
It's diggity Das, no doubt, back to shatter your wigs
These pegs be all on my back, cats be actin too brave
I think they better just relax, before we dig em a grave
You blow the spot, baby face it, kids can't erase it
or trace it, ya get'cha face lit, Books come lace it, what?

Bringin it straight from the lands of the crooks where heat, Books to heat
em
Keepin em raw from these Brooklyn streets, where Books defeats em
Flippin these lines like a polygraph, y'all niggas lolly dat
Freakin a style from Brooklyn, the home of the bodybags
And kids with no fear, bitches with no hair
Low gear Benz's wit chrome wears, what we all here
So don't stare, we there to interfere with the heads of ?????
What you didn't know, this miggity might hurt

Chorus: 

It's diggy Das, raw breed
Make moves at top speed
It's the niggas from the sewer
Drink brew and puff weed
Giggity get wit it
Sewer rats stay twisted
Many people tell me this style is terrific
It's diggy Das, raw breed
Make moves at top speed
It's the niggas from the sewer
Drink brew and puff weed
Giggity get wit it
Sewer rats stay twisted
Aiyo, many people tell me this style is terrific

Verse 2: Dray, Skoob

Yo
Well yo, in Glocks we trust, and at the cops we bust
We just be hustlin for cash and makin lashes of muss
They went from AZ to Jay-Z, Nas back to Krayzie
To Drayzie, I fuck up your knot and then I'm swayze

Word, yeah, yo, yo
Well yo, figgity fuck a fear, want to bust like a flare
gun, beware, son, my sons keep guns in the air
None of y'all bitches can sue me, all my niggas twenty one gun salute me
Pick up the vine and rock the Kufi

Well, all I heard was Versucci, coochie for the lucci
The Gucci, but I just stay raw just like some sushi
My crew be ill, time to move these mill's
And all the drunken mawfuckers best to show they skills

Yeah, yo, yo
Well yo, the shit I talk, it be the shit I walk
Some faggots try to get wild, they bit my style but got caught
Like me and my man caught, slippin up at the crimescene
Fuckin lime green, you fuckin wart, this is my team

Das EFX,"Verse One: Dray, Skoob

Yo (yo), yo (yo), yo (yo)
Piggity-presto, who these cats on your stereo? (Das EFX)
My records spin round and round like a merry-go
Here we go, riggity-raw as I ever was
Diggy Das blow the spot, sharp as ever, 'cause
Same pro (what?), never rock with the same flow
My chain glow like lines up in the rainbow
Aiyo, Boogie Bang what the deal, son? (Yo)
For real, son, break it down, how you feel, dun?

Yo, when my record company fail, I'm gonna need bail (why?)
Flippin on coats like Latrell Sprewell
My cat's gone broke off blowin weed sales
Can't see mine, dickhead, you're gonna need braille
Like females, cats is fake, I snap and break
your biggity-back and neck and crack the safe
Snatch the cake, get in the truck, divi' it up
Not givin the one just give me ya cup
We're livin it up, my crew get buck in berry singers
Shows get wild like Jerry Springer, ice on all fingers
Frost bear, me and my girls fare
New York share politican, so

Hook:

So yo set it off, get it off, let it off
Set it off, get it off, let it off
Set it off, get it off, let it off
(Like that) I want to break fool, cock me back, c'mon
Set it off, get it off, let it off
Set it off, get it off, let it off
Set it off, get it off, let it off
(Like that) I want to break fool, cock me back

Verse Two: Dray, Skoob

'cause I'm too nice, rockin blue ice
Jet black Ferrari runnin through lights
My crew tight, riggity-roll with the ruggedness
Enough of this, yo it's time to put a thug in this
Look at this, straight Gz, you can tell it's dope
In your face, kid, you don't need a telescope
Smellin smoke, break the mic, make sure it's broke
????, you can quote every word I wrote
My antidote, stiggity-straight from the subway
The thug way, miggity-Monday to Sunday

Lyrical dumb-dums, watch the stray shots
stay hot like them chicks from Baywatch
BK, to the UK, all the way to Guatalupe
Das got chicks shakin their booty
Cats actin unrul-ey, who they?
Do they, should they, give a fuck, nah too late
Save em, ya gotcha els, roll em up, kid
Blaze em, roll a whole dime but save some
Throw your hands up, raise em, hip-hop nation
Nuff respects to my EFX Generation

Hook

Verse Three: Dray, Skoob

Aiyo dun son, hit me, brought the whole gang wit me
Sixty, peace to low down shifty
Strictly, send the world in a frenzy
My mens be, laid up in the penzy
Correctly, when it's my turn to rhyme again
Devils stall, play the ball, went to Heineken
Find a friend, hit her off with the fly talk
The sly talk, riggity-right off the sidewalk
My talk, slidin with the sickedness
You're lickin this like a lollipop, sick of this

Miggity-makin moves on a regular, wack MC's I'm testin ya
Smack you with a chair like a wrestler
Boogie Bang, sewer rat buckwildin
Run the streets of Brooklyn, properties on an island
A pen and a pad, you know my steez when I'm weeded
Bring rhymes together like cleavage
So love it or leave it, I got to eat, kid, plus got mouths to feed
hip-hop crowds to please, bullshit trials to plea
Trees are blastin out my team, blast back
Matter fact, my game is tight and that's that

Set up my office now e'rybody flossin
If niggas is hot, I'm ultraviolet

Cash flowin, over throwin, motor rollin
Play the low and keepin niggas not knowin, yo

We got a fool-proof hustle, lotta muscle
So miggity-make sure to put the money in the duffle

Das EFX,"[Chorus]
Somebody told me that this rap shit was fun 
You get to smoke weed and hold big guns 
Stand on stage rockin' your Timbs wit your sons 
That's bullshit  yo I'm out to get these funds 

Yo, yo somebody told me that threw a hotter joint dies 
Could he see it? EPMD Aguilar recognize 
Niggas was stuck on Diggy before Biggie and Nas 
Test guy reported in The Source, even thought about ""Best Buys"" 
My twelve-bar Count Dracula wit lyrics spectacular 
Sippin' out of Coke and he's drinkin' terror daiquiris and chrome 
backwards 
Challenge any woman, balls nothing, rock the hardest 
Racoons rap with your soloists if artist 
Puttin' it down on the day nine thousand, that's a cell with stories to tell 
Off those cells we're livin' well 
In the nine-eight-off, country club plink off 
While you're way off, check all systems, it's time we take off 

[Chorus: x2]

Guns with banana clips, two Rolexes to master whips 
A point four-five under my armpit 
Another one in the glove compartment 
Money startin' shit, brand new shoes on spank shit 
Tek nines, after parties with mad dimes 
Bitches twist the vine, I'm high and the moon's mine 
We're out to get mines, on a regular 
On the south, probably took the dreaded predator's pirate treasure 
In the crib I bought the leather, plus a movie screen 
So my team can play Sega plus the gods in Vegas 
An ounce of weed in every type of flavor 
Bank accounts wit fat paper, a major player 'cause

[Chorus] 

Higgity-hardcore, sewer rats keep it raw 
Beach houses and more, puffin weed on Seymour 
Pliggity-plush carpets cover floors, on bus tours 
Chrome point forty-fours, diggity-diamonds on paws 
All my slick cats above the laws, higgity-hide records in stores 
Hit squad, second world tour 
Kiggity-cameras compass on doors, signin' autographs 
After, where? In corridors 
Figgity-fuck walls, I'm buildin', splittin' Dutches spillin'
Chillin' until these pilgrims start ice grillin' 
Figgity-frontin' hard like a villain, Das EFX'll make a killin' 
And grab the cheese up like Sicilians cos

Das Ich,"Überall ist Bitterkeit
Farbenfroh ein Schicksalsschlag

Aus denen das Verlangen schreit

Tausend haben Paradiese
Ich hab über tausend Ohren
Trauernd Opfer treten süchtig
Über unsren Massenwahn

Verblasste Traumlawinen
Märchen haben Winterzeit
Stunden die uns Überholen
Meine Schläfe bricht entzwei

Geistig Narbenlabyrinthe
Ärzte züchten Wunderblumen
Rot bemahlte Augenhöhlen

Das Ich,"Ein Herr in Falten fühlt den Erdball rauchend unter sich drehn
Greift sich Fleisch aus Mütterleins Schoß spiegelt sich I'm Erdversteck

In seiner Hand lagen heilig Versprechen die er mit Lügen brach
Durch Leid getrieben auf Bergen krichend stürtzt an kalter Felsenwand
Frei I'm Fall lauscht er den Chören die der Wind endlos wiederholt
Sei dir gewiss dein Schicksal ist fremd Brüderlein Mensch will deinen Thron

Er folgt dem leisen Pfad zu den Sternen schwärzlichste Torheit I'm Sinn

Ich suche den Weisen um ihm zu zeigen unten die Erde sie glüht
Der Mond hoch erstaunt stößt ihn kalt lachend zur brennenden Erde

Aus dem Fenster stiert ein Schodel
Der den weisen Stumm erzohlt

Won tiefster Seele steigen klagen
Weil die Herrschaft uns verdreht
An kahlen Felsen stremen softe
die von Tieren ausgepresst

Fleischkollonnen stehen Schlange
Vor den Toren vieler Ahnen
Aus den Moulern kreischen stimmen
Die mit Hab sind aufgefullt

Von Seuchenadern tropfen Gifte
Tronke unsre neue Bibel

Und heute bin ich vogelfrei

Von Lumpen aufgewischt
Es rostig schmeckt
Mütter stürzen suchend
Gräber ihre Kinder
Gesichter verstümmelt
von Krähen hinterlassen


Krieg werden nie
Gewalt vernichten
Und Ehrlichkeit von Kot und Stroh
Wie faulend gelbe Maden
Es stirbt ein Kind
unter Marmorsäulen
Auf diesem Boden sollen
hellerleuchtet neue Städte stehn

Kein guter Wille hilft uns mehr
Uns retten nur noch Wunder

Das Ich,"Es macht mich wahnsinnig, daß alles bunt ist
daß alle lachen können über Nichtigkeit
Es macht mich irrsinnig, daß ich ein Nichts bin
daß ich ein Molekühl I'm großen Universum bin
Es macht mich wütend, daß es so schwer ist
daß die Gerechtigkeit an mich nicht denkt
Es macht mich traurig, daß ich allein bin
daß ich nicht finden kann die Gottheit die mir beisteht

Es macht mich schuldig, daß ich bereit bin 
daß ich mit Tod und Teufel alle in die Hölle wünsch
Es macht mich eiskalt, daß wir so mächtig sind
daß uns Gevatter holt, wenn unsre Zeit verrinnt
Es macht mich böse, daß er allmächtig ist 
daß er für mich nicht Leben sondern Tod bestimmt
Es macht mich gierig, daß es so leicht ist
daß ich Gottes gleich das Recht bestimm´

Laß mich doch frei sein
Laß mich in ruhe Gott
Laß mich ich selbst sein

Wann hat mich die Wirklichkeit und wann bin ich ein Kind
Wer ist meines Geistes gleich verbrannte Flügel neben mir
Wo sind all die Bestgelehrten? Geht nicht Leid und Elend um
Was ist wenn es morgens blitzt und abends fehlt das Licht
Wenn ich mich dreh ist alles Eins und nichts davon trägt eine Seele

Wie fühlt sich wahre Liebe an und wie der blanke Hass
Fühl das kalte grauen Zittern wenn das Herz I'm Rhythmus bricht

Das Ich,"Als wir damals Hand in Hand nicht schuldig waren
War die Zeit spiel und spiel nur undankbar
Wenn wir uns in reinem Zorn gestritten haben
Ist die Welt nicht unter uns zu staub zerfallen

Als wir Kinder groß ob klein ganz mutig waren
Ist die Zeit nur sonderbar im schlaf vergangen
Weil der Weg in unsren Augen neblig war
Ist die Welt zu groß fur uns im Geiste klar

I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu

Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires

What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it

This is how we do it
South Central does it like nobody does
This is how we do it
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
This is how we do it

Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and smile

Cold coolin at a bar, and I'm lookin for some action
But like Mike Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them want to get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin def, yo, what's up with L-o-see?
The girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar
Havin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" he said, ""Funky Cold Medina""

Funky Cold Medina

This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal

I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink,"" I said, ""Ehm - ok, I'll go get it""
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina

You know, ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies
Ya know?

Break it down

Back in the saddle, lookin for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on _The Love Connection_
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin
Instead she started talkin 'bout plans for our weddin
I said, ""Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein ya""
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina

Ya know what I'm sayin
That Medina's a monster, y'all
