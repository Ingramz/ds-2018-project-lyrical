Anticipatin'
Sun comes up
The skies won't sink my soul

I've dreamt of this
But is never comes
But it never comes
The risin'

The natures dry
Folk!
I've been dreamin'
Traced out but dreamin'

The sun comes up
The blisters burn my soul
I'm dreamin'
Of something now

Of something now
Of the risin'
The natures dry

Pavement,"Lies and betrayals
Fruit-covered nails
Electricity and lust
Won't break the door

I've got a heavy coat
It's filled with rocks and sand
And if I lose it
I'll be coming back today (I've got a message for you)
I'll be coming back today (I keep it in my hand)
You know I'm coming back one day (I've got a system for two)
And I'll be coming back today

Ex-magician
That still knows the tricks
Tricks are everything to me
Until it's free

I've got a trigger cut
And I can't pull it back
But if I learn how
I'll be coming back today (I've got a message for you)
You know I'm coming back today (I keep it in my hand)
You will look at me and say (I've got a system for two)
That you just wish I went away

Sha-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I learned the truth
The truth of the words
Truth I made for you because
It's just as good

And if I spit it out
Before I chew the ring
I'll rearrange it till it
Looks just like today (I've got a message for you)
And I'll be comin' back my way (I keep it in my hand)
Then you will look at me and say (I've got a system for two)

I saw your girlfriend and she was
Eating her fingers, just another meal

I'll be waitin' forever

Somebody painted over paint
Painted wood
And where he stood, no one stands
It's been said he's sitting now
In the churning land

Well, I've seen saints, but remember
That I forgot to flag 'em down
When they passed
And in the morning light

You hold that ashtray tight
You could put it out
But I can't put it out

My hands shook, down and out
I've got the blisters of the world
World new
I name the book after you

So look up and watch the camera lens
When the risers fade

Slow it down! Song is sacred!
And brother, you're a hunter
And you're right at home
And in the morning light

I'll hold my ashtray tight
I could take it down

Pavement,"On an icy island north
In the woods beside the church
We can bury crimson lockets filled with dirt
And when the April thaw
Brings us out again
We can bless the arrows
And the sun won't stall
And the land will never fall

On virgin fields we'll skate
Stand by children we'll create
Like the arctic wind we spin
A windmill's rose into the threshing soul
You can't thresh the snow
When the snow is sending
There's no divine grove
You can see the blankets go

Everything I did was right
Everything I said was wrong
Now I'm waiting for the night
To bring the dawn
Into the only room where the fire's warm
Where we keep our vices warm
And it's all that's left
All that's left is vices torn",Greenlander,1993

You were born to be a camera,

The singer, he had long hair
And the drummer he knew restrait.
And the bass man he had all the right moves
And the guitar player was no saint.

And on a hill there stands Sherman
Sherman and his mates.

And the gum smacks are the pulse

He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day)

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?

Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter

Food is served, and you're stone-cold munchin
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
Some frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin, so you're goin
Could care less about the five you're blowin
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
Come sit next to me you fine fellow.""

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him to listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on.
Strumming my pain with his fingers,

Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song,
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song

He sang  as if  he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there.
But he just came to singing, singing clear and strong.

Peabo Bryson,"Looking out my window
I see you playing in the leaves
It's amazing how a little girl
Means all the world to me
When I tell you that I love you
I love you more than words can say

Smile, say cheese, say pretty please
I wanna take your picture
How'd you ever get so big?
I've gotta take your picture
Hold on to the memory
Before the whole thing slips away

I wish I could save these moments
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop the world from turning
Keep things just the way they are

I wish I could shelter you from everything
Not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't, I know I can't
But I wish I could

When you kiss me for no reason
It goes straight to my heart
When I feel your arms around me
I almost fall apart
It's time for bed and you whisper
""Daddy, we forgot to pray, whoa""

I wish I could save these moments
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop the world from turning
Keep things just the way they are

I wish I could shelter you from everything
Not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't, I know I can't
But I wish I could, oh

And when I watch you sleeping
All my worries fade away
A little bit of heaven
Glows on your angelic face

I wish I could save these moments
And put 'em in a jar
I wish I could stop the world from turning
Keep things just the way they are

I wish I could shelter you from everything
Not pure and sweet and good
I know I can't, I know I can't, I know I can't
But I wish I could, ooh, I  wish I could

Peabo Bryson,"I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine

Peabo Bryson,"She'll read your mind 
She's smart as a whip 
She'll suck you dry

At the point of ecstasy 
I write a symphony 
Of poetry in motion 
And leavin' me there to die 

I tell myself 
Let no one take her place 
To confide in someone 
And look at how much I paid 

I want you next to me 
Call it telepathy 
We drifted into vision 
And look at how much we see

Ah... 
I just want to get closer than close to you 
To the moment you discover 

What the best of my love can do 
And lovers fall for lover's friends 
We make each other cry 
Living in each others lives 

And tryin' to make the fantasy come true 
But I just want to get closer than close to you, baby 
I just want to get closer than close, to you 
Your soul is naked 

It tells you what you want 
I read your letter 
And look at how close I've come 
There's more for us to see 

In this philosophy 
We both end up in heaven 
And look at how close we'd be 
Ah... 
Ah... 

I just want to get closer than close to you 
I know that one way or the other 
Any test of my faith will do 
I give my heart for you to break 

I give my final breath

What we can turn eternity into

And we talk like strangers do, saying nothing at all

Would ever be the one to go, no
She got herself free and now she's over me

Was nothing more than ancient history

Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you can’t do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Dre told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like
Why a nigga can’t live? Get this money, fuck these bitches though
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me

All I ever asked is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever asked is 100

Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me, while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg 'cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

And now he's coming quick now you can just close your eyes
And live your live and just run and hide
While you deny under a pile of lies, but it won't
Coincide with the fact that he'll just crack the skies
And catch most guys off guard and just by surprise
So who if not you made the sun and the moon and
How many knew just when he came from the tomb that
What he would do is just rise just for you, then how

You don't know, man your just one puff and then
You'll come and go, sending prayers to the wrong
Number with the wrong area code, ehhh ehhh . . .

On God and try to call him collect, don't work that way

Came and gone, shouting for his attention

Hey brother, there's a better way out
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope man you're copping out
Take my advice, it's either live or die
You've got to be strong, if you want to survive

Would catch hell without a ghetto around

Don't understand
You must be frightened
Or just stupid

You want everything?
Well, you must be joking

So much to answer for
Black and white
Corrosion of all

You want everything?
Well, you must be joking

Corrosion burning it down
Kerosene burning it down

Love me through the bad years
Love me 'til it's spring again
Love me through my hopes and my tears
Love me 'til we have no fears

Take me there, in your mind's eye, out of time
Love me again, before we pass out of time
",Dougal,1993
Peach,"You came out to nowhere with red roses pressed against your white chest
You sat down beside me and you took me to a time when you could see
A time when you could feel, when you could speak
When I believed

You have seen some nameless and some faceless
And some hopeless cases
You have touched the heart of darkness
Mister Kurtz is dead and so are you

Where is your truth?
Do you believe all that you see?
And where'd you lay your grave?
And what did Jesus say?

You have opened my eyes to the nature
Of our time and our lives
No safe truths, no comforting illusions
Make the best of your life

It took a while to come to my senses
When I heard the news, I couldn't believe it was true
As long as stars are blue, I will still love you

I could wait for several life-times
I'll meet you when the sun is in my eyes
And we'll spend our years, floating with the tide

Peach,"My mind, out of my mind, in my mind's eye
You've got mirrors in front of your eyes
You can't see truth for self-obsession
Compromise, why don't you live your life

Are you so scared you'll be forgotten
As you stare into the sun?
Are you scared, you'll be forgotten
As you stare into the water?

In time you will arrive with a clear mind
You'll be sure, you're not afraid of a freefall
Words can't say all the things that you feel
No faith that they'll outlive you anyway

Down and out but no one's writing a book
Altruistic or just trying to shine bright
Are you scared you'll be forgotten
As you stare into the sun, as you stare into the water?

Let me down gently, let me down today
Or trick me on for once and always, always

So just tell me what you want from me

Lock you up put a strike by your name you on paper 
See the white boy be on every money and your paper

In the mandatory joes, now you ain't gon bounce

Was it tinted when you pulled this six 
Over to the side of the road 
Got my hand on my heater cause I'm tired of you hoes 
Let the dog sniff my vehicle and my clothes

Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'

I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing

Wild thing

Wild thing

Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""

So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Wild thing
She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please

Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype
And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine

Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Wild thing
She want to do the wild thing
Please baby baby please

Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance

So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said ""Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing""

Say what
Yo love you must be kidding
You're walkin' babe
Just break out of here
Hasta la vista baby

Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'

I winked my eye she got into the ride went to a club was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said You're a liar
I said I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire
Took her to the hotel she said You're the king

I said Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing
Wild thing 
Wild thing 
Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy

I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said You have plans for the night
I said Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to an other

I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing
Wild thing

She loved to do the wild thing
Wild thing
Please baby baby please
Posse in effect hangin' out is always hype

And when me and the crew leave the shindig I want a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss go gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside

I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jack she was like static cling
But that's what happens when body start slappin' from doin' the wild thing
Wild thing

She want to do the wild thing
Please baby baby please
Wild thing
Doin' a little show at the local discotheque

This fine youg chick was on my jack so I say what the heck
She want to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way

And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said Tone let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler I get paid to do the wild thing
Say what

Yo love you must be kidding

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1994

Peaches & Herb,"Wear a smile, they say
But it faded when you went away
I tell myself, I got to be strong
Hold my head up high, can't push it all

But Monday through Sunday
I cannot have just one day
That I don't think of you
And I don't call myself bluer than blue

Listen baby, I wear a mask of pretense
When I party with my friends
And I've even told them all
That I've gotten over you

They being my friends pretend that it's true
But it's in my voice there's no way, nohow
If I had my choice, I wouldn't be with you right now
Ever since I've lost you, I've been bluer than blue

Bluer than blue, baby
Since I lost you
I'm like a Robin without the wing
I can't fly and I won't sing

Like a Romeo with no Juliet
My whole world has been upset
Without you I'm bluer than blue
I'm bluer than blue

Anybody that's ever been in love
Those are feelings that I'm speaking of
And when you burn yourself walking the floor
Or waiting for a knock upon your door
You wait at night, you start to cry
Every thing's wrong, nothing's right

It's in your walk and it's in your talk
You try to fight the feeling
But the truth shows up
There's nothing you can do
When you're bluer than blue

So it's Monday through Sunday
I cannot find just one day
That I don't think of you
That I don't wake up blue

Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

And they will sing us a song

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

I am cheerful now
Got the warmth all over
To smoother my worried brow
Oh, the girl I use to be
She ain't me no more
I closed the door
On the girl I was before, hmm

Feelin' fine and full of bliss
What I really wanna say is this

I never has seen snow
All the same I know
Snow ain't so beautiful
Can't be so beautiful
Like my love is
Like my love is

Nothin' do compare
Nothin' anywhere with my love

A hundred things I see
A twilight sky, that tree
But none so beautiful
Not one so beautiful
Like my love is
Like my love is

Once you see his face
None can take the place of my love

A stone rolled of my heart
When I laid my eyes on that
Near to me boy with that far away look
And right from the start I saw a new horizon
And a road to take me where I wanted to be took
Needed to be took
Needed to be took
Oh, oh

I never have seen snow
All the same I know
Nothin' will ever be
Nothin' can ever be
Beautiful as my love is
Like my love is to me
Nothin' is as beautiful to me

In an old, tar-paper shack
On the south side of the town

""Mama, can we stop and give her a ride""?
Sometimes we did
But her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed, crazy Mary

Down a long dirt road, past the Parson's place
That old blue car we used to race
Little country store
With a sign tacked to the side
Said 'No L-O-I-T-E-A-R-R-I-N-G Allowed'

Underneath that sign
Always congregated quite a crowd
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around

Pass it a, pass it around

One night thunder cracked
Mercy backed outside her window sill
Dreamed I was flying high above the trees
Over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Bare bulb hung, newspaper-covered walls
And Mary rising above it all
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks and followed them around
Over the curve, through the fields
Into the house of Mary

Could meet you halfway

I was a Catholic boy,
Redeemed through pain,
Not through joy
I was two months early they put me under glass
I screamed and cursed their children when the nurses passed
Was convicted of theft when I slipped from the womb
They led me straight from my mother to a cell in the Tombs

I fed on cellmates' dreams, it gave me fine ideas
When they cut me loose, the time had served me well
I made allies in heaven, I made comrades in Hell
I was a Catholic child
The blood ran red
The blood ran wild
I make angels dance and drop to their knees
When I enter a church the feet of statues bleed
I understand the fate of all my enemies
Just like Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane

I make a resolution to purify my soul

I got baptism,
I got communion,
I got penance, 
I got extreme unction
I've got confirmation

The blood ran wild!

Next to a handsome face 
That the president took for granted 
Writing checks the whole world pays 
And in all the madness 
Thought becomes numb and naive
Too much to talk about 
And nothing for to say 

It's the same every day 
And the wave won't break 
Tell you to pray while
The devil's on his shoulder
Laying claim to the take 
That our soldiers save
Does not equate, and 
The truth's already out there

In an old, tar-paper shack
On the south side of the town

Sometimes on the way into town we'd say
""Mama, can we stop and give her a ride""?
Sometimes we did
But her hands flew from her side

Down a long dirt road, past the Parson's place
That old blue car we used to race
Little country store
With a sign tacked to the side
Said 'No L-O-I-T-E-A-R-R-I-N-G Allowed'

Over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Bare bulb hung, newspaper-covered walls
And Mary rising above it all
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks and followed them around
Over the curve, through the fields

Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend.

And the sky breaks at dawn; shedding light upon this town
They'll all come â??round

The broken seems along the way

Survived and you're amongst the fittest

And lightness has a call that's hard to hear.

I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.

Pointing me in a crooked line.
And the less I seek my source for some definitive,
The closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine.

He graded my performance, he said he could see through me.
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind,
Got my paper and I was free.

I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line.
And the less I seek my source for some definitive,
The closer I am to fine. The closer I am to fine.

I stopped by the bar at three A.M.
To seek solace in a bottle, or possibly a friend.
I woke up with a headache like my head against a board,
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before.
And I went in seeking clarity.

We go to the Bible, we go through the work out.
We read up on revival, we stand up for the lookout.

Now in the air the spring is coming

Pearson Dunn Strings Orchestra,"I'm living with false hope, and my eyes
Just want to see a ray of light
I'm gonna find it in my fairy tale

I hear, long forgotten broken toys
Tell me ancient tales of a boy
I will sing of them in my fairy tale

I was just a silent girl
Always dreaming of a little angel
Close to my reality
Sing, la la la

The midnight sun hangs in the sky
Show me your smile, my little angel
Hear me, my fantasy
Sing la la la through the night

See, how my flights of imagination
Help me discover comprehension
I can find it in my fairy tale

I know, only a man can dare to dream
Nothing is really as it seems
Keep on telling, your own fairy tale

Now wake up, my silent girl
Take to flight, like a foolish angel
Sing me your fantasy
Sing, la la la....

My midnight sun hangs in the sky
The first and last wondrous invention
Show me the horizon
Sing, la la la

The summer is here, we kiss and fall in love
But we've got to go, leaving nothing here
I want to share the memories of long forgotten love

I was just a silent girl
Wishing for better understanding
This is my melody

Lovers are in pain
They blame and pick on each other
You play melodies of love
Forgotten phrases
Tender and sweet

Come a little bit closer
Don't stay in the shadows my boy
(La la la la la la la)
The melody's fading.....
Now or never, love will go

I'll be there by your side
Share your fears in the silent redemption
Touch my lips, hold me tight
Live in vanity for a while

As winter melts in the sun
Boys will be out running and reaching for the light
Oh mother please find me in that place
Before the memories tear us into pieces

Clinging to affection, we somehow do learn to live
(La la la la la la la)
In endless motion
Never coming back, love will go

You'll be there by my side

Pebbles & Bamm-Bamm,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1965
Pebbles the Invisible Girl,"I used to cop a lot
But never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails, tight, and bob a lot
Stop and stick around
Come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat
Came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press - let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back
Came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone turn H2O to Cognac
On Doomsday!
Ever since the womb ‘til I'm back where my brother went
That's what my tomb will say
Right above my government, Dumille
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on See-Cipher-Punk, leave him left scraped

One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer

Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown

Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipple and tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow with no talking orangutangs
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can
Me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap

I was in a case out of state
She was thirteen and good we had a hotter date
It was just a number she never told she was knocked up
By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up
My aunt came and got and steadied the block
We bounce to the yeti and I'm ready to rock
With no attachments feelin a little loose
Blowin up in every spot we had a little juice
Probably the dime on the Afghani ?
We played the stage standin by the speaker and suddenly
Who tapped me I'm bout to get real ill
Already ripped the whole club with metal face's steel wheel (The mic)
What a sweet surprise her with the fly eyes
And fine she pulled me to the sidelines
The mystery shot up with strong words
She was an intelligent wisdom and a song bird
I met her last week at the same place
She stepped to me the same way at a no shame pace
I'm off guard her game had me choked up

Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three
In my earlier days they showed me things new to me
So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off
They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off
When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin her
Switchin off three times a night made them more opener
So you could love Allah or leave him the hell alone
Message from my god father aside a gold telephone
Many of my men went up in smoke
While trickin with these chickens I ended up broke
You find out who's ya mans when you broke
Like a bad joke it's funny when you on you got mad folk
I played the middle man in every little scam
Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam
I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers
Walk upon me speaking with stinkin mouth (About what?)
About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats
Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps
And it's that ?
I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat
I play the back steady on the humble
But be right up front when we get ready to rumble

Ich bau’ ein Haus mit einem Hammer wie ein Mann
Bring’ ein Album raus und nenn’ es einfach „Mama“ wie ein Mann
Wir müssen die Teller und manchmal auch Gläser füllen
Doch ohne drauf kleben zu bleiben wie Tesafilm
Ein waschechter Mann muss zu jeglicher Zeit die Klischees erfüll’n
Ein Haar auf der Brust wie ein Mann
Na klar hab’ ich Lust wie ein Mann
Du rufst mich an, um Geburtstag zu feiern, doch ich hab’ den Tag nicht gewusst wie ein Mann
Das Bad nicht geputzt wie ein Mann
Den Bart nicht gestutzt wie ein Mann
Wochenlang Touren, lebe nur aus meinem Koffer und schlafe im Bus wie ein Mann
Ich plane mit Plus wie ein Mann, hab’ Dope für dieses Land
Wurd’ zum Dealer, dabei war ich nie ein Drogenlieferant
Komm in meine Hood, stell mich auf die Probe wie ein Mann
Auch unter Druck mach’ ich Kohle - Diamant

Ich kämpfe jetzt, glänze später, wie ein Riesendiamant
Hände weg, im Endeffekt ging ich durch Krisen wie ein Mann
Jeder Tag ist wie ein Kampf, den man verwundet übersteht
Nach außen zeigt man kein’ Schmerz, mein Herz mit Wunden übersät
Mit dem Kopf durch die Wand, Killa - Zinédine Zidane
Keine Glock in der Hand, ich hab’ zwei Fäuste wie ein Mann
Halb Mensch, halb Maschine, verfolg’ meine Ziele
Hab’ für diese ganzen Schlampen keine Liebe - wie ein Mann
Lieber lachend und zu Fuß als weinend in ’nem Benz
Ah, Reime so potent, ah, keine Konkurrenz
Die meisten von uns hier sind auf Scheitern programmiert
Weil sie mit Dingen nicht beginnen aus der Angst, was zu verlier’n, ah

Diggah, gib mir mal das Mikro, es gibt bisschen was zu beichten, es war viel los
Doch eigentlich: wem muss ich was beweisen? Ich bin Pilot
Höhenflug, zwei Meter Größenwahn auf hundert Kilo
Und das Geld, das alles möglich macht, wird unser Friedhof
Ich hab’s geseh’n, trag’ die Narben wie ein Mann
War bis nachts auf der Straße, doch ertrag’ es wie ein Mann
Der ausm Stegreif krumme Dinger wieder geradebiegen kann
Ohne in ’ne schiefe Lage zu gelang’ - wie ein Mann
Ich war geduldig und hab’ jahrelang gewartet wie ein Mann
Auch aus ’nem Sandkorn wird irgendwann ein schwarzer Diamant
Die Welt dreht sich und die Jahre zieh’n ins Land
Nur wer gut blufft, zeigt, dass er seine Karten spielen kann - wie ein Mann

Ah!
Sie sind biologisch maskulin, aber nicht mit mir verwandt
Irgendwie logisch - sie sind Fotzen wie kein Mann
Ich fühle mich verlor’n auf Instagram, mach die App auf, wisch’ den Dreck aus
Meiner Netzhaut mit dem Kärcher wie ein Mann, zurück zum Thema
Hol’ DVDs ab - wie ein Mann, geb’ viel zu spät ab - wie ein Mann
Zahl’ die Mahnung wie ein Mann - irgendwann
Ich könnte singen auf dem Beat, doch ich bleib’ simpel
Trag’ oft wochenlang dieselbe gottverdammte Diesel - wie ein Mann
Dein Bodyguard, er war nie ein Mann, der schwarze Rabe, er war nie ein Schwarm
Fahre mit zweihundert, tippe dabei meinen Part mit einer Hand
Adam hat sich einen Garten gebaut, Eva hat sich für ’nen Apfel verkauft
R A war da, als der Beat entstand, „Schwermetall“ Gitter - wie ein Mann

Ich geh’ scheißen mit dem Smartphone in der Hand wie ein Mann
An meine Haare lass’ ich keine Frauen ran wie ein Mann
Finger weg, Sinan-G: vom Haschticker zum Knastkicker
Wie ein Mann kauf’ ich meine Brechstange beim Praktiker
Spastiker! Was für Knast? Sieh zu, dass du dein’ Spaß hast
Ich bin dieser Sinan und nicht der Bruder von Savas
Doch Brüder im Geiste
Ich muss wieder in den Knast und sitze bis zum Hals in der Scheiße
Sag mir, warum biten deutsche Rapper wieder „Frankreich“?
In meiner Welt ist Mustafa arm, aber Frank reich
Wie ein Mann hat sich Sinan in die Szene eingebrannt
16 Jahre jung, sag mir, wer ist in die Bank reingerannt?

Auch wenn ich stundenlang nur depri schieb’
Lös’ ich eines nach dem andern wie ein Mann, ich hab ’n Multitasking-Defizit
Und habe ich Schulden bei der Bank
Spucke ich in die Hand und acker’ dann, bis ich Plus mach’ wie ein Mann
Park’ das Auto immer rückwärts, bau’ das Ott auch immer rückwärts in dein’ Blunt
Mach paar Züge, Augen rot, so wie ein Blatt
Leben im Traum, bleibe am Boden und ich kämpf’, bis ich nicht kann
Gebe nicht auf, Kopf durch die Wand, weil ich denke wie ein Mann
Halt’ das Lenkrad mit ’ner Hand, bin am Handy, pass’ ’nen Blunt
Mache paar Geschäfte klar bei 160 km/h
Ich brauch’ Schubkraft und dreh’ ab, geb’ ein’ Schuss ab wie ein Junk
Und sind die Zeiten einmal schlecht, geh’ ich auch Bus fahren wie ein Mann

Ah!
Yao, gib ihn’!
Ich bin ehrlich, wie ein Mann, wie ein Mann
Macht der Alltag mich fertig, doch ich wehr’ mich, tu’ als wär’ nix, wie ein Mann
Sag’ „Ich merk’ nix!“ wie ein Mann, lass’ den Schmerz nicht an mich ran
Ich könnte jammern wie ein Mädchen, doch beherrsch’ mich wie ein Mann
Wie ein Mann werd’ ich irgendwann beerdigt wie ein Mann
Bevor ich lebe wie ’ne Fotze geh’ und sterb’ ich wie ein Mann
Wie ein Mann, Probleme k-k-klär’ ich wie ein Mann
Und muss es sein, dann fick’ ich Feinde - wie ein Pferd, nicht wie ein Mann
Und wenn ich feier’ wie ein Mann, dann bis ich reiher’ wie ein Mann
Am nächsten Tag dicker Kopf und dicke Eier wie ein Mann
Sag’ meiner Frau, dass ich sie lieb’ und später heirat’ wie ein Mann
Und ich bin treu, doch ich träum’ von dem Dreier wie ein Mann

Ich bin eklig und böse, so wie ein Mann
Ich weiß Probleme zu lösen, so wie ein Mann
Kämpf’ gegen Bären und Löwen, so wie ein Mann
Ich bin nämlich der König in diesem Land!
Dieselben Socken an, wochenlang, wie ein Mann
Ist voll normal, dass ich gut kochen kann, wie ein Mann
Kam noch nicht vor, dass mich das Leben in die Knie zwang
Denn guck, ich leiste Widerstand, wie ein Mann, wie ein Mann
Voll entspannt am Strand wie ein Mann
Scheiß auf dein Handtuch, ich lieg’ auf dem heißen Sand wie ein Mann
Langer Bart und tätowiert auf der Hand wie ein Mann
Und pass ma’ auf: ich kann saufen, bis ich nicht mehr laufen kann wie ein Mann

Yeah, ey
Ich überleg’: Wat zieh’ ich an? Seh’ da keine Jeans im Schrank
Nehm’ die alte, rieche dran - Deo drauf, wie ein Mann
Du bist Luft, das’ der Grund, warum ich dich nicht riechen kann
Hier mein Finger, zieh ma’ dran, kurz gefurzt wie ein Mann
Ich werd’ wie ein Mann nie mehr wat auf Raten zahlen
Denn mein Kontostand kann sich sehen lassen - Rasensamen, yeah
Ich schneid’ die Hecke wie ein Mann
Wärm’ die Füße meiner Frau unter der Decke wie ein Mann, yeah
Und für sie mach’ ich Einmachgläser auf
Mach’ ich ein Kind wie ein Mann, dann kommt ein kleiner Pedaz raus
Doch muckst du auf oder kommst mit irgendeinem Firlefanz
Schwing’ ich die Keule und mach’ passend, wat nicht passt - wie ein Mann

Und falls mein Akku mal leer sein sollte, brauch' ich kein Navi
Weil ich meinem Herzen folge

War auf der Hauptschule schwach, doch Chef glaubt, dass er's schafft
Er steht auf in der Nacht, macht sich Kopf, kann nich' schlafen

Er geht zocken für Bares, die Eltern wissen von nichts
Dispokredit ausgeschöpft, Gewissenskonflikt
Er weiß Kerle in der Gegend machen durch's Ticken zweitausend die Woche
Und er fährt rum mit Ticket 2000
Er weiß, was er macht ist richtig und Mama ist stolz
Doch Patte macht man hier im Business mit Hammer und Colt
Als er morgens an der Halte sein Berichtsheft geschrieben hat
Sieht er paar Gs am Park mit Zippacks im Siebener
Sitzen in Shisha-Bars, er kloppt Schlitz in den lieben Tag
Auch wenn das Gewissen ihn nicht plagt, wirkt der junge Kerl kein bisschen zufriedener

Wat Hustlen am Block? Ich mach nur mein Job
In der Pause den Beat an und ab geht die Post (jaja)
Tausend von Featuren doch hab keinen Bock
Werd' von ? bekloppt, dank von die 2-5-7
Im ? Stoff als er hätt' er Kerosin drin
Sehe Rapper die Kuren knallen
Ich krieg auch so locker Ruhm wie Englische Tourenhallen
Denn ich bin inzwischen kein Nischenprodukt mehr wie single Küssen ah

Kanne Bier auf heißt jetzt ist Stundenausgleich

Pumpen um eins bis der Muskel zerreißt

Einmal im Jahr heißt es Eier schaukeln
Das heißt Beats picken, wat schreiben und dreimal aufnehmen
Zeilen verkaufen, sehen wat die GEMA ran fährt
Bin kein Tontechniker doch versteh mein Handwerk (yeah yeah)
Ich mach mein Hobby zum Beruf
Wat für Ghostwriter, für mich heißt copy-paste Betrug (yeah)
Ich kauf ein Manta mit schwarzen Leder
Du schimpfst auf pumpende Karre, Wagenheber (yeah)
Ich zieh's durch wie Kartenleser
5-4 für immer Kollege, Zahlendreher
Ich mach klar Schiff wie Straßenfeger 
Überfahr' dich und mach dich 'n Kopp kürzer, Rasenmäher
Ich werd' steinreich die Sprüche aus der Steinzeit
Wat du Kopp Full time Job nennst, nenn' ich Freizeit
Bald hört mich jeder, der gelacht hat auf 1Live
Krieg nicht, denn du bist nur 'n Abklatsch, High five

Pedaz,"Könnte fünf Lämmer, drei Kälber und 'nen Hasen verputzen 
Und kämpfe höchstens mit den Tränen beim Nasenhaarzupfen 
Ich schwinge die Machete um bei mir den Rasen zu stutzen 
Wie ein Mann, riesen Schwanz, Kumpel, klar will sie lutschen 
Blicke reichen und Ischen kreischen 
Ich rede nicht vom Pausebrot, wenn ich sag „Sie wollen mir ihre ihre Kniften zeigen“
Du fickst hier keinen, denn von Eiern gibt's hier keine Spur
Das heißt, die kann man mit nichts vergleichen
Und wat für Proportionen?
Dein Tagesbedarf inhaliere ich pro Protion
Denn hier heißt's Schonkost-Fritten essen
Du Veganerschwuchtel bist nervtötend, als würdest du Botoxspritzen setzen
Im Video seh' ich halbstarke Scheine zählen
Doch eure Alben sind halbgar wie meine Steaks
Haltbar wie Schweinesteaks – ein, zwei, drei Wochen
Weil alle anderen nur den Einheitsbrei kochen

Alles was du machst geht in die Brüche
Bist wie das Eichhörnchen bei Ice Age – alles was du machst ist für Nüsse, Dikka
Wat denn für Schüsse? Mach besser die Biege
Du kriegst auf Mett, red' nicht von Pfeffer und Zwiebeln, du Bastard
Halt' an der Tanke an für Brühwürstchen
Und hab' die Lampen an wie Glühwürmchen
Bin wieder stramm wie'n Spanngurt, du Hans Wurst
Ich verklopp' dich mit meinem Schwanz – Kampfwurst
Du bist ein netter Dude, du fette Kuh
Wat für'n G, du bist nicht Bullitt, Junge, du bist bulettenproof
Du bist nicht du, wenn du hungrig bist
Also iss mal nichts, denn du bist nicht du, wenn du hungrig bist
Du machst auf Gourmet und dicken Bonzen, doch glaub' ma' ich gönn' mir 
Pommes jede Woche auch mit dicken Konten
Es gibt nich' viele die mich ficken konnten, denn der Lange ist zäh 
Und ich rede nich' vom Dicken Onkel

Mach' mich an, ich mach' dich lang
Bin nich' der Papst, doch wenn du zu mir kommst, zeig' ich dir Wat-i-kann
Locker, komm' mal klar jetzt, du Kackbratze
Dich zu battlen ist so einfach wie am Sack kratzen
Würde dich abschlachten, killte früher jeden
Keine Prüfung für den Langen, trotzdem is' er überlegen
Ich schreib' das kurz auf'm Scheißhaus
Ihr seid hart, doch wenn ich furz' nehmt ihr reiß aus
Du scheiß Lauch, laber nich' vom harten Biz
Ich zeige dir auch ohne Phasenzip was bei uns Phase ist

Konkurrenz seh' ich nich'
Red' nicht von China wenn ich sag: „Du weißt, dass hier Peking ist“
Yeah, bin auf Baustellen beschäftigt, ist mehr Pause als mir rech ist
Mach' ich auf schnell 'ne Deadlift (heftig)
Deine Braut ist viel zu hässlich
Nimm ein volles Glas Benzin ist zwar kein Ausweg, aber Exit 
Lass die Kinkerlitzchen, Jung
Mit Behinderung kommt halt immer bisschen dumm
Doch paar Kinder dissen rum, jetzt folgt 'ne Denksportaufgabe

Pedaz,"Ich habe ziemlich früh gelernt „begleiche deine Schulden!“
Denn das beste Gefühl ist, keinem was zu schulden
Vergeude keine Kraft, bevor dich deine Wut zu Fehlern treibt
Solltest du dich eine Nacht gedulden, glaub mir
Fokussier' dich auf dich, nenn' mich ruhig Egoist
Interessieren tut's mich nicht
Denn wahre Kumpels wissen, man darf nicht abgefuckt sein 
Wenn der andere sich nicht meldet ohne den wahren Grund zu wissen
Willst du was erreichen, musst du Hass vermeiden
Ich versuche beim Sport die Last abzuschmeißen
Bin ohne Rast am Schreiben und ebne meinen Weg wie mit Pflastersteinen
Kack paar Reime, Mach paar Scheine
Wenn sie deine Träume nicht teilen Kumpel, mach alleine
Sind Freunde zu nett? Dann haste Feinde!
Teste ob der Schein trügt, wie mit Wasserzeichen

Ich habe ziemlich früh gelernt, „sei immer schön bescheiden“
Ein wahrer Mann kann auch durch Schweigen Größe zeigen
Lass lieber Taten sprechen
Ich mein nicht lass lieber Harten treffen
Sie sollen noch in hundert Jahren davon sprechen
Schmerz vergeht doch der geknickte Stolz bleibt
Sie werden sehen, ich gehe meinen Weg und spitte Hits in Vollzeit
Schau bei keinem ab, wir sind sowieso verschieden
Mache so viel selbst wie geht, denn nur so bin ich zufrieden
Bis jetzt ist Rap noch kein Fulltime-Job
Bin erst Stolz wenn ich mir selbst auf die Schultern klopf
Und keiner kann mir wat erzählen, denn nur ich kenne mein Weg
Keiner kann mir wat erzählen
Ich mach' vernünftig mein' Job
Such' die Fehler nicht bei anderen und brauche für die Sünden kein' Bock
Repräsentiere auch zukünftig den Pott
Hör mein Album und drehe noch ein Ründchen im Block

Peder,"They have all gone to the city
They all walk down the same dead end street
Standing in line looking for a sign
Between the tall buildings where the sun never shines

It's taken the peace from the shade of these trees
Watching you fade away

You need some sunshine
You need some daylight
You need some sunshine
You need some daylight

And it makes me 
Ever so sad to find that 
You are going mad
Losing yourself within this maze
Just turn around and leave that place
You must turn around and leave this place
Please wake up and change your ways

You need some sunshine
