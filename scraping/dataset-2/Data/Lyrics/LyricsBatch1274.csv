Them dead presidents
Well I ain't broke but I'm badly bent
Everybody loves them dead presidents
A little bit of Lincoln can't park the car
Washington he can't go too far
Jefferson is good, played the track
If you think you're gonna bring some big bitch back

Them dead presidents
Hamilton on a ten can get you straight
But Jackson on a twenty is really great
And if you're talkin' about a poor man's friend
Grant will get you out of whatever you're in

A hundred dollar Franklin is really sweet
A five hundred McKinley is the one for me
If I get a Cleveland I'm really set
A thousand dollar Cleveland is hard to get

Willie Dixon,"I went out to the insane asylum
And I found my baby out there
I said please come back to me darlin'
What in the world are you doin' here?
Then the little girl raised up her head
Tears was streamin' down from her eyes
And these are the things
That the little girl said

When your love has ceased to be (Lord, have mercy)
There's no other place for me 
If you don't hold me in your arms (Oh child oh child)
I'd rather be here from now on
Some people have an halfway fare
Without your love I ain't nowhere
Oh I can't eat and I can't sleep (oh child oh child)
Lord I can't even live in peace 
Please take me baby for your slave (Oh)
And save me from that early grave
Some people have an halfway fare
Without your love I ain't nowhere

And then sorrow struck my heart
Tears began to stream down from my eyes
The only woman that I ever loved in whole my life
Out here in a place in a condition like this
And I began to thinkin' about what my mama told me when I was a little boy
She told me when I couldn't help myself, to get down on my knees and pray
Then I fell down on my knees
And these are the words that I said

Save me save me save me babe,
Save me save me save me dear,
Whoa I don't know just how we made it
But I'm so glad our love is here
But I'm so glad our love is here

Reaching up to the sky above 
Asking to myself

Trying to find at least one clue 
On a paper scrawled

The came to cry and laugh and fight about it 
All searching for the promised land

Where twisted hands don't mean a thing

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

If we had the chance to do it all again

Want somebody tell me, what is the soul of a man

I've traveled in different countries, I've traveled foreign lands
I've found nobody to tell me, what is the soul of a man

I saw a crowd stand talking, I came up right on time
Were hearing the doctor and the lawyer, say a man ain't nothing but his mind
I read the bible often, I tries to read it right

As far as I can understand, a man is more than his mind

Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What is This Thing Called Love,2012
Willie Jones,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996

Oh oh oh, it's been an hour and three seconds
Since I had you naked
And I'm feeling like its nicotine
And I only wish that I could keep my cool
You got me being a fool
And I want another piece of you
I'm lonely like in solitaire
And I wish I had you here
And I'll push you down and climb on top of you
The more that your away
The more I wish you stay
And I'm gonna have my way with you
And there is no way that I'll stop wanting you
Now tell me if its hard, for you to give it up
Is it wrong, for me to want your love
Is it crazy, that I want you so bad
Uh, like I do
And there is no way that I'll stop loving you

I can't get enough of your thing

I can't get enough of your thing

I can't get enough of your thing
(whats a girl to do)
I can't get enough of your thing
(with a man like you)

Oh oh oh, everybody says I'm crazy
They say you got me open
Like a twenty four hour liquor store
You never keep your baby running
You always keep me cumming
And now in feeling for some more
Come close to me
Baby be strong
Don't ever stop
Keep holding on
Everybody's got their own way of living
And I gotta be down with the way I'm feelin'
And there is no way that I'll stop wanting you
Now tell me is if its hard, for you to give it up
And is it wrong, for me to want your love
And is it crazy, that I want you so bad
Uh, like I do

Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me

See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me

Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keep on, keep on crying baby for you

Willie Mitchell,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.

Til' it rains I'm gonna stay inside and let it rain.",I Wish It Would Rain,1993

Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be sticking but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

And every time i think back
On all the stuff I been through
I prayed through I cried through

And then I tried you and just
When I was about to fall
Your love caught me when your name I called
Jesus You keep on looking out for me [Repeat; x 2]

Remember when the doctor said
He said he couldn't help you and
Remember when the money was getting low
You're hurting now your felling low and just

When you thought the night would never end
The sun came out now you can smile again
Jesus you keep on looking out for me
 
[Chorus]
You keep on lookin' out for me [Repeat: x 3]

In spite of all I've done
Jesus you keep on lookin' out for me
I shouldn't be here today
And when i look back on all my mistakes

If it hadn't been for your grace
I don't know where I'd be where I'd go
Who can love me like you do
And who can hold me when I'm goin' through

The snow is on the grass again,
The sun's low down the sky, Lorena,
The frost gleams where the flowers have been.
But my heart beats on as warmly now,
As when the summer days were nigh,
The sun can never dip so low,
Or down affections cloudless sky.

A hundred months have passed, Lorena,
Since last I held that hand in mine,
And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena,
Though mine beat faster far than thine.
A hundred months, 'twas flowery may,
When up the hilly slope we climbed,
To watch the dying of the day,
And hear the distant church bells chime.

We loved each other then, Lorena,
More than we ever dared to tell,
And what we might have been, Lorena,
Had but our lovings prospered well.
But then, 'tis past, the years are gone,
I'll not call up their shadowy forms,
I'll say to them, ""lost years, sleep on!
Sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms.""

The story of that past, Lorena,
Alas! I care not to repeat,
The hopes that could not last, Lorena,
They lived, but only lived to cheat.
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now,
For ""if we try, we may forget,""
Were words of thine long years ago.

Yes, these were words of thine, Lorena,
They burn within my memory yet,
They touched some tender chords, Lorena,
Which thrill and tremble with regret.
'twas not thy woman's heart that spoke,
Thy heart was always true to me:
A duty, stern and pressing, broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee.

It matters little now, Lorena,
The past is in the eternal past,
Our heads will soon lie low, Lorena,

We knew they would cry when we said goodbye 
And I'd rather leave quietly instead
We can never be happy 
We both know it's true
We've quarrelled from the day that we met
Our love was too weak to pull our dreams through 
But too strong to let us forget
I hope we can salvage a few memories 
To carry us through the long nights
The clock's striking midnight 
Yesterday's gone and there's no tomorrow in sight

In our efforts to break through 
The thick walls of pride
With harsh words that burned to the core
The walls still remain 
But the words broke inside 
And strengthened the walls even more
I hope we can salvage...",No Tomorrow in Sight,1967
Willie Nelson,"I'm so tired of all this trouble now aren't you
We've tried and failed to make our dreams come true
It seems that we had dream worlds all our own
So don't you think that we should try it once alone
Life's too short to spend it feeling blue
And it's not too late our dreams could still come true
But before our chance for happiness is gone
Don't you think that we should try it once alone
It's not your fault and neither is it mine
It seems that we're just victims of the times
It's not that I don't love you cause I do
But love alone can't make a dream come true
I suppose that we'll survive the parting tears
We've survived so many others through the years
But before our chance for happiness is gone
Don't you think that we should try it once alone",Once Alone,1967
Willie Nelson,"Laugh with me, buddy 
Jest with me, buddy

Don't ever let me start feeling lonely

I cry at the least little thing, buddy 
And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy

Stay with me, buddy

Willie Nelson,"This looks like a December day
This looks like a ""time to remember"" day
And I remember the spring, such a sweet tender thing
And love's summer college,
Where the green leaves of knowledge,
Were waiting to fall with the fall

And where September wine,
Numbed the measure of time
Through the tears of October, now November's over,
And this looks like a December day

This looks like a December day
It looks like we've come to the end of the way
And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning,
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
The ending that won't go away

And as my memories race back to love's eager beginning,
Reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
The ending that won't go away

And this looks like a December day",December Day,1968
Willie Nelson,"Did I ever ever love you?
Did I ever really care?
All the times that I cried for you 
Did I really want you there?
Wiser man then I have wondered 
About love and never knew
Did I ever love you?
I guess I still do

All the nights that I spent cryin' 
All those lonely loss of times

Was it only in my mind?

About love and never knew
Did I ever love you?
I guess I still do",Did I Ever Love You,1968
Willie Nelson,"Last evening, I turned by the pages of time.
And tore out the chapters when you were mine.
I attempted to cut out the memories of you.
And paste in some new ones, far better an' true.
True. 

I searched through the chapters, referring to hearts,
for the one with the caption: ""Till death do us part.""
I ripped at each letter an' I tore at each word.
I screamed at your memory an' nobody heard.
Nobody heard. 

But your memory's determined, and chances are few,
Of my ever finding a replacement for you.
It desperately clings to the floor of my mind,
And fights for its place in the pages of time.",Pages,1968
Willie Nelson,"Don't be concerned it's time I learned 
That those who play with fire get burned

But you'll be permanently lonely

Don't salve my heart with sympathy
'Cause I'll be alright in a little while 
But you'll be permanently lonely
The world looks on with wonder 
And pity at your kind
'Cause it knows that the future 
Is not very pretty for your kind for your kind

And left all alone

Willie Nelson,"I wake up in the morning with my arms around my pillow
Then suddenly I realize I only hold a pillow you're not there you're not there
I call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallway
To return alone confirming all I've known for so long I'm alone you're still gone
Still half asleep I stumble to the kitchen for my coffee
My footsteps match my heartbeats funny heartbeats on linoleum
The sounds all wrong you're still gone
The sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait forever
And understanding saves don't stand by empty graves
You're on your own all alone she's still gone",She's Still Gone,1968
Willie Nelson,"My world is like a river as dark as it is deep
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories
Sweet memories
Sweet memories, hmm

She slipped into the silence of my dreams last night
Wondering from room to room turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories
Sweet memories
Sweet memories, hmm",Sweet Memories,1968
Willie Nelson,"As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy, all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen, as cold as the clay

I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did speak as I slowly walked by
Come sit here beside me and hear my sad story
For I'm a young cowboy and know I must die

So, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Once in the saddle I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle I used to go gay
First to the cardhouse and then down to Rosy's
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dyin' today

Bring six tall young cowboys to carry my casket,
Six pretty maids for to sing me a song
Take me to green valleys, there lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Fetch me some water, a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips, then the poor cowboy said
Before I returned, his spirit had left him
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead.

So, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Play the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to green valleys, there lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I known I've done wrong",Streets of Laredo,1968

And when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas with you
Waltz across Texas with you in my arms waltz across Texas with you
Like a storybook ending I'm lost in your charms

Willie Nelson,"I'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go
And the first to say be happy if you can
But you lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you so
Do you mind too much if I don't understand
I suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do
Life is short and sweet break all the hearts you can
I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to you

But do you mind too much if I don't understand
Forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me

I used to live in
I hope that you don't mind 
I won't stay very long
So long ago someone and I lived here together 
And then so suddenly I found myself alone

I couldn't stand the thought 
Of living here without her
And so I moved away to let my memories die
But my memories outlived my own judgement

This may sounds strange to you 
But I just thought I'd drop by
The very door you're standing in 
She used to stand there

And wait for me to come home every night
And when I'd see her standing there 
I'd run to meet her

These things were on my mind so 
I just thought I'd drop by
I guess that I should leave

And what did it do
I just kept right on goin' 
Until it got right to you

And it's driving me wild
When I let my mind wander 

I try to keep my mind busy
With thoughts of today but 
In terrible memories 
Seem to lure it away

The sun will blaze its scorching path across the sky a million times or mroe... and men with charts will scan the skies in quest of life on some forgotten shore... and in the quiet womb the sleeping seed will stretch its arms and grow at last...and love will grow, it will come to pass...

Though men and minds and times will change still pinioned they by fers of growinkg old...though scalpeled hands will plumb the deepest corners none will find the soul... yet bearded men in sandwich boards will tell the sinfuls treets, ""He's Come At Last"" .. and love will grow, it will come to pass...

Willie Nelson,"The lights go out each evening at eleven
And up and down our block there's not a sound
I close my eyes and search for peaceful slumber
And just then the local memory comes around

Piles of blues against the door to make sure sleep will come no more
She's the hardest working memory in this town
Turns out happiness again and then lets loneliness back in
And each night the local memory comes around

Each day I say tonight I may escape her
I pretend I'm happy and never even frown
But at night I close my eyes and pray sleep finds me
But again the local memory comes around

Rids the house of all good news then sets out my crying shoes
What a faithful memory never lets me down
We're both up till light of day chasing happiness away
And each night the local memory comes around

Piles of blues against the door to make sure sleep will come no more
It's the hardest working memory in this town
Turns out happiness again and then lets loneliness back in
And each night the local memory comes around
And each night the local memory comes around",Local Memory,1969

With only these few million tears I cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come

There'll be a gatherin' of loved ones and friends and Lord you know I want to be there
There'll be a mixture of teardrops and flowers, crying and talking for hours
'Bout how wild that I was and if I'd listened to them I wouldn't be there

Well there's old Charlie Toll they threw away the mold when they made him
And Jimmy McCline it looks like the wine's finally laid him
And Billie McRae that I could any day in a card game
And Bessie McNeal but her tears are real, I can see pain
There's a mixture of teardrops and flowers, crying and talking for hours
About how wild that I was and if I'd listened to them I wouldn't be there

Lord thanks for ride I got a feeling inside that I know you
And if you see your way, you're welcome to stay 'cause I'm gonna need you

It's just as wrong to think as to say

Never worry if he can't repay
For in time you'll be repaid ten times over

But open arms should await it's returning

Willie Nelson,"I passed a home the other day
The yard was filled with kids at play
And on the sidewalk of this home
A little boy stood all alone

His smiling face was sweet and kind
But I could see the boy was blind
He listened to the children play
I bowed my head and there I prayed

Dear Lord above, why must this be
And then these words came down to me
After all, you're just a man
And it's not for you to understand

It's not for you to reason why
You too are blind without my eyes
So question not what I command
'Cause it's not for you to understand

I pray his will, not mine be done

Rise before me

Who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye

Been a failure

That I've traveled

Caught pneumonia on the road
Taking it home to Connie and the kids

He said traveling on the road is such a drag

Raw perfection there for all the world to see

You came out in front but I was hiding
And now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody for my love is in there hiding

And I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I've loved you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you",A Song for You,1974

To the wide Pacific shore
To the queen of flowing mountains

As she glides along the woodland 
Through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine 
And the lonesome hoboes call
No changes can be taken 
On the Wabash Cannonball

Now here's to daddy Claxton 
May his name forever stand
He'll always be remembered 
In the ports throughout the land
His earthly race is over 
And the curtain round him falls
We'll carry him home to Glory

Your problem is clear now to me.
You think that the whole world's against you,
An' you tell everyone that you see. 

Just suffer in silence, speak no bitter words.
The world offers no sympathy.
Though trouble surrounds you, an' you long to be heard,
Just suffer in silence, like me. 

I'll give you a lesson in living,
And I hope it stays with you a while.
You're the reason for all of your sorrows,
So just suffer in silence, and smile.

The angel of the Lord came down and glory shone around and glory shone around
Fear not said he for mighty dread had seized their troubled mind
Glad tidings of great joy I bring to you and all mankind to you and all mankind
To you in David's town this day is born of David's line
The Saviour who is Christ the Lord and this shall be the sign and this shall be the sign
The heavenly babe you there shall find to human view displayed
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands and in a manger laid and in a manger laid
All glory be to God on high and to the earth be peace
Good will henceforth from heaven to men begin and never cease begin and never cease

Willie Nelson,"Met a girl that I loved
In a town way down in Texas
'Neath the stars up above
She was the sweetest girl
I ever did see
So I held her in my arms
And told her of her many charms
And I kissed her

Don't you ever go away

And my heart fell at your feet
An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side,
And he looked so satisfied
An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing,
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
An' suddenly, I got that old time feeling
An' I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you,
And hold you just the way I used to do
Heaven only knows how much I miss you

Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars
A maiden so fair divine

Lonely there she kneels, and tells the stars above
In her heart is a song
And there it belongs
Her undying song of love

Every word reveals
An empty, broken heart
Broken by fate
That held them so far apart

Stars on high
Seem to know she's there
In her heart is a song
And there it belongs
Her undying song of love",A Maiden's Prayer [#][*],1975
Willie Nelson,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end

Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

And I taught you how to cheat you're doing fine

Except the usual mem'ries that always linger on
And today might be the day that you walk away

And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own

That fountain in his day;

Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away;

Wash all my sins away.

Willie Nelson,"I could tell the moment that I saw Him
He was nothing but the trouble making kind
His hair was much too long and His motley group of friends
Had nothing but rebellion on their minds

He just goes from town to town, stirring up the young folks
'Til they're nothing but a disrespectful mob

I know for sure He's never joined the army
And served His country like we all have done
He'd rather wear His sandals and His flowers
While others wage the war that must be won

And sentenced Him to die but that's no great loss
Friday they will take Him to a place called Calvary
And hang that troublemaker to a cross",The Troublemaker,1976

When the roll, is called up yon-der,
When the roll, is called up yon-der,

And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,

Breathing a lesson unheard,
Hope with a gentle persuasion
Whispers her comforting word:
Wait till the darkness is over,
Wait till the tempest is done,
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow,
After the shower is gone.

Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice,
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.

If, in the dusk of the twilight,
Dim be the region afar,
Will not the deepening darkness
Brighten the glimmering star?
Then when the night is upon us,
Why should the heart sink away?
When the dark midnight is over,
Watch for the breaking of day.

Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice,
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.

Hope, as an anchor so steadfast,
Rends the dark veil for the soul,
Whither the Master has entered,
Robbing the grave of its goal.
Come then, O come, glad fruition,
Come to my sad weary heart;
Come, O Thou blest hope of glory,
Never, O never depart.

Whispering hope, oh how welcome thy voice,
Making my heart in its sorrow rejoice.",Whispering Hope,1976

Shatter your illusions of love

Willie Nelson,"Funny a woman can come on so wild and free
Yet insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch me
And stand by my bed and shiver as if she were cold
Just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were gold
One night of love can't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord cause I'm flesh and bone
And sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all

Right or wrong a woman can own any man
She can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
Then leave him as weak and weary as a newborn child
Fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes
One night of love can't make up...

And sometimes it seems...",If You Could Touch Her at All,1979

'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

Willie Nelson,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,1979
Willie Nelson,"See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans,
Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile--
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams,
Which he spent like they was goin' outta style--
And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse,
Searchin' for a shrine he's never found--
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse,
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down--

He's a poet, he's a picker--
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.

He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
And he's traded in tomorrow for today--
Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars,
And losin' all he's loved along the way--
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,
And all he ever gets is older and around--
>from the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse,
The goin' up was worth the comin' down--

He's a poet, he's a picker--
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--

Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you

Through you won't speak and I won't speak that's true
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through

Whose cold cold wars are never won and whose hearts just can't be free
Oh let's do right or let's just say we're through
I just can't stand another cold cold war with you

But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning

Willie Nelson,"I grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
And lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days

I learned all the rules of a modern day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow movin' dreams

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold, in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well that your best days are gone

Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my youth fade away
Old worn-out saddles, and old worn-out memories
But no one and no place to stay

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems

Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

I'll be rich as Rockefeller

Willie Nelson,"Sometimes I wonder, why I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale
Tells his fairy tale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

Though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain
My stardust melody

And though I dream in vain
In my heart there always will remain

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips you took my love so tenderly

I miss you darlin' more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you

As I watch the mating of a dove,
And it was in the springtime that we said goodbye.
I remember our faded love.

And the plans of a wise man

Gazed at the world all around
Made a vow that somehow I would find fame and fortune
I found it but look at me now

I had a sweetheart who would love me forever
Didn't need her, I would reign all alone
And look at me, I'm the king of cold lonely castle
The queen of my heart is gone

Listen to me, a lesson you'll learn

Willie Nelson,"I'd have to be crazy
To stop all my singing
And never play music again

You'd call me a fool
If I grabbed up a top hat
And ran out to flag down the wind

I'd have to be weird
To grow me a beard
Just to see what the rednecks would do

But I'd have to be crazy
Plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you

Now I know I've done weird things
I told people I heard things
When silence was all that abounds

Been days when it pleased me
To be on my knees
Following ants, as they crawled across the ground

I've been insane on a train
But I'm still me again
The place where I hold you is true

So I know I'm alright
'Cause I'd have to be crazy
To fall out of love with you

Now I don't intend to
But should there come a day
When I say that I don't love you
You can love me away

I sure would be dingy
To live in an envelope
Waiting alone for a stamp

You'd swear I was loco
To rub for a genie
While burning my hand on the lamp

And I may not be normal
But nobody is
So I'd like to say 'fore I'm through

Plumb out of my mind
To fall out of love with you

Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

Then the traveler in the dark
Thanks you for your tiny spark;
He could not see which way to go,
If you did not twinkle so.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!

In the dark blue sky you keep,
While you thro' my window peep,
And you never shut your eye,
Till the sun is in the sky,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!","Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star",1981
Willie Nelson,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?

Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

I'm a plan that you didn't lay so well
I'm a fire that burns in your mind 
Close your eyes I'm a memory

I'm a love that you know from a song 
I'm a voice on a green telephone
I'm a day that lasted so long

If you should ever change your mind about me
Be the one to come and tell me so
Please don't let me hear it from another

I've seen it happen to so many others
They seem to find their love has gone cold

Willie Nelson,"Not many'd say you're handsome cause they don't realize
That the best is often hidden from another's eyes
But in the quiet moments that's when you stop to shine
And every night I'm thankful that you're mine mmm that you are mine
Cause you were born to love me in your gentle way
Born to love me each and every day
Born to love me born to hold me tight
Born to love me every night every night every night

I've learned it doesn't matter what other people see

Cause you were born to love me",Born to Love Me,1982
Willie Nelson,"I've been blinded, by my feelings,
Self pity and sorrow was all I could see
Tears I was crying,
Kept me from seeing, I didn't love
That man as much as he loved me
Looking for excuses and other reasons,
To keep myself in a constant doubt
After all my searching and undo hurting.
I nearly lost the only good thing I ever found

Bring on the sunshine,
Take away the rain.
Bring on the sunshine,
My baby's coming home again
Take away the grey skies,
Hello love of mine
Happy days are coming my way,

I have made my last mistake
And once I get him, right here beside me
I'm gonna give him all the love he'd care to take

Willie Nelson,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.

Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!
Lord! she said, casey can you only stay a while? 

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the golden crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.

Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,
Now she said, now that you've a fam'ly of your own;
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body!
Lord! she said casey it's a shame to be alone!",Casey's Last Ride,1982
Willie Nelson,"When I look out over a green field of clover 
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day 
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain 
Or see April showers bring flowers to May 
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm 
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away 
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger 
The storm's even beautiful in its own way 

When I see leaves drop off from the treetop 
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day 
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder 
God made all things beautiful in their own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way, in its own way, in its own way",Everything's Beautiful (In Its Own Way),1982

Although you're with somebody new 
Thought I'd drop a line to say 
That I wish this happy day 
Would find me beside you 
Happy, happy birthday baby 
No, I can't call you my baby 
Seems like years ago we met 
On a day I can't forget 
Cause that's when we fell in love 

Do you remember 
The names we had for each other 
I was your pretty 
You were my baby 
Oh, how could we say goodbye 

Hope I didn't spoil your birthday 
I'm not acting like a lady 
So I'll close this note to you 
With good luck and wishes too

Willie Nelson,"I wake up in the morning with my arms around my pillow
Then suddenly I realize, I only hold a pillow
You're not there, you're not there

I call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallway
To return alone confirming all I've known for so long
I'm alone you're still gone

Still half asleep I stumble to the kitchen for my coffee
My footsteps match my heartbeats, funny heartbeats on linoleum
The sounds all wrong you're still gone

The sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait forever
And understanding saves don't stand by empty graves
You're on your own all alone, she's still gone

Sittin' when the evening comes
Watchin' the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tides roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

Left my home in Georgia
I was headed for the Frisco Bay
I have nothing to live for
Looks like nothing's gonna come my way

I can't do what them people tell me to do

I know I said I'd take you to the lake today
But I'm going to have to break those plans, and it really hurts
Every time I go fishin' it'd always start me wishin'
That I could be a child again
Take my 50 cents and go down to the local picture show
To watch my heroes rope and ride
Most times they'd win but when they'd lose it always made me cry
Ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all

Well I guess the fish just ain't bitin' just as well I don't feel like fightin'
All in all it just ain't that great a fishin' day that old newspaper headline
Kind of wrapped around this old heart of mine another big one got away

Willie Nelson,"I remember the day that Clayton Delaney died
They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did

Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his old guitar and made it down in Tennessee

Well daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early gray

I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned pickin' up the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now

I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be the good Lord likes a little picking too
I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died

And darlin' we could be happy after all

Willie Nelson,"I was sittin' beside the road in Blackjack County
Not knowing that the sheriff paid a bounty
For men like me who didn't have a penny to their names
So he locked my leg to thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chain

All we had to eat was bread and water
Each day we had to build that road a mile and a quarter
Black sneak whip would cut our backs when some poor fool complained
But we couldn't fight back wearin' 35 pounds of Blackjack County chain

And then one night while the sheriff was a sleepin'
We all gathered round him slowly creepin'
And heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain
When we beat him death with thirty-five pounds of Blackjack County chain

Now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankful
That there's nothing but a scar round my ankle
Most of all I'm glad no man will be a slave again

Got a ticket for my destination.
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
And every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.

Homeward bound,
I wish I was,
Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Every day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, 
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll play the game and pretend.
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

People breaking up and just walking away from love 
And that's wrong don't you know that's wrong
A happy little home comes up for sale because two fools half tired and failed

A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
And neither one of them try to love and understand
And take it with a grain of salt

A little bit of love is better than no love even sad love's better than no love
Even bad love is better than no love at all
A little bit of love is better than no love even bad love's better than no love
Any kind of love is better than no love at all

No love at all is a poor old man standin' on the corner with his hat in his hand
And thare's no place to go, and he's feeling low
No love at all is a child in the street dodging traffic and a begging to eat
On the tennament row and that's a rough row to hoe

No love at all is a scared young girl, standin' on the bridge on the edge of the world
And it's a pretty short fall

Where her dead sweetheart lay
And on his breast placed a rose

When his hands crushed the rose
And the rose petals fell in the sand

And old tougher than leather

Where a young cowboy died 
And a young maiden cried
And rose petals fell in the sand
And his heart had been softened 
By the beautiful maid
And he knew he must see her again

Well he went back to the town 
Where it all had come down
And he searched but his search was in vain

And say he was sorry
For causing her heart so much pain

Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress

A sigh is just a sigh

They still say, ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate

Willie Nelson,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings
She belongs to you
An old love story that's known to very few

But if you wear those golden earrings
Love will come to you
By the burning fire, they will glow with evï¿½ry coal

And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight",Golden Earrings,1983

Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds.

Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind

Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
I guess I lost my way, there were oh, so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worrying about paying or how much I owed
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules I could bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again
CHORUS (ALL):
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
I found myself seekin'
Shelter against the wind
WILLIE:
All those drifter's days are passed me now
I've got so much more to think about
JOHNNY:
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
Well I'm older now and still
Running against the wind

Willie Nelson,"Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.

Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf.
She loves you, Big River, more than me.

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.",Big River,1985
Willie Nelson,"There's a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor

There's a girl in 307, coming down on Thorazine
And a superstar's ex-drummer trying to kick Benzedrine
There's a boy just down below me, who's the son of some well-known
He was brought in by his mother, 'cause his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on Broadway and a few quite well-to-do's
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview

There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning, an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good choosing some committed to Parkview

They wake us about 6:30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And I always say ""Fantastic! There ain't nothing wrong with me.""

With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin and a rose of a different name
The devil made me do it the first time the second time I done it on my own
Lord put a handle on a simple handed man and help me leave that black rose alone

But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run

Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And sad songs for us to bare

If we could only fly

Then some little thing goes wrong

We were runnin' from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life and romance
And that's why we thought we should go
And start our lives over on the seashores of old Mexico

Our first night in Juarez, we lost all the money we had
One bad senorita made use of two innocent lad
But we must keep on runnin' it's too late to turn back
And we wanted in Tucson, we know
An' things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

Two Mexican farmers en route to a town, I can't say
Let us ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where we slept in the sunshine on the seashores of old Mexico

After one long siesta, we came wide awake in the night
We were startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
Our new-found companion, one young Senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico

She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
'Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
Well that's all I needed to know

Willie Nelson,"South Of The Border Lyrics
South of the border down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
Now as I wander my thoughts ever stray south of the border down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
And for a tender while I kissed the smile opon her face
For it was Fiesta we were so gay south of the border down Mexico way
And she smiled and she whispered Manana

Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied and I whispered Manana for our tomorrow never came
South of the border I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
And the mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border down Mexico way

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay",South of the Border (Down Mexico Way),1988
Willie Nelson,"If I were a painting
Captured on canvas
Alone in the portrait I would stand
And brush strokes bold
Yet soft as a whisper
The work of a feminine hand

Caught in a still life
Surrounded by shadows
And lost in a background of blue

If I were a painting
My price would be pain
And the artist would have to be you

I imagine the colors
Would all run together
If you ever allowed me to cry
So don't paint the tears
Just let me remember me
Without you in my eyes

It's only the frame
That holds me together
Or else I would be falling apart

If I were a painting
I wouldn't feel
And you wouldn't be breaking my heart",If I Were a Painting,1989
Willie Nelson,"Is the better part over?
Has a ragin' river turned into a stream?
Is the better part over?
Are we down to not quite sayin' what we mean?

And after thinkin' it over
Wouldn't you rather have the endin' nice and clean
Where love remains in all the closing scenes?
If the better part's over

Why hang around
For an endin' that's laden with sorrow?
We've both been around
We've both seen that movie before

And as much as I love you
I can't live while fearin' tomorrow
If the better part's over
Then why should we try anymore?

Is the better part over?
Has a ragin' river turned into a stream?
Is the better part over?

Where love remains in all the closing scenes

Willie Nelson,"I've got a long list of real good reasons
For all the things I've done
I've got a picture in the back of my mind
Of what I've lost and what I've won

I've survived every situation
Knowing when to freeze and when to run
And regret is just a memory written on my brow
And there's nothing I can do about it now.

I've got a wild and a restless spirit
I held my price through every deal
I've seen the fire of a woman's scorned
Turn her heart of gold to steel

I've got the song of the voice inside me
Set to the rhythm of the wheel
And I've been dreaming like a child
Since the cradle broke the bow
And there's nothing I can do about it now.

Running through the changes
Going through the stages
Coming round the corners in my life
Leaving doubt to fate
Staying out too late
Waiting for the moon to say good night

And I could cry for the time I've wasted
But that's a waste of time and tears,
And I know just what I'd change
If went back in time somehow
But there's nothing I can do about it now

Running through the changes
Going through the stages
Coming round the corners in my life
Leaving doubt to fate
Staying out too late
Waiting for the moon to say good night

And I could cry for the time I've wasted
But that's a waste of time and tears
And I know just what I'd change
If went back in time somehow
But there's nothing I can do about it now.

I'm forgiving everything that forgiveness will allow
And there's nothing I can do about it now",Nothing I Can Do About It Now,1989
Willie Nelson,"I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below

They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around
And around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain and I'll be back again
And again and again and again and again",Spirit,1989
Willie Nelson,"It might be in the middle of the afternoon,
Maybe somewhere in the middle of night
I might not be thinking anything at all
And a perfect stranger's face 
Catches a certain light
And my heart jumps
'cause all at once 

There you are
Standing right in front of me
There you are
As lovely as you'll always be
And Here I go 
Back into those memories
Where you are 
Still in love with me.

I know I'll never hold you in my arms again
I know I'll never hear you speak my name.
I look around this lonely room and I can see
Your memory's the only thing that hasn't changed
I close my eyes 
And every time 

There you are
Standing right in front of me.
There you are
As lovely as you'll always be

Willie Nelson,"A long time forgotten are dreams
that just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times
or the bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times
they've had and all the good times to come

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
And through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass through this world hand in hand
This good hearted woman in love with her good timin' man

He likes the night life and bright lights and good timin' friends
And when the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Though she don't understand him but she does the best that she can

She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man

I'm a plan that you didn't lay so well

I'm a voice on a green telephone
I'm a day that lasted so long

I'm a face that fades with the light
I'm a tear that falls out of sight

Willie Nelson,"Mister record man I'm looking for a song I heard today
There was someone blue singing 'bout someone who went away
Just like me his heart was yearning for a love that used to be
It's a lonely song about a lonely man
Like me
There was something about a love that didn't treat him right
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mister record man get this record for me won't you please
It's a lonely song about a lonely man
Like me

I was driving down the highway with the radio turned on
And a man that I heard singing sound so blue and all alone
As I listen to his lonely song I wonder could it be
Could there somewhere be another lonely man
Like me
There was something about a love that didn't treat him right
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mister record man get this record for me, won't you please
It's a lonely song about a lonely man
Like me",Mr. Record Man,1989

But don't ask how long I planned to stay it never it crossed my mind

See that sparrow fly across the cloudy sky
Searching for a hatch of sunlight so am I

Heaven in your eyes

To warn you
Sometimes she lies
But it's your heart
I can't tell you
What to do

Greener pastures now and then

She knows Old Faithful
Will just take her back again

Willie Nelson,"On a Sunday morning sidewalk I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing sure to dying half as lonesome as the sound
On a sleepy city sidewalk Sunday morning coming down

Well I woke up Sunday morning with no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad so I had one more for desert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stair to meet the day
I'd smoke my brain the night before with cigarettes and songs I'd been a picking
But I lit my first and watched the small kid cussin' at a can that he was kicking
Then I crossed the empty street and caught
The Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
And it took me back to something that I'd lost somewhere somehow along the way
On a Sunday morning sidewalk

In the park I saw a daddy with the laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school and listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
Coming down coming down coming down coming down",Sunday Morning Coming Down,1989
Willie Nelson,"If this is a game, we play
And if this is a roll, I play
Where are the words, I say to you
The words don't fit the picture anymore

And if we've been acting all along
And we both act right and we both act wrong
Where does it say that we should cry
It's just the words don't fit the picture anymore, anymore

The words don't fit the picture anymore
No need to force the love scenes anymore

And a one act play comes to an end
And we turn to leave, we can both part friends
But this is the time to say goodbye, goodbye
'Cause the words don't fit the picture anymore, anymore",Words Don't Fit the Picture,1989
Willie Nelson,"If you think
I laugh louder than anyone here
If you think
That my volume's too high

I talk louder than maybe I should
Well I guess, I'm just that kind of guy
But if I talk loud
And laugh loud
You ain't heard it all
You ought to hear me cry

I go home, to a home
Where love's almost gone
Not enough to fill one needle's eye
Then I sit down in a corner
And I turn on the tears
And you ought to hear me cry

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon as only they can

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that as part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note

Its pages worn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table

And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one

I can see us sittin' round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me

Now this old world of ours is filled with trouble
This old world would also better be
If we'd found more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing, rock of ages cleft for me

How their dreams all ended too soon.
Guess they never hung out under the stars,
Howlin' at the moon.
I guess we're as different and nine and eight,
I see it in a different light.
I don't think much about the good ol' days,
Just about the good ol' nights.

Talk about the good times,
Talk about the times when the times were right.
You can keep the good ol' days,
I'll take the good ol' nights.

They wanna go back to when a Cadillac,
Didn't look like a Chevrolet.
It mean't a lot to them but not a thing to me,
I never owned one anyway.
But a good lookin' woman and an old guitar,
With both of them tuned just right.
Well I don't think much about the good ol' days,

Willie Nelson,"Well I grew up lean and hungry
I worked hard for my money
Said I'm gonna live my life the way I please
Spent some time on the road of life
Saw an angel once and the devil twice
I came across some things that I don't need

[Chorus: ]
Like a cold-hearted woman
Whiskey in my water
And only one way out of a motel room
Payments on the Cadillac
And too many questions
And old guitars that won't stay in tune

You know there's good and bad breaks
You learn from your mistakes
It's all in how you handle them do's and don'ts

Wild and stubborn and not much sense
But I've got enough to know what I don't want

Two hours of sleep to make it or bust.
Eight seconds of glory, you stay in the money,
And five year old whiskey to wash down the dust.

That ain't no hill for a couple of climbers,
That's all we ever intended to be.
That ain't no hill for a couple of climbers,
Two old sidewinders like you and me.

Let's find us a place and a couple of ladies.
Someone to lie to, someone to trust.
Someone who's impressed by a couple of outlaws.
Who's gold plated trophies have turned into rust.

Now we're damned near broke, and we keep buying whiskey.
Do you think they might settle for a bottle of wine?
Well those two over there, right there by the jukebox.
Yours don't look back, Hoss, but just look at mine.

And the hand that you're holding means nothing at all

Willie Nelson,"South of the border down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
Now as I wander my thoughts ever stray south of the border down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
And for a tender while I kissed the smile opon her face
For it was Fiesta we were so gay south of the border down Mexico way
And she smiled and she whispered Manana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied and I whispered Manana for our tomorrow never came
South of the border I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
And the mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border down Mexico way

Sometimes when I'm falling, flying, tumbling in turmoil I say this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I say losing love is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart, everybody feels the wind blow
And I'm going to Graceland, in Memphis Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain, some part of me wants to see Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend every love and every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe we all will be received in Graceland

Oh, oh, Graceland, Graceland, I'm going to Graceland",Graceland,1993
Willie Nelson,"There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland
And the bankers are taking my home and my land from me
There's a big achin' hole in my chest now where my heart was
And a hole in the sky where God used to be
There's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland
There's a well where the water's so bitter nobody can drink
Ain't no way to get high and my mouth is so dry that I can't speak
Don't they know that I'm dyin' why's nobody cryin' for me
My American dream fell apart at the seams
You tell me what it means you tell me what it means

There's a home place under fire tonight in a heartland
And bankers are taking the homes and the land away
There's a young boy closin' his eyes tonight in a heartland
Who will wake up a man with some land and a loan he can't pay
His American dream fell apart at the seams
You tell me what it means you tell me what it means
My American dream...

I don't mind the way you talk
But if you touch me somethings got to give

Tomorrow night they could belong to you
The girl move me at their will

Willie Nelson,"They all sat around in a circle laughing and all telling lies
Then the tall one he bumped in a dollar se said boys I've got nothing to hide
The King and the Queen stood together then the ace he would not be to blame
And if the cards were all laid on the table then love could be more than a game
And if the stars didn't shine on the water then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand
And if I were the man you wanted I would not be the man that I am

And I have seen my share of long nights and I have told my share of lies 
And I have run into the darkness when I saw the look in your eyes 
But if the night didn't lie in the darkness then the daylight would be hard to find 
And if the truth didn't turn to a weakness I would have never have spoken my mind 
And if the stars didn't shine on the water...

So if you're going out to Carolina then don't linger in New Mexico
And if you think of the one there behind you then you might not feel so alone
And if the stars didn't shine on the water...
And if I were the man you wanted I would not be the man that I am",If I Were the Man You Wanted,1993
Willie Nelson,"What there was left of us 
Was all covered in dust and thick skin
A half eaten apple or the whole Sistine Chapel
Painted on the head of a pin
A life long love's worth gone up in a smurk 
And you didn't even see her waltz in
Now this love is a ghost having played host 
To the most unoriginal sin

At the wedding we smiled 
As some devil played wild violin
Soon after the chapel she offered me that apple
One bite and I was gone with the wind
And you needed no proof 
'Cause the whole naked truth
Was wearin' only an infidel's grin
And a proud schoolboy's boast of having left his post 
For the most unoriginal sin

Now the jukebox is humming 
All the venial shortcomings of men
Lord I found me this drink that can finally sink
All the skills that I've been wallowing in
Buddy once you get started 
Once true love's departed 
You do it over and over again
So tonight I will toast just whoever comes close
To the most unoriginal sin
So tonight I will toast just whoever comes close
To the most unoriginal sin",The Most Unoriginal Sin,1993

What's going on in your show.

You can get it together by then.

What was it you wanted
You can tell me, I'm back,
We can start it all over
Get it back on the track,
You got my attention,
Go ahead, speak.
What was it you wanted

Was there somebody looking
When you give me that kiss
Someone there in the shadows
Someone that I might have missed?
Is there something you needed,
Something I don't understand.
What was it you wanted,
Do I have it here in my hand?

Whatever you wanted
Slipped out of my mind,
Would you remind me again
If you'd be so kind.
Has the record been breaking,
Did the needle just skip,
Is there somebody waitin',
Was there a slip of the lip?

What was it you wanted
I ain't keepin' score
Are you the same person
That was here before?
Is it something important?
Maybe not.
What was it you wanted?

Did somebody tell you
That you could get it from me,
Is it something that comes natural

Who are you anyway?

Am I getting it wrong,

Willie Nelson,"Riding on the city of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail

All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulled out at Kankakee
And rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
And freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor

And the sons of Pullman Porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rail is all they feel

Good morning, America
How are you?
Say don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the city of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Nighttime on the city of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea

But all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues

Willie Nelson,"I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman,1993
Willie Nelson,"I stood in line and left my name
Took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
Said they'd let me know
I put in my time till the Pocono line
Shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
Now I can't stay there no more

Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
To move some old cars around
Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
Van and do a little settlin' down
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
And the junkyard's a pretty good ways
That job's about a half week old besides
It'd be gone now anyway

Unemployment said I got no more checks
And they showed me to the hall
My brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
A little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
We're headed down into fall

I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
Hustled up a little dough
But I got drunk and I woke up rolled
A couple of months ago
They got my harp and they got my dollar
Them low life so and so's
Harps cost money and I ain't got it
It's my own fault I suppose

The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
Two freights everyday
If it was just me I'd be headed south
But Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
Says we gotta wait and see
In my heart I know it's a little boy
Hope he don't end up like me

Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
Hope she don't break down and cry

Marie she didn't wake up this morning
She didn't even try
She just rolled over and went to heaven
My little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
Caught a Chesapeak on the fly
Marie will know I'm headed south
So's to meet me by and by

Marie will know I'm headed south
So to meet me by and by",Marie,1993

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heaven's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, o'er all the weary world.
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Oh yeah, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1994

I cannot offer you all the clothes that your young body crave

Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The son of god by name

Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

This day is born a Savior
Of virtue, power, and might
So frequently to vanquish all
The friends of Satan quite""

Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding

O tidings of comfort and joy

Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay

Unto the Lord did pray

It's really not the proper thing to do

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss

Willie Nelson,"In the hustle of the day we're all inclined to miss
Little things that mean so much

A word, a smile, and a kiss
When a woman loves a man he's a hero in her eyes
And a hero he can always be if he'll just realise

She may be weary, women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary try a little tenderness

She may be waiting, just anticipating
Things she may never possess
While she's without them, try a little tenderness

It's not just sentimental she has her grief and her care
But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear

You won't regret it, women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy, try a little tenderness

",Try a Little Tenderness,1995

Willie Nelson,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me

Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler Stop!
For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy
Oh what a heartache but I forgive the things you said to me
Cause I believe forgiving is the only way that I'll find peace of mind
And forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time

Willie Nelson,"The red headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a ragin' black stallion
And walkin' behind was a bay

The red headed stranger had eyes like the thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin' his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow haired lady leaned out of her window
An' watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay

But how could she know that this dancin' bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin'
Had ridden when she was his wife

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin' his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow haired lady came down to the tavern
An' looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink, an' he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care

She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
An' laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin' his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

The yellow haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free, of course
For you can't hang a man for killin' a woman
Who's tryin' to steal your horse

This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the ragin' black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin' his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again",Red Headed Stranger,1995

Look down the bar from you

Are you sure that this is where you want to be

You seem in such a hurry to live this kind of life
You've caused so many tears and misery

Look around you, take a good look
And tell me what you see

Don't let my tears persuade you, I had hoped I wouldn't cry

That I'm livin' too fast and they say I can't last much longer

And that I'll find someone to love me someday,
Another to cherish the love you once knew,

The flowers you planted, that rose you loved best
It's soft velvet petals are now closed in death

The summer sun was sinkin' low
There's nothin' but romance, just everywhere you glance
And the native hearts are all a-glow

They all stare like a statue out of stone
And when they realize what's before their eyes
The other girls are left all alone.

Down in the Caribbean, it's not a dream you're seein'
When you get a glimpse of the lady with the charm
But from miles away you can see her sway
To the beat of the Cuban Conga line that forms.

Up in a tree so high, way up in the sky
Sits a wide-eyed monkey on a limb
He wonders why the people go to so much trouble
Just to try to be like him
He doesn't understand, that it's a lady's hand
That makes a heart feel so sublime
But before too long, he starts singing the song
And then he gets in the Conga line.

I've been everywhere.""",I've Been Everywhere,1995
Willie Nelson,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
He said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,
She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

Oh like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.",Bird on a Wire,1995
Willie Nelson,"Each time that I hold you close, here in my arms
I'm building heartaches
Each time that I kiss your lips, so sweet and warm
I'm building heartaches

And when you say you love me
We both know it's a lie
An' just a dream from which I must awake

That each sweet word you tell me
Is a heartache in disguise
So I'm building heartaches

When people ask me what I'm doin', here's what I tell
I'm building heartaches
And each kiss you give me is a tear that hasn't fell
So I'm building heartaches

And when you say you love me
We both know it's a lie
An' just a dream from which I must awake

And each sweet word you tell me
Is a heartache in disguise
So I'm building heartaches",Building Heartaches,1996
Willie Nelson,"One time she loved you
And though you still feel the same
Love is always the loser
When pride plays the game

She would never admit she was wrong
And you just couldn't give in
Now you both are losers
And pride wins again

She would never admit that she was wrong
And you just couldn't give in
Now you both are losers
And pride wins again",Pride Wins Again,1996
Willie Nelson,"This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

He rides the feed lots, clerks in the markets
On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer
And his dreams of tomorrow, surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the 7th when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis Lamour has told us his tale
Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him
And wish to God, we could have ridden his trail

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
The voices sound sad as they're singin' along
Another piece of America's lost

This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year Waltz
