Dana Galen,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2002
Dana Gillespie,"(This is Andy Warhole and it's take one, take one)
It's, it's Warhol actually
(What did I say)
Whole, it's whole as in wholes
(Andy Warhol)
Wah, Andy War hol, Andy War hol (he)
Like whole hub
He
Ha
Are you ready
(Yeah)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise (hm hm hm)
When he wakes up on the sea
He sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall

Can't tell them apart at all",Andy Warhol,1973
Dana Gillespie,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1991
Dana Glover,"There is something that I see
In the way you look at me
There's a smile, there's a truth
In your eyes

But in an unexpected way
On this unexpected day
Could it mean this is where I belong
It is you I have loved all along

It's no more a mystery, it is finally clear to me
You're the home my heart searched for so long
And it is you I have loved all along

There were times I ran to hide
Afraid to show the other side
Alone in the night without you

But I know just who you are
And I know you hold my heart
Finally this is where I belong
And it is you I have loved all along

It's no more a mystery, it is finally clear to me
You're the home my heart searched for so long
It is you I have loved all along

Over and over I'm filled with emotion
Your love rushes through my veins
And I am filled with the sweetest devotion
As I look into your perfect face

It's no more a mystery, it is finally clear to me
You're the home my heart searched for so long
It is you I have loved
It is you I have loved
It is you I have loved all along",It Is You (I Have Loved),2001
Dana Glover,"And you cry
And you cry, baby
And you cry
And you cry...

Dark clouds in the distance
The wind has such persistance
You can feel the teardrops from the sky

Oh God not today
Make it go away
Is there somewhere it can pass on by?

I hate to admit but I know it's true
It's gonna be a long time before I'm over you

You didn't take it easy when you let me down
You didn't let me find a place to fall
But you'll be sorry baby
when I'm not around
You will see you almost had it all

Can I read your letter?
My heart is beating faster
It's as if I didn't know the truth
You said you might regret it
That we should just forget it
You ended saying there was someone new

So hard to believe it but I know it's true
It's gonna be a long time before I'm over you
Better listen dear you're gonna feel it

You didn't take it easy when you let me down
You didn't let me find a place to fall
But you'll be sorry baby when I'm not around
You will see you almost had it all

And you'll cry
And you'll cry, baby
And you'll cry, baby, yeah
And you'll weep for me
And I'll be gone
I'll be gone

Didn't take it easy, no no
Didn't take it easy
Didn't take it easy when you let me down

You didn't let me find a place to fall
But you'll be sorry baby
When I'm not around
You will see you almost had it all
You almost had 
You almost had it all

Didn't take it easy when you let me down
You didn't let me find a place to fall

You will see you almost had it all

Dana Glover,"Carefree is what we claim we wanna be
Free to live the life that we have found
Shame on you and shame on me
It's living when we're laying our lives down

People hear me when I say
No one knows the hour or day
Be prepared to live your way 
When everything could change

Cherish every moment of your life
Don't let the days of good and bad just pass you by
And cherish every moment you're together
Cause you will never know
When your days are gone

Hold onto the ones you love
They're gone, within the twinkle of an eye

People hear me when I say
No on knows the hour or day
Be prepared to live your way

Dana Glover,"Hold on my heart
Remember what you've been through
Be still my song
And let yourself be renewed

You've been here before
So tell me what I must do
Don't lose your way
Cause I'm following after you

And it feels like I'm falling into lullaby
Can't believe what I feel like
Falling into love
I'm falling into love

Why do I smile when there's no one else around
These butterflies well they can't seem to settle down

Feels like I'm falling into lullaby
Can't believe what I feel like
Falling into love

It feels like I'm falling for the first time
I can't believe that its real life
I'm falling into love
O I'm falling in to love

If I am dreaming please let me never awake
La la la la

And it feels like I'm falling into lullaby
Can't believe what I feel like
I'm falling into love
It feels like I'm falling for the first time
I can't believe this love is real
I'm falling into love
I'm falling into love yea

Falling in falling in falling in
I'm falling into love",Falling into Love,2002
Dana Glover,"Where we walk, down the road, everyday
With a plastic smile and we wave like we're in a parade

Oh and then we pass one another
And nothing but a ""how do you do""
Oh but it makes me smile
And we'd stop for awhile 
And just give me the truth now

We can make it real
Open your heart
Cause that's when you start
To truly feel
We can make it real
Look in my eyes 
You feel it inside
Yea I know you will
We can make it real now now
We can make it

Let your mind, take a walk, in the rain
Let you head roll back, touch the joy, remember the pain

'Cause we can talk about the weather
We can weather it together my friend
Yes we can
And the sun will shine on your heart and mine
We will feel it again and again and again

We can make it real
Open your heart
'Cause that's when you start
To truly feel
We can make it real
Look in my eyes
You'll feel it inside
Yea I know you will
We can make it real yea
No we can make it real

This life that we're liven
It's all that we're given
It's all little precious time
'Cause now it's the moment
Let your emotions breathe in the open sky
Fly

We can make it real now
Baby try to make it real
We can make it

Dana Glover,"Here I go climbing a mountain 
It's much too high for me 
And here I go crossing the ocean 
Losing myself, getting lost in the sea 
Where did I go wrong 
When did I stop singing a love song 

Maybe I was wrong 
Maybe I was blind and could not see 
Maybe you were never the one 
Maybe you were not the one for me 
Maybe 

Here I go posing a question 
Not sure of what I'll hear 
Here I go refusing to let you answer 
Until I make myself so very clear 
We can take what was wrong 
We can end these words in a love song 

Maybe if we try 
Maybe we can start again when we've already said good-bye 
Maybe we can still be what we always dreamed that we could be 

And I know that I was wrong to let you go 
But I'm still holding on to let you know 

Maybe I was wrong 
Maybe I was blind and could not see 
Oh but baby I'll be strong 
And I'll sacrifice the very breath I breathe 
If I could only hear you say to me 
When I ask you if you think you still love me 
Maybe",Maybe,2002
Dana Glover,"Rain
Rain 

Rain, Her mother gave her a name on a weary day
24 hours of pain then she gave her away
Into the arms of another family
Into a life of confusion and misery

Rain, day after day in her room where the walls are bare
No dream exist in the eyes of her empty stare
Night after night in her room with no one to care
She lays her head down to cry and whispers a prayer 

Oh whoa

Oh God there must be some mistake 
But no one's ever loved me 
I'd like to believe in you and I try
But I'm just so lonely

Rain 
Rain

Rain, she's got a smile in her heart no one's ever seen
She's got a life in her mind and a crave to dream
She walks alone on her way to a secret place
And fills her soul up with tears
Such a silent space
Oh whoa

Rain, one tennis shoe on the ledge, one in midair
She feels a whisperin' breeze rushing through her hair
She lifts her face to the sky in complete despair
And cries aloud in the night with her very last prayer

Oh God there must be some mistake 
But no one's ever loved me
But if there's something more in my life you can make
Here I am won't you show me

And then the clouds began to roll
And the peace replaced her pain
And on her face and in her soul
She felt the drops of that same, same,

Rain
Pourin' Rain

I need your love to rain down on me

Dana Glover,"Two steps forward, and three steps back
And I don't know where we are
You see it your way, and I see it mine
And we're lost here in the dark

Not just a matter of talking it out
(You know) it don't mean nothing if there's something to hide
And oh, I know you know just what I'm talking about
There's an unspoken hesitation we both feel inside

Am I here, am I gone
Tell me where I belong
All that I need is a reason
Am I wrong, am I right
Are we saying good-bye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause all that I need is a reason

It's complicated, so overrated to say all we need is love
My baby believe me, I wish it was that easy
But sometimes love just isn't enough
This indecision here is wearing me down
I can't hold onto something so undefined
And I, I've got to know if what was lost can be found
This situation's got me crazy, goin' out of my mind

Am I here, am I gone
Tell me where I belong
All that I need is a reason
Am I wrong, am I right
Are we saying good-bye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause all that I need is a reason

And, oh, if you would only just let your feelings flow
I'd be the one who would never let you go, and you'd know and I'd know

All that I need, all that I need from you, all I need, all that I need..

Yeah, tell me where I belong
You know all that I need is a reason
Am I wrong, am I right
Are we saying good-bye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause all that I need, all I really need is a reason

Dana Glover,"Over joy I could cry a thousand tears
Til they'd all run dry
And in your love, I could lose track of the years
The fire intensifies
And, oh I feel your depth of devotion
Pulling me under to the depths of the ocean with you

Your love is like the river
My soul is like the sea
Open and full of waves of emotion
As your love, your love flows into me

In my life most everything will come and go
Life is a season of change
But in my life, it puts a smile on my face to know
That your love, your love, your love remains the same

I can't expect the whole world to stop turning just to listen to me
Besides everybody thinks that a women has got something to say
It's the way it's been it's always been the way

It's a really fine feeling when I'm dreaming of a rainy day
Cause I can hear the words I just can't feel the soul
Said the tides aren't turning but nothing ever seems to change
When I turn the dial the grief still feels the same

Well I guess it's just the way it's got to be
Whose to say I'm the only one living in reality
But there's a melody I'm singing keeps me feeling like a never belong
I'll just sit right here and think all the way

Is anybody feeling what I'm feeling on the radio
Cause I can hear the words but I cant feel the soul
Said the tides aren't turning but nothing ever seems to change
When I turn the dial the groove still feels the same

Well I guess it's just the way, that things will have to be yea

Well what if I could just live in that wonderland
Stevie touches my heart with his hands
Aretha sings about a do right man all night long just for me
That would be the way that it would be

Believe me honey, that money

No complaints

Hand it out

Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

Is the one thing you can't see

They look so stupid, they aren't much fun
Cows aren't fun

They eat to grow, grow to die
Die to be et at the hamburger fry
Cows well done

Nobody thunk it, nobody knew
No one imagined the great cow guru
Cows are one

He hid in the forest, read books with great zeal
He loved Che Guevera, a revolutionary veal
Cow Tse Tongue

He spoke about justice, but nobody stirred
He felt like an outcast, alone in the herd
Cow doldrums

He mooed we must fight, escape or we'll die
Cows gathered around, cause the steaks were so high

Bad cow pun

But then he was captured, stuffed into a crate
Loaded onto a truck, where he rode to his fate
Cows are bummed

He was a scrawny calf, who looked rather woozy
No one suspected he was packing an Uzi
Cows with guns

They came with a needle to stick in his thigh
He kicked for the groin, he pissed in their eye
Cow well hung

Knocked over a tractor and ran for the door
Six gallons of gas flowed out on the floor
Run cows run!

He picked up a bullhorn and jumped up on the hay
We are free roving bovines, we run free today

We will fight for bovine freedom    
And hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die
Cows with guns

They crashed the gate in a great stampede
Tipped over a milk truck, torched all the feed
Cows have fun

Sixty police cars were piled in a heap
Covered in cow pies, covered up deep
Much cow dung

Black smoke rising, darkening the day
Twelve burning McDonalds, have it your way

We will fight for bovine freedom    
And hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die
Cows with guns

The President said ""enough is enough
These uppity cattle, its time to get tough""
Cow dung flung

The newspapers gloated, folks sighed with relief
Tomorrow at noon, they would all be ground beef
Cows on buns

The cows were surrounded, they waited and prayed
They mooed their last moos, 
they chewed their last hay
Cows outgunned

The order was given to turn cows to whoppers

Enforced by the might of ten thousand coppers
But on the horizon surrounding the shoppers
Came the deafening roar of chickens in choppers

We will fight for bovine freedom    
And [E]hold our large heads high           
We will run free with the Buffalo, or die

Dana Robbins,"It's three in the morning
You're nowhere in sight
And all that I wanted was
To be with you
Tonight
I've watched love get closer
And then fade away
I've seen you believe in me
I've seen you trying to stay
But what good is holding on
When you know
That all you can think about 
Is letting go
They say if you love someone
Then set them free
If they come back again
Then in the end
It was meant to be
I thought we were lovers
I thought we were friends
I guess when reality
Steps in
The dreaming ends
We live for the future
We learn from the past
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last
All you can think about
Is letting go
Be true to yourself my love
That's all I ever wanted you to be
Just don't forget to smile
When you think of me
I'll reach for the stars
I have got them in sight
There's someone who really needs me
Out there in the night
We'll live for the future
We'll learn form the past
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last
Why can't they last?

Here among the shadows, beautiful lady, open you heart.
The scene is set, the breezes sing of it,
Can't you get into the swing of it, lady, when do we start?

When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool,
Any dream is permissible in the heart of a fool.
The moon is high and you're so glamorous,
And if I seem over amorous, lady, what can I do?

Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon

You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But some how it's enough

And now we're standing face to face 
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the night you came to me
When so silly girl have set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing your looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I've made up my mind it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn

I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, Oh

Mama mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist ya
Mama mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I missed ya

There's something broken-hearted
New since the day we parted

Darling can't you hear me

Nothing else can save me

How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
Though I try, how can I, carry on
Knowing me Knowing you

Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just had to face it this time,

We're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know
But I had to go
Knowing me, knowing you

It's the best I can do
Take A Chance
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line

Honey I'm still free
Take a chance on me

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?

You think I like this movie
My world is real, I even feel
And I can do without you

Your red bandana too

This is the end for me and you.
Now be a bold vaquero, 
Don`t show your feelings 
I'll cry while you`re disappeared 
Into the night, and dressed in white 
Unchained and free, without me

Go find a sweet senorita 
Somebody meek who never speaks 
Hursly to you

Proud, never bending

Como una canción sin voz 
Como una queriendo ser dos 
Como una luz, que no alumbra 

Así me siento yo y te debo una o dos que se yo, mi voz, 
Trato de escribirle al retrato de tu amor 
Se rompió el cristal pero el marco me atrapó 
No fue una fantasía lo que se fotografió 
Y tú, tantas veces apareces y eres tan real como si estuvieses 
Aún cuando pienso que estás lejos de mi alcance 
Estás en mis sueños o en alguna frase 
Y yo no creo que vuelva a amar otra vez 
Ni que me entregue como a ti me entregué 
Y en mi silencio tu amor se quedó 
Y grito en el vacío una armonía sin voz 
Cada vez que miro hacía el cielo 
Y no veo la luna yo no tengo consuelo 
Sólo un sentimiento de resignación 
Entre los bienes de separación te llevaste mi corazón 

Como un alma, oscura y sombría 
Como una calefacción, que solo enfría 
Como una canción sin voz 
Como una queriendo ser dos 
Como una luz, que no alumbra 

Como pocas respuestas a muchas preguntas 
Como una soledad que asusta 
Como un desespero que me consume por dentro 
Así me siento cuando llego y no te encuentro

Como una calefacción, que solo enfría 
Como en ocasiones quise estar dentro de ti

Para comprender porque la vida giró así

Y que la única vía de salvarlo es el día a día

Contra lo poco de humano que existe en la humanidad 
Donde una blusa escotada borra un amor de verdad 

Una foto al descuido que nunca valió nada 
Y una carta.. Mal redactada 
Puede dejarte viviendo en el dolor y sin valor

De sentirse superior y aprovecharse de la necesidad que hay aquí 
Lo que es verdad, que el vivo vive del bobo, pero yo, oh, oh, oh
No soy un juguete, de los que te entretienen 

Yo no soy un juguete, de los que te entretienen 
Lo que pasa es que respeto pa que me respeten 
No pongas la mente a noventa pa no poner la mía a cien 
Yo necesito de ti pero tu de mí también

Acerca te ven, pero siempre ten bien claro 
De no dirigirte a mi si vas a caer en
Nunca subestimes la inteligencia de ser 
Humano que de pronto por la vueltas de la vida caes bien bajo

Todo fuera bonito 
Si se hablara con la verdad 
Si no existiera uso de poder 
Si existiera hacía donde correr 
Si se respetara el trabajo de los demás 
Si solo dependiera de mí y de mis deseos de crear y de hacer
Pero quien eres tu para escucharme y yo para cambiar lo que está mal 
La comprensión de tí la espero lejos 
Por que tu no estás en mi pellejo 
Pero si hay una cosa que aprendí 
Es el no sobornar mi identidad 
Por que yo soy individual 
Y me gusta el blues y me gusta el reggae y me gusta el rap 

Yo no soy un juguete, de los que te entretienen 
Lo que pasa es que respeto pa que me respeten 
No pongas la mente a noventa pa no poner la mia a cien 
Yo necesito de tí pero tu de mí también

Danay Suarez,"La ultima canción que te escribo es esta
No va con molestia ni con protesta
No espera que un día toque tu puerta
Y puedas entenderla de forma directa
No es para que saques en cuenta tus faltas
Ni para que sepas que conmigo cuentas
No es para que sientas o que no sientas
Cuando ya estén de siesta los días de fiesta
Ahora no importa si te he querido en vano
Y te crei mas grande que un ser humano
Ahora ya no es triste es lindo el pasado
Puedes firmar mil documentos de segunda mano
Esta vez no estaré como estaba
Esta va debido a que la base me agrada
Esta no es recuerdo a la ilusión no lograda
Esta no es en deuda a nada

Took out a photo of an old Romeo
Threw it over his shoulder and rested his hand on my knee

He's have an Adam & Eve and I had a Dixie Julep
Went through an Artillery, Caruso, and a Diamond Fizz
Fallen Angel, Green Dragon, ending with a kiss in the dark

In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend
The evening on my own

As I look around the room

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Dandy Livingstone,"There was a girl, there was a boy
If they had met they might have found a world of joy
But she lived on the morning side of the mountain
And he lived on the twilight side of the hill

They never met, they never kissed
And they will never know what happiness they missed
For she lived on the morning side of the mountain
And he lived on the twilight side of the hill

For love's a rose that never grows
Without the kiss of the morning dew
And every Jack must have a Jill
To know the thrill of a dream that comes true

And you and I are just like they
For all we know our love is just a kiss away
But you are on the morning side of the mountain
And I am on the twilight side of the hill

Dandy Livingstone,"Last night as I got home about a half past ten
There was the woman I thought I knew
In the arms of another man
I kept my cool, I ain't no fool
Let me tell you what happened then
I packed some clothes and I walked out
And I ain't going back again

So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life
You've been many things but most of all a good secretary to me
And it's times like this I feel you've always been close to me
Was I wrong to work nights to try to build a good life
All work and no play has just cost me a wife

[CHORUS]

When a man loves a woman it's hard to understand
That she would find more pleasure in the arms of another man
I never really noticed how sweet you are to me
It just so happens I'm free tonight
Would you like to have dinner with me

Surely I can testify
When life gets you down
You need a true friend around

Whenever I need you you're always there
You near here to listen show me love and give me wisdom
Someone who understands me and cares about my feelings
Girl I love you so and I want you to know

Let's make a vow that we'll keep this together
You are my sister no matter the color
A friend in need is a friend indeed
My sister, my sister you can always count on me

When I seem tossed and drilled
You uplifted me with worship given
Dragged through some things
And I'll forever be your sister in return

I'm here for you and you're here for me
That's how a friendship supposed to be
Come day or night storm some rain or shine
We'll stay side by side for the rest of my life

Let's make a vow that we'll keep this together
You are my sister no matter the color
A friend in need is a friend indeed
My sister, my sister you can always count on me

We will always be best friends
And it's you that I can rely all to let me know
With you by my side and Him as our guide

Danette Williams,"As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Just a sweet young girl in a knockdown world, such a pity
Well she never worried, growin' up in a hurry
No one showed her the right

Out on the street all the people you meet
Wanna use you for your innocent ways
Running around you're the talk of the town today

You were so cool you played by the rules
You thought you had it in the palm of your hand
You're on your way to the top and
They won't let you stop till you're there

Now you're under the gun out on the run
Paying the price with your flesh and your blood
It's bringing you down, bringing you down
Livin' your life under the gun

Under the lights, you're feelin' the bite
Of big city days and big city nights
Now you're alone, you wanna go home, but you can't

You're goin' out of your head, they're in and out of your bed
You're losin' sight of what you thought was the truth
They'll string you along till you're tattered and torn
Then along comes somebody new

Danger Doom,"The Villain ain't rhymin off cred alone
Let him get some cognac, a mic and a headphone
Smoke the mirrors, caught her in the mix
Couldn't read the shorthand for mortars and bricks
If any negative thought linger he let it vent
Wrote this one with his middle finger in wet cement
Did it on the sly
Before he's gone bye bye spit it on the fly
Brush your teeth, rinse and gargle
A true nerd who messed with new words since Boggle
And used slang in Scrabble
Rhymed with a Northern drawl, twang and babble
Flossy pen jargon to break the world record
Do a Faustian bargain and tape the girl naked
More spots than a leopard
Then he had to stop, the block was hot peppered
Shepherd, leading the sheeps out to slaughter
Kept your soul and repped it, everytime he saw ya
Tryin to douse a pinch of weed in a frat street house

I'll make mince meat out of that (beat) mouse!

Welcome to the show
Remember whatever you do, do not boo the flow
Schooled the dumb on the number one rule of thumb
What a fool; still you never met a cooler bum
Give the drummer some rum, I'm sure he could use a shot
Just to get his cues hot, ensure he don't lose his spot
A stranger who speaks to you vocal
Danger made the beat get a freak to do the bogle
No bull, everything he wanted they grabbed and took
Whole lab looked like an ill left jab and hook
Even had a secretary to take the calls
Shake it and make it fall, I told her don't break my balls
Wherever Mouse go, trouble follows
The bounty on this pro was mills and ""double dollars""
Vil's spills muddled flows that befuddle scholars
Thick Buffalo girl with the bubble hollars
She rocked leather and gold, a fat blouse
And need a brother with soul to let her cat out
Even if the rat couldn't compete with Kraus

I'll make mince meat out of that (beat) mouse!

Tap ya toe, grime and strapped for dough
Rap for show, to let the whippersnappers know
Sucks to be them, now pass that loot
Up under the tux he wore a hazmat suit
Sounded like froggy, sip the groggiest of potions
Be up in the party with the foggiest of notions
On the list of lobbyists who save the oceans
Gave his donation to the lady with the lotions
Swoll hand itchin, the old man bitchin
Switchin with the fan with the gold band twitchin
Spittin like a bionic sneeze that freeze vodka
Just to clear the air like the Ionic Breeze Quadra
Sleek enough to outsly a fox
For a chicken pot pie, thinkin outside the box
Enough to taste her goody
But got no time to be wastin chasin putty
Out for Daffy Duck bucks, Porky Pig paper
Bugs Bunny money or Sylvester Cat caper
Offer DAT tape of rap, country or deep house

Somethin' bad ass, like, uhh, I don't know
Like uh, REO Speedwagon or somethin'
Hell yeah

Aiyyo, I know this dude right
Carl, he wore tight blue sweats but wasn't glued too tight
All he had upstairs was a crude light
You think that's weird? He lived next door to a food fight

Howdy Danger, much obliged for the beat god
Even though you still eat lard by the Meatwad
Mesquite charred, speakin' of which or who
Voice all squeaky like they tuned it up a pitch or two

A chunk of burned up witch's brew, get your crew
See if they can't get past the stench of the stew
It stank like a septic tank full of big poo
He mostly only turned into a frank or a igloo

Switch your view to the brother with the fried dreads
Not to be confused with the incense selling Thai heads
His name rhymes with Mike Cock
You could call him livewire, eye sockets, Frylock

Able to shoot electricity through his eyeballs
And blast all through your single sided brick and drywall
More interesting than professional wrestling
When he's online you can find him on instant pestering

What's up with your boy? He's not a soft or hot drink
Whoever don't like it could suck his straw, it's hot pink
On some junk like Gucci on a classy ho
Might splash you in the face with nuclear pistachio

Make a fast break or that'll be the last mistake
That ass'll make, is what you get for messin' with Master Shake
Look out, don't block the screen son, lunge across
Tryin' to watch Adult Swim, Aqua Teen Hunger Force

Rock this cult hymn, sock your mean younger boss
Psht, Adult Swim, Aqua Teen Hunger Force
He often wondered, should he get the logo tatted to his woody?
He could be number one in the hood, gee, easily

Shake callin', he, heh
You know I
I'd just got off the phone with somebody else
And, uh, that wasn't about you

That was about me being upset about something else
I shouldn't have called you but I did 'cause I just
I like you so much, I'm really looking forward
To us working together and just as of now that I'm calm

And after I've apologized profusely, probably too much
I am available, call me doggie",A.T.H.F.,2005
Danger Doom,"Not a lot of bling
When he do the thing, bada boom, bada bing
From the womb to the tomb
Get that ricotta, bada bing, bada boom

Doom, your reputation precedes you
Wail 'til you crack and see what ""weed"" do, you dweeb you
No pun intended, takes one to know one, will know - it's unscented
Yo son, demented when them sent it from the other time
Before everybody and they mother rhyme
What a crime - beats is the same way
Make 'em wanna hit the streets with the heat for a lames pay
Game day, flag on the play, improper helmet
Drag on the suede from the gem drop of well spit
He didn't listen, titty kissing the city glistened
Depending on what from what position you're sitting
In the pissy wind, is this thing whistling?
Who let the spinning whispering jinn in?

The Villain again? Without a doubt
That's his name, don't play it out
Or spray it, when you say it out your mouth
Then gave him a cold shoulder for a hour
And told him take a gold shower, for faking funk, soul power
Stocky, short and cocky
Looked like Apollo Creed after he fought with Rocky
Rhymed in a broken English slang, not cockney
Thirteen, his first queen wore hot knock knees
Had to tell her pops, yo stop cock blocking 'B'	
Hold something for your daily 'ya' habit
Then go, bada-bing-bing-bing like ricochet rabbit
How 'bout the sicko say stab it?
There's liquor in the cabinet and a slicker for the crafted
And Heineken, I told him much obliged friend
What I gotta spend, if I only touch her thighs then?
Why his eyes widened
He didn't know your man had a nice surprise hiding
Took pride in riding in a sly wise guy grin

Real recognize real
On the microphone, the wheels are mechanized steel
Please, at least respect your ideals
How you got her walking along the stroll in high heels?

He said her mama was getting old
God bless her poor soul, now no more drama is your role
Straight to the head
He know a lot of haters can't wait 'til he dead
Lead to go, like a ho, to a strange whack housewife
Only thing he know will change his back do', how trife
Rules is rules, don't go there
Stay on sale like a old coat made of mohair
Keep a snotty chicken on E, the Lone Ranger
Why everybody always picking on Danger?

And Doom, maybe it's him
Called up my lady, told her baby it's slim
Make me up a margarita I need to take a swim
Tell them kids remember school - if they let them out, cool
But get the hell from out the pool

Hey shit head, it's me again!
And you know what? I just heard, IT'S ALL DONE NOW!
And somehow, I guess you must have lost my number
You know what?! You suck!
You suck! Your music sucks!
And i hate your sucky stupid metal face!
I hope you burn, you're going down!
This is the last big mistake, you'll ever make
You suck!!! I hate your guts!...
But, if there is another project in the future please keep me in mind
Thank you",Bada Bing,2005
Danger Doom,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we all lived through the 70's
The clothes, the music, the heartwarming but rarely amusing Ziggy cartoons
Now, later, who are we to look at these two, fine young men
And say, ""You there - I sit in judgment of you!""

For being a drunken lush, and bad as hell
Read the charge and thunk, sunk in in a plush padded cell
Temperpedic Craftmatic adjustable
Go on try to stare at it, it's not that combustible
I accidentally split some kerosene
And dozed off with the L lit, doped up on thorazine
Matter of fact, make mines a double
Few could see the point like a line through the Hubble
Doom hit the eye in the sky with a pie
Shrink said he thinks he believe he could fly
Spread his wings and flap like a goose
He'll show you how to do it if you help him get the straps loose
Diagnosed as shell shocked from totin toast
And still could hear the bells rock Doc, another loading dose
He claimed he couldn't take the racket
Faked his own escape in a eightball straight jacket

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
This, animal, here; this ursine fellow
Unclean!
He rejected society and retreated
To a cave in the woods to plot his vile - nod!

And it isn't true that at these times
He often descends into a delusional state
Sometimes actually adopting another person's persona?

I started punchin' once I saw son lungin'
He had me put on punishment for eating the last Munchkin
So now they got me down here near the dungeon
Nurses all arguin' over who's to do the spongin'
He requested time off for bugged behavior
And rhymed off of thug beats bumped by a neighbor
Who spoke with his fist and kept a mirror with a thumbhole
Cell twelve drumroll, ode to a gum sole
A O.G. like a captain that's retired
Rappers is space cadets yappin' be quiet
And that's an order ship your daughters to my quarters at once
And don't sip the tap water dunce
He is the super, a stranger who talks to you
Maybe even offer tech support and walk you through
Villain, man in the mask, spit in the face
Show him where to go, inside a hand basket case

The defendant's confession!

Uh, nothing further

Mentok commands you to proceed, with your case!

Just since some people, wear a mask
Don't mean.. they.. did nothing automatically

Now wait a second!
Your Honor I'd respectfully like to have a word with you in chambers

I request an immediate dismissal, on the grounds
On grounds that

Your honor I

Don't mean that they did something",Basket Case,2005

Believe me he'll get Bizzy.
When it comes to poetry he's got plenty.

Jump em' in the jump rope, double Dutch
Then turn on the mic with a thumb stroke
Subtle touch, cuddle, clutch, is this thing on
Like the fling with Mrs. King Kong, this spring gone?
Sing a song of slaphappy crappiness
He came to blow like it was strapped to his nappy chest
Surely I jest, the best on a wireless mic not an eye test,
Yet I di-gress
But why stress? Try an' remember when, maybe bit the tender skin-ned babysitter Gwendolyn.
The type to hit and run and go tell a friend
Word to El Muerto cucaracha, exoskeleton
He know, flow, like inter stellar wind,
Tow a rap Jinn, by his toe, into hell again
A-hem, One, two, check me too, loose wreck

Eh, if I may interject?
Rap these days is like a pain up in the neck,
Cornier, and phonier than a play fight,
Take two of these and don't call me on a late night
The beat won't fail me, with more rhymes,
Than times he washed his hands and feet daily
And all that kerosene ain't cheap, Villain been deep
Since a teenage creep, peep
He always was a gentleman,
And kept the pen and a pencil in his mental den
Right there, next to where the Rolodex was
Before it turned up all burnt by his solar plexus
He don't know his own strength, when he's on the bone
It's like the microphones length, and width, ain't it funky like dingy socks?
Feel the full effect off cassette in your Benzie Box.

The super flow with more jokes than Bazooka Joe
A mix between Superfly Snuka and a superhoe
Chew a MC like El Chupa Nibre
Digest a group and sell the poop on eBay

Danger with the vest screamin ""Shoot the DJ!""
Doom clickin over two chickens, three-way
Four in the 5, a cork on the freeway
Villain find a way to make 'em pay whatever we say

State your intentions
""I really love your tape but I hate your inventions""
Very well, what you want, a brownie?
He took off the mask and whispered ""Put me where you found me""

He kept his paper digits in a chunk
Once joined a rap click, midgets into crunk
He did a solo on the oboe
Coulda sold a million then the Villain went for dolo

And cited creative differences
Basically they hated, he left no jaded witnesses
Rappers suck, when they spit I doubt 'em
The crap they sing about you'll wanna slap the fuckin' shit out 'em

Psht - time waits for no man
On a blind date, a love with a slow chrome hand
Judged him by his shoes, hot smelly Brogan
Budged him with the news, called him pot-bellied Conan

No prick barbarian
A strict bear-atarian, a sick pair of merry men
The beat is like a swift kick in the rear end
The stiff dick made her lose her lipstick and hairpin

He said ""Djamn! Act like you know me
Even with the mask on, show me what you owe me""
Tell her brush her grill and wash her face and pussy, homey
Dumile got her like Inuyasha got Kagome

What we have here is a failure to communicate
If you gonna hate, might at least get your rumors straight
About Doom the Great, a lot more confident
Came a long way since the days we had to rhyme for rent

It was time well spent, vented
Spelt and dented, hell-bented and heaven-scented
A wire is dead, he's in it for the cash flow
I'd like to send a big up to Firehead Lazzo

Danger Doom,"Head on straight, mask on crooked
Exit stage left with the cash, gone took it
Off like a koufi, the fit was a bit doofy
He tried to get screwy, with that ""two for you,
One, two for me, G,"" cut the cranky attitude
Wet him like a handkerchief on a stanky fatter dude
Whether you's a rapper or dang sanger
Once you in the zone only one way out, like a gang banger
With a new crew keychain and street name
What set do he claim for fame, peep game
Just to keep feta and stay dip
You need it like a letter or better a getaway whip
This old things rusted, encrusted as the gold rings the old kings busted
Plan to end global starvation and fat her
Now what in tarnation did I go and do that fer?
Stuff happens, like gettin' snuffed for tough tit rappin'
See, I told 'em enough, quit yer yappin'
The same applied to any and all chumps
The only question he had for y'all is how many lumps?
Three or four? either or? mon cheri amour
See, why you need your heater for?
The super villain slid in your party for free
Warn a emcee, get outta here kid, you bother me!

The day I took my mask off my face was missin' for two days
For the record, G, came back a year later, whole new identity
Tony Starks pedigree, my money green like my nickname was celery
Who is Ghost who flashes toast, never wore sheets but bulletproof coats
Oh no! the fans cry for the mask back on
Told 'em ""Ghost is dead, he'll return at the crack of dawn""
Few years from now, him and his pals before the Jetson-era arrived
He'll be back summertime, 2000 and 5, with a half a face iron
The other half water look like alien science
In the summertime, you can see the face boil
But the other side I keep blue with the Penzoil
Mad loyal, when the wintertime come, (what?)
I get stuck 'cause my brain all numb
Like I ate a thousand icee's and frozen Pepsi's
Aquaman's pops can't water-check me, disrespect me, indirectly

Whoa whoa whoa whoa, why is she ""Black"" Debbie?

No, not in a bad way
It's just to tell them apart because she's... black!

True, Doom rolled on through with a whole crew
That stole on you for holding old brew, who told you?
Even if it's crap, mind your own business
They raps ain't got no gift like a lonely Christmas
Real phony with beats that's hardly fresh
How they manage to deal is anybody's guess
Yours is as good as mine, she's sure fine
From the hood where you squeeze your nine off the free cheese line
All you saw was a do a bee's line
To where she stood and sipped the Nehi Grape, the sweet kind
Circle you, thicker by de-sign
Be-hind swingin like bring it back, come rewind
Uhh, excuse me boo
She stuck out her tongue, it was purple number two
FDA approved played it smoother than a doo rag
What a brother gotta do to get a taste a some of you?
Bagged, and he don't mean coach
Then she saw the mask, acted like she seen a roach
The mirror shine reflect colors like your CD's
Show love to others, we all brothers like the Bee Gees
All except the broads and you
Hold your applause, they break God's laws and who pays?
The taxpayer that's who
Catch a rapper by his toe and smack off his tattoos
That's gonna leave a bruise
Leave 'em grievin blues like believin in evening news
They must be eatin glue
Heave it all back, and we even Steven Sue
Sprinkle lyrics like seasoning beef stew
And sneezin all in it after breathin in the flu
Get a clue, his reasoning is askew

Either that or... dude
Leave your girl around this man whore and she's too screwed
Just in case she's in a ""what you wanna do"" mood
Bring your plate to the Metal Face and get your food chewed

Or like a lace eye with you through thick and thin
Raw humor, face pie to a frickin chin
New York'n, a hell of a finer town
Choose your words wisely from the Boogie Down to Chinatown
Or be found with a hole in your designer gown
In the role of public opinion it earned a minor frown
If you think you're slick, you might could wish, but uhh
As a few good men set sights to link with your chick
You have to find a new hen fight to drink your liq'
Ten years later, see how Enzyte'll shrink your... wallet

Cheers, is that your beer kid? Then swallow it
Or get chased by the Sandman, on some Apollo

And a paused beat from my stereo
Rhymes stronger than Popeye with the spinach
Yeah I'm gangster like the frog on Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse
Maybe I'm trippin and it's just a cartoon to you
But I got chills when I heard how Doom flipped the Scooby Doo
And, I might be buggin but it seem to me
That cartoons be realer than reality TV
They inspire my decision to be open and listen
But folks got it all twisted, like a yoga position
Like, in order to spit it dope, you gotta have a criminal past
That's similar to the cast of Different Strokes

I'm an urban entertainer of the hot nights
I don't wanna see no end because it's not right

Compromised his integrity

Bury me in the hood
Never think I'm not cautious, hey
I recognize what a wrong look'll cost us
So inside I'm always nervous
But I never look worried
Come for me
Gun shot flurries in a hurry
Come get me
And be where I perform, stay warm
I'm prepared for the storm
And I brought the heat with me
Lord, please talk to these boys
'Fore I leave they evening spoilt
Put 'em six feet up under the soil
Looking at the roots of trees
Better yet leave they bodies all out in the open so the flies can feed
And when the 'hood get dry I supply the need
Y'all fagot niggas keep it moving honey riding with me
So what ya want?

Fuck y'all then, I'm trying to put some dubs on the road
Then just slide up in the club and try to bubble some hoes
Player, the harder we grind, the further we go
I'm at the point I'm ready to commit a murder to blow
Whatever it takes, I see the nigga holding the case
Look dead in his face, hit the nigga holding the weight
Make his man take me to the crib and go in the safe
Jah done made the reservation so we ready to peel
For real, without no hesitation Nitty bustin' the steel
So what ya what?

Mixed with a little cheese (from Coolie High)

Pardon me a second dude (you better get in line)
Confrontation time, get in line or spit a rhyme
I ain't looking for no beef but I will oblige
I'm kinda quiet but surprise I ain't really shy
Didn't mean to shock you with the real
But niggas know the deal
When I'm up in punk knockers and down in Sugar Hill
Call me Mr Foreverman, can't say I never ran and never will
But when the shells get to flying and I don't got skill
I get ghost then I bounce
Come back and a nigga be ready to throw toast

Ready or not I be lyrical machete that cut
Through bricks and steel 'cause sticks and stones might
Break ya bones
But they won't end the rhetoric
The evidence is in, I'm guilty
'Cause the verdict is my cleverness with pen

To show the privates that they can't follow where generals go
I leave the troops and the battles and the trenches

You have no defenses against my sub tenses
I'm all up in the game and you sidelined on the benches

And faces start to look crazy concerned
They know I'm about to burn baby burn
From the facility
The city'll need a lot of H20
When I'm finished you'll need a place to go
Face the facts
I flow from the brain to the paper to the wax
Back niggas down like automatic gunfire
I perspire when I show a MC how to holla for the have my power locked down
like Rottweiler dogs
Don't be appalled at the crowd just because they applaud
When they lock-jawed but don't follow yours
Yours was only endured for a minute or more
Until I took the floor
And came through with the definitive raw
The textbook definition of ""damn he nice!""
I'm so explosive like bullets bust from ya biscuit
Sometimes my shit is too explicit to risk it
But these idiots love the pain
And they ain't really tryin' to risk it

The baddest born motherfucker ever to pick up a mic
And when I touch the structure
Watch the structure rupture
Clutch ya, might butt ya
Not the type to get down with the baddest
The Jemini status
I'm blunt with the gun so I stomp out ya business
Plus I can dominate ya physical fitness
So witness the Jemini shit comin' from way back
Beef with me chief I throw the blade to ya nutsack for payback
Don't ya try to diss me like a gamer

Of never asking why

Cast down it was heaven sent and
To the church, no intent to repent on my knees
Just to cry

Until you travel to that place you can't come back
Where the last painting's gone and all that's left is black

Grey nights he's coming to me and
Some day they'll punish my deeds and they'll find
All the crimes

But then they ask when they gonna see them
Then they gonna ask to feel the ghosts, the walls, the dreams
We'll I've got mine

At last those coming came and they never looked back
With blinding stars in their eyes but all they saw was black

Fooled them hoping to seem
Like a slave of evil but the product of greed and
It's not a mass so be honest with me
We can't afford to ignore that I'm the disease

And all the doors are locked

But where no one knows
And when Her Highness grows
She shakes me

Gotta set the record straight.
Pretend that I'm alright.
I give in to the night.

She's got me on the edge, I'm slipping.
Try to look away.
But she stares deep down inside me.
And I lose my way, can't fight.
I give in to the night.

So if it's love that she wants.
Love that she's after.
Don't come looking for me.
Cause I'm so far gone.
So if it's love that she wants.
Love that she's after.
Don't come looking for me.
Cause I'm so far gone.

Been exhausted.
I'm so warn out by the games she plays.
Sneaking off.
You leave me hanging.
I won't take that bait.
Can't offer you forgiveness.
Or justify your foolish mistakes.

(So far gone)
(So far gone)
(So far gone)

So drained and falling apart.
Predicted it from the start.
Tried hard to break it.
But I strayed too far away.
Your words, they don't mean a thing.
I stayed despite of the pain.
I'll keep it my distance.
And you'll keep all the blame.

Late call said you were alone
Crying to me about all the things that we said
Apologized for your ways
Said you hadn't slept in days
Said that you need me
And it was just a phrase

So i come back opened my mind
Decided to give you the time
To make it up to me and not turn away
But then again to my surprise
Fooled me once more with your disguise
I should've listened to what my friends had said

All the lies you fed to me
You keep messing with me
You keep messing with me
Promises you never keep
You keep messing with me
You keep messing with me

You said you want me to stay
That I can't leave you no way
But then you run away when
I come knocking on your door
Suddenly want me to leave
Can't stand to be beside me
Used and Abused me
But I won't be coming back no more

Now weeks had passed you left my side
Left all my thoughts of you behind
No use in being miserable or depressed
Sometimes I see you walking by
But never brother to say hi
Don't worry to get caught up this mess again

All the lies you fed to me
You keep messing with me
You keep messing with me
Promises you never keep

Bring me back to where I started
Tell me how I got so lost
Bring me back to days uncharted
Oh won't you to tell me how I got so lost

I've seen a big change, in how I think lately
No signs of sympathy, whoa whoa
Came out and came clean, force fed the enemy
For her tranquility, whoa whoa

Brought me down with her vanity, facile things are destroying me
Completely driven by a deadly obsession
The words slide into her ear, she doesn't listen cause it wasn't clear
Pushed down to the ground, it's an emergency

[Chorus]

She played a huge role in how I've been lately
Stole all my sanity, whoa whoa
Hold tight and kissed me and now I'm completely
Under this certainty, whoa whoa

Maybe love can exist in me, through this girl who I never see
Too many questions that have been left unanswered
Holds me down so I never leave, she holds cards that I've never seen
Pushed down to the ground, it's an emergency

You know? Check it out, like this here 



Verse1(Mac Dre) 

As I get to bustin' 

This introduction 

Of mind corruption 

And rhyme seduction 

I steal and fill brains 

With game and mo' thangs 

Like them dope thangs 

And what that hoe brang 

Creep on Crest streets 

Speak on fresh beats 

Hit the motel, and freak on fresh sheets 

And wet sheets, is the end result 

Been killing long cock since ten years old 

See I blend this old-game with this new 

And ain't no telling what a bitch will do 

Now picture you 

In my position 

Steady getting sweated by the opposition 

Could you handle 

All this scandal 

And keep on stepping like boots and sandals 

My handle, is young Mac Dre 

Silky slim, is my A.K.A 

And you know that bay is my rompin' grounds 

I mean stompin' grounds 

But I like the way Rompin' sounds 

So I'ma keep it 

Romp related 

And if it ain't down with the romp, I hate it 



Verse2(JT the Bigga Figga) 

Well let me jump into the pot with all the hustlers and players 

Chop potatoes with Phillie faders,Knocking niggas with Tre Eights 

But now I 

See my niggas at the spot with the session 

Illegal product 

Then people plotted, rotted with no confessions 

Smith and Wessons 

Demonstrations with Fully Autos, actin' 

Conversations at the lab to keep the trackers trackin' 

Double backin' to the spot where all the money filter 

Keep it on the down low 

You never tell about your scrilla 

On the reala 

I breaks it down in all directions 

It's the Fillmoe players with the O 

and the Crest connection 

All in the session with my folks, You know they got the Dolo 

Hit the gateway tracks, like some fiends in a forward Volvo 

Bought a Bolo 

Seen Kelly, mashed off, and then we hollered 

Trailing Coolio and Mac Dre in a green Impala 

Getting cloudy 

The laboratorys just like a porny 

Got a patient 

Cousin Quinn is making the shit get saramani 

Hella fetti 

We ready, steady, with all the bumbles 

Keeping it real with Dangerous Dame and Mac Mall in this fucking gumbo

Niggas we pull 

Niggas will say so 

We hit the strip from San Jose, to Vallejo 

Make more scrilla by the mouth piece 

Non-talking niggas don't know shit about me 

Ignore 'em like bitches 

Respect 

There ain't a hand out 

Like a sore thumb, fake niggas always stand out 

Player hater prayer 

Praying that I buckle everyday 

Ain't worth five cents, or my knuckles to the face 

But my burners ain't feeling no flesh 

If you niggas want to test 

Let it jump and we could put the shit to rest 

You thinking deeply 

But I be on service like a shark 

Consider me that hate, but see I serve you from the heart 

'cause love loves me 

And hate loves me 

So what the fuck you think? 

You can't fuck with me 

You paying dopefiends, to put 'em to work 

But now your money's gettin' low 

While I be getting low with this wicked flow 

You got at me last night 

but I wasn't asking who was bustin' the trigger 

I'm blowing big bomb smoke, yelling ""Nothin' ass nigga"" 

My pimping ain't soft 

I'm taking no losses 

So why the hell do you persist to put me in crosses? 

You thought it was shackles, but then they was ropes 

And now they're spider webs 

I broke on you hoes 

I know what you're doing before you do it 

Got an outside plan, but in the end you're looking stupid 

Huh, yeah 

'Cause Dangerous Dame got 'em riding on the freeway 

Actions speak louder 

I don't fuck with he say-she say 

Think you got game? 

Never could you have it 

You niggas are crying wolf, while I'll be fucking Jessica Rabbit 

Straight trading places 

But fool this ain't no dream 

You was happy as hell when you had me under your infra red beam 



Once again, get low for the East O 

Add a little recipe to the gumbo 



Verse4(Da Unda Dogg) 

Add me 

Mix me up 

Stir me in the pot with these niggas that fix me up 

See, back in '91, Coolio was the shit 

So now we cooking a batch of gumbo and it ain't gonna quit 

My nigga the Bigga Figga, adding that spice so fool it's saucy 

You bitches thinking you'll eat for free, well this shit is costly 

So back up off me 

And recognize the sound is poppin' 

Beause we steadily droppin' dope, like the keys you coppin'

Resides where once delicate orchids bloomed
No revocation for the damned
Cursed temptations ground to sand
Like a scornful, lustful breed
Dehumanizing virtue for your novelty
Serenade with a swollen tongue
Let no elegy be sung
I am the deep shade of jaded
Will I burn down your fortress of lies?
Six fucking years I have waited
To fucking cut you out of my life
No turning back

I’ve finally let you go and left the past to die
This is my resignation from
All that we’ve loved and left behind
Now I’ll leave it behind

A portrait of torture we paint
Beguiling allure whilst adorned in lace
Eternally the porcelain cracks
A fatal passion forged in black
Like a creature of oddity
A captivating vessel of aesthetic beauty
Dressed in blood to provoke collapse
A fatal heart preserved in wax

I’ve finally let you go and left the past to die
This is my resignation from
All that we’ve loved and left behind
In the grave you dug for me
A frame of bones reside
The flesh has burnt to embers
My muse, this is my last goodbye

Spit you out
Your beauty is bullshit
I was just a corpse you saw fit to drag around
Now your hold on me’s broken
But heaven knows I’m miserable now
No longer your ashtray
To dispose of inside
Fuck your pretty face
This is finally goodbye
I am not your fucking puppet

I’ve finally let you go and left the past to die
This is my resignation from
All that we’ve loved and left behind
In the grave you dug for me
A frame of bones reside
Six years I’ve pissed away
It ends right here, you’re dead to me

pero yo se de un lugar donde brilla el sol,
dejame llevarte este verano donde esta la accion.

¿Qué es esta farsa? Dime ¿quién engaña a quién? 
¿Quién se han creído que somos para tratarnos así? 
Solo se que así no se puede seguir. 

Hay muchas formas para hacerse escuchar 
muchas personas que merecemos la paz 
porque odiar al diferente si no es como los demás 
cuando todos somos gente nada más.

Dani Martín,"Hoy ya no sé dónde,
Guardo tus recuerdos,
Porque siempre el viento los regresa.

Ya sé que el tiempo ha dado su sentencia,
Lo nuestro ya es pasado,
Pero no sé qué hacer.

Con esta soledad
Que me abarca why me ahoga,
Que me lleva a un abismo
Why allí caigo a un espacio en que no hay luz

Con esta soledad,
Buscaré mil razones,
Para un día olvidar que te has ido,
Pero hoy lloraré el vacio,
Que deja tu adiós.

Hice algunas cartas donde esta tu nombre,
Pero de qué valen los intentos
Why hoy con el corazón tan desolado
Sabiendo que te he amado,
Hoy tendre que luchar.

Con esta soledad
Que me abarca why me ahoga,
Que me lleva a un abismo
Why allí caigo a un espacio en que no hay luz

Con esta soledad,
Buscaré mil razones,
Para un día olvidar que te has ido,
Pero hoy lloraré el vacio,
Que deja tu adiós.

Caminaré sin dudar
Why lucharé hasta el final
Why viviré,
Yo se que sonreiré,
Pero hoy que me haré.

Que estas cansado de andar y de andar
Y caminar girando siempre en un lugar

Saber que se puede querer que se pueda
Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera
Pintarse la cara color esperanza

Es mejor perderse que nunca embarcar
Mejor tentarse a dejar de intentar
Aunque ya ves que no es tan fácil empezar

Sé que lo imposible se puede lograr
Que la tristeza algún día se irá
Y así­ será la vida cambia y cambiará

Sentirás que el alma vuela
Por cantar una vez más

Quitarse los miedos sacarlos afuera

Amor que pronunciado en eso se convierte

Que hoy es CERO

Que todo vuelva a empezar
Que todo vuelva a girar
Que todo venga de cero
De cero

Y quiero que todo vuelva a sonar
Que todo vuelva a brillar

Dura lo que dura y ya se fue

La luna junta amigos en el bar 
Y sobran los motivos para festejar 
Recuerdos de un futuro sin tiempo 

Si tu lo crees, lo crearás 
De pronto todo empieza a cambiar 
Todo da vueltas, todo gira y el mundo va 
Empieza y termina sin final 
Da vueltas la vida 
Y si va bien o va mal 
Aquí estaré
Siempre a tu lado para caminar 
Caminar

Todo da vueltas, todo gira y el mundo va 
Empieza y termina sin final 
Da vueltas la vida

Dani Martín,"He trepado a tu ventana
Me instalé un año en tu cama
Mientras escapaba de la tempestad

Te he nombrado en mis canciones
Te hice mil proposiciones
Eran todas indecentes, la verdad

Me he aprendido de memoria Tus 32 escaleras
Y ahora ya no s´w vivir
Ni a tu lado, ni lejos de ti

Me he ganado tus maneras
El olor de tus quimeras 
Y tu corazón difícil de domar

Alma de montaña rusa
La batalla por excusa
Un encanto de desastre natural

He aprendido de memoria tus 32 escaleras
Y ahora ya no sé vivir
Ni a tu lado, ni lejos de ti

Yendo contigo, juego con fuego
Solo disfruto cuando más me quemo
Libra de libro, tus ventoleras
Vienen y van como las mareas

Woah oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh (como las mareas)

Woah oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh (como las mareas)

Declarándonos la guerra
Nos casamos en Las Vegas 
Y entre luces de neón llegó la paz

Subo como cada noche tus 32 escaleras
Y ahora solo sé vivir 
A tu lado, y cerca de ti

Yendo contigo, juego con fuego

Cádiz al fin
Me cruzo unos ojos que rozó
Me miras, te miro, va a ser que sí
Te pareces al del canto del loco
Toda la tarde, Sevilla y Madrid
Nos vamos a un bar que conozco
Vienen amigos ‘Si os queréis venir'
Y miro tu boca y me rompo
Y después, me viniste a ver

Y dormimos, temblamos y huiste al amanecer
Y después, quisiste volver
Porque allí se quedaron tus gafas
Y un poco de tu piel

Ni el momento soñado
Mil movimientos perdidos
Ni el motivo buscado
Solo dos bailarines

Aquí acaba el vals de los locos

Hung up the phone
Raced to his place

Daniel,"Eu nasci num recanto feliz
Bem distante da povoação
Foi ali que eu vivi muitos anos
Com papai mamãe e os irmãos
Nossa casa era uma casa grande
Na encosta de um espigão
Um cercado pra guardar bezerro
E ao lado um grande mangueirão

No quintal tinha um forno de lenha
E um pomar onde as aves cantava
Um coberto pra guardar o pilão
E as traias que papai usava
De manhã eu ia no paiol
Um espiga de milho eu pegava
Debuiava e jogava no chão
Num instante as galinhas juntava

Nosso carro de boi conservado
Quatro juntas de bois de primeira
Quatro cangas, dezesseis cansis
Encostados no pé da figueira
Todo sabado eu ia na vila
Fazer compras para semana inteira
O papai ia gritando com os bois
Eu na frente ia abrindo as porteiras

Nosso sítio que era pequeno
Pelas grandes fazendas cercado
Precisamos vender a propriedade
Para um grande criador de gado
E partimos pra a cidade grande
A saudade partiu ao meu lado
A lavoura virou colonião
E acabou-se meu reino encantado

Hoje ali só existe tres coisas
Que o tempo ainda não deu fim
A tapera velha desabada
E a figueira acenando pra mim
E por ultimo marcou saudade
De um tempo bom que já se foi
Esquecido em baixo da figueira

Escondo meu veneno e me entrego
Com amor e paixão

Sem ela eu me perco 
Fico feito sabiá sem laranjeira 
Sem ela sou bom dia de ressaca
Em dia de segunda-feira

Sem ela sou alguém pela metade
Sou um grito de saudade
Sufocado e sem razão, sem ela
Destruída na maldade
Pela força de um vulcão

Com ela posso ser um colibri
Canarinho ou Bem-Te-Vi
Preso ou livre mundo afora
Com ela sou visita inesperada
Que não tem hora marcada
E nem pressa de ir embora",Essa Moca,2004
Daniel,"Sou o cowboy da madrugada 
Vou viajando pela estrada
O vento sopra meus cabelos
No retrovisor eu vejo os olhos da minha amada

Os faróis vão clareando
Todas curvas do caminho
No tapete de asfalto
Cai a noite nos meus olhos
E pra espantar o sono 
Ligo meu rádio bem alto

Quando a solidão alisa
O meu coração avisa
Penso logo lá em casa 
Pego firme no volante
Piso fundo no possante
O danado cria asas

O meu cavalo de aço
Não reclama do cansaço
Nem derrapa na banguela
Pra lembrar de quem me ama
Deito no meu banco - cama
Vendo o céu pela janela

Quando um companheiro avisa
Que na frente tem polícia
Dou um tempo no motor
Se a saudade dá em cima
Meto o dedo na buzina
Tô voltando meu amor",Cowboy da Madrugada,2004
Daniel,"O certo era nem pensar em voltar
Nem mais te ver
Não te ligar

O certo era a gente nem conversar
Tentar fugir
Nem procurar

Mas quando eu te vejo ainda dói
Se chega de surpresa me corrói inteiro
Eu entro em desespero

Não me lembrava de você sem mim
A gente foi tão feliz
Por quê?

Se eu pudesse escolher
Nunca teria amado você

Mas a chuva não pede pra cair
O sol tem hora certa pra nascer
Será que estava escrito

Daniel,"Dizem que você tem pavio curto
Tá sempre alterada
Eu te entendo
Ninguém gosta de levar desaforo pra casa
Muitos podem te achar ciumenta, louca e possessiva
Eu acho lindo quando de hora em hora você me liga

À noite deixa a luz acesa, acorda tarde
Dorme mais que uma princesa
Eu sei que o sono é bom pra pele
Que dormir faz parte da sua beleza
Conta pra mim suas histórias
E as piadas que ninguém quer ouvir
Pra mim você é interessante e engraçada
Sempre me faz sorrir

Eu quero todos seus defeitos
Eu não tenho preconceito
Eu te vejo com o olhar da paixão
Tudo em você é tão perfeito
Tudo bem que eu sou suspeito
É por você que bate o meu coração

Eu quero todos seus defeitos
Eu respeito, eu te aceito
É o teu beijo que eu desejo
Eu te amo do teu jeito

Ou nada sei

Conhecer as manhas
E as manhãs
O sabor das massas
E das maçãs

É preciso amor
Pra poder pulsar
É preciso paz pra poder sorrir
É preciso a chuva para florir

Penso que cumprir a vida
Seja simplesmente
Compreender a marcha
E ir tocando em frente

Quando a boiada passava e a poeira ia baixando
Eu jogava uma moeda e ele saía pulando
Obrigado boiadeiro

Arriei do meu cavalo num ranchinho à beira chão
Vi uma mulher chorando, quis saber qual a razão
Boiadeiro veio tarde, veja a cruz no estradão
Quem matou o meu filhinho foi um boi sem coração

Lá pras bandas de Ouro Fino levando gado selvagem
Quando passo na porteira até vejo a sua imagem
O seu rangido tão triste mais parece uma mensagem
Daquele rosto trigueiro desejando-me boa viagem

So come in like the day
And chase the dark away

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Varit död i minuter, hela själen var bruten
Blivit jagad av snuten, varit vilsen på djupet
Jag har famlat i mörker, men i dig såg jag ljuset
Och för dig har jag låtsats, och dolt mina tårar
Med dig blir jag mindre, som gubben i lådan
Jag vägrar att inse, du sviker mig alltid
Jag gräver min grav för dig, jag är en soldat för dig

Jag tog en kula för dig, och fick en smula tillbaks
För dig ska jag, göra det tusen gånger om
Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar
För dig ska jag göra det tusen gånger om
Tusen gånger om

Blivit lämnad i staden, medan du gick och blunda
Fick jag kängor mot magen, tills jag smakade gatan
Ändå gick jag tillbaka, och jag måste va galen
Som nyss blivit bedragen, och som tänkte på laget
För jag trängde bort jag-et, och jag såg alla tecken
Men jag ville va bättre, men då blev allting sämre
Jag vägrar att inse, du sviker mig alltid
Jag gräver min grav för dig, jag är en soldat för dig

Jag tog en kula för dig, och fick en smula tillbaks
För dig ska jag, göra det tusen gånger om
Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar
För dig ska jag göra det tusen gånger om
Tusen gånger om

Ställ oss båda på en våg, och snart så flyger du bland stjärnor
Jag bär tyngden utav rymden, ändå finns du i mitt hjärta
Ta mitt skimmer, för jag brinner, du är blott en blek lanterna
Jag har gjort det här så länge, jag kan lika väl fortsätta

Jag tog en kula för dig, och fick en smula tillbaks
För dig ska jag, göra det tusen gånger om
Jag har givit dig allt, och jag har ingenting kvar

That I busted on the day I quit.
But now that I've been drinkin'
I'm out of smokes and I wish that I had it.
Woke up to my daily headache 
And the realization that you are gone.

I was knocked out on the floor
Staring at the floor boards
She kicked me to the floor

I said to myself
""This ain't no way to have fun""
Then she looked me in the eye and said
""Your life has just begun""

Now I want some water, not some whiskey
I want some water in this cup
Don't tell me of your fortunes
Then wish me best of luck

I've seen that face before
In a million magazines
All beauty on the outside
And the inside's just as clean

Then she say ""Love, it's just not enough""
Then she say ""Love, it's just not enough""

Now the telephone's been ringing
And I'm knocking at her door
Standing in the hall she say
""I've seen that face before""

Now I don't want to own her
I just come for some more
No, I don't want to own her
I just come for some more of that

Love, it's just not enough
Love, it's just not enough

Love, it's just not enough
Love, it's just not enough

So when the sky's ain't blue
And stars don't shine
And everything ain't right
You go walking down that hallway
See the girl from paradise

Now you won't want to own her
You'll just sit, you'll want to cry
No, you won't want to own her
You'll just sit and wonder why

Daniel Balavoine,"Comme un fou va jeter à la mer 
Des bouteilles vides et puis espère 
Qu'on pourra lire à travers 
S.O.S. écrit avec de l'air 
Pour te dire que je me sens seul 
Je dessine à l'encre vide 
Un désert 

Et je cours 
Je me raccroche à la vie 
Je me saoule avec le bruit 
Des corps qui m'entourent 
Comme des lianes nouées de tresses 
Sans comprendre la détresse 
Des mots que j'envoie 

Difficile d'appeler au secours 
Quand tant de drames nous oppressent 
Et les larmes nouées de stress 
Étouffent un peu plus les cris d'amour 

De ceux qui sont dans la faiblesse 
Et dans un dernier espoir 
Disparaissent 

Et je cours 
Je me raccroche à la vie 
Je me saoule avec le bruit 
Des corps qui m'entourent 
Comme des lianes nouées de tresses 
Sans comprendre la détresse 
Des mots que j'envoie 

Tous les cris les S.O.S. 
Partent dans les airs 
Dans l'eau laissent une trace 
Dont les écumes font la beauté 
Pris dans leur vaisseau de verre

Mais les vagues les ramènent 
En pierres d'étoile sur les rochers 

Et j'ai ramassé les bouts de verre 
J'ai recollé tous les morceaux 
Tout était clair comme de l'eau 
Contre le passé y a rien à faire 
Il faudrait changer les héros 
Dans un monde où le plus beau 
Reste à faire

Daniel Bedingfield,"Girlfriend, you make my
head start spinning around
And all I can ever hear
is the sound 
Of your heart beating 
in my ears
Girlfriend, this boy has found
another reason to sing
You're reminding 
me of everything
That I hold dear in my heart

Chorus:
And I'm feeling elevated
Lifted to my highest dream
My whole world's revolving
in circles round your heart
You gotta be the one for 
me or else life
makes no sense
So wrap your arms 
around me and
Kiss me till I'm dead

Girlfriend, a girl like you
would take an army to find
How glad I am that you said
you would be mine 
Standing there in the cold,
dark night
Girlfriend, let me take you to
the fields of the sun
How much it means to me
that you are the one
That I hold here in my arms

When your love is falling like the rain
I close my eyes and it falls again
When will I get the chance to say I love you
I pretend that you?re already mine
Then my heart ain?t breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
God, gotta help me get through this

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make it, make it, make it through
Said I?m gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta take my, take my mind off you

Give me just a second and I?ll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn?t break my heart
Give me ?til tomorrow then I?ll be okay
Just another day and then I?ll hold you tight

Daniel Bedingfield,"Tell me I should not be feeling what
I am today
Tell me to silence my heart
Tell me we've been here before
And I will walk away from your love

For there is a wall between you and I
And he hasn't been treating you right
I've been watching it all
I've seen you cry
And I just gotta tell you tonight

That he don't love you like I love you
Don't think about you like I think about you
He don't want to have your children
He don't want to build his life around you

Tell me this love's just a feeling and
will pass away
Tell me your heart is a liar
Tell me you're not what I know you are
All that a man could desire
And he doesn't know
Darling, what he's got
But I would treasure you
If you give me a chance
I will make you smile
I will give you a love that's true
But he don't love you like I love you...

So why can you not see
This place in your heart that was
made for me
Why must you hide yourself away
And why must you fight
The way that I'm holding your hand tonight
Take a chance and give your heart to me

Honest questions in my heart this hour
Opening like a flower
To the rain?
And do you know the silent sorrow
Of a never ending journey
Through the pain

Do you see a brighter day for me?
Another day?
A day?
Do you wonder what's in store for me?
The cure for me?
The way?

Oh look down see the tears I've cried
Lives I've lived
The deaths I've died
You died them too
And all for me

And you say (faded)

""I will pour my water down
Upon a thirsty barren land
And streams will flow from the dust of
Your bruised and broken soul
You will grow like the grass 
Upon the fertile plains of Asia
You will grow, You will grow""

Do you know
The story from the start?
And do you know me
Like you've always told me?
Do you see
The whispers in my heart against your kindness
My eternal blindness
Do you see?

Do you see a brighter day for me?
Another day?
A day?

I should play my hand all cool and calm

And though I can't be with you tonight,
You know my heart is by your side

I don't understand,

Daniel Bedingfield,"She was all that I could ask for
I could see it in her eyes, And her smile told me
That I was on her mind, And you should have seen the way
That she looked at me across the room
I could see her thinking, man that boy is fine

Do ya know she's tryin' to fool ya
I know what she's doin' to ya, She loves me more than you
Ya, ya know she wants me, Do ya think I'd lose her to ya
But you don't get that, do ya
You know she's nothing to ya, She wants me

So what makes you think a girl like her could fall in love with you
When a guy like me has everything she needs
Well, I don't believe you understand, The power of my game
You just got to know that girl is into me

They're just some things that love brings

And you will never learn till you get burned
Till your burned by the flame

Nothing hurts so bad
Nothing hurts so much
No nothing, hurts, like love 

So you gave all you had
How this story turned so sad
Nothing left but the tears in your eyes
You die inside, cause

There's a mirror showing me the ugly truth
These bones they ache with holy fire

Every little thing's gonna be alright
Every little thing's gonna be alright [x2]

There's no-one else to blame

Baigner dans du liquide
Je n’ai pas cru d’abord
En mon chagrin
D’autant que je ne pleure
Plus jamais
Mais en fouillant
Juste un peu plus
J’ai trouvé des motifs
Bien assortis
Et des raisons plus qu’intéressantes
Pour comprendre ce qui m’arrive

C’est qu’il ne m’arrive plus rien
Tous les jours de mon âge m’ont endormi
Jamais plus rien
Plus de voyages, presque plus d’amis
C’est très restreint
En termes de loisirs et de plaisirs

Alors dans ce miroir
Trop grand pour moi
J’ai vu ma bouche
Dessiner un sourire
Je n’ai surtout pas cru
En ma deuxième chance
D’autant que je ne gagne
Jamais à rien
Mais en y songeant
Juste un peu plus
Et sachant que ça fera mal
J’ai décidé de changer
Que peut-il se produire de pire
Que rien?

Et je crois que tout arrive
Que tout vient
À qui sait mourir
Pour mieux revivre
Ce n’est pas sans peine
Je crois qu’on revient mieux
Après le deuil de soi-même
Que tout vient
À qui sait mourir
Pour mieux revivre
Ce n’est pas sans peine
Je crois qu’on revient mieux
Après le départ de soi-même
Que tout vient
À qui sait mourir
Pour mieux revivre",Revivre,2002

Un sac à main ouvert

Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón",La Última Curda [Tango],2002
Daniel Block,"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
Shes everything on this earth to me.

Hey hey hey, what a beautiful day

Hi hi hi, beautiful Sunday
This is my my my beautiful day
When you said said said said that you loved me
Oh my my my its a beautiful day

Birds are singing, you by my side

Daniel Boucher,"Je suis parti, j’étais toute jeunesse
Gagner ma vie et me faire un métier
À mes parents j’avais fait la promesse
De revenir aussitôt fortuné
J’ai vu de loin s’effacer mon village
Midi sonnant, je ne l’entendis pas
Car je marchais vers des mirages
Qui grandissaient à chacun de mes pas
Car je marchais vers des mirages
Qui grandissaient à chacun de mes pas

Me suis trouvé marchant de ville en ville
Bien peu d’amis, beaucoup de compagnons
Le verre plein, l’amitié est facile
On est tout seul quand on en voit le fond
D’où c’est qu’tu viens, comment c’est qu’tu t’appelles?
Norbert? Une bière – Armand, moi, j’prends du fort
Moi, j’lave les vitres – Moi, la vaisselle
Mes compagnons m’ont appelé Tit-Nor
Moi, j’lave les vitres – Moi, la vaisselle
Mes compagnons m’ont appelé Tit-Nor

Tous ces métiers qui sont fils de misère
Je les ai faits et je m’en suis défait
On est chômeur quand on veut pas les faire
Quand on les perd, on est… comme on était
C’est pas au bout des balais pis des pelles
Que la fortune advient le plus souvent
Les gros qui l’ont couchent pas loin d’elle
Les autres sont feuilles d’automne au vent
Les gros qui l’ont couchent pas loin d’elle
Les autres sont feuilles d’automne au vent

Ah! si j’avais été d’amour naïve
J’aurais pris femme et j’aurais des enfants
Maison, voiture, comme ceux qui arrivent
Je serais seul, mais seul moins… seulement
Mais trop d’argent met l’amour en doutance
Et pas assez l’éloigne à tout jamais
J’ai dépensé mon existence
Avant d’gagner l’coeur de celle que j’aimais
J’ai dépensé mon existence
Avant d’gagner l’coeur de celle que j’aimais

Trois jours passés, me suis mis de voyage
Pour retrouver mes parents, mes amis
Pour mes parents, c’est au bout du village
Au cimetière où la mort les a mis
Mais mon oreille et ma vue sont surprises
On voit personne et tout est désâmé
Un chien perdu sort de l’église
Et j’ai compris: mon village a fermé
Un chien perdu sort de l’église
Et j’ai compris: mon village a fermé

J’sus donc monté m’informer chez Narcisse
Qui a refusé d’bouger du cinquième rang
Fallut fermer par loi de la justice
De la justice et des gouvernements
A-t-il fallu travailler sur nos terres
Tant essoucher et piler les cailloux
Pour découvrir chez un notaire
Qu’au bout d’nos vies on n’était pas chez nous
Pour découvrir chez le notaire
Qu’au bout d’nos vies on n’était pas chez nous

J’ai ben pensé m’installer dans la place
Passer la nuit, brailler su’ un perron
Sauver l’église avant qu’elle se défasse
Et réparer la meilleure maison
Je deviendrais mon propre locataire
Je deviendrais mon propre médecin
Bedeau, curé, marchand et maire
Mon propre ami et mon propre voisin
Bedeau, curé, marchand et maire
Mon propre ami et mon propre voisin

Comme en prison à la grandeur du monde
Je m’en irai comme j’étais venu
Je n’attends pas que quelqu’un me réponde
Le désespoir est jamais bienvenu
Pour mes pareils tourmentés de voyage
Mon triste sort leur serve de leçon
Ne quittez pas votre village
Si vous n’avez pas une grande instruction
Ne quittez pas votre village
Si vous n’avez pas une grande instruction

Faut donc r’partir, mais plus toute jeunesse
Gagner ma vie, n’importe quel métier
Moi qui faisais dans le temps des promesses
De grand retour aussitôt fortuné
Je vois souvent apparaître un village
J’entends midi quand il ne sonne pas
Marchant toujours vers mes mirages
Qui se défont à chacun de mes pas
Marchant toujours vers mes mirages
Qui se défont à chacun de mes pas",Tit-Nor,2011

For my Valentine

Oh to only me

But that's just a start

I'd give you my heart

Daniel Carillo,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2001
Daniel Carwile,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone

Back in 1992, bababadabababadabababada

It was two years after New kids hit the charts
Six years after Madonna stole my heart
It was TLC on the radio and
""Stop-Hammer time""

Chilli peppers sure could rock
And Kidies made the covers with the help of a sock
I turned down sports for Faith No More
While Slash fed his snakes with blonds from the tour
Bababadabababadabababada

Jeremy spoke in the class today
When the smell of our youth got portrayed
By the man with the voice and pain inside
Ah, fuck that shit, rest his soul, never mind
In my shoes there were room to grow
So I got real high after a pumpkins show
Sure as hell I miss my past
And when I think of it now I smile relaxed

[Chorus]
We listened to ""Would?"" and made out in the car
I took the shit when you dad found out
You were my first and you gave me your heart
Alle I gave you mine...It was 1992

Bababadabababadabababada

And I learned all the songs on cheap guitar
And sat in my room and I looked at the stars
Wondering if wedder had lost it for real
And if Miss Sharon Stone wore panties in the scene

It all made sense with Body Count
The first one to speak were the words came out
And I sang along to ""It's a shame about Ray""
When I found you-I got laid, I got laid

[Chorus]

Back in 1992

I don’t think I know
Though everyone’s set
Got it on deadlines
Like an astrological sign
Where will you go?
My friend the ghost
You seem down
But I’m here to tell you
That it’s not so bad
Cause, no one really knows how it ends
So, we’ll just see how it plays for us friends
Cause, it’s just all a matter of setting off to the sun
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
Watch as the sun tries to burn
Our eyes
And we’ll laugh cause we’ll all be blind
We’ll be blind
Claiming for clearer sight
And going on
Oh, sorry to stop
I’m quite problematic with talking to people
Though school has helped me
Quite a bit and my friend
You’re the hint
But we have to move on
It’s such a pain, that I cannot bear
So I leave it to you
To the tears, Oh curse you,
Destiny
Cause when I look into the cracks
At everything broken in past
Well, it’s just all a matter off
Playing off to the sun
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
Watch as the sun tries to burn
Our eyes
And we’ll laugh cause we’ll all be blind
We’ll be blind, we’ll be blind……….
Oh so we set sail
But do I have the boats
To till these gardens
Oh I’m sure we’ll be glorious
As we set off to the sun
I don’t want things to end
On such cliché rhymes my friend
I don’t want to go
I am a creep
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
Watch as the sun tries to burn
Our eyes
And we’ll laugh cause we’ll all be blind,
We’ll be blind, we’ll be blind……….
To be blind
Out of the past, out of the dark
To the light
Watch as the sun tries to burn

And we’ll laugh cause we’ll all be blind,

Daniel Correa,"You can call me whatever you like
Doesn’t change the groove of tonight
The guitar’s syncopated rhythm is so so tight
I’m dancing to this funky beat
So girls, guys, and those in between
Can all get down with me and
We’ll show them what we mean
Gonna shake it, shake it
Break it
Cause We’re On Fire,
Shaking things up
Cause it’s time to get down
Time to do your thing
(Fire)
Don’t let them shut you up
Time to throw things back loud
Time for things to change
You can call me whatever you like
Doesn’t change who I am on the inside
Made of cheese, organs, and carbon
But there’s no set list
I could be summed by
Some man in a white suit
Telling me what to do
Cause I may be an invention
But at least I was the inventor
Making my own trends
But I’m not a setter
Cause We’re On Fire,
Shaking things up
Cause it’s time to get down
Time to do your thing
(Fire)
Don’t let them shut you up
Time to throw things back loud
Time for things to change
(Fire)
Time to throw things back loud
Time for things to change
(Fire)
Let’s just shake things up
Cause it’s time to get down
Time to do your thing
(Fire)
Don’t let them break you, love
Just cause they don’t know how
to dance like human beings
Move to the left
Move to the right
Do a little shimmy
Now walk that tightrope
In the words of the Electric Lady
Whether you’re high or low
You don’t even have to listen to me
I lack that reliability
Being an upper class kid in the pop stream
But I’ll try to use it in the best way
To say that
Gender is an idea, it’s a concept
The bathrooms are merely suggestions
And to say there are only two options
Is to limit the human definition
And her name was Leelah
And you shouldn’t forget her
As we groove tonight, together,
Alright, alright, alright
We’re On Fire, shaking things up
Cause it’s time to get down
Time to do your thing
Don’t let them break you, love
Time to throw things back loud
Time for things to change
(Fire)
Let’s just shake things up
Cause it’s time to get down
Time to do your thing

Daniel Day-Lewis,"I would like to be here, I would like
To be there,
I would like to everywhere at once.
I know that's a contradiction in terms,
And it's a problem, especially when
My body's clearing forty as my mind is 
Nearing ten.

I can hardly stay up, and I can't get to 
Sleep,
And I don't want to wake tomorrow
Morning
At the bottom of some heap,
But why take it so seriously?
After all, there's nothing at 
Stake here-only me.

I want to be young, and I want to be
Old.
I would like to be wise before my time
And yet be foolish and brash and bold.
I would like the universe to get down
On it's knees
And say, ""Guido, whatever you please,
It's okay. Even if it's impossible, we'll
Arrange it.""
That's all that I want.

I am lusting for more. Should I settle 
For less?
I ask you, what's a good thing for, if 
Not for taking it to excess?
One limitation I dearly regret,
There's only one of me I've ever met.

I would like to have another me to
Travel along with myself.
I would even like to be able to sing a 
Duet with myself.

I would like to be here (Sing along
With myself in a song)
To be there (Walking down a lane now,
Everywhere)
Everywhere (Everywhere. That's a 
Contradiction in terms. I want to)
Here (With a counter-)
Here (Melody in the)
Here (Top of the morning to you, Guido)
Guido (Guido)
Guido (Guido)
Guido (Me)
Me (Me).

I want to be Proust or the Marquis De 
Sade,
I would like to be Christ, Mohammed,
Buddha
But not have to believe in God,
And you know I mean it with all of my
Heart.
It's the end if something important
Doesn't start.

I want to be young, but I have to be 
Old.
What I want is a tale of sound and 
Fury
That some idiot went and told.
I would like the universe to get down
On it's knees
And say, ""Guido, whatever you please, 
It's okay.
Even if it's ridiculous, we'll arrange it.""
So arrange it!

Arrange it!

That's all that I want!",Guido's Song,2009
Daniel De Bourg,"I was always on top of love
I knew what I had was enough
But that was long before you
And I, thought nothing could hold me down
Just me and myself from hanging out
That was my life without you

You came and changed everything
Took me from fall to spring
Degraded by love, for you il do anything

So I let go, can't say no
You got me on foot patrol
With you I believe anything you need
You just gotta say so
When I'm with you, its hard to, keep myself under control
Its alright I'm on the other side of love
You got me on foot patrol

Yer I've made some mistakes in my life
But I never stopped to think twice
And that's what you showed me
For the first time, now when I close my eyes
I see my vision to survive
Now I can't live without you

You came and changed everything
Took me from fall to spring
Degraded by love, for you il do anything

So I let go, can't say no
You got me on foot patrol
With you I believe anything you need
You just gotta say so
When I'm with you, its hard to, keep myself under control
Its alright I'm on the other side of love
You got me on foot patrol

'cause the loves so strong
I feel like nothing can be wrong
Your heart is mine and I dedicate this song
To you for life, I ain't gonna strive
I'm under control and I can't let go
So I just wanna say thanks to Daniel for lettin me share my love out on thii track 'cause he knows, and anybody else that's in my situation, just let your loved one know.

Daniel de los Reyes,"The emotion it was, electric
And the stars, they all aligned
I knew I had to make my, decision
But I never made the time
No, I never made the time

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home

Exoneration lost his, eraser
But my forgiver found the sun
And there are twisted days that I take comfort
Cause I'm not the only one
No, I'm not the only one

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home

There is a majesty at my doorstep
There is a little boy in her arms
Now we'll parade around without game plans
Obligations, or alarm

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer

Daniel de los Reyes,"It's getting close to sundown over the Sierra
Stranded on the freeway burning with desire
She was on the sidewalk looking for a night light
We talked about the real things
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Is filling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a rag top
Take away my pain

[Chorus]
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
Move across the night
Like a separate wind

Pulled up to a motel
""Vacancy"" was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settle on the hood
Wrap your arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumble in the twilight
And fell onto the floor
Loving Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door

[Chorus]

When your hopes and dreams
Lose the will to go
Joyride
Reaching for the light
Knowing we can't win

There's something in the distance
A glorious existence
A simple celebration
A place you've never been before
Tell me that you wanna go

Reaching for the light
Knowing we can't win

When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride

All your hopes and dreams
All you need to know

Just seek and you will find
That when the world turns cold and almost gray
I can be the one to hold you and show you the way

And I'll be your light
I'm shining in the darkest night
I'll take you to a higher place burnin' so bright
I'll be the song that moves you when all hope is gone
That gives you the strength to carry on
I'm burnin' so bright
I'll be your light

Burnin' bright
Burnin' bright
Burnin' bright

Burnin' bright so you'll see
I can be who you need
Give you faith to believe

And I'll be your light
I'm shining in the darkest night
I'll take you to a higher place burnin' so bright
I'll be the song that moves you when all hope is gone
Gives you strength to carry on
Burnin so bright
I'll be your light

I'll be the light
Gives you strength to carry on
Burnin' so bright

Daniel Dyer,"Hey man come on over here 
Let me play some of nothin' for your ears.
Well I sat down and listened to him 
Say love keeps getting in the way.
How many times will I fall in love with a girl that was my friend 
You see love is a hole in the middle of my heart
Like a well that has no end
And I said...

[Chorus:]
Oh yeah I know what you mean 
Cause a friend in love is a friend in need 
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh yeah I know what you mean

Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
She said hey man come on lets go 
Let me tell you about something that you don't know.
Well I paced the floor and listened to her say 
Love keeps getting in the way. 
How many times will I fall in love with a boy who was my friend 
You see love is a pole that blocks the door with a key
The boy can't lend and I said.

[Chorus]

And I tried to find some reason why I know our love is better 
But I've been sinkin', I've been sinkin'.
Well I tried to find a corner in my mind leave it all behind 
But I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'.
We can put it all together babe, we've got plenty of time 
I remember sittin' 'neath the stars, talkin' 'bout love in a broken down car. 
He said what are we gonna do we've lost our way 
And love keeps gettin' in the way. 
Well I replied to the question on his face 
Said love's not a time or convenient place. 
You got rocks in you're shoes you gotta fly if its love 
There is no question why he said.

Daniel Dyer,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again),2003

Got your head hung low
Your skies' a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake away

'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive!

I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way

No more living in those shadows
You and me we know how that goes

'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same

We'll be the light that's turning 
Bottle up and keep on shining

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

That you are mine

To see you smile

Here inside my dream

That angels breathe
And that love will live on and never leave

Daniel Gildenlöw,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.
The truth is the truth.
That's all you can do is live with it.",Repentance,2007

Reviens, reviens si tu le veux un jour
Reviens, reviens pour moi c'est toi l'amour.

Qui a duré jusqu'au petit matin

Reviens, reviens si tu le veux un jour
Reviens, reviens pour moi c'est toi l'amour.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Daniel Hiribarrondo,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1990
Daniel Ho,"I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii
I want to be with all the kanes and wahines that I knew long ago
I can hear old guitars a playing, on the beach at Hoonaunau
I can hear the Hawaiians saying ""Komomai no kaua ika hale welakahao""
It won't be long 'til my ship will be sailing back to Kona
A grand old place that's always fair to see
I'm just a little Hawaiian and a homeside Island boy
I want to go back to my fish and poi
I want to go back to my little grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii
Where the Humuhumu, Nukunuku a puaa goes swimming by

Daniel Humair,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1962
Daniel Humair,"Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous; he answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
She feels neglected, and he's suspected
Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone 'most every night
He doesn't phone her; he doesn't write
He says he's busy, but she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge right into jail""
You'd better keep her; I think it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee

You'd better keep her
I know it's cheaper
Than makin' whoopee",Makin' Whoopee,1962
Daniel Humair,"Chillun', listen here to me
This is my philosophy
To see me through the day
To scare my cares away

All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
All God's Chillun got swing
Maybe haven't got money
Maybe haven't got shoes
All God's Chillun Got Rhythm
For to push away the blues
Yeah !

All God's Chillun got trouble
Trouble don't mean a thing
When they start to go ho ho ho de ho
Troubles bound to go 'way, say!

All God's Chillun Got Swing.

Daniel Humair,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
 
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Daniel Humair,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1997
Daniel Humair,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1997
Daniel Humair,"We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your vein is as lifeless as yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance
We don't exist
We are nothing but shadow and mist
In the mirror we look as we pass
No reflection's revealed in the glass
Don't you know that the blood in your veinis as lifeless as yesterday's rain?
It's a game where we come to conceal the confusion we feel
But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless
You cried when we kissedIt was nothing but shadow and mist
Two illusions who touch in a trancemaking love not by choice but by chance 
To a theme that we tore from the past to a tango we swore was the last
We are shadows who dance
We are shadows who dance",Last Tango in Paris,1999
