Hard 2 Obtain,"A G.D. about five three
with the hunky-dorey type of smell goods on
with the Timb boots and the hoodie yea troop
constitute that the chick really got it goin on
At this right time, she can get sentimental
but never too good to puff a blunt with my people
She can even tap my brew when it comes around and holsters
with my crew, my Ghetto Diamond is elite Boo
Hah, an hourglass, can't really see that ass
cause she got a pair of baggy jeans on, Au-ZI
Look at honey go with those bangle earrings
Please Shorty put me on, cause...
""Lovin you!  Is easy cause you're beautiful, and
 ah doo-doo do-doo!""  Peace to all my G.D.'s
Check it out

Chorus: H2O

A G.D., what?  A G.D... what?
A Ghetto Diamond is a man's best friend
(repeat 4X)

To tell the truth, she's pure like juice
I'm slick like Rick James, and Bustin Loose
about her big, pretty brown eyes
Hourglass figure, and shapely thighs
That ain't the half, breath so sweet
Full figured calves and her sexy feet
From toe to head, from the darkest meat
to the bones that's red, and I repeat
Hourglass figure, and I'm on beat
To my chicks and my niggaz, in the street
And that's where we stay so we can compete
From the tips of her nails, to the depths of her
my man, and my crew, hell
A Ghetto Diamond

""To the most beautiful black woman of the hour""

Chorus

A Shorty doo-wop, with the Nike high-top
Scully pulled down so you can't see her eyes Hobb
A Diamond in the rough that likes to puff the stuff
who get her head on straight, so she don't hang too tough
Once in a while, she might play the block
Not a Gangsta Bitch, cause she don't have a Glock
Not that nothing's wrong with that
but the Ghetto Diamonds I fuck with they don't carry gats
They leave the bustin to me
She might drive the getaway car if I so choose G
But we ain't with that, the shit is detrimental
I'd rather have a honey with a slammin ass mental
So peep the drama, come here little mama
with your Bulls hat tipped and your pants saggin Palmer
To all my Ghetto Diamonds blows up with the ep
I'd like to say peace to the massive, and the crazy fat asses
Huh, you know what?  A Ghetto Diamond is a man's best friend

Chorus to fade",Ghetto Diamond,1994

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Hard Knocks,"You claim you're still bitter
but I got the raw end of the deal

[ VERSE 1: Hardhead ]
I heard the expression 'a dog is a man's best friend'
But I grew up thinkin it was a woman
But I had to learn the hard way
Never thought I'd see the day I'd be sleepin on the subway
But that's the path she chose
The next day I arose still kickin the same clothes
I had to make a decision
Even though I lost her my friends still gave me recognition
Bein recognized by the guys
Wasn't a surprise, you see, cause they're my homies
And with them I get nuff respect (nuff respect)
When I was down they were there
When I didn't have, they were more than happy to share
Inside I feel the pains trapped
I don't feel she dissed me but I feel I got a bum rap
The guys knew what I was thinkin of
The only thing to cure an old love was a new love

A ghetto love

[ VERSE 2: Hardhead ]
It's 3 o'clock, I'm hungry and I'm cold
I want to call her but she's even changed area codes
Was it that bad, what I did?
To hell with it, I go to my man's crib
Oh, his name is Bezo
The type of power only friendship could bestow
I ring his bell and he's alarmed
And I'm greeted in with open arms
The next day, a different routine
I'm caught drinkin on a public scene
I'm callin my homies to come get me
Cause I know down they never let me
Free as a bird, once again I'm chillin
My homies ain't rich, but to me they're top-billin
Over, over again they've proven
Not even a jail cell can separate a real friend
It seems that our love as a crew gets better and better
We stick as a posse like a stamp to a letter
What's theirs is mines, what's mines is theirs
Cause in this ghetto love game we play fair
I'm unspoiled by success
Even though God's blessed they're still not impressed
The way they once treated me they still treat me
It's nothin different now cause I'm makin a little money
Like when we hang, rumbles still continue
Puttin heads out is still on our menu
We'll go to war in a heartbeat
And I never went to war and they ran out and left me
We're all about one for all and all for one
And if it's more than one you better have more than one gun
The only sleep that outlasts love is death
And we'll hang until one of us takes the last breath
How close can a clan of man be?
That one partner's pain is his posse's mysery?
We say they come a dime a dozen
But I've been turned on by my own so-called cousins
Is the blood we shed really thicker than water?
If it is, then maybe you oughta

Witness
A ghetto love

I'ma always have my homies
They gon' see me in the cold, or hunger
or just out there driftin, whatever
All my homies around the way in the South Bronx
Jason, Shawn, my man Jim-Jim, the whole posse
Those who I miss, you know who you are
[Name], Bezo, Lucky
The official crew, y'all know
The same crew that always goes through
the rain and the shine

Hard Knox,"I am eternal, the ruler of the earth and sky
I am infernal, I am on a quest to see the heavens die
My fascination with the dead
Won't be fulfilled here on this killing spree

And when they dream that's when my spirit arise
And when they scream a little part of them dies
I find my way into the minds of the weak
They are led astray, it's now my path that they seek

You die before me
Your destiny is in my hands
You are soon to see
My one desire is to rule this world eternally

And when they dream that's when my spirit arise
And when they scream a little part of them dies
I find my way into the minds of the weak
They are led astray, it's now my path that they seek

You will never reach me, I am the darkest one
You will never heal me, a mind beyond repair
I will make you fear me, I slay your hopes and dreams
You're lost forever in this world of mine
I devastate your life and crush your every dream

No human being will perceive your silent scream
The king of rapture will betray your soul tonight
The life of yours is soon to end in brutal death
Don't look me in the eyes if you are awake
Just a glimpse of me will put your life at stake

I am the horizon, I am the serpent of the dead
My gaze will burn your skin and flesh into a crisp

Like fire, like fire

This very morbid mind of mine
Will set your course into and early grave
I twist your fate and seal your doom
I bid you welcome, my eternal slave",Fire Like This,1997

And have a drink and do whatever made us feel alright
We'd stay out all weekend

That weren't enough for you
You'd go out Monday too
And Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday 'till it all caught up with you

We all went out one night
You got us in a fight
You owed some money
To a monkey who had seen you right

You sold your furniture
So you could pay him off
They cut the power
Can't afford it you slept on the floor

You can't hold down a job
So then you had to rob
First from your mom and then your friends and then the local shop
But as a criminal

You're just no good at all
You got your collar felt
So dumb, you thought about skipping bail
Now you're in jail

You loved to watch the sky
And you get beat and injured
End up throwing up all night

You could not take no more
So when they closed the door
Tied up your sheets - strang yourself up
And then you were no more, no more

Every day I,I,I see your face
As I walk on by past that awful place
23 hours in a cell
Each and every day just locked up living hell, living hell, living hell

When you treat me like you do
And you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?

I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard your words
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?

Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They will turn away no more

And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes
I'd be a heavenly person today

And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?

Now I stand here waiting

I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me, how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?

And when they scream a little part of them dies

You will never heal me, a mind beyond repair
I will make you fear me, I slay your hopes and dreams
You're lost forever in this world of mine
I devastate your life and crush your every dream

No human being will perceive your silent scream
The king of rapture will betray your soul tonight
The life of yours is soon to end in brutal death
Don't look me in the eyes if you are awake
Just a glimpse of me will put your life at stake

I am the horizon, I am the serpent of the dead
My gaze will burn your skin and flesh into a crisp

Hardwell,"I remember how we used to be free
Listen to nothing but our fears
Hop to the sound of our own run speed
Oh we locked ourselves away and tied up the beast
But we're only waiting for the moment to break free
Can you hear my heart howl at the sky?
It's the wolf that I keep deep inside
I've been holding back but tonight
Tonight we run wild!
Tonight we run wild
Tonight we run wild
Tonight we run wild
Tonight we run wild
There is no deny in what we're made of
See how your eyes reflect the moon
Feel how your instincts become blurred to love
Oh 'cause you can try your best to keep in the crown
But it's only waiting for the moment to break out
Can you hear my heart howl at the sky?
It's the wolf that I keep deep inside
I've been holding back but tonight
Tonight we run wild!

They all end the same - a nosedive endeavor

But angels did fly and flooded boats sailed
To rescue my heart and pull out every nail
Things don't seem right since I've fallen

I'm falling like rain for everything about you
I find myself chained - thinking I'm coming loose
It's everything about you

A deep devotion has washed on our sands
Took hold of our hands and guides us forever
Holy water that some of us brave
They're poetic slaves - drowned by their conscience

Angels did fly - the loneliness fails
To capture my heart and push in every nail
Things turn out right since I've fallen

Harem Scarem,"I stand before you
Accused of many crimes
But I want to believe
That love can still survive

You don't have to say it,
I don't have to read your mind
To know the emptiness
That's finally arrived

How was I,
To know the right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken,
So where did I go wrong?

Tell me honestly
If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!

Words will have more meaning,
If they're said at certain times
Now the all they've seen
I found to be a lie

How would you know it,
You won't give me sometime
To see if everything could work out,
And you'll be mine

Oh, will love be lost forever
But someday I will find
The world we've all been searching for
Or just some peace of mind..

Tell me honestly
If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!

Tell me honestly
If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!

All the night I sit and wonder
Must be more to laugh, I'm sure that
Days and years gone by while I am
Living with the..
Oh, lonely feeling

If you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes, honestly!

Harem Scarem,"It's only life
I remind myself each day
If only I could remember what I'm doing in a room

Because it takes away the sound
And alters the voices that tell me to do
What I do
They're worried that I'll want to kill

Without my pills
And they knew that I'd do
What I do
One more try

To step inside my brain

I won't have anyone to blame,I won't have anyone at all

With a little love, I keep holding onto you forever
With a little love, we can see it through together

For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours
And today in the mail I received a short little note
And I'd broke down inside at the message that her mother's wrote
Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They knew that she loved me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love goodbye my sweet Mary Ann
[ ac.guitar ]
The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then
In the papers I read of the far away places she's been
I can't eat I can't sleep for over and over again
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann
Mary Ann regrets...
[ ac.guitar ]
My Mary had died too sad she just wasted away
If I'd've been her I know she'd be living today
For we loved each other and if they had left us alone
Today she'd be wearing my ring not a blanket of stone

Every once in a while there's someone whose life is like a comet flashin' across the sky
Men of great talent with things to tell us
And it seems like all too soon those kinds seem to die
Now Stephen Foster was one of these gifted people
He's down to earth songs turned the whole world on
But then like most people who are sent here on a mission
All too soon young Stephen was gone
A little more time a little more time oh the songs he might have wrote
Tender words and pretty notes with only a little more time
Another man I feel was sent here on a mission was John F Kennedy
A man loved and respected by I guess just about everyone
And I suppose we were all guilty of takin' him for granted
His love for humanity and the many fine things that he done
Now he wanted this to be a better world but all too soon this great man died
And as we gathered around our radios that afternoon
The whole world stopped a little while and it cried
A little more time a little more time so much to do so little done
But the victory's he might have won with only a little more time
And looking back down the pages of history
The greatest influence for good there ever was Jesus
And his spite of all the obstacles in his path
Look at the legacy of hope that you gave us
And as I look around me at those who live by his teachings
And bless the day of his birth
I can't help but feel this would be a whole lot better world

So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store
From their vast mysterious sky
I'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
Chances are some heavenly star-spangled night
We'll find out just as sure as we live

Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give
Something's gotta give

Fight, fight, fight it with all of your might
Chances are that some heavenly star-spangled night

Yo  just think if you could rewind time 

And start your life all over again 

What would you give and what would you keep? 

You heard me  what would you keep? 



[Loon] 

Yo  yo  if I could go back  I wouldn'ta sold no crack 

Wouldn'ta never put my hands around no gat 

But you know Loon  bein' all hard headed 

And don't listen  even if God said it 

I didn't have to stick with folks that sniff no coke 

I didn't have to fix the block when shit was broke 

Same cats I helped was twistin' smoke 

Now imagine if I went to school, went to class 

'Stead of bein' a young cat sent to blast 

Sent to slash criminal's necks in half 

For playin' dumb when I come to collect my cash 

And 'cause of that cats will respect my past, I ain't playin' 



[Shyne] 

If I start from scratch I'd sign with Def Jam 

Nah, fuck am I saying? Puff's the best man 

Plus I'mma Bad Boy, I'm more like a bad man 

Put mo' nigga's in pits than Brad, man 

Can't dodge bullets? Too bad, man 

Shit, I'd a copped the five instead of the six 

That way wouldn't of crashed and killed my cousin 

Keep quiet instead of having the industry buzzin' 

Do a devil's advocate style, don't let 'em see you comin' 

Use the revolver when bustin' and sluggin' 

That way no evidence 

But fuck it, got money to be tried, worse come to worse 

Who God bless, no man curse, hatin' niggas, lay in the dirt 



[Mase & Meeno] 

Yo, if you could start your life from scratch (What? What?) 

Rewind time and still go back (It's time to eat) 

What would you change in the way that you live today 

And what would you leave right where it's at? 



If you could start your life from scratch (What? What?)

And what would you leave right where it's at? 

Come on, come on 



[Meeno] 

Yo, if I could start life from scratch, I wouldn't change shit 

Same gun, same clip, same dumb bitch 

All Out, Harlem World, same old clique 

Same old studio, same old shit 

Shit don't change just because a cop took six to the brain 

Meeno got a lawyer, man I'm hip to the game 

You could find a gun, but if my prints ain't on that thing 

What is you sayin'? 

And on the same block that I get my glocks from 

You see the same cop that get popped with the shot gun 

(Mysonne: Mysonne) 

And at the same bodega I got my tops from 

(Mysonne: Mysonne) 

I give the same old money to the same cop's bum 



[Mysonne] 

If I could start from scratch, I'd bring daddy back 

And put five in the first cat that show mami crack 

I sit back and listen to them drunks on the block 

Tryin' to school me with jewels, tellin' me who to watch 

I killed five people, I'd let survive 

And the five I took away, I'd a left alive 

If I could do all it again I'd bring Virg' back 

Or I switch places with him, I hope you heard that 

I would have preferred that, I ain't have to starve 

Pitch crack, have to rob and catch a charge 

And I'd do it all again if I had to 

Pitch no-win to win, and I'd be glad to 

And I'd hit every target I took aim at 

But I'd still be a problem, you can't change that 

I'm a problem 



[Mase] 

Yo, if you could start your life from scratch (Uh)

And what would you leave right where it's at? 

Come on, come on 



[Mase] 

Yo, 'cause half the cats that flip, we all was cool 

And half the chicks I hit, they teased me in school 

I got a baby by a lady I don't even love a lot 

Wish I wore three rubbers 'case the first rubber popped 

But you can't cry now, milk already spilt 

I had eleven friends and ten already killed 

Went down south and I ain't feel the guilt 

And I ain't ready to war but that ain't the way built 

And for all the nights and all the fights 

That I had for all this money over all these dice 

All my cars and homes and all my ice 

If I could do it all again, I'd do it all for Christ 

Whoever thought the limelight or the super-stardom 

Whoever thought there'd be a problem comin' through Harlem 

Can't even chill, cats want to make me a villain 

Cats that I grew up with I gotta contemplate killin' 

Nobody love me, I'm my own mister, and on my own, mister 

Mama did what she could but now I'm grown, mister 

Though she told me once, wish she'd told me then 

Though I'm the youngest, I'mma grow to be the oldest man 

And cats thinkin' they gon' win 'cause they veterans 

Ain't about age at this stage, man with the most cheddar win 

How you live right? Every day get in bigger sin 

How you say no at the door screamin' ""Let me in""? 

From the outside it's lookin' gooder than it ever been 

But tell the truth, when I was broke it was better then

You help me change my name from Vasquez to your name
Take me to your domain
Trick, you must be out yo' brain
She said it's no game, my pops got tons of cocaine
And you could have some if you get me on your plane

Caught his first bid dealin' with narcotics
And had Daytons and always kept 'em polished 
You taught me about khakis and Converse
And if a foo' try to move then you ball first, feel me?

Knowin' she wild, the condoms, she havin' my child 
Now that I'm stuck, she can't keep scratchin' my truck 
Actin' all young, doing it in front of our son 
Peeped it before, but didn't want to think she's a whore 
Thinkin' it's good, fuckin' up her rep in the 'Hood 
Fuckin' up mine, fuckin' niggas two at a time 
But look at her now, Harlem World quicker to town 
But look at my rhyme, better it didn't turn into crumb

Where was you when shorty turned two? 
Tell me what whould you do if the baby caught the flu 
You ain't even got a clue, if you do, tell me how to pursue 
But you quick to get hyper, come mess up my cypher 
No dough for no diapers, so why should I like ya? 
And you never cared before, so why should we care that you now see 74?

Yo  only got twelve bars so let me cut to the chase 
Fuckin' wit' Stase  I caught a buck in the face 
I got the set me up  everybody's drinkin' Henney 
Kid named Timmy actin' friendly 
Grabbed her by offending  sure 
Hurt 'cause his game didn't work 
He didn't know the alcohol's about to get him merc 
He tried to french kiss her 
Yo  that's my man twin sister 
Swung on him  but he threw the toaste in my ear 
I shoulda known he had people posted in here 
So I waited 'till the coast was clear 
And when he walked off, I put four in his rear, yeah, yeah 
[Stase] 
Yo, Hud is the type, give him an inch? He takin' a yard 
'cause see, he the type of cat that be thinkin' he hard 
I told him if he gonna come, he got ta come by eight 
But Hud don't never listen what I say 
He always do it his way, instead of our way 
That's why he always caught up in some damn foul play 
Talkin' 'bout I said at nine, he killin' time 
And he ain't checked the time on his wrist 
He probably somewhere lying to a chick 
Talkin' 'bout he rich, no, it ain't right 
How he gon' leave my big brother Mase and jell overnight 
He wouldn't sell us out or yell us out 
But messin' wit' Hud, we ain't even get to bail him out 
[Cardan] 
I can't believe this nigga Hud tried to blame it on me 
We on the I-95, three jars on my seat 
I'm hopin' cops don't be prejudiced, if not we don't eat 
You know what that mean, shut up Hud, keep drivin' the jeep 
We got about ten miles, we don' did ten states 
I shoulda stayed, knowing Hud? He gon' gas you to stay 
I'm tellin' Hud, yo, pull over we ain't pissed since Penn State 
The windows all foggy, plus we got temp plates 
Now Hud steady streetin', not listenin' and yappin' 
Smokin' Buddah straight from Cuba, 'bout to wish this ain't happen 
I ain't tryin' to point no fingers but it's all Hud's fault 
If he wasn't speedin' wit' no weed we woulda never got caught

Cardie, when you gon' grow up? You need to get chips 
Stack dough up, switch your flow up, 'cause your single was a donut

And Mase, that's your twin, tell her stay out my face 
And Loon, that's my man but he floss too much 
He want to hang out, 'bout, but he cost too much 
And Meeno, that's my dog, but he talk too much 
And Blink, fake pretty boy, soft as butt

For a pretty face, a slim waist, sweet perfume 
Can't believe this shit 
Second week in June, second night in Cancun 
Pop Cris' by the full moon and the stars is bright 
Pray to God that I catch me a slide tonight 
But of course, Loon gets drunk then starts to floss 
Runnin' his yap 'bout the same chick he toss 
Same chick from tour, all I got was jaw

Why your block hotter than a nuclear warhead 
You more fed 'cause my pockets are stacked up 
While you spend most of your day baggin' your cracks up 
You fat fuck

And don't come around forty and front and get tapped up 
Cracked up, can't wait 'till this album is wrapped up

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Changing colours in the haze

I run the rap game like a ol' D boy

I can rock gator boots an' wear K Swiss
Put the diamonds on my pinky, watch on my wrist
I'll tell you like this, the G's gon' sag
Wit some real freem in my bag
An' it goes like this, like this

Into my destiny, now I see
Was once confused by these haters in this cold society
Now maybe I'm wrong about the way I fluc
But the game been so real to me
I can't help but get my skrill

I'm in the wind, 600 Benz up in the traffic
My rims, reals girls in, it's like magic, it's drastic
Tryin' to live the life that I live
I rap P.I. an' stay high as I need

I'm a factor, brought in a rapper, I'm from the game
Legit is the name, the mo' skrilla the fame
In the train, all in Seattle where it rains
You can buy my slang, I'm from the Bay, mayne

A rap star piece, I'm a beast on the mic
It's ten, I'll creep up in by midnight
You can check my rap site, B-Legit.com
An' it tell you that, “Yo boy, he the bomb”
An' it goes like this, like this

Into my destiny, now I see
Was once confused by these haters in this cold society
Now maybe I'm wrong about the way I fluc
But the game been so real to me
I can't help but get my skrill

Make way, a brand new day, so peep the boss
It's true when I come through, so tear it off
It cost, so we all kick it an' ball
An' talk about the platinum an' gold on the wall

I'm a savage, ain't nobody bad like me
Got people from the Bay all the way to D.C.
Ask the boy R P an' K R E D
About a hog, out the valley named Legitimate B

I'm a mac, I rap on special request
Call me Superman without the cape an' the 'S'
I'm from the hillside an' plan to hold that down
So let me know when you fools hit the westbound

I'm feelin' like I got the whole world in my hands
Gator boots on the feet for the limpin'
Sophisticated, high classy
If you gonna have it, have it lavish

Into my destiny, now I see
Was once confused by these haters in this cold society
Now maybe I'm wrong about the way I fluc
But the game been so real to me
I can't help but get my skrill

Where am I?
I smell fire.
Who got that fire? Fire.

I don't smoke that brown. Al Capone.
I don't like that shit.
I don't like that shit.
I need fire, who got fire?

Real pimp.
Yo nigga.
It's yo nigga.
Roll something up.

Smokin'.
Roll something up.
Lets get to flowin'.
(Go herd).

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I'm at the licker store gettin? more blunts for the skunk.
Hit the block in the chev I got thump in the trunk.
Feeling good off the wood in the hood and I'm fizz ?em.
Kind of annoyed they always trying to take a boy back to prison.

They hate to see a playa, employ yourself.
They hate to see a playa, enjoy yourself.
When I'm (side ?) want a ride, then playa lets go.
I'm 29 with many rimes and love at soul.

I'm a ho, Bust it raw with the words I serve.
Every tape I make baby learns the words.
Young Mac Dre, got to give to get.
Hate a reasy who give easy like she look at some zags.

I'm on the celli telli trying to get some roll from Nelly.
Need it very smelly, fitin to go chunk for the telli.
It's on, fitin to go blow a zone to the dome.
Tone Capone got the bong in this bomb weed song.

[Chorus]
Fire.
Puffin' the smoke in the air. Blowin' it big like a playa playa.
Fire.
Cheech and Chong on a spree. Blowin' it big, come smoke with me.
Fire.
Puffin' the smoke in the air. Blowin' it big like a playa playa.
Fire.
Cheech and Chong on a spree. Blowin' it big, come smoke with me.

[Verse 2: Young leech]
Every day in the life as G (Westside) we be trifling and we,
Are likely to see niggaz ain't likin' me.
Them pimped out gangsta-ism tactics,
Spinnin' all over my gun like a blacksmith.

Them bitches belligerent actor, see the chiropractor.
But I crack yeah neck, back to the scene.
Blow 'em to smithereens like the things I done seen.
In my everyday smoking out ritual, regular ooh thing.

Walking down the street with a gangsta limp and demon jeans.
Me and some squalls, and smile (bling, bling).
I just want to lean.
Why I don't chugalug this 40.

Then jump in block park homie for the block smok-ie.
With the O-G, Mac Dre, kill-a Cali parlay, parlay.
Smoking the ounce of that bomb bay every day.
Puffin' the smoke in the air. Blowin? it big like a playa playa.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I need narcotics, that goo-e and stanky.
When I ain't got it, I'm moody and cranky.
What the dilly, what's really, what's down that filly?
We can old school with a zag, blow bags in the dilly?

Is you silly? Never throw the dubbe away.
Lace no dank when you're blowin? with Dre.
Trying to cope with this stress, so I blow big.
How can the bulletproof vest protect my wig?

See them cutthoat fools, done changed the roles.
The public got it twisted and we blame the news.
Got game for fools,
'Cause I hang with fools,

That got game to use,
And maintain the roles.
Keep it real dog, but represent what's rite.
Be a real hog when you bless the mic.

Smoke big live long, and get yo pringles.
Young Learch and Mac Dre making hit rap singles.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Mac Dre talking over Chorus]
Killea.
Rapper gone bad.
Smoking them big gads.
Uh.

Keep it bouncing.
I told 'em, can't hold 'em. 2000.
Feel it bitch. Yeah.

[Young Learch] 
Wicked Learch if you didn't know and Mac Dre.
Playa playa!
And that broke you. Yeah.
My nigga Snipes off in the building.

Out that fillin'.
That new millennium shit.
Tone Capone pass the bong it's on my nigga. Yeah.
They can't fuck with this.

	I've been down
	For oh so long
	Starin at these prison walls

I want you to...
Step in my 150s for a minute
Step in my shoes
Walk in my shoes
Yeah
Just want you to see things like how I see em
You know
This's for all my niggas out there
Check it out

Bottom bunk, sleepin in a 2 man cell
C.O. at my do', and I'm mad as hell
Punk police cowboy from Texas
Talkin some shit bout servin breakfast
It's 5:15, he must be psycho
Or just plain stupid for thinkin I might go
I cussed him out, he gave me distance
And pressed his body alarm for quick assistance
Now these muthafuckas want to do it the rough way
Five C.O.'s is what it takes to cuff Dre
Straight to the hole, but it ain't no thang
My celly got dank, so I'm cool & The Gang
See the lt. for the disposition
28 days commissary restriction
2 days later back on the main line
Dopefiend's dose, so I go claim mine
25 cartons, now I'm straight
Keep 17, and the homeboys 8
Cop some hop, start back boomin
Got em sendin money on the Western Union
2 fat gramms of that china white
Gon' have these dopefiends tryin to fight
Grabbed 3 cartons to coop some dank
And 5 whole packs for some hoops to drink
Now I'm chillin in my cell lookin out the window
Drinkin pruno, smokin indo
Grabbed my shank, but when I'm finsta bounce
They lock a nigga down for resistance counts
Look at Jack Brooks while I'm waitin
Might even do a little masturbatin
Trippin off that bitch Dominique
I bust one quick while my celly sleep
Doors rack open, now it's time for movement
Goddamn pruno got a nigga too bent
Bounce to the movies with my homies
The title sound good, but the shit was phoney
Damn cigarettes won't let me breathe
Niggas gettin restless, wantin to leave
The lights flash on, quick as fuck
Somebody in the bathroom just got stuck
If he makes it, he'll be lucky
Six inch blade stuck straight in gutry
25 cops rush the spot
Now I got one-time on my jock
Stash my shank underneath the seat
And make sure no blood is on my feet
Punk police want to take me down
They put me on the wall and they shake me down
Now it's back to the block strapless
But I got two mo' in my matress
One mo' time I peep the cops
Fuckin with them boys from Great Street, Watts
I said, ""Punk muthafucka, won't you leave em the hell alone""
Down to the 3rd and got on the telephone
Called my bitch, but she showed me no love
Got on the phone, shot me a cold dove
She said she can't talk, she got a sore throat
But she probably gettin fucked by a sport coat
I'm goin through it

Yeah
y'all real niggas know

Yeah muthafucka
I done been there and back boy
I could tell you the story from rags to riches
How I did time with fags and snitches

These streets will swallow you up mayne, and eat you alive
Can't be no poodle, run tuck your tail and hide
They'll spaghetti your noodle, mayne, element of surprise
It's going around mayne, death in the air
Better not be scared cause hyenas can smell fear
There's not a lot of love but it's a whole lot of hate
Beware of your surroundings they're starving they ain't ate

Whatever money that I get to (Whatcha livin?)

In the fastlane (x8)

Looking up with greenbacks on your mind is a good sign
My name ringing like a high school bell, like a church chime
This ain't chameleon, but go get a glass of wine
Listen to me preach my rhyme, sit back and recline
I'm too real to be unreal, too truthful to be fake
Daddy and mommy went they're separate ways when I was eight
But it made me great, more stronger and god-willing
A few years later, I'm worth a few million
Top billing, killing em' with my independent grip
Got rid of my digital scale and started making hits
Flipping all kinds of whips, Benzes, Cutlass, and Lexus's
Me and the clique of St. Charles, god was blessing us
Successfulness, all praises due to Allah
Jesus, Jahova, the most highest almighty god
Reverend Thurman and Mother Thurman, I miss you much
I know you up in heaven watching over us
If I can help people, that's what they taught me to do
Can't save the world, but I can help save a few
People talk behind my back, laugh and smiled all in my face
Said my voice was too squeaky and my style was a disgrace
Now I'm hittin', they ain't laughin' all the way to the bank
Making deposits and promoting my own track
Backing with my nose in the air, like my shit don't stank
Came in the game blindfolded, stressin', guessin', walking the plank

Já sinto falta do teu cheiro, teu abraço
Tentei de tudo já não sei mas o que faço
Nas noites frias, preciso do teu calor

Por que fez assim?
Me abandonando sem me dar explicação
Será que não percebe, magoou meu coração
Sem motivo algum, interrompendo uma linda paixão

Meu amor
Eu não sei o que fazer
Eu não sei se te procuro
Ou se tento te esquecer

Eu não sei como o cupido me flechou
Eu só sei que estou apaixonado
E enlouquecendo de amor

Um amor tratado como fruto de um sentimento
Quem não teve aguarde, pois terá o seu momento
Seu momento, Seu momento
De amar

Quando me pego parado
Fico ate me perguntando
De onde será que vem o sentimento soberano?
Que a gente não consegue controlar",Meus Sentimentos,1999

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots

Remain to love until they droop and die

Harmonious Wail,"I know she's a tracker
Any style that would back her
They say she's a chooser
But I just can't refuse her
She was just there, but then she can't be here no more

And as my mind unwheels
I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives

She's been down in the dunes
And she's dealt with the goons
Now she drinks from a bitter cup
I'm trying to get her to give it up
She was just here, I fear she can't be there no more

It's long, long when she's gone
I get weary holding on
Now I'm coldly fading fast
I don't think I'm gonna last very much longer

She's stoned said the Swede, and the moon calf agreed
I'm like a viper in shock with my eyes in the clock
She was just there somewhere and here I am again
And as my mind unweaves, I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives",Unfaithful Servant,2008

Here at the end of all things
I am the on that you lived for
And the one that you killed

Don't you remember my words now
Here at the turn of the tide
I am the one that you clinged to
I heard your call every night

Am I too blind to see to trust in these words
Am I too numb to feel what will become of me

Don't turn away the path before you all clear
Don't turn away one thought and nothing is lost
Don't turn away from me now

I weep over you when you cry
It is a thorn in my side
But if I lead will you follow
Me to the end of the times

Am I too blind to see to trust in these words
Am I too numb to feel what will become of me

Don't turn away the path before you lies all clear
Don't turn away one thought and nothing is lost

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust, label us ""Notorious""
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sitting here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I been through!
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick 'cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your Gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga: die slowly
I'mma tell you like a nigga told me
Cash rules everything around me
Shit lyrically, niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke
Cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself loving it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer, me or you?

7 A.M., woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough, so pop a couple of doze

Nigga Dean, deep in my temple and not to get
Sentimentally steamed with my
Instrumelody, and heated
Especially for your team
And a .45, indeed, will beam
In between the scenes. Destroy your dreams
You willing to die? we'll see
How many flee when I 'cause the scene
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs
Trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spitting fire
This the real truth, bitch
Breaking out for lies
My Messiahs better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child
The one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now. Contender never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends, hey
Open it! Let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin
Baby we ain't marching, we shooting!
In daily recruiting there's a thug born
Everyday in the ghetto
We start em off little, we give em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label, kick it

Nigga roll with Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome with a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feeling that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, gimme that Mossberg swerve
Up into my bag, 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12-gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga your loss, take it all off
Got a nigga caught off
But the Bone not Leatherface, too many are thinking they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch if you steppin' we buckin' them guts, that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smoking the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be serving em dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down if he come back talking
Like, gimme back me money
Thugging with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiending for them green leaves

Gotta make some money, so

Grab artillery, a nigga start packing
'Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin, and I did him

I'm gonna do right by my Pa

What to hunt the possum
Where the corn top blossom

I see two heads of snowy white
It seems I can hear them both recite

Haro Stanley,"A policeman's whistle gayly, a smile upon his face
As he walked along the old familiar beat
He saw a little bay crying and thought his heart would break
Standing bare foot in the middle of the street

I was left on the street with no shoes upon my feet
When I saw my mom and daddy drive away
Now I'm not old enough to know every much myself
But I saw my dad and mommy drive away

The policeman stopped the traffic, then went up to the boy
And he asked him gently, where do you belong
The little boy stopped crying and with trembling lips he said
I'm not big enough to know just what went wrong

[Chorus:]
The little boy is happy now with a new mom and dad
His new daddy is the policeman on the beat
Tho' he can't forget that awful day it doesn't seem to hurt so bad
He has a brand new pair of shoes upon his feet

Haro Stanley,"We all loved our fair tender maiden
From her eyes the light of Heaven shone through
She fell sick one cold winter morning
And there was nothing we could do

She lay on her death bed so bravely
Her face all tired and worn
We knew in our hearts she was leaving
God had called her to His heavenly home

As she lay on the bed she was smiling
At the people all gathered a-round
It was her only way of saying goodbye
And tomorrow she'd lay neath the ground

The fragrance of flowers from her grave
Goes to heaven where she has gone too
Mortal pain shown on all our faces
But there was nothing we could do

When the preacher began to console us
His words rang out clear and true
He said God called her that's the reason
That there was nothing we could do",There Was Nothing We Could Do,1991

Down with sighs and down with cupid

My poor Minnie!

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Tidying the childrens clothes and toys

Harold Danko,"And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Harold Harris,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Harold Hastings,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
You in mid-air.
Send in the clowns.

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
One who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
Opening doors,
Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again
With my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
No one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want - 
Sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
In my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.
Well, maybe next year",Send in the Clowns,2011

But I miss you most of all my darling

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere","Here, There and Everywhere",2007
Harold Melvin,"Hey, lady, can I say something to you for a minute?
Please? No, Now before you take your coat off, That's it
I got something to tell you
See, what I have to say is so very important to our relationship
Why is it that every time we go out on the town, we get around our friends?
Man, you're always talking about what you got, huh
Went out and bought for you
How much money I make
And what school our children go to
And all the fancy clothes and big pretty cars
The big diamond rings, and them fantastic mink coats
Is you for real? No, I don't think you are
Sit down, No, no, sit down
Now don't say nothing, You see
Wait a minute, wait a minute, that is your problem
That is your problem, You're always saying the wrong tthing at the right time
You see I don't--I don't know how to explain this to you
The best I can tell you is what my mother told me as I was coming up
She used to say, ""Son, chances go 'round,""
She said, ""The same people that you meet going up
They make the same old faces coming down,""
Heh, tell the truth
You see, people today, they come out there to party
They come out to party, man
They didn't come out to hear all that jive mess you talking about
You standing up in the corner with a bottle of champagne taking about
Harry, Joe, and Dick and Bobby and what they ain't got
And they live down in the lower development homes, and you won't even help
You won't even buy 'em a drink
Is that any way to meet them?
If you're gonna boast, boast around somebody that has what you have
Don't make your own brothers and sisters feel bad
You see Listen
I know you know what I'm talking about because from time to time
I can remember you coming to me putting your head on my shoulder and crying
""Oh, papa, why? Why? Why don't nobody wanna be my friend?""
You told me a long time ago, You said, ""Papa, what am I doing?""
I didn't wanna tell you that
I thought you had sense enough to realize what you're doing, but I see you don't
Sit down and listen to me, No, sit down!
You see, people are too sensitive today
They don't wanna hear all that jive you talking back
You see, they don't wanna hear about what you got
cause they're trying to get it, too
Heh, tell the truth
I can't very much blame her
As much as it hurts me, it hurts to see people
going around behind our backs saying that
""This woman this, this woman that,"" or ""she ain't this"" or ""she ain't that""
I wanna be proud of you, mama
I wanna be proud of you
Listen, as long as you live
As long as you live whether you're with me or not

Be for real, girl
Just be for real, yeah, (Be for real)
Be for real, girl
Be, be, be for real, yeah, (Be for re-e-e-eal)
Be for real

You shouldn't have to worry about how you've been living good
No, if you're smartly dressed, Hey, baby, Hey, baby
What you should be doing is getting down on your knees every night
And thanking the man above for being blessed right now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If you want your friends to think you're starting with a smile
Be for real, girl
Just be, be for real, (Be for real)
Be, be for real

I can't let you go on chasing my friends away
Because of the silly and stupid things you say
Yeah, baby, Yeah, baby, Hey, baby
You better dig yourself there, woman
Putting people down is less best to you
It just don't pay, Hey, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want people today by starting with a smile
Be for real, girl
I know, I know I want you to do is just be for real
(Be for real) Hey, lady, Yeah, baby, Yeah, baby
(Be for real, girl) Be for real, honey
Just be, be for real (Be for real)
I don't want your money, I don't need your money
(Be for real, girl) Just be for real, Just be for real, mama
Don't do it for me, do it for yourself
(Be for real) Be for real, honey
Yeah, yeah, Tell 'em ' bout it, honey
(Be for real, girl) Be for real, mama, Hey, yeah
Just be, be, be for real, (Be for real)",Be for Real,1972

Hmm
Hello
Did I disturb you
I didn't mean to take up too much of your time but
Just thought I'd give you a ring and see how you was doin'
How's, how's everything
A friend of mine told me he saw you the other day
Said you was still lookin' good
Heh, made me feel kinda good, you know
Told me, told me that you did ask about me
Heh
I been really meanin' to try to get to talk to you
For now but
You know how a man's pride is
Sometimes it kinda won't let him do what he wanna do

(Oh, I) Yeah, baby (Oh, I), come back to me, darlin'

I know this will knock you dead but
I even went out and got a gig
Oh, forgot you know hip to the hip talk
Plain J-O-B, baby

I don't know, I guess it might be too late but

I love you, baby, ha

Heh, remember how I used to always say how lucky I done been
You know being they got that lottery, I hit it
I'd like to kinda make up for
A lot of things that just seemed not to go right
Don't want you to think I'm tryin' to buy back your love or your friendship
But now I feel I got a chance to kinda make things up to you a little bit
Heh, enough about you and me
How's my little son?
Hmm, he ever ask about me?
Just a little bit
Does he still like to go down by the supermarket?
If I could just
If I could just see you
Can't really say what you mean or what you want over the phone
I swear I miss you
You done heard it ten times or more but
I swear I done changed
I swear I done changed

Harold Melvin,"If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me (Oh)

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now baby I know the difference between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing to upset our happy home
Oh don't get so excited when I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children when we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now (If you don't know me)
You will never never never know me (You'll never, never know me)
If you don't know me by now(If you don't, if you don't know me baby)
You will never never never know me(No you won't)

We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together it should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair when you can't see eye to eye, oh

If you don't know me by now (If you don't, if you don't know me baby)
You will never never never know me (Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey)
If you don't know me by now (You will never never never know me)
You will never never never know me (Oh)",If You Don't Know Me by Now,1972
