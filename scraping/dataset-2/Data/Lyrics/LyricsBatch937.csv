Robby Krieger,"Words are flying out like
endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
are drifting thorough my open mind
Possessing and caressing me

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light which
dance before me like a million eyes
That call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a
restless wind inside a letter box
they tumble blindly as
they make their way across the universe

Jai guru deva om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter shades of life
are ringing through my open ears
exciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which
shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Robby Krieger,"I am becalmed in virtue
Lost to nothing on a bay of dreams
Warm weather and a holocaust
The tears of God flow as I bleed

Left to die by two good friends
Abandoned me and put to sleep
On a shore where oyster beds
Seem plush as down
And ripe enough for the luxor dream

Recall the dream of luxor
How fluids will arrive
As if by call or schedule
Resume through the morning tide
Where entry is by seaweed gate
And plan the plan of dreams
To lose oneself in reverb
In all that is and all that seems

So ladies, fish, and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
To see me in the blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea

The oyster boys are swimming now
To claim me back from the dead
The creatures back from vertigo
They fear to fall but haven't fell
Will reclaim tries and try again

The oyster boys are swimming now
Hear them chatter on the tide
Of the lost and language lost
Hear them chatter on the tide

We understand, we understand, we understand
And so do i
We understand, we understand
But fright is real
And so am i

So ladies, fish, and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
To see me in the blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea

The entry to lost vestibule
Opens on the bay
An instant shape of mercury
Lost and then retained
An instant is an eyelash
Caught on the tide
Imaginos!
Below this bay
And then besides...

The oyster boys are swimming now
One deal is what we made
Forest keys and whirlwind cold
Green keys too and keys of gold
Even locks that won't explode
When the skies become a scroll
Having lost it's interest
See that's the deal we made
Just to join the oyster cult
The blue oyster cult

We understand, we understand - blue oyster cult",Blue Öyster Cult,2012
Robby Krieger,"Cornwall and the harbor
Where witches went mad more than once and
Until this day
In dreams at least
The lighthouse at lost Christabel
Squat and hugely tilts
Upon the strand where granddad's house was built
And having stood the test of time
The starry gale the bloody tide
Grandad's house though gaped with hooks
And filled with books
Could stand no more until
A certain prophecy
Once read - now stood
Before the world fulfilled

Now of these books in granddad's keep
Some of them were new but mostly they were old
And the oldest was a scroll
A prophecy that read
When the riddle begins
The story will end

August the first 1892
And in the guise of destiny
Grandad quit Cornwall
I'm a captain of a ship
My ship is charmed, and called Plutonia.

Stories on land, storms at sea
'tween 1892 and '93
When grandad sailed for Mexico

Ships charmed and ordinary
Sailed the glidepath to the sun
And when the sun proved false
As it always does
Some of them would be lost
And some would sail back home
It was no star
But a magna of illusion
I mean by that
The mirror found
In the chamber of jade grown like a seed
Deep within the ground


The mirror found
By one man
So on and off again
He sailed the Europe's rim
On and off, off and on
Until his time had come

Through tears and smiles
The last domain
The rods of broken crystal
On and off, and off again
Until his time had come
Late to the story that had been
But early to the riddle not yet begun

August the first 1893
The charmed ship Plutonia
Sailed like a ray into Cornwall
And none too soon it seems

That night the captain's granddaughter
Would celebrate her birthday
I've come a long way, said the captain
From lost Christabel this night
Accompanied by my dog familiar
To blast your rafters with my surprise!
Granddaughter, it's a foreign mirror
Taken from the jungle by crime!

Stories on land, storms at sea
'tween 1892 and '93
When grandad sailed for Mexico

When tables collapse
And floors have filled
And the party's over, it's all over
Sea-dogs and rockers will dwell on doom
I've warped the stuff of ground
What seems to be is not
Behind closed eyes
Realize your sight
Mine, granddaughter, proves a surprise
More light than sun
More dark than night then
More a snare than lust",Magna of Illusion,2012
Robby Krieger,"Hey what's the matter with the style I wear
'Cause I never thought I'd end up here
And you wear a face that holds a selfish smile

But it's not enough to care
It's not enough to know me
If you woud only give me somethin'

I'd be your everything

Take all the masks and lay them down on me
And try to make me what you think that I should be

'Cause it's not enough to share
And really get to know me
With all the changes you make of me

I'll be your everything

Why do I have to stay with this charade?
'Cause I used to be a man of dignity

Now I've found enough to care
And pick up all that was me
To lay the masks down on your doorstep

I was your everything
But it wasn't m",Puppet Strings,2014
Robby Takac,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water [5.1 Surround Sound/Stereo],2006
Robby Turner,"I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on blue bayou

Savin' nickels, savin' dimes
Workin' till the sun don't shine
Lookin' forward to happier times on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, come what may, to blue bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on blue bayou
All those fishin' boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Oh, to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on blue bayou

I'm goin' back some day, gonna stay on blue bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on blue bayou
Ah, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Ah, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside

I'll never be blue, my dreams come true on blue bayou",Blue Bayou,2000
Robby Turner,"I was all right for a while, I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say ""Hello""
Aw you wished me well, you couldn't tell

That I'd been crying over you, crying over you
Then you said ""so long"". left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying crying
It's hard to understand but the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you but it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do
For you don't love me and I'll always be

Crying over you, crying over you
Yes, now you're gone and from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
Yeah crying, crying, over you",Crying,2000

Robby Turner,"A candy-colored clown they call the sandman
Tiptoes to my room every night
Just to sprinkle star dust and to whisper
""Go to sleep, everything is alright""

I close my eyes then I drift away
Into the magic night, I softly say
A silent prayer like dreamers do
Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you

In dreams I walk with you
In dreams I talk to you
In dreams you're mine all the time
We're together in dreams, in dreams

But just before the dawn
I awake and find you gone
I can't help it, I can't help it if I cry
I remember that you said goodbye

Too bad it only seems
It only happens in my dreams
Only in dreams
In beautiful dreams.",In Dreams,2000
Robby Turner,"Your baby doesn't love you any more
Golden days before they end
Whisper secrets to the wind
Your baby won't be near you any more

Tender nights before they fly
Send falling stars that seem to cry
Your baby doesn't want you any more
It's over

It breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue
But oh what will you do? then she said to you
There's someone new we're through we're through
It's over it's over it's over

All the rainbows in the sky start to even say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows any more

Robert Benchley,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo

So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are

Their voices were soft
And their words inviting

There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And that song was exciting

There was a time, and it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in days gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame

He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came

And still I dreamed he'd come to me
That we would live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather

So diff'rent from this hell I'm living
So diff'rent now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",I Dreamed A Dream,2003

Robert Billig,"And now I'm all alone again
Nowhere to go, no one to turn to
Without a home, without a friend
Without a face to say hello to
And now the night is near
and now I can make-believe he's here

Sometimes I walk alone at night
When everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy
With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head

On my own, pretending he's beside me
All alone, I walk with him 'til morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes and he has found me

In the rain, the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
in the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me, forever and forever

And I know, it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself, and not to him
And although, I know that he is blind
Still I say there's a way for us

I love him, but when the night is over
He is gone, the river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers

I love him, but every day I'm learning
All my life, I've only been pretending
Without me, his world will go on turning
The world is full of happiness that I have never known

Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms
 
First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun

Robert Bonfiglio,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love,1997
Robert Bonfiglio,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997
Robert Bonfiglio,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1997
Robert Bonfiglio,"It's like a diamond ring
It's a precious thing
And we never want to lose it

Ev'ry time we hear the music

We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

It's like a rainy night and candlelight
And ooh, it's so romantic
We got the whole thing working out so right
And it's just the way we planned it

And we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

Don't you know we're in this love together

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999

That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,2000

No one ever will.

Sure, I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,

In the dear days gone by,

Of the smile in your eye,

In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

Or a knife in the case of the zeppelin.

Robert Calvert,"I see myself a hero
While one wings falls away
And the dial approaches zero
In a spiralling display.
My past life flashes feverishly,
And lives I did not lead,
Like the time I was a hero
Of a weird, outlandish breed.

One arm of flesh and muscle
And one of feathered scale
I was hero with one wing
That was of no avail.
I could only fly in circles
Like a corkscrew in the sky,
My one wing flapping frantically
While birds just glided by.

I launched myself from mountains
And from the highest trees
And though I could get nowhere
Just landed on my knees.
But still I was a hero,
With one wing more than most.
Almost half an Angel;
A whirling holy ghost.

My father was an eagle
With two wings wide as sails
My mother was the west wind witch
With grasping finger nails.
She lured him from his aerie
With her twittering device.
She kept him in a golden cage
And fed him field mice.

Dying for the sins that you never done

Robert Charlebois,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1976

Il est joufflu, tendre et rosé
À l'église, beau petit homme
Demain tu seras baptisé

Une cloche sonne, sonne
Sa voix, d'écho en écho
Dit au monde qui s'étonne:
""C'est pour Jean-François Nicot
C'est pour accueillir une âme
Une fleur qui s'ouvre au jour
À peine, à peine une flamme
Encore faible qui réclame
Protection, tendresse, amour""

Loin des chemins, loin des humains
Voici qu'après dix-neuf années
Cœur en émoi, le Jean-François
Prend pour femme la douce Elise
Blanche comme fleur de pommier
Devant Dieu, dans la vieille église
Ce jour, ils se sont mariés

Toutes les cloches sonnent, sonnent
Leurs voix, d'écho en écho
Merveilleusement couronnent
La noce à François Nicot
""Un seul cœur, une seule âme""
Dit le prêtre, ""et, pour toujours
Soyez une pure flamme
Qui s'élève et qui proclame
La grandeur de votre amour""

Voici qu'en la nuit étoilée

Elle chante dans le vent
Obsédante et monotone
Elle redit aux vivants:

Robert Chauvigny,"Dans un amour, faut de la fierté,
Pouvoir se taire, de la dignité,
Savoir partir au bon moment,
Cacher son mal en souriant,
Et je me disais en marchant
Que j'avais su partir à temps.
Si mon cœur est désespéré,
Il ne m'aura pas vu pleurer.

Un refrain courait dans la rue,
Bousculant les passants,
Qui se faufilait dans la cohue
D'un petit air engageant.
J'étais sur son passage.
Il s'arrêta devant moi
Et me dit d'être sage.
""Tu es triste, mon Dieu, pourquoi ?
Viens, et rentre dans ma chanson.
Il y a de beaux garçons
Jette ton chagrin dans le ruisseau
Et tourne-lui le dos.""

Il faut que ton couplet soit gai,
Alors parlons du mois de mai,
Des arbres en robe, de lilas
Et de l'été qui pousse en tas.
'y a des violettes, un balcon.
Un vieux poète chante une chanson.
Ma robe est tachée de soleil.
Je le garde pour mes réveils.

Un refrain courait dans la rue,
Bousculant les passants,
Qui se faufilait dans la cohue
D'un petit air engageant.
Les gens sur son passage,
Se regardaient l'air surpris,
Cessaient leurs bavardages
""Quel est donc ce malappris ?""
Oui, mais l'air était entraînant
Et les mots engageants
Et surtout, il y avait dedans
Du rire à bout portant

Peut chasser vos tourments,
Alors entrez dans la cohue.
Y a de la place en poussant",Un Refrain Courait Dans la Rue,2000

From some enchanted land.

Robert Clary,"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

Robert Coote,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1964

Robert Coote,"Well after all, Pickering,
I'm an ordinary man,
Who desires nothing more than an ordinary chance,
to live exactly as he likes, and do precisely what he wants...
An average man am I, of no eccentric whim,
Who likes to live his life, free of strife,
doing whatever he thinks is best, for him,
Well... just an ordinary man...

BUT, Let a woman in your life
and your serenity is through,
she'll redecorate your home,
from the cellar to the dome,
and then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you...

Let a woman in your life,
and you're up against a wall,
make a plan and you will find,
that she has something else in mind,
and so rather than do either you do something else that neither likes at all

You want to talk of Keats and Milton, she only wants to talk of love,
You go to see a play or ballet, and spend it searching for her glove,
Let a woman in your life and you invite eternal strife,
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands...
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling than to ever let
a woman in my life,

I'm a very gentle man, even tempered and good natured who you never hear complain,
Who has the milk of human kindness by the quart in every vein,
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips, 
the sort who never could, ever would, let an insulting remark escape his lips
Very gentle man...

But, Let a woman in your life, and patience hasn't got a chance,
she will beg you for advice,
your reply will be concise, and she will listen very nicely,
and then go out and do exactly what she wants!!!

You are a man of grace and polish, who never spoke above a hush,
all at once you're using language that would make a sailor blush,
Let a woman in your life, and you're plunging in a knife,
Let the others of my sex, tie the knot around their necks, 
I prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition than to ever let a
woman in my life

I'm a quiet living man,
who prefers to spend the evening in the silence of his room,
who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb,
A pensive man am I, of philosophical joys,
who likes to meditate, contemplate, far for humanities mad inhuman noise,
Quiet living man....

But, let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through,
in a line that never ends comes an army of her friends, 
come to jabber and to chatter and to tell her what the matter is with YOU!,
she'll have a booming boisterous family,
who will descend on you en mass,
she'll have a large Wagnerian mother, with a voice that shatters glass,

She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

""Good morning"" ev'ry day.

Opened up my arms and smelled her satin skin

I tease and tempt her with games we can play

She said, ""I'll be back when I get off tonight""

And watched us drown

Again
Now we travel out of Eden

I know you would stand up
For what is right
And I know you would you stand up
Against what's wrong

Our neighbors were blind
But we had each other
And we became strong

They said it was paradise
And that we'd live here forever

Rightly upset
When our friends turned their backs
We knew we'd never, never forget

Lay on the bed

Hundred proof everclear
I'm the crack in your ceiling
Thump you think you hear

I'm a siren stopping
At the end of your street

Opened up my arms and smelled her satin skin

I tease and tempt her with games we can play

Her lips were so inviting
Her hands soft to touch
After just one kiss
I knew I was out of luck

Robert Cray Band,"Some people live to ruin a love so fine
They know, they'll never have what's yours and mine
I know things won't get any better while we're apart
So stop talking to your friends and try listening with your heart

They always try to tell you, all that they see
Jealous minds will tell you what they think about me
They'll show themselves in time
To be nothing but jealous minds

I took you out to a party, a high-class a fair
You were talking to your friends, like I wasn't there
You told them that living with me has really been one big chore
Oh, then maybe I should leave and you'd appreciate me more

They always try to tell you all that they see
Jealous minds will tell you what they think about me
They'll show themselves in time
To be nothing but jealous minds

Oh, tell your friends when you see them
When you see them again
Tell them about the hard times, how we survived the pain
Then don't waste any more time

Because they're nothing but
Jealous minds, jealous minds
Ohh, they're nothing but

Once again I had the dream
I tossed and I turned
That old feeling's still the same
It was so real
I woke up cold and sweating
I wonder did I call her name?

In the dream she was right there with me
Right there with me in the bed
She said, ""Bobby, come and kiss me
Never leave me"", is what she said
But when I reached out to hold her
Oh, I woke my wife instead

Once again
Once again I had the dream
Six years since I've seen her
Ain't no doubt about what it means, no, no
I tried hard not to think about her
But all she left me was this dream

All she left me was the dream

I dreamed I called her name
I dreamed I held my baby in my arms

Robert Cuccioli,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

In the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam

Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid

But if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss

Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again

Robert DeLong,"I think it burns my sense of truth
To hear me shouting at my youth
I need a way to sort it out.

After I die, I'll re-awake,
Redefine what was at stake
From the hindsight of a god.

I'll see the people that I use,
See the substance I abuse,
The ugly places that I lived.

Did I make money? Was I proud?
Did I play my songs too loud?
Did I leave my life to chance
Or did I make you fucking dance?

Symmetry exists only in our mind.
Our brain is shaping squares.
So I woke up with entropy defined
But the forms still linger there, in my head.

I'll see the people that I use,
See the substance I abuse,
The ugly places that I lived.

Did I make money? Was I proud?
Did I play my songs too loud?
Did I leave my life to chance

That if you can hear reacts to every sound

You're a soul survivor, it's so, it's so clear

How it won't last.

Give me your sweet soul

Will you take control

Fill my little holes

Drive me to the red line

And climb my iron flagpole

There's a [rage for love]

So it lays beside road

And it catches in the wheel

I could not escape it

Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,1959

To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love

I'm sayin' son you'll see me searchin', sizzlin' down that broad hiway
Dollar signs in both my eyes, I'm seekin' out my prey I'm prayin'
""Jesus, will you send me just another three or four?""
They pay two-fifty down in Halletsville, 3 dollars, maybe more.

And more than likely they'll be out tonight a-wanderin' from the farms,
Waddlin' down 1291 to keep their bodies warm.

The second was too fast.

Good-God, his car was sideways flyin', 
when the bridge wall met his door.  
The impact shook the river bed his foot went through the floor

Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore was his last moment from the bridge wall to the stream, from
The speckled blood around his smile a-spewin' gasoline.  
And then he screamed his raspy epitaph, before he turned to flame,
