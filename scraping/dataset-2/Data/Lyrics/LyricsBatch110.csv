Dave Barbour Quintet,"She plays her cards close to the vest
To hide the heart she wears on her sleeve
Sometimes she's caught between the woman that she is
and the one she's expected to be
But with an innocent smile
And the should of a child
She's always giving more than she can

When a woman loves a man
When a woman loves a man

She knows how to hang on your every word
And she knows how to look the other way
She'll whisper to you what no man has heard
Secrets she would never give away

With her arms opened wide
She'll take you inside
And hold you in the palm of her hand

When a woman loves a man
When a woman loves a man
She will be there to the end
When a woman loves a man

And when all you've got to give her
Is nothing more than a dream
She'll sacrifice for love to prove to you
Her mind's made up
To stand by you through everything

When a woman loves a man
When a woman loves a man
She will be there to the end
When a woman loves a man",When a Woman Loves a Man,1999
Dave Barbour Quintet,"You left me sad and lonely; 
Why did you leave me lonely? 
For here's a heart that's only 
For nobody but you!
  
I'm burning like a flame, dear; 
Oh, I'll never be the same, dear; 
I'll always place the blame, dear, 
On nobody but you.
 
Yes, you, 
You're driving me crazy! 
What did I do? What did I do? 
My tears for you 
Make everything hazy, 
Clouding the skies of blue. 
 
How true, 
Were the friends who were near me to cheer me, 
Believe me, they knew! 
But you, 
Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me, 
When I needed you!
 
Yes, you! 
You're driving me crazy! 
What did I do to you?",You're Driving Me Crazy,1999
Dave Barbour Trio,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
Think so little of me that they allow you go

When your near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye",Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,1958
Dave Barbour Trio,"I'm mad about the boy
And I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it but must admit the sleepless nights I've had
About the boy

Mmmm on the silverscreen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there are traces of the kid
About the boy

Lord knows I'm not a fool-girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school-girl
Who's in the flurry of her first affair

Will it ever cloy
This odoversity of misery and joy
I'm feeling quite insane and young again 
And all because I'm mad about the boy

I'm feeling quite insane and young again 
And all because I'm mad..

Dave Barbour Trio,"Nobody's heart belongs to me
Hiegh ho, who cares
Nobody writes his songs for me
No one belongs to me

That's the least of my cares
I may be sad at times
And disinclined to play
But it's not bad at times
To go your own sweet way

Nobody's arms belong to me
No arms feel strong to me
I admire the moon as a moon, just a moon
Nobody's heart belongs to me today

",Nobody's Heart,1999
Dave Barbour Trio,"You're nearer than my head is to my pillow
Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the earth below
Precious as the sun to the things that grow

You're nearer than the Ivy to the the wall is
Nearer than the winter to the fall is
Leave me but when you're away
You'll know you're nearer for I love you so

You're nearer for I love you so

",You're Nearer,1999
Dave Barbour's Orchestra,"Linger in my arms a little longer, baby
Don't think twice
While my love for you is growing stronger, baby
T'ain't right
To say goodnight
Though it may be getting past your dream time, baby
Don't think twice
Just linger in my arms a little longer, baby
Cause it's so nice
It's oh so nice.","Linger in My Arms a Little Longer, Baby",1999
Dave Barbour's Orchestra,"Bali Ha'I may call you, any night, any day
In your heart, you'll hear it call you, 
One where they know they would like to be
Bali Ha'I may call you, any night, any day
In your heart, you'll hear it call you, 
Come away...Come away
Bali Ha'I will whisper on the wind of the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me...Come to me
Your own special hopes, your own special dreams
Bloom on the hillside and shine in the streams
If you try, you'll find me
Where the sky meets the sea
Here am I your special island
Come to me...Come to me
Bali Ha'i...Bali Ha'i...Bali Ha'I
Someday you'll see me floating in the sunshine
My head sticking out from a low-lying cloud
You hear me call you, singing through the sunshine
Sweet and clear as can be,
Come to me...Here am I...Come to me
If you try, you'll find me,
Where the sky meets the sea,
Here am I your special island
Come to me...Come to me

Dave Bargeron,"You use me to get you anything you wanted.
Oh, but I'm a changed man now, baby,
And your other friend can get you what you want now.
If I go through those same things again,
I'll be worse off than I started.

[Chorus:]
Girl, you're such a bad influence
And you've got ways to make me do what you want.
Girl, you're such a bad influence,
I've got to stay away.

I've been hurt in all of the worst kind of ways,
And it's you pretty baby,
I've just got to stay away from.
I won't go through those same things again,
I'm so glad that we parted.

[Chorus]

Somebody please, you've got to help me break away.
You know I don't like this lonely feeling.
It wasn't meant to be this way.
I won't go through those same things again,

Dave Bargeron,"Don't change your mind,
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder.
I'm doing fine.
If you decide to leave, I won't go under.

You know I've come this far without you
It won't be too hard to be alone.
I've got choices all around me,
So I won't be spending too much time at home.

[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, baby.
I can't forgive you,
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.

No, don't say a word.
I already heard that you don't love me.
In your state of mind,
I don't need to hear your side of the story.

Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know.
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go.

[Chorus]

I broke my back to make you happy.
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care.
If you think you're better off without me,
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there.

I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,
Gonna miss the air you breathe.
I'm just not quite happy, baby,
'bout your crazy plans to leave.",Miss You,1986
Dave Barker,"The preacher talked to me and he smiled
Said, ""Come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile
Now for once in your life you're alone
But you ain't got a dime, there's no time for the phone""

I've just got to get a message to you, hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on

I told him I'm in no hurry
But if I broke her heart, won't you tell her I'm sorry
And for once in my life I'm alone,
And I've got to let her know just in time before I go

I've just go to get a message to you, hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on

Well I laughed but that didn't hurt
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt
Now I'm crying but deep down inside
Well I did it to him, now it's my turn to die

I've just got to get a message to you, hold on, hold on
One more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on
Hold on
One more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on

Dave Barker,"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star

She want it, she want it, she want it
Now you give her as she want it
She want it, she want it, she want it
Now you give her as she want it

'Cause when she can't get it, she feels so mad
But when she get it, she feels so glad

Don't stop her if she want it

She never stop 'til she get it

Feel that? Right there
Rub it in, babe

At last, winter's gone away to rest.
Once again the leaves have returned to the trees.
I can just feel that soft summer breeze.
There's magic in the air
Winter's disappeared
It's summer
Children will be playing in the park
Days will be longer till dark 
Nights will be cool

And the livin' is easy, so easy

Dave Barker,"Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by
I say to myself you're such a lucky guy,
To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true
out of all the fellows in the world she belongs to me.
But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.
 
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, can't forget her
Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.",Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me),1997

Blame it on August and quit

Watch as the storm goes through
And I need you

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

There's more here than what were seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you.

Life has gone and gotten so tough
Emily, you believe you will never ever
Never ever find that you're enough

Circumstances can change your mind

It's love that hung the moon and stars for you above
And stays awake to start the morning
If you feel you've had enough
He's never given up
It's love

Emily, you will see some stormy weather
Dark and cloudy days of rain
But Emily, there will be summer laughter
'Cause everybody knows the seasons change

Circumstances will turn out fine
And time will help you see

It's love that hung the moon and stars for you above
And stays awake to start the morning

I know you believe me
Everything is whispering this well-known story
So listen in

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

Shows me all of this time I've been blind to this waking life.

Bring back memories of you to me.

One nigga's goin to eat tonight
Somebody's moves its feet tonight

Rather bring the best 16 when you fucking with Bing,
You could try smooth in between and you can scream
Sound while the crowd won't bounce to that
And you be fucking up the room,
Changing up mood
And that's rude
And my thugs want to eat your food
Drinking milk shake and after that shit in your face
And let your bitch know there been a car bomb from the git
Blow the day you blow Shaq make all his free throws
Let him throw a finger fucking fast or slow
Even put it in your ass if you tell me so
Toe to toe, you can lose your deal and your hoe
Now it's hard to pay your carton note and buy you some smoke
Seen your man is 'convensary' now, he starting to worry
He said stay away from Bing and 118
They really put it down, really put niggas in the ground
And your really love me if you only got a beat down

Confidential, you need a whole lot of it
To bang with Bing in two bars, I can spoil your dream
Get mean, I could lead to things
Like me coming for you, in the middle of the night
With all black on, all you can see is the red light
The fo fo special got you hoping God bless you
Girl, won't forget you, once the bullets start the get you,
Games over soldier, don't you see the fucking Range Rover
With Bing in it, 10 more, 12th and 118 in it
I started rappin cause there's cream in it
But I still keep the crack, how for five or six fiends in it
A ring with the Bling Bling in it
And my brand new truck, bitches like the way I lean in it
Stop at the Stome, leave the keys in it
Gave you to leave with it, Bing will make you believe in it
You got a gut, put some trees in it

[Chorus]

Need a hard rock between your legs, I see the red spot
Thug knot, all it takes is one shot to make your head rock
Take you out your spot
While in the Woodstock, ask about Bing on the block
Fuck the cop, sell crack in blue top
Niggaz the size of dimes, ya'll cowards must be outta ya mind
Thinking that Dave Bing won't shine
This ain't the first time I cut head wrong with 1 9
Find the lactose slope, mix it in with the coke
Buy a quarter pound weed and let the clock choke
Stuck the nine out, Stuck it down the bitch nigga throat
When it was least expected made him get buck-nagged

I see you real flashy ""but that ain¡¦t gone last nigga"" 
Pop fire off shots ""and that¡¦s your ass nigga""

Six-hundred bad bitch on it holding down the throttle 
And fuck that beef shit cause some beef won¡¦t die 
And some niggas will say they gangsta but they won¡¦t ride

Sell cracks if you could bust your gat when you should 
It¡¦s for my blacks from the bricks back to Inglewood 
We eat together nigga fuck the crossroads 
In this world my flow is another lost soul 
My shit sounds like shots from a four pound 
For these bitch clowns it¡¦s war now

Niggas know the truth 
Rule raises the roof 
'cause I pop more shots than Abdul-Rauf 
And when the concludes I bring closure to the situ 
Come through squeeze eight out the stolen black pinto 
Niggas know my mental kill or be killed head for the hills 
But don¡¦t never slide down it if you to high ground it 
(puff, puff) uhhh! Is how it sounded two shots through and silent 
And one nigga stripped of his talents 
New fucking Yiddy City the sex and violence 
Where first time offenders get floated to the island 
And one time give a nigga one time 
Breathe wrong and a nigga have a blown mind 
I blow lines like an addict 
Bust guns erratic shine blind like carats 
Rules above average me and this music make a marriage 
So I thee wed till I¡¦m either jailed or dead motherfuckers

In the void of falling

All you need to do is take
One step into the sky
Give yourself to gravity
Give death another try
In free fall, free fall

The wind will take your frightened face
And force your mouth to smile
While destiny is on your case
The gods look up your file

The clouds are coming at you
Like a host of angels wings
For thirty seconds of freedom squared
You've cut the puppet strings
In free fall

Seeing visions of a new bright horizon

Dave Brubeck,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""

Dave Brubeck,"The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see, 
For the moon refused to shine. 
Couple sitting underneath a willow tree, 
For love they did pine, 
Little maid was kinda 'fraid of darkness 
So she said, ""I guess I'll go."" 
Boy began to sigh, looked up at the sky, 
Told the moon his little tale of woe: 

""oh, shine on, shine on harvest moon up in the sky. 
I ain't had no lovin' since January, February, June or July 
Snowtime ain't no time to stay outdoors and spoon, 
So shine on, shine on harvest moon, for me and my gal!"" 

I can't see why a boy should sigh, 
When by his side is the girl he loves so true, 
All he has to say is: 
""Won't you be my bride, 
For I love you, 
Why should I be telling you this secret, 
When I know that you can guess?,"" 
Harvest moon will smile, 
Shine on all the while, 
If the little girl should answer ""yes."" 

""Oh, shine on, shine on harvest moon up in the sky.

Dave Brubeck,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1992
Dave Brubeck,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

And mail it right away

Dave Brubeck,"The sound that you're listenin' to
Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame

I don't think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when I'm blue it's seems like Lucille
Tryin' to help me callin' my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues

Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now

You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

One more now, Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?
Look out, Lucille
Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright",Paying the Cost to Be the Boss,2001

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1951
Dave Brubeck Trio,"I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain

Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?
Why do I get up each morning to start happy 
And get up with joy in my heart?
Why is each new task a trifle to do?
Because I am living a life full of you

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above

There's a miscommunication

And we complicate the truth 
And convolute the story 
But as far as I recall I do believe it all

[Chorus]
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world Rising from the dead 
Doing what He said He would do 
Loving everyone He saw
When it's said and done it all
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world

It isn't a secret  And maybe I'm being simple minded 
But it's about Jesus and a way, a truth, a life 
That can change a heart and a soul forever 
And we need to be reminded

It's the power of the blood 
That brings us to redemption 
We can rise above the fall 
And the reason for it all

[Chorus]

All the people beneath the steeple 
Are just reaching 
For the truth that can save a helpless soul 
We wrestle with the mystery in the teaching 
But the news is all good I think that we should 
Remember one thing.",Saving the World,1999

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye

Should I go on whistling in the dark,

Dave Cousins,"The village square stands quiet
The curfew still enforced
The streets are even clear of dogs and whores

Like some evil bird of prey
The scaffold spreads its wings
The people build their fires and bolt their doors

The mayor is giving dinner to the officers’ wives
His eldest son is learning how to fawn
The barrack block is hushed and tense
The soldiers drawing lots
Who will be the hangman in the dawn?

The lot falls on a young man
Who has served for but a year
His home is in the village close nearby

He shivers at the thought of what
He’s forced to do next day
He wonders who it is, who has to die?

And the full moon casts a cold light
On the gloomy prison walls
The papist walks his cell, he cannot sleep

He hears the waiting gallows creaking
Just beyond that door
He prays for he has no more tears to weep

The day begins to break
A muffled drums begins to sound
A crowd begins to gather in the square
The presence of the hangman in his terrifying mask

Weighs heavy on the minds of all those there
The colonel reads the sentence
Which the papist knows by heart

He has failed to show allegiance to the King
His crime is thus with God himself
And in His name he must hang
The papist, head held high, says not a thing

The jailer binds his hands
And puts his blindfold to his eyes
He leads him through the door before the crowd
The hangman sees his victim

And the blood drains from his face
He sees his younger brother standing proud
The hangman tries to protest
But is ordered to proceed

His trembling hands begin to take the strain
His eyes are blind with streaming tears
And he cries for all to hear

Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Oh, please forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name

Dave Cousins,"The hillside was a patchwork quilt 
Neatly stitched with tidy hedge 
And crumbling grey stone wall 
The trees were bare, but Spring was near 
To conjure up its endless strings 
Of green magic handkerchieves 

Could you only see what I've seen 
You would surely know what I mean 
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heaven.

That tumbled down the daunting cliff 
To sparkle bright on the beach.

As you dry her tearful eyes
You tell her fairy stories

She looks to you for comfort
And holds out her little hand.

Into her tiny room
She wakes up like a bird
And she's fine again.

You gently kiss her forehead
And from the room you creep

And her head's an open fire
All night she turns and tosses
As her temperature gets higher.

Into her tiny room
She wakes up like a bird
And she's fine again.

And her breathing much more slow
She dreams of clowns and princes
Sailing boats and trains
The fairies come by moonlight
To take away her pain.

And just as many girls to while away my nights

Lord, my whole life has been like a raging torrent
Sweeping many things in its course that other men only dream of
I've valued it so cheaply, until now

Let me live, let me give, my love to her

"Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich","I watched the burning sun climb in the morning sky
And from all sides I hear excited voices cry
Today Don Juan will fight the proudest bull of all
And in the blood-red sand which one will fall
Hey! Don Juan!

I am the matador who's won a thousand fights
And just as many girls to while away my nights
But there is one who's love thrills me like heady wine
I'll fear no fear of death while she is mine
Hey! Don Juan!

Don Juan, braver than brave
Show us today what you are
Don Juan, man amon men
Your name will shine like a star

The time draws very near to meet my greatest test
But with her eyes on me I'll fight my best
Hey! Don Juan!

Lord, my whole life has been like a raging torrent
Sweeping many things in its course that other men only dream of
I've valued it so cheaply, until now

But now her love leads me to find peace of mind
Let me live, let me give, my love to her

Don Juan, braver than brave
Show us today what you are
Don Juan, man amon men
Your name will shine like a star
Hey! Don Juan!

The end must be in sight this bull will die for me
And I think of the one who'll share my victory
As my eyes search the crowd my body turns to stone
I see my lover there, but not alone
Hey! Don Juan!

If I can't live for her, then there's no life for me
So in this blood-red ring, die Don Juan!

One smile and I was born again
I felt sure it wasn't too late
I'd find strength to make me go straight
I had love and threw it away
Why did they lead me astray?
For last night in Soho I let my life go

I never told you of some things I've done I'm so ashamed of
I thought my foolish past was over and done
I felt sure I'd make a new start

I had dreams and broke them in two
I'm just not worth of you!
For last night in Soho I let my life go

Well, hi there, kid you ain't been around for quite some little while
See you got yourself a real cute doll you're living in style
But boy don't get above your station
If you don't want aggravation
Got a little job for you
This is what you gotta do, boy!

That's how last night in Soho I let my life go

Don't cry my baby as they lead me where no love can help me
Don't stay around to watch me go

That it was only yesterday

Well it missed him by a whisker 
And the gunman could not be found 

They found a bullet in the chapel nearby
It was embedded in the altar stone
The statue Virgin upon the altar
Started bleeding on a Sunday 
And so the faithful- They came in thousands 
From as far as the Phillipines 
To pray for healing from the Virgin 
And to kiss that bullet clean
Word got around about the Virgin
There were pilgrims- There were tourists
Souvenirs and postcards 
Plastic virgins and bullet roseries

And many cripples started walking 
And the mute began to speak 
And the skeptics kept on talking

A bloodied rifle among the pieces
Found the sniper above the altar
Dead and tangled in the attic

As they rifled through his jacket
A bloodied wallet identified him
And his surname was Emmanuel
His given name was Jesus

So they buried him in the Chapel
With the rifle by his side
And they bought another statue Virgin
With the proceeds from the healing

Now she stands upon the altar
Spring water runs from the bullet hole
Now the Chapel is a shrine

I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
Get off get off you railroad bum and he slammed the boxcar door

And brought the accident that left me blind

George I guess you knew how much it hurt me
The day the judge gave her our little kids
She said she wouldn't care if I should drop dead
With all that insurance I don't guess she would

Cause to your kind of promise is nothing but something to break
And the laugh fits your lips honey like a hand fits the glove
And your kind of woman don't understand my kind of love
The heartaches you caused me don't cause you the least bit of shame
And I guess if I let you you'd hurt me all over again
And I can't help but wonder what was I thinking of
To think that your kind of woman could understand my kind of love
I made you my life while you made me into your fool
Yes I found that too late that your love meant heartache
Your kind of woman never could be true
But someday you'll know what a hurt when your heart breaks in two
And when your world falls to the pieces then you'll know what you put me through
And I hope I'm around when you'll learn what I'm speaking of
Cause your kind of woman don't understand my kind of love

Dave Dudley,"Would you like to hear the story of a girl that many soldiers know
It's a tale of love and all its glory they tell it when the lights're soft and low
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone every night you see her wait
She waits for her boy who marched away and though he's gone she hears him say
Oh promise you'll be true fare Thee well Lily Marlene
Till I'll return to you fare Thee well Lily Marlene
With the kiss she gave her promise to be constant as the stars above
Every soldier knows she kept her promise and she's been faithful to her love

Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone every night you see her wait
For this is the place a vow was made and breezes sing her serenade
Oh promise you'll be true fare Thee well Lily Marlene
Till I'll return to you fare Thee well Lily Marlene

Although each tale must have an ending no one knows just what the end will be
But tonight when twilight is descending if you will come along here's what you'll see
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone each night you see her wait
And as they go marching to the prey the soldiers all salute and say
We'll tell him you've been true fare Thee well Lily Marlene
Till he returns to you fare Thee well Lily Marlene",Lili Marlene,1966
Dave Dudley,"When the postman delivered a letter
It filled her dear heart full of joy
But she didn't know til she read the inside
It was the last one from her darling boy.

Dear Mom, was the way that it started
I miss you so much, it went on
Mom, I didn't know, that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won.

I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
You know as you did, when I was a kid
And I'd come home with mud on my feet.

The captain just gave us our orders
And Mom, we will carry them through.
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But now I'll just say I love you.

Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed for there was no name
And she knew that her darling had died.

That night as she knelt by her bedside
She prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free.",Soldier's Last Letter,1966

She turned to someone else and taught him everything she knew

Washed my face in the morning dew

And each injustice I have seen

Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun and we grew up together that way
I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep he was right there to the rescue he came
He jumped in and he pulled me out
Now the years rolled along and at last he grew old his eye sight was fast growing dim
Then one day the doctor looked at him and said well I can do no more for him Jim
With a hand that was tremblin' I picked up my gun
And I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
But I just couldn't do it oh I wanted to run and I wished they would shoot me instead
Well I went to his side and I sat on the ground and he laid his head on my knee
I stroke the best pal that a man ever had then I cried so I scaresly could see
Now old Shep is gone where the good doggies go and no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know old Shep has a wonderful home

I'd like to talk to him about the law""

And I really should be a gettin' on my way

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,1971
Dave Dudley,"Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself, then you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

Every time I look in the Holy Book I wanna tremble
When I read the part where a carpenter cleared the temple
For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellers
Than what I profess to be
And it causes me to shame to know I'm not the man I should be

Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself, then you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

Mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
And when I'm down on my knees that's when I'm close to heaven
Daddy lived his life, two kids and wife, you do what you must do
He showed me enough of what it takes just to get me through

Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself, then you can look at others differently
Put your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee",Put Your Hand in the Hand,1971
Dave Dudley,"Have you read any good telephone books lately?
If you ain't then let me recommend one
I've already read that Tulsa telephone book through thirteen times
If you don't know any last names it ain't much fun

Well, I was in Tulsa and didn't have anything going
And she was in Tulsa and didn't have anything on
She said, my name is Shirley and I said, my name is Dave
I woke up the next morning and she was gone

[Chorus]
Readin' that Tulsa telephone book will drive a man insane
Especially if that girl, you're looking for has no last name
I got to find her and tell her I don't want our love to end
So I'm readin' that Tulsa telephone book again

All of the Tulsa operators know my voice now
They must know how long I've been alone
If you see a girl named Shirley with some ribbons in her hair
Tell her that she's wanted on the phone

[Chorus]

I keep on readin' that Tulsa telephone book again
I'm readin' that Tulsa telephone book again",Tulsa Telephone Book,1971
Dave Dudley,"I keep the radio on most all night long listen to the songs they play
Sometimes I hum tap along with my thumb listen to the words they say
And I have to admit those yesterday hits take me back a year or two
I get those 1953 Dear John Honky Tonk Blues for you
I get those 1953 Dear John Honky Tonk Blues
Well I need help when I hear No Help Wanted
Remembering where we first heard Lovesick Blues
Old songs make me wonder what you're doing
I get those 1953 Dear John Honky Tonk Blues

Gonna play this song for Rollin' John the Wild Side Of Life
It's Rolly Polly a golden oldie for Carl and his brand new wife
Makes me feel sad but it ain't half bad rememberin' the things I'd do
I get those 1953 Dear John Honky Tonk Blues for you
I get those 1953 Dear John Honky Tonk Blues
Well I need help...

Dave Dudley,"This ol' rig that I'm drivin' ain't the sharpest on the road
These ol' bulls that I'm haulin' ain't perfumed
But if it wasn't for a lot of those truck drivers just like me
Then who would bring those T-bone steaks to you
We're the bullshippers big bullshippers a haulin' them ol' bulls across the land
We're the bullshippers big bullshippers bullshippin' truck drivin' men

This ain't the best job in this world that I know
And some people may look down their nose at me
But I'd rather be a struggling with these ol' rowdy bulls then a haulin' a load of T-N-T
We're the bullshippers

There's a lotta pretty wairesses that I always see every time I'm making my run
Well I tell 'em that I love 'em but they just laugh and say
You big bullshippin' son of a gun
We're the bullshippers
Yeah we're the bullshippers",Bullshippers,1972
Dave Dudley,"Some folks call me a laughin' boy some say I'm a clown
But till you've tried my way of life don't ever put it down
And if it feels good do it if it hurts just let it lie
Now there's no mystery to it just a better way to look at life

Some folks worry bout growin' old but that don't bother me
Old age is one thing I hope that I live long enough to see
Forget your disappointments pretend they wasn't there
But when they pass out happiness be sure you get your share
And if it feels good

One day when I'm old and gray lookin' back at what I've done
I can face the world and say that livin' sure was fun
And if it feels good
And if it feels good",If It Feels Good Do It,1972
Dave Dudley,"I'm sittin' back easy in my easy chair watchin' the morning dawnin' fair
My wife's cookin' breakfast and my little girl
Is looking at her daddy like he owns the world
I've got everything that a man could want
My lips oughta smile but somehow they don't

I feel a guilty lamp in my throat my body's at home but my heart's on the road
Alberquerque and New Orleans hamburgers and pinto beans
Big mountains and river beds happy anywhere I lay my head
I feel like I'm about to explode my body's at home but my heart's on the road

I love my family and I always will but I'm just no good when I'm sittin' still
A quiet kind of love and me don't mix and you can't teach an old dog new tricks
So kiss me baby and hold me tight I'll try to get back by Saturday night
I don't mean to hurt you Lord knows I don't
But my body's at home but my heart's on the road
Alberquerque and New Orleans
Alberquerque and New Orleans",My Body's at Home (But My Heart's on the Road),1972
