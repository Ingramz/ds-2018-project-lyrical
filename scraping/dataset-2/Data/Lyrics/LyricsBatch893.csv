Babyface,"Last night I laid with you
'Twas like a dream come true
I've never felt so right
I want you for the rest of my life

Maybe we should settle down
And raise a family
A girl for you
And maybe a boy for me
'Cause that is how much
That is how much
How much I love you girl

Sunshine
You brighten my life
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
Sunshine
You turn the darkness to light
And you brighten up the corners of my mind

You really do, yeah

Last night I prayed for you
That you would forever be cool
'Cause you brought back love in my life
And I gotta tell ya baby
The feeling it's so nice

So maybe we should just settle down
And raise a family
A girl for you
And maybe a boy for me
'Cause that's how much
That is how much
How much I love you girl

Sunshine
You brighten my life
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
Sunshine
You turn the darkness to light
And you brighten up the corners of my mind

Maybe we should settle down
And raise a family
A girl for you
And maybe a boy for me
That is how much
That is how much
How much I love you girl

Sunshine
You brighten my life
Sunshine
You make me feel alright
Sunshine
You turn the darkness to light
And you brighten up the corners of my mind",Sunshine,1989

Tender lover, tender love

Eleanor Rigby
Spends half her life all alone
No fault of her own
Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love it has a right to go

Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry
Well I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so broken hearted
Well I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

Don't ever give up
In spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us
There's more than enough
Keep lookin' for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want

Sky is the limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

My tender lover
Tender lover, tender love

Babyface,"Love never came between us
For love was too deep in our hearts
It's the silly things we do between us
That managed to tear us apart
But oh I believe if we work real hard
We can get through, through it this time
Girl just trust me and I will trust you
There'll be nothing that we can't get through

[Chorus:]
I love you, babe
In the scariest way
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
Though I'm hurtin' to say
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
In the scariest way
I want you, babe
To stay with me
I love you, babe
Though I'm hurtin' to say
I want you, babe
To stay with me

Trust never came between us
And that's just the way that we are
It's the crazy things we do between us
That managed to break both our hearts
But oh I believe that we can survive
Through anything if we'd only try

Baby, stay, won't you stay
Baby, stay, with me.....",I Love You Babe,1990
Babyface,"My friends tell me
That he's been cheating on you
And that he treats you unkindly
He's using you
My friends tell me
That he keeps messing around
And that your love is so blinded
You think that it's it cool

Well, he never sends you roses
He never kisses you goodnight
He never thinks about your anniversary
He says he don't have time

Well, I might be wrong to think
A little bit confused
That a girl like you is too beautiful
For a guy like him to use

[Chorus:]
What ever happened to chivalry
What ever happened to love and true honesty
What ever happened to chivalry
What ever happened to love and true honesty

My friends tell me
That he's been bragging about
All of the girls that he's doing
All over town
My friends tell me
He's putting you down
And you're so in love you can't tell
He is turning you out

Well, he never sends love letters
He never takes you out at night
He never wines and dines your heart
He says he don't have time

Well, I might be wrong to think
A little bit confused
That a girl like you is too beautiful
For a guy like him to use

Babyface,"Calling all cars
Calling all cars

I never thought that 
I could feel this way 
You came around and 
Brought about a change in me 

[Chorus]
I was a typical guy 
You came along and blew my mind 
You were runnin' fast 
I was runnin' slow 
Everybody said that it would not work 
Love came and set me free 
You were standing there to rescue me 
Love caught it, we thought 
Why can't we be in love, well 
Why, it's no crime 
If I'm guilty of love 
Let me do my time 
Why, it's no crime 
Everybody needs love 
And baby (so do I) 

You never thought love 
Came so easily 
No doubt about it 
Never in your dreams, no way 

You were a typical girl 
You came along and changed my world 
I walk slow 
You walk fast 
Everybody said that it could not last 
Love came inside of me 
Never knew how good our love could be 
Love caught it, we thought 
Why can't we be in love, well 

[Chorus]

I've spent half a lifetime 
Waiting for someone 
You say I know it was you 
They don't recommend it 
I don't understand it 
I've been reprimanded 
'Cause I'm in love with you 

Calling all cars
Calling all cars

You were a typical girl 
You came along and changed my world 
I walk slow 
You walk fast 
Everybody said that it could not last 
Love came inside of me 
Never knew how good our love could be 
Love caught it, we thought 
Why can't we be in love, well 

Why, why 

So do I, so do I 
So do I, so do I 
Oh so do I

Why",It's No Crime,1991
Babyface,"Deep in the heart 
Love has many ways 
Of touching your emotions 
Taking control of you 
And even in thought 
Love can make you change 
There's no way of taking control 
When it's part of you 

Well you could be a married man 
With two kids and a good woman 
And you could give your heart and soul 
I swear it don't mean nothin' 
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Boy makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm telling you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do 
When ever true love takes hold of you 

There's never a time 
Cause love will let you know 
Love appears at the worst and even the best of times 
Takes over your mind 
Your heart is not your own 
There's no way of controlling love 
It controls your life 

Well you could be a faithful girl 
With a good heart and good intentions 
And you could never leave your home 
I swear there ain't no preventions 
Cause love can pull you deep into a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Boy makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm telling you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do 
When ever true love takes hold of you 

There's nothin love can't make you do 
When love takes hold of you 
You can have the purest heart 
And the finest attitude 
But I swear that don't mean nothin 
When your heart's under a spell 
It will spin your mind around like a carousel 

I'm tellin' you love 
Love makes things happen 
You never know where it's coming from 
You never know who you're gonna love 
I'm tellin' you love makes things happen 
You never know what you're gonna do 
Whenever true love takes over you (Oh Baby)

Babyface,"I used to think that love was so silly
Something that a girl like me never dreamed of
And it all was for me (no not really)
But there was not a guy who was special enough
Until you came and made me so happy
Like a child on Christmas Day
I was so, so, so, so anticipating
And I didn't know I could ever feel this way

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
You bring me joy, you bring me joy, you bring me joy

I used to think that love was a mischief
Something that a guy just could not figure out
As if I never had no fancy stuff
Not even a clue what true love was about
Until you came and made life worth living
Like the very first day of spring
I was so, so anticipating
Girl, I didn't know I had love inside of me

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy

Oh girl, my, my girl
I never thought that I could love a girl the way I do
Oh boy, my my my my boy
I'm so glad that I found your love too

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy (x2)

You bring me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
You bring me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
Keep on bringin' me
Keep on bringin' me joy

Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love made me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger, danger of pain

You brought me so much joy
Love saw it, love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy

I just can't explain it
My heart can't contain it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy

Babyface,"Let's take our time and concentrate
The mood is right for living, ooh I can't wait
I've waited so long to be with you this special way
Don't be afraid, afraid to stay
And share your love with me this way

I understand baby it's your very first time
I'll be gentle with you baby, it's gonna be alright
And so if we're gonna be together tonight
I'll be good to you baby, sweet to you lady

When you go

But it's not enough
To satisfy emotions

I still love you

Does that love disappear

Babyface,"We fell in love and who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
Now they wonder
Why we didn't last
We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end

Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know 
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves
So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves
When everybody says to let it end
It makes me wonder
We can't let them win

And our feelings 
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know 
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion

And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we shoulda done
We'd both be here still making love
I want to know that, that we can go back
Back to a time when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love

And daddy did too
Did all they could

Made sure we had clothes and food

Had a friend named Bobby
Who always kept his word
We went through schoolyard fights
Had a thing for pretty girls

Didn't cost much money to
See the picture show
So we hopped the bus into town
That's where all the girlies used to go

Fifty cents would buy us popcorn for two
'Cause Bobby's girl, she worked there and
Sometimes she's break the rules
Picnics in the summer

Wouldn't wake up 'till noon
And even though Bobby's gone now
I can still hear him laugh
In the middle of June

I will love you any way, baby
Any way and every way I can
'Cause I'm that kind of man, yes

I will give you everything, baby
Give you more than any girl can stand
I'm gonna love you baby, baby, baby, baby

I'm talking 'bout makin' love in the shower at least an hour
And let you dangle in my arms 'cause love is power
Can you feel it? The sky's the limit once you reveal it
Your heart was wounded, God sent me to heal it

On a mission, ain't no stress, love
Touch you with precision, just undress, love
I know the right position, come on, trust me girl
Throw this rock up on your hand, I'll give you the world

I will love you all the way, baby
Girl that means this love will never end
I'll be your lover and your friend

I will take you anywhere, baby
Just say when and girl I'll take you there
I'm gonna take you baby, baby, baby, baby

We're going from Tahiti to France, to Italy in one night
Drop top Bentley coupe parked in the spotlight
And you can drive it laced in all white
I'm wearin' triple black, our gear is top flight

Trips to Venice, the man of steel when I'm in this
A match made in heaven when we blend this
Lovers everlasting, in other words endless
To love any other man would be senseless

Who satisfied my mental and physical thing
When I lay me down to sleep, I rest assured
With the thought that you are right, right next to me

This is how we'll start love anew

To touch their harps of gold

From Heaven's all-gracious King

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Nut up, cut up, and act a fool

I know you're mad you got to hate boo
Gon' wait it through, let's see what he gon' do

So one to one, man to man
He got to deal which you

Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine""

A year gone, and she seein' things most chicks only
Hear in songs (uh-huh) keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)
Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said

I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
Hatin cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you acting like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double cross you they got to triple cross me
(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh
(One more thing:
 If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'

Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine 

If I needed would you, give me your kidneys?
Catch a case you catch it with me? (fo' sho')
Pawn your jewelery to come get me? (You better know)
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (now that, I don't know)
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)
They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail? (uhh)
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
 that you was, throwing rocks, at the roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you balling, from the heavens, or the hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself
Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
Just continue to be my Sunshine

I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all

And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

I love you
I honestly love you

In another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss

She's superstar material (She can roll with me)
She's way past being beautiful (She can go with me)
You know, she makes me lose my mimd almost every single time

It's that sexy sweet perfume and the way she works the room
It's that naughty little smile, lets you know the girl gets wild
It's that air of confidence
What's she wants, you know she can and
She'll make you lose your mind when you look into her eyes

It's a world of fantasy
She's a girl of mystery
When walks into the club,
All of the players stop like, ""What?""
Watching every single move
They wonder who you're talking to

She can go, go with me
She can roll, roll with me
She can go, go with me
Make me lose my mind
Almost every single time
She's international

My hope is lost but somehow
I've gotta be brave
I know I'll find a way, yeah

So savage the heart that beats in you 
I can hear the laughter
So savage the heart that beats in you
And that's all that matters

You wanna hide your shame
From the town, deep inside your soul
Well the bones you've broken
On the trusting hand
And the moonlight promise
When we first met
Well I know there's justice
You're gonna get yours too
Some nights you'll look back
And wish that I was still there

Well, someday your heart will breakdown
But I just wanna tell, that you'll cry out and say

So savage the heart that beats in you
I can hear the laughter
So savage the heart that beats in you
And that's all that matters

[Chorus]

You're gonna call my name
On a cold dark night
You'll ask forgiveness
But I won't be there
For your savage heart",So Savage the Heart,1992
Babylon A.D.,"Please allow me to adjust my pants
So that I may dance the good time dance
And put the onlookers and innocent bystanders into a trance

Give disease so the swine will marry and propagate lies.
Tough luck for elected officials. The beast you see got fifty eyes.
Bring it on home, spread the wealth. Play it cool, the hand's been dealt.
Now, all the odds are in our favor. Save the victory speeches for later.

Streets on fire, the mob goes wild.

21 guns, box made of pine, letter from the government sealed and signed
Delivered Federal Express on your mother's doorstep.

Condoleeza Rice is nice, but I prefer A-Roni.
And that man on the T.V. who speaks to the dead, you know that man's a phony.
Everybody move to Canada and smoke lots of pot.
Everybody move to Canada right now. Here's how we do it:
Bum rush the border guard before he and his dog ever knew it.

I'm awake and my heart is still dreaming
It's 3:00 A.M.
Outside I hear the souls still screaming
It's been so long you know 
Since my head's been this clear
Just like a ship lost in the night
I just don't know which way I should steer
But I'll keep chasing my dreams
And only you can make them real
I pour my heart out every night
But do you know the way that I feel
Sometimes this is work
And don't you know sometimes this is play
Sometimes you are listening to me
And sometimes you don't hear 
A damn word that I say
Sometimes there's a girl 
Sometimes I go home alone
And I guess it's no wonder right now
That I do very well on my own
But I'll keep chasing my dreams
And only you can make them real
I pour my heart out every night
But do you know the way that I feel
And I will play just as long as you will listen
Now I'm in no big hurry to get back on the road
Sometimes in this lifestyle
I feel like there's so much that I'm missing
Well I'm missing you
It's just that I'm ... so far from home

To milky ways of stars with you

Please don't walk away
Give me a minute
Listen to what I have to say
I always put you number one in my life
Never thought we'd say goodbye

Mi amor te extraño
Cuando te siento lejos de mi
Vivir sin ti, me mata el dolor
Es que yo no soy nada sin ti
(No)

Siento en mi piel tus manos acariciándome
Te busco y no te encuentro amor
Es que yo vivo extrañándote

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasión
y me lleva volando hasta ti

Eres mi cielo, eres mi luz eres mi despertar
A ti te entrego todo sin mirar atrás
'Cause it's all about you and your future with me
Girl, it's so simple to see that this was destined to be

Abrázame, sentir que el tiempo es corto y se va
No existe la distancia en mi amor
Sera tuyo por la eternidad

Amándote, besándote y tu besándome
Descubro que estoy sintiendo que quiero morir
y amarte otra vez; sabes que

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Ouu tengo un amor que habita en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ah ah ah de mi pasión
y me lleva Volando hasta ti

Como le digo al corazon
Que ya no esta mas contigo
Sintiendo caricias tuyas si en verdad
No estas conmigo Cierro los ojos y te veo

Me refugio en tu recuerdo
y a la vez que pasa el tiempo
Me da miedo perderlo

Mi corazon se lamenta desde el día que tu te fuiste
Disimula estar sano cuando en verdad esta muy triste
Quiero saber si de verdad yo volverá a amarte
Quiero saber si siempre vivirá pa' recordarte

Tengo un amor que solo se alimenta en tu voz
No quiere hablarle ya al corazon
y vive lamentando tu adiós

Tengo un amor que vive en cada espacio de mi
Que se apodera ahahah de mi pasión
y me lleva volando hasta ti

You said there was no other
As you cheated on me

Just to learn the truth
So humiliated by the things that you do
Fooled by your deception
Tricked by your disguise
Never saw the secrets

I could be yours, you could be mine
But we both have other lives, play different games
Sometimes circumstances change but maybe someday 
I could be yours, you could be mine

Time drags on when you're waitin' for the perfect one
Someone to touch your heart, make a change

Like two trains runnin'
Down different tracks of life
Until our destination is the same 
We must play this waiting game
We gotta play this waiting game

Another dream, another dance
Our eyes meet, we take a chance
Seems we've been waiting for this moment far too long
When it makes us feel so right can it be wrong?
Reach out your hand, wade cross the line
This is the place, this is the time

And the girls who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed, look at me I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I'll be taking care of business (every day)

If you could make sounds loud or mellow

Tell them that you like it this way

You're always so far away

Down below, you used to tell the truth
Now, you're lookin' for something to say
You give me those eyes
And then look away

Do you want me down on my knees?
Are you livin' a lie?
Is this some kind of game
Baby, won't you tell me please?

Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Who do you love? What makes you happen
What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love? I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time
Who do you love?

I wish you'd lie or tell me the truth
So I can decide for myself
Maybe you've tried what we used to do
With somebody, somewhere else

They call the Rising Sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one.

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans.

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's all drunk.

Not to do what I have done
To spend their life in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun.

Approached me in his saloon and asked me to sit down

Was I unemployed or would I like a job
He said he owned the stage line and there were men who liked to rob 

He offered me his daughter's hand, an advance of salary
A fancy gun, a pair of boots, and a share in the company

Now I ride shotgun on his stage line
I ride shotgun on his life
I ride shotgun on his money
I ride shotgun on his wife
Shotgun rider, shotgun rider, shotgun

There were outlaws who waited on the trail
For the stagecoach daily run with payrolls and the mail

They spied our dust, and saddled up to ride
They saw the worried driver with me sittin' at his side

So they circled 'round the stagecoach it was their daily fun
Until they saw the driver smile and spied my trusty gun

We caught the outlaws and took them back to jail
Sent for the county marshal and would not post a bail

Sent 'em up the river. 
That sure cleaned up the town
I was elected sheriff. 
The mayor asked me down

I now own half the stage line and half the rest of town
I go to chuch on Sunday.

Bacilos,"Contigo se va, contigo se fue
En una mañana sin sol todo lo que quise ser
Contigo se va, contigo
Poco a poco acaba conmigo
Empiezo a caer, empiezo a entender
Que nada vale la pena 
Sin miedo a perder, si no exige cada día
Una mirada, un poco más.

Esperame corazón no vueles
Que sigue siendo hoy
Y dame otra miñatura antes de que se vaya el avión
Dejame una razón y enseñame que quieres luchar
Para que un día nuestras promesas se hagan verdad todas bajo el sol.

De lejos amor, desde muy lejos verdad
Colgados de una esperanza
Viendo el tiempo pasar, robandonos
Cada día lo que sea nuestra felicidad
Contigo se va, contigo se fue
En una mañana sin sol todo lo que quise ser
Contigo se va, contigo
Poco a poco acaba conmigo

Esperame corazón no vueles
Que sigue siendo hoy
Y dame otra miñatura antes de que se vaya el avión
Dejame una razón y enseñame que quieres luchar
Para que un día nuestras promesas se hagan verdad todas bajo el sol, sol, sol.

Ah, ah

Contigo se va, contigo se fue
En una mañana sin sol todo lo que quise ser

Bacilos,"No puedo reír
No puedo llorar
No puedo dejarte de recordar
No puedo decirte nada que tú no sepas

Tan solo puedo quedarme como un idiota
Pensando en cosas que me provoca
Hacer contigo en islas perdidas

No puedo gritar
No puedo exigir
No puedo contarte lo que sentí,
No puedo decirte nada, tú estás tan lejos

Y tú que no sabes nada y lo sabes todo,
Que me derrites de tantos modos
Dime pa' donde vas con mi vida

Carito el corazón
Me queda grande
Cuando yo pienso en ti, yo siento pasos de gigante
Carito esta canción,
Es importante
Porque cuando la canto yo juro que estás ahí delante
Porque cuando la canto yo juro que estás ahí delante

Se fue complicando la situación,
Y no hay que olvidarse que al corazón,
Le puedes decir de todo menos mentiras

Tú ibas para allá
Yo iba para acá
Y fue tan bonito verte cruzar
Al menos por un ratito por mi camino

Carito el corazón
Me queda grande
Cuando yo pienso en ti, yo siento pasos de gigante

And I knew I wanted her for me

Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work

So was my future bride

But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man

The art of money makin', murder, murder an' drugs
Hear what I say, don't play no games, this automatic hit ya'
They say these ladies shady, baby, keep your pistol witcha

Jump out four doors, let me get that there
Partna, leave it where you standin', sucka get somewhere
Lil' shawty, shake some, lil' shawty, take some
Shoot a G, bet a G, I say, I break some

Gotta get 'em, split 'em, let this hot heat penetrate 'em
My lil' buddies drop 'em on the spot, no hesitation
Better know 'bout that, we leave 'em stuck like four flat
Gear it up, you seen this here before black

Early mornin' to late night
Gonna give it to ya', just like you like
Lettin' this world know just what it be
Look, shawty an' dem, lay you down with hot heat

Forever grind on this here concrete
You can quote every word that I speak
Stay sharp, heavy starch in my crease
An' spit this slang like a automatic piece

You on your last an' only way of ever livin'
An' it's forbidden to even mention on what your life is riskin'
Gettin' fold, now whether you know, see you S.O.S
Put an S on your chest, see it ain't nothin' less unless you confess

An' go tell the rest on what is real, what is flawed
Where you been an' who you saw, nigga, naw
We won't fall for no broad an' all because see, we gonna pause
In the night, see they gonna crawl, so listen when we hit ya'
Comin' dead off to you fuckin' raw

Like underdogs, see, we gonna win, never was you just a friend
From way back when count to ten, now this shit is 'bout to end
So suck it in an' get a grip, make your move an' make it quick
Before you snooze, you gon' lose, dwellin' on that other shit

Early mornin' to late night
Gonna give it to ya', just like you like
Lettin' this world know just what it be
Look, shawty an' dem, lay you down with hot heat

Forever grind on this here concrete
You can quote every word that I speak
Stay sharp, heavy starch in my crease
An' spit this slang like a automatic piece

Now let me tell you how it go, man, shackled like the chain gang
Stuck off in this range, trappin', tryin' to snap my chain, man
Here, it's an ugly thang, I'm back on these streets again
Own the strength, I'm known to limp, everythin' is against da grain

Can't you tell? ATL, sack it up, make it sale
Fat sacs keep 'em comin' back, now they shop with Pelle
Pelle, big time playa, never scared, hill-top nigga, never fell
Terroristic threats, shawty, tell 'em that this here death or trill

Ain't no time, fuck around with crime, strap it up, sack up them dimes
Chill the Mo',[Incomprehensible] Billy Dee drankin', everyday livin' fine
Constantly stay on the grind, niggas, they don't fuck with mine
Hit 'em hard, one hit caught, the other two times can't fuck with mine

Early mornin' to late night
Gonna give it to ya', just like you like
Lettin' this world know just what it be
Look, shawty an' dem, lay you down with hot heat

Forever grind on this here concrete

If you want to see me for something, it's going cost ya cash
I see ya poking outcha jeans girl you acting bad
Oh, do that again with you nasty ass

Now shorty got her at the wood shack, throwing her back
Champagne, chicken wings, and bubble bath
Catch me somewhere outta town signing autographs
Still working street corners, straight serving them blacks
Them thirty-two fifth it for four and a half
I prefer a Chevrolet, when it's time to mash
And I smoke the 'dro weed, a hundred dollars a sack
I put up the big numbers nigga, check the stats

In the situation, no dentition, smelling good
But I ain't gonna feel her, touching up would be too easy

Fool A, see, D, and me

Watch you say the grade is,
Burn like acid reflux, somebone'll order up the Pheffer chickens
While I order up a smoked duck (Thank You)

We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight
Let Juke lick the plate, I re-rock the shape
Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake
Got gorillas with banana clips, who love to go apes

Mighty knife, just enough not inconsiderate ice

Or roll or roll down a bat, wonder what blow your mind

Get on the block, and get it gone
Raised up out of the factories, and then we sit it chrome

Do you have a speaking impediment bitch, or are you just at a loss for words
Oh-no actually I'm monogonous, all that talk was false you heard
So don't stall betty just slurp, of course I'ma tell you when
Oops my bad that's my mistake, I was just gonna tell you then
I just bought me 5 new Polos, 'cause see I'm partial to that logo
That horse is just so Bubba, that means rural like you don't know
Regardless though I'm gon' glow, even in my birthday suit

Then see me flee, high speed from eight cops
Leave 'em floored, showin how I'm opposed, y'all can't stop
Jumped the fence, went down the path, came out by Ms. Dot 'partment
Ay, ay Bubba Sparxx shoot we down to the spot
Them young G's up on that corner, done made the porch hot
Them folk say they sweepin, seekin 'He who hold stock'
Ay, run tell shawty, cut off, close shop
I told them boys down there, homes in the van was a NARC
Tell 'em ""Naw we don't sell that shit round here doc""

Hit the mirror make sure ya' boy leaned up
Brush up out the clean up, ya' team freezed up

Walkin' up in the V.I.P., I.M.P. when I walked by
Man, I, don't holla at no lame ho's
I go to the bar, get somethin' to sip on, for my folk

Man, this is how is goes down, where I stay
When them Tram boys done had a good day
Then I'ma buy the bar up, later on tear the car up
Flip a new one by the mornin', nigga back crunk

Good times, if you in the club blowin' good pine
Freakin' ho's while ya' car bein' stripped down
Sick now, nowhere for her to sit down
Ya' Escalade, man, it's sittin' on bricks now

Straight fresh off that drizzle boy you know who it is
It's them loud-mouth motherfuckers at it again
Poppin' bottles, cuttin' up, livin' life to the end

So lean low, if you feelin' like I'm feelin', let's go
Got a cup, throw it up, now hit the flo'

At the bar, we trippin', throwin' it up
Like kings in a castle, yeah we toastin' it up

So everybody, clap, and break it down
'cause we the same old fools slidin' through yo' town
So on yo' mark, get ready for this whole new era
Drankin' Patnaz is the name, it don't get no better

Stay workin' back do', till every sack is sold
I'ma hit you in the back wit' hot callico
If not then my rock, it I can hardly afford
Old school at the bar buyin' bottles of Moe

We swervin' Cheverolets up and down the road
When you hear ""Shorty in town"" hide ya' ho
'cause aww shit, lil' buddy fire the dro'
I stay, fresh a fool, keep a crease in my clothes

I'm puttin' on the scene, and let the champagne flow
I'm tryin' to get outta here wit' somethin' freaky to poke
You know what it is, you seen it befo'
We call him ""H2O, he froze ice cold""

Tell Sean to keep 'em comin', gon' and order one mo'

Backbone,"No ego trippin', just growin' old 
All up when I'm feelin' cold 
'Cause pain up on my soul seems to be all I feel 
Watchin' my family fall apart, was all I never wanted to see 
'Cause I got love for one another 
I'd kill for my only brother, even though he might be wrong 
At times I'm gon' do what I got to do to come through every scary moment 
Just brought us closer which kept us down 
Remember them days when southwest Atlanta wasn't even 'round 
So out the reds to wet it 
And say they actin' brains, relaxin' 
And steady stackin' and pistol packin' 
And trackin' is tired 
I set it off! 
I don't be sittin' in a trap slangin' lil' peewees 
Tell Mike, ""Damn I'm 'bout to mess up my re-up money"" 
See, I used to wear my shoes until I couldn't no more 
Now I hit the store, when the lace get old 
I wear Calhoun jeans 'cause I don't like Calvin 
I relate to my folks 
To make you think this 'bout my third album 
This supposed to be the times when the moon and the sky turn purple 
So watch this full circle 
Black wire touch red 
Red wire touch black 
Me and Big Slate got this drop wit some gator backs 
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how much I make 
He get the rims, I get the system and we leave him the tapes 
Ya know what I'm sayin' 
Who gives a damn about catchin' a charge 
It's been a while since I seen my boys 
One time for my potnas who got out today 
Back on the grind, did that time, got that hide-away 
Okay (that's right) 
I just got to say 
Two times for the crook who just got away 
It done got so quiet now, I can here a rat piss 
On cotton, one apple sport the whole 
Barrel rotten 
What it mean when you see the sun and the moon shinin'
At the same time 
This God's way, you dug your own grave 
The righteous path was laid 
But you chose to go astray 
Ay, out the war shit 
Wakin' up in a cold sweat 
Through the same ol' skit 
Genocide 
>From the inside, look a pit 
You lie, never killed nobody 
Let's take it to the ol' school 
No you can't 
Hands shakin' like a dog shittin' fish hooks 
Don't stare 
Can't help the crooked look 
It came with the face 
I used to steal from my folks 
But now I'm straight 
Went through the neighborhood rat's pockets books 
Ooh 
You missin' somethin' of value 
We have you, got you 
Jumpin', dumb bitch, you gets nothin' 
Nobody knows the trouble I have seen 
My homeboy MD write me from the ? 
24-7, hell or Heaven, it ain't no tellin' 
Will it be mo' sunshine for the due time felon 
They gave him 10, do 3, self year, probation 
Law leaders not, unto no temptation 
why'all know how it be 
You make a monkey move, lay yourself on the street 
You'll understand me 
They don't care nuttin' 'bout you 
In that cold cell 
Can't do nuttin' but take what them folk give me 
I'm dead serious 
Them folk givin' away time 
Just to show us the good Lord keep lettin' the sun shine
One time for them niggas who got out today 
And my folks on stokes
?? just westward on Olympian Way

Backbone,"One time
Uh for these freaky hoes I lust
But I'm still flickin ashes a lot of other motherfuckers snort dust
But that's they thang
A lot of us fall victim somehow
But that's that game
Won't try to explain
From books to bricks
Now I see crooks and tricks
Caught up in the mix
Of everyday in every way but the right
I control the substance my people fiend for at night
Lord knows I do wrong
Sound like the same old song
A lot of niggas singing
Homeboys conceal your weapons
Cuz ain't gon be no smoking section in heaven
No more be buckin your luck
Seven eleven on the first roll
Don't let the streets rock and roll your soul
Swats GA by way of Cascade Heights
Gunshots roadblocks sidewalks and ice

Sold me out for 3.5 grams of neighborhood clout
Now what the fuss be 'bout
I'm back home from the bullshit
Puttin in work
Meanwhile others dug ditches and covered themselves in dirt
One squirt
And you locked down forever
Can't run from reality
Luring you closer and closer away
To the same old traps
Now you never learn from your mistakes
And now you wear this ass whoopin with pride
What side you on?
It wasn't no I in team
Only in your dreams
Saturated with schemes
Yea you right, God gon deal wit ya
Fallin from his grace
Rookie moves cause shifty game
And 30 days I'm blessed in the hole
But that's till I go to the state federal
Penitentiary
Yea I could did my time standin on one feet
But see I fucked up royally
Thought I was slick
Them herpes-havin ass crackers changed my big check to six
Times wit Dean Whitaker's sermon of the day
But when I go to sleep I don't dream no more I just lay
A wise man knows his limitations
Concrete, concrete like Greg Street

Sufferin from a severe case of inner-city blues
I ain't got no clues to which directions I need to choose
This opportunity to gain is all I got to lose
Cuz I just can't settle for these streets shorty I refuse

That's the shit I like
Lord got the door
Shot down to the pavement
Remove yo hat under the ceiling
Of this building
A rebuff from the usher of sorts
Deacons leading hymns rooted stems
Most strive for the diamonds and overlook the gems
Got skimp wit yo bags
Boulders become shoulders to depend on
Which way to explore
Reform, refrain, we gain inflame
Every thought you walk through the trails is hell
Airborne for one
Clone me
Replace me wit me
Another nation inside a nation
Out the land of Scots
Suction cups to test tube
Layer of skin
Supply the crust
And we'll mix the fruit
Gunshows supplied me in the hour of need
Watch em bleed
Aryan Nation be the dealer
Now who's the killer
Yup yup that's the shit I like
That's the shit I like

Uh puttin forth the effort to make a change
Not doin a lot of talkin bout it what's yo game?
You slippin you can't never do that
That's when you get jacked
For yo life over your emotions runnin wild
Like salamanders swimmin in southwest creeks
Feelin incomplete
Another story
Livin you had it
Now you lost it wasn't worth it look what it costed
Yo life young nigga
Didn't go out without a fight behind the gun trigger
You better think fast or get swept off yo feet
Nigga it hurts to see these drugs deteriorate
The minds of knuckleheads that grow up to be base heads
Don't say I didn't tell you cuz you gon see in the future
I hope I don't have to shoot you
If you switch
Went from hardcore to beggin like a bitch
Revolutions good to bad
Hoods to rags real niggas to fags
What's the news?
But I refuse to lose

Sufferin from a severe case of inner-city blues
I ain't got no clues to which directions I need to choose
This opportunity to gain is all I got to lose
Cuz I just can't settle for these streets shorty I refuse

Well I woke up this mornin with the same frustration from situations like these
Got a call about some work from one of them temporary agencies
No high school diploma or any college degrees
I can't enlist but they'll draft me if there's a war overseas
Oh please
Of course I can slice some OZs
But see I'm one of those aspirin MCs
And uh bills are due so at times I'm doubtful and everyone disagrees
But I'd rather struggle on my feet than to live on my knees
So my uniform tight workin all night at Mickey D's
Got about 90 dollars and some change after the government
Get they fees
These minimum wages ain't enough to feed my babies
Purposely these limitations on black folks opportunities
So I quit cuz I'm tired of being one of those overworked
Underpaid employees
Stop carin at all went on and did a few small burglaries
It seems like my faith done turned into forgotten memories
And I ain't gettin away with nothing because I know He always sees
But see right now I need to see how I can get this here dope sold
I done stuffed in my pocket as many rocks as it can hold
They gonna get high so I'm gonna get my money even though it's freezin cold
Now how many times you done heard this story told?
Believe it or not, there's some very intelligent junkies
But dependencies is eating away at they souls like disease
Anyone can turn into somebody who covets and envies
Unequal economics can easily make you some enemies
And the crime rate never drops so the cops ride around in threes
I knew he would have killed me if I did anything but freeze
They found the rest of the dope in some nearby shrubberies
In a dimlit room being questioned by these authorities
And they gave me some time in correctional facilities
And now my woman's gotta take on a man's responsibilities",I Refuse Limitation,1998

Nothing but hard times, working this concrete

They was in my filthy, fiending getting closer
I'm in my seventy-nine, flying
Mobbed out so they can't see me when I'm riding
They slow me down, holla like we buddy buddy
But at the same time I know these motherfuckers want to mug me

There's something bout these guns that give these hoes asthma attacks
These are actual facts, I ain't been in no actual car-jacks
But let me tell you this, I'll burn a nigga ass up to a crisp
Riding with these two glocks, we goin' bounce on off, on the new shocks
My nigga don't hate me, cause I ain't hated, but we related
No one including me, should be underestimate
But don't you dare ride through the SWATS without, at least 30 shots
Cause I'm telling ya, these Southern boys goin' get all they got

Pop it in, get to work, brains blow, ?
Off the block before your carcass drop
Can't share nothing with the niggaoles, stealing socks
Out your cornbread dream too, if you got those, leaving deaf hoes
Brown, on the outside, pink, in the middle
Ain't, barring none hundred round draw
Nothing under seventy-five, and I get slick ?
Taking no prisoners cuffed, they die fighting for they freedom
Everytime son, rhymes too pretty'll get your mascara smeared
When they did, my buddy Spanky I bust out in tears
The world would be a better place to live, if it was less queers
I still see, punk ass bitches, bitches

Why'all from the section where the straight shit, straight up off the top
Block for block, yo we got the ??, wait for days
Gone up off the Purple Haze, when you see me call me Mr. Gipp
Shoot em from the hip, every time I'm in my 84 Sedan Deville
Block me off and watch me peel, Big Boi grill riding through the park
On the weekend ain't no stopping keep it dipping that's how we tripping
Looking mean, you too clean behind the glass
Watch yo' ass, keep yo' elbows out the windows

Rapped around crypto but never too good to blow 
A fifty-dollar O of Jam Toe you know sucka boy play Rambo 
Get sliced off the hambone its Slimm and Slick Backbone 
We get the track blown 
For a dollar Calhoun Scholar in a Caprice or Impala

See it take bread to make bread, we only count in grands

For a 500 Sedan and a spot in the sands

Never let the money and these broads break us

We act a fool cause the laws make us
Baby, you can't stop the hustle'

You walk your ass 'cross my yard, get off my grass
You want to get to that money, get off yo' ass
You wants to know my name, you wants to ask
If you want to see me for something, it's going cost ya cash
I see ya poking outcha jeans girl you acting bad
Oh, do that again with you nasty ass
I caught her coming out the mall, with 2 or 3 bags
Now shorty got her at the wood shack, throwing her back
Champagne, chicken wings, and bubble bath
Catch me somewhere outta town signing autographs
Still working street corners, straight serving them blacks
Them thirty-two fifth it for four and a half
I prefer a Chevrolet, when it's time to mash
And I smoke the 'dro weed, a hundred dollars a sack
I put up the big numbers nigga, check the stats
And I'm on the microphone with Gipp, Slimm, and Cass

[Chorus: x2]

[Big Gipp]
Since the trashman only run once a week
If I miss it, I'm wait 'til night and dump it up the street,
behind the Winn-Dixie
Quiver, never step or kept up his penny drawers
To get an applause, appeared to have no flaws
In the situation, no dentition, smelling good
But I ain't gonna feel her, touching up would be too easy
 
Sleazy, measly, looking ugly like a person trying to sell me a dub
Fool A, see, D, and me
Trees ain't my reason for sending your ass to grave and
Watch you say the grade is,
Burn like acid reflux, somebone'll order up the Pheffer chickens
While I order up a smoked duck (Thank You)
Get the gas to go, at the corner sto'
Keep my hand on the nine piece
In case somebody want to disturb the peace (Always keeping my eyes open)
Cause you, can't, stop the hustle

Well I'm known for my shine, Southside
Eyes on the prize, it's Mr. Fly Guy
Mobbing, '68 Chevy, door vault ties
Jumped out mugging like I'm holding twenty pies
Rocked up, work on the block,
We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight
Let Juke lick the plate, I re-rock the shape
Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake
Got gorillas with banana clips, who love to go apes
Southpaw, side-strapped, known to leave yellow tape
Try and stop the hustle and crushed like grapes
Just for the taste, just for the taste

Backfire!,"Buried in the fields
I see the fields under a peaceful sky
I wonder if we ever realized
That on this ground here in these fields
A lot went down back in our history
Many men stood here on this land
And fought their battles 'till the bitter end
They came here to free us from tyranny
They gave their lives for you and me
Now the grass is green and the land has healed
But I know there's a lot buried in these fields
The war that took place here on this land
The ghost of the past now in gods hands
The tyrants that once rised and fell
Now strickened after life in hell
A time of fear that we once knew
When tanks shook this ground
When the eagles flew
When the guns were fired and the bombs rained down
Death and despair lay on this ground
Now the grass is green and the land has healed
But I know there's a lot buried in these fields

We've got to break the public peace
Force those suckers down to their knees
We've got to make them show
That suit and tie guy can't play with us, oh no

We've got to stick together as one
Our fight ain't over, it has just begun
We've got to break the public peace
To save the ones we love, the kids, the trees

So tell your mommy you won't be home for dinner
And tell your daddy you do what he was too scared for
The fight for freedom within yourself
Don't rely on others, it's your choice and no one else's

We won't cut our hair to get a job
We won't act macho to become a cop
We won't suck your dick to be in your scene
We won't wear a suit that's what you call clean

We've got to let them hear our voice
If we want to survive, it's the only choice
We've got to go back to the basics of nature
To discover we're a hell of a creature

Break it, break it, break the public peace!

But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car
To get to you, I'd walk a thousand miles

I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

When you talk, does it seem like he's not
Even listenin' to a word you say?
That's okay, baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away

Does he leave when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please, I'm on my knees
Prayin' for the day that you'll be mine

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give to you

Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside, oh
All the money in the world could never add up to
All the love I have inside, I love you, baby

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
All everything I have is for you
You've got what I got, you you
What I need, my love is all I have to give
All that I have is for you

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you

I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again

I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes

I promise you from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything that I am

Oh, there are no guarantees
That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch
But what I'm trying to say to you
I've never said to anyone

I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again

That she wasn't my only one

And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

About the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in misery
When I was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
And I, I got a little place nearby

Julie was a long way from home
She can make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of her landscape
Riding her bike through alphabet city

She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise
She said ""what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?""
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe

That the consequences of your actions really are just a game
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world

Julie likes to shop lift in stores
Right alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop
And make love on the floor until the camera made us

And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,
""What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?""
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe

And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out

As he mushed on through the snow

Backwoods Boys,"On one cloudless morning I stood on the mountain,
Just watching the smoke from below,
It was coming from a tall, slim smokestack
Way down on the Southern railroad.

It was 97, the fastest train
Ever ran the Southern line,
All the freight trains and passengers take the side for 97,
For she's bound to be at stations on time.

They gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,
Saying, ""Stevie, you're way behind time.
This is not 38, but it's Old 97,
You must put her into Spencer on time.""

He looked 'round and said to his black greasy fireman,
""Just shovel in a little more coal,
And when I cross that old White Oak Mountain
You can just watch Old 97 roll.""

It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville,
And the lie was a three-mile grade,
It was on that grade that he lost his air brakes,
And you see what a jump that she made.

He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour,
When his whistle began to scream,
He was found in that wreck with his hand on the throttle,
He was scalded to death by the steam.

Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And at 1:45 he was due,
For hours and hours has the switchman been waiting
For that fast mail that never pulled through.

Did she ever pull in? No, she never pulled in,
And that poor boy must be dead.
Oh, yonder he lays on the railroad track
With the cart wheels over his head.

97, she was the fastest train
That the South had ever seen,
But she run so fast on that Sunday morning
That the death score was numbered 14.

Now, ladies, you must take warning,
From this time now and on.
Never speak harsh words to your true loving husband.
He may leave you and never return.",Wreck of the Old 97,1995

Not everyone will know what's ahead
How could you know that I was sad
'Cause little did you know what you had

There was a time when I was young and blind
Could not see 'cause of my one tracked mind
There was a time when I was betting high
Too many things to do before we die

You're playing hide and seek
What you find is yours and always to keep
Revolution ain't for the weak
Don't double cross a river too deep

Could not see 'cause of my one tracked mind
There was a time when I was betting high
Too many things to do before we die

Always a beginning and always an end
But not very often anything in between

How can I make it on time
There seems to be no reason no rhyme
Can you face another day
When you have nothing left to do or to say

Could not see 'cause of my one tracked mind

Watch the gangsta haters close 'cause they worse than dope fiends

Cause I'ma make things get better for me

Better go around and when it come to you

Without the coastal juggle

Always, strays try to follow me home
To get the pooper scooper, why? They dropping doo-doo
I'm stepping on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashing full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail

Hit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
I want em close enough so I can lock on em
With the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em
Check this out here man, I lick em, sick em
Man's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, 
Fleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?

Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG

We the passion for smashing and mashing the masses
Knocking niggas like cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cause for the cash in my own zone we known for blasting
Busting, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch

Where do hungry and the needy-greedy's got to eat? {But who cares?}

Down ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys
Pumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in
And hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall
Ran to the window, put my eyes to the sky
To see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy
I sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine
My bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine till next year come
I try to see the same thing, they got us brain washed dumb
And when you find, it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot
Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got
You got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people
When wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas

Chestnuts roastin' on an open fire
Singin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle
I didn't pop, I ain't even shout
I even stayed in the house, where the homies tried to sneak me out
And all I want for Christmas is my 6-4 Chevrolet
And a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly
Ain't that somethin'? Nah, ain't that nothin'
How it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'
Everybody happy, hair still nappy
Gonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy
Catch me giving out turkeys at the church-house
Don't try to work me, just stand in the line and everything gon' be fine
Holla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down
Ain't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound
And we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs
Christmas on the Row, can you dig it? {can you dig it}

Christmas Eve, by the leaves, every 6 with the year
Girls and boys full off joy with the season cheer
Smell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked
To be ate after everything gone off your plate
But wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice
On the table, are we able to proceed tonight?
I wonder what the morn's bringin' so it's hard to doze off
Three 'o clock in my socks I crack the dope song
Hopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa
Now who the hell is this in this blue bandana
Messin' with the boxes that's up under the three
Look like Santa Claus been crossed to a woman to me
Now I'm comin' to see, the whole picture gettin' clearer
How we have messed I says best get nearer
Mirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've be deceived
And thank the same trick for the gifts I receive

When we blast testin' marks you ain't fit to live a day here
Best to keep your heat and hold your post you wanna stay here
It sure ain't worth askin' why I stay so high
You don't irritate my mind
And I ain't got time if it ain't about a dime
The fat pace, crack chase, played out with ces
It's getting rich with Low Life's and's it's put on my chest
And fuck a high speed chase, gettin' laced with slugs
And stuck steppin' off a plane duct taped with drugs
I'm trying to live my life to the fullest extent
You crossed my clique noe you know what them bullets just meant
We keep it hittin' hard bangin' corners bouncin' up the boulevard
Smokin' somethin', niggas dumpin' hollerin' bout ""life is hard""
Just cause we ride to live, mean somethin' gotta give
I don't care who you are, live like a ghetto star
Life is only one time, that's why we hate one-time
Tryin' to live my life, my life under the sunshine
That's why I live, when they get deep I hold my breath
And here's my only reply when he asks me 'bout death
I said, ""I never could picture me dead,
Could only see my life is lavish and obviously
I can get it so I gotta have it""
And you can live your life forever scarred
But I'ma ball 'till I'm gone livin' life as a ghetto star
Bentley coups, mini mansions like Snoop
And watch full of rocks, million dollar speed boats, yachts
All the time I got. is spent on some hood shit
Pray when I see the break of day on some good shit
Hit the liquor store to get some blunts for the dope
Man if I ain't high, can't cope
God help us
You hope to hear us holler his name
He know we stuck in all this sea and chasin dollars and fame
When will it end
The pain and the pressures of life come at once
And the only remedy is some drinks mixed with blunts
The lord knows what goes on behind closed doors
And it's tewntey five to life with those ho's with gold ?bows?
Catch you at your momma's hose slippin'
Gang bangers from the game we ride when it's time for dippin'
Kill the cops, fuck they law, they ain't arresting me
Life is jail without bars and ghetto star is my destiny

The money makes, murder the kids, and gangbangin
The stock market crashed, they watchin my black ass
You pop em for fast cash so we dies over dollars
Get wise hold the knowledge, we rides know the choices
The key to the future, the devil he wanna shoot ya
Fuck em they call us niggs I'm tryin to make a livin
Do some touchin, you know I'm pretty good with the bustin
Trustin nothin you can buy if your money in discretion
We'll beat you and car jacks and leave you wit a concussion
We the gang, we mash and blast and maintain
Still the same, just fuckin wit a brand new thang
Bang, bang, take that, nigga 'fore we skirt out
Aint gotta say shit already put the word out
Ya heard how the thang goes down around us
We playas, so haters can't clown around us
On point, big fat blunts and joints
And get drunk, this cold world, they aint givin a fuck
About you livin let alone you livin it up
Niggas is stuck, I'm tryin to keep my head above water
Not stressed about dyin for a quarter in a shorter
My time get the heart of my rhymes, get a nigga get better with time
And wonderin how I'm goin by, can't help it in the heat of the
Heartless hood, it's all good

You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin
Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life
You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin
Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life
You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes
But you know what...
You cant change who the fuck you are
You's a motherfucking nigga for life

It's all sowed up, in the LBC
Bitches breakin bread when they see the lil ass gee
I keeps my finga on the trigga cuz I'm down for this bangin shit
Quick to do it for the cause bitch I smash for my dogs
So don't get close to my nine
Cuz if you do you in store to see your nigga do the crime
Sirens goin off, niggas bowin down
Now you know about to rip gut fools ready to clown
Nigga fuck you bitches, and you hoes and you sluts
You tricks don't know what the fuck's up
On the eastside we ride, nigga 24 / 9
Tryin to keep my hands on somethin nigga at all times
Ready for war now that my pockets got bigger
You other fools die when I ride for my niggas
Cuss, bust, and fuss and kick up dust
What you laughin at nigga don't get your bitch ass rushed

You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin
Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life
You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin
Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life
You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes
But you know what...
You cant change who the fuck you are
You's a motherfucking nigga for life

As a child I was wild as fuck, and down to dump
And kept a sawed off brown to pump
And my reputation never takin time to thank
Role models, holdin bottles, as we ride and drink
Livin right and plottin how to come up off the bottom
Black stockings in our pockets and I pocket profits
Fuck a school, I tuck a tool and start steppin
First lesson, aint no question, you gotta have protection
Sheets on the streets showin niggas defeats
And most beef don't cease 'til the trigga release
Livin hard, givin scars, gettin noise from hustlin
Slangin gangbangin run a game in musslin
Trustin nothin, sayin fuck it is the slogan
Everywhere we go we off the chronic and the potion
>From the ocean to the city to the valley to the bay
Niggas on the mission for the cabbage every day
Cutthroats, gunsmoke, dope and hoes
What controls niggas souls on the streets I roll
Bold letters think the gangs where I bang is at
Saints, Cowboys, Steelers and Raider hats
Though I know we all the same no matter what we claim
If you a nigga you a nigga and that aint gon change
We love Martin Luther King but respected Malcolm
Cuz he didn't give a fuck about the outcome

You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin
Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life
You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin
Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life
You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes
But you know what...
You cant change who the fuck you are
You's a motherfucking nigga for life

You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin
Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life
You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin

What have we? - a house full of Cavi, no stress
Well known riders from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes licking up, so hard we're sticking up
How could the East Coast win; when the West Coast is clicking up?
So please, no set tripping about Cs and Bs
It's the Westside connected with the D.P.G.s
For the cheese we're jab with the gift of the gab always capping
Mack 10 and Snoop rapping, now how does that happen?
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood
So now you despise, cause it came to your surprise
Two well known enemies now becoming allies
In Californ-I-A; we parley the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport (Blue and Grey!)
But gangsters don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside connected with the Dogg Pound Gang

We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
We are party people, West Coast gangsters are party people
(Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll) (Rock the party ya'll)
Party people, party people, do you wanna get funky?
Get down, get down, you know

Up jump the boogie, so I've jumped up with it
We smoke weed by the ounce, no hit it
It's a party, Bombay and Bacardi, O.E. and Hennessy
We're all heated just in case, any of my enemies slipped in
Tripped in, you don't wanna own a casket this soon
Get at the bitches, nigga, bump to the boom
The ladies love me cause I love myself
I'm like an age, by no wine in time you'll find
I'm at the top of the shelf
So when you ready and you're cracking a sip
Strip, trip, slide around your house in your slippers
Bump the rap tunes that's as cold as the Whispers
Fantastic, brand new in this classic
We done mellowed out but you still get your ass kicked
It's Mr. Bad Azz, I rock microphones right
West Coast, East Side, for life!

It ain't no need for the fronting black, between me and you
Reality bites, so I'ma keep it real with my crew
I'm dangerous like Michael Dew
My life cycle completes the last stages
I'm more, I'm through, definitely gauges is outrageous
Cause I was born to rock the party
Oh! now you're Mister Smarty because we got the show started!
I'm cold-hearted, and won't stop what I'm revealing
Leave it up to the West to have them dancing on the ceiling
And I'm feeling, that Vibe that represents the East
I attack like a pack, to make them burn like grease
So let the nonsense cease, and hold my piece in case
Reel-to-reel come to deal, I have to give them a taste
I serve face to face, rhymes define by Tech
Versatile style done switched up to wreck your whole set

That's real, you know
It's getting kind funky here man, uh

Mack 10 is the lick, Dogg Pound is the clique
I can't get enough of this gangster shit
My name ain't +Jeru+ and I ain't out to +Dama-ja+
But when on the mic, emcees, to me, they're all amateurs
See the opponents, disassemble the components
Disassemble the opponents, then disappear in a moment
In a blink's time, I take time in the doorway to crime
With a criminal mind, the raw kind
Microphones used so abusively
You can't fuck with the K-U-R-U-P-T
And in the mixture, painted clearer than a picture of a psycho
I'm suicidal, split shit to cause a twister
And get you twisted, you're fucking with the unlisted
To be specific, niggas ain't being realistic
I ain't impressed, you're about to get your chest test
In the west, where it's about your money and your set

You East Coast niggas flow like the home grown grow
Zoo got the flavor, every color for the rainbow
Dream, on out far, pass the stars
Your styles ain't doper than ours
Hard to the core, hit it one time, hit it some more
Y'all spit but that West Coast shit is out doors
Wild like Ninety Days in the cage
Cold like the Everglades, and never fades
Me, C to the Z to the T
Beef? Bet' not let me catch you in the streets
Hoo-Bang, cracked in the fast lane
The melody by Deadly, the Dopeman

Yeah yeah yeah, there you have it
It's like magic, it's so tragic
The West Coast, Hoo-Banging, Westside Connection, L.A. Zoo
L-B-C Crew, and you know about the infamous D.P.G.s
We make them freeze to their knees, real Gs

[Bad Azz]
I'm so proper - I came up like a liqour store robber
I'm so L.A., like the Dodgers or the Lakers
Man I put money on players
On the corner, with the Mayor of Pomona
So break down, bitch, in a serious fashion
If the pimpin' don't kill you than I'm forced to blast ya
It's a paper thang, it ain't about the pussy and dick
It's the difference between you walkin' and you pushin' a whip
See it's a major type of paper, caper, motivator, playa, neighbor
Haters hate us, I don't give a fuck if you don't play this later
I'm to the strip, I gotta check my money makers

[Suga Free]
You might not ever get rich...
So you might as well go ahead and bust you a bitch...
Nigga, now if I hang around nine squares (I would be the dif')
And if I hang around nine fools feelin' loose (I would be the dif')
But if I hang around nine projects a mile (I would be the dif')
And if I hang around nine rich business men (I would be the dif') 

Now if I had wings - I'd fly
And if if was a fifth - I'll be alright
It ain't so sippin' in my pimpin'
(They don't know)
We got them regulars trickin'
(We got it crackin' on the stroll)
And I know sometime when I pee I forget to lift the seat
But she don't cook, clean, cash every night, and her hair's always neat
Nah nah, get gone
Don't forget to remind me to whoop your motherfuckin' ass as soon as we get home

Now this is dedicated to hoo-bangin', slangin'
Catch heat from this motherfuckin' dirty rap game
I won't tell you nothin', that you might have been told
I won't sell you nothin', that you might have had bought
Just fuck wit cha nigga cause I stay low gold
Quick to blast moms and pops and the dog To-to
You don't know me nigga, so keep my name out your grill
If I see you on the streets I'm just gon' keep it way real
They know again, keepin' that shit gangsta cuhz
I got my head on straight, with my brain on buzz
Trust a slug, when it slip the AK's flip
Squeezin' on the trigger yellin' Rollin' 20 Crip
Walkin' through the shadow of death, I see my shadow on my left
Grip tight with the heat on my right
Will I make it through these fucked up situations?
I'm headed to Dogghouse, so D's paper chasin' (motherfucker)

[Bad Azz talikng]
All the motherfuckers who tellin' it's alright now
Ey,nothin' can stop us from doing our motherfuckin' thing
God dammit

[Verse 1]
From sunrise to sunset,one life one God
The universe and the rear out to the blocks they don't care about
Seein' hope till every hood fill with hopelessness
And hopelessness is enough to get the hustle back crackin'
Now you can tell the story to your friends back home
Back home they missin' ""back"" 'cause a nigga been gone
So long,to all the homies that God called before me
Now without y'all here me and the homies gettin' lonely
Wonderin' who gon' the next to experience death
It get deep around here,fo' real hold your breath
Just thinkin' about ya lookin' at the stars as they glistenin'
It's hard to put the puzzle together with pieces missin'
In the places where the love is gone with no traces
Tryin' to eat of sellin' drugs,we goin' from catchin' cases upstate
To our concrete wars with sad faces and the freedom costs more
Than a House so we ain't sleepin'
I'm stuck tryin' to touch me a buck and can't grind
'cause they ate us and the punk one time
I keep it strapped at the homegirls spot
If we get hot we get bad and give 'em all we got
We hittin' back,think twice about bringin' your gat
To where we at we nuthin' nice when it come to all that
And fuck a fight I'm too much in love with life
And gettin' cash and I don't know how long it's gon' last
You understand

[Chorus]
Gotta get yourz,gotta get mine
We gotta hurry,'fore we run outta time
Yo,as addition I'll be outta my line
I'm lovin' my life
Too much to be wastin' my time
Gotta get yourz,gotta get mine
We gotta hurry,'fore we run outta time
Yo,as addition I'll be outta my line
I'm lovin' my life
Too much to be wastin' my time
I'm on the grind

[Verse 2]
Just drinkin' this hot wine and dealin' with hard times
And keepin' my feet in shoes the horrible keepin' loose
It only shows me bad what happens ain't somethin' good
They funny 'cause it's the money what happen off in the hood
They replaced the love with hate in different (?)
I tried to smell 'em and liked 'em and tried though again
Pills is equals(?) ???? where we goin' from here
Is what you showin' me ??? I only do what I fear
I got love for real niggaz from here to over there
All my Long Beach niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
All my Jersey niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
You can feel 'cause I'm real and I'm killin' just to live
With my New York niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
All my Georgia niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
All my Texas niggaz that keep it real enough to feel
And Arizona they be killin' just to live
What!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From a helpless child to a hopeless man
I got bait that's overshadowed in this hopeless land
When money splits friends apart and broken hearts cause
Guns to spark when we pray it don't start
They say it's all bad but it's not,you see it's all good
When it could be that's really how it should be
It would be real (?) instead of (?) help each other to live
Knowin' how hard it is all of this is dedicated to y'all for life
One Love,my niggaz get ya Thug on
It's a real cold to have to kill Just to live
And these Long Beach streets ain't really made for the kids
It's a real cold game to have to slang just to eat
In the lowdown shang(?) you got that thang just to sleep
See niggaz like me we be real enough to feel
You can feel me 'cause I'm real and I kill you just to live

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
California niggaz we be killin' just to live
'cause Chicago niggaz they keep it real enough to feel
All my Oregon niggaz the ones who killin' just to live
'cause Loiusianna niggaz keep it real
What about my Michigan niggaz the ones who killin' just to live
'cause in Arkansas they keep it real enough to feel
Down in Florida y'all they keep it real enough to feel
Out in Vegas they be killin' just to live
What!

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz talking]
Imagine that,we got the whole world out here killin' just to live
That's a goddamn shame,you gotta get yourz I gotta get mine
Put a rush on it 'cause we runnin' outta time

The play pen party is popping, it's strait line up
It's an after Aftermath party and my bed's smelly bottom
Oh you gone, I see real weird 'til it's over
When we leave, we goin' peel out in the limo wit the chauffeur
Wit the doja, gat, Congnac and some soda, (c'mon, see man)

Who make 'em chat? Angels rule the world
Who make these niggas want to leave their girl? (Kola, Kola!)
Who got the turk to the dirt? Throwing nose and dope
Got niggas cumming from the lyrics I quar (Kola, Kola!)

Money makes girls, take bitches, make niggas
Take money by the motherfucking gun
See I'ma gangsta from the East side, the L.B.C.

Oh you gone? I see it real weird 'til it's over
Where you at? We still smoking and this is Conyiac

It's only one way, Dogghouse is doing movies
Fun stack to unlimited, riches with intentions
Regulate every aspect of the game

That got me and Angels choked out (no doubt)

Step up wit quiet and I could get us

Three, two, one, it's at the NFL like the thing just begun
I'm fucked up, I can't believe I'm still looking at butts
I can't quit, I'm off the hizzle with this kinda shit
It's goin' be all away, done before we trying to split
When it's this kinda party, we always act dope
Now you all doped up and you think ya mad dope
Gotcha homegirls talking to you, glasses of, damn
I done, drank all my 'gnac and Cola, whats up Chan?

Know I, not tap, no hats, nothing but hand claps
Slap the pistol cause my holsters snap, and dudes get snapped
Time to act up, and I could definitely dig that
We got's to get paid to snitches masses, my decision is made
Why y'all bought, why y'all paid

I hear everybody say they put they heart into they music
Blessed with the time, I want to share this piece of my life with y'all
I mean all y'all
I dedicate this to the whole wide world
And everybody who's in love with life, feel me, you know what I mean
(Life is full of hard times and then you die)

I gotta thank God for real life 'cause man invented violent death
My generation's in love with sin, I want to live
I want to see some more kids, Martini, stress, a little head
'Cause my son ain't here and only God cures fears
Ain't no woman 'bout a dollar, 'cause what we need, we got it
Even God gave it to us, so one of his people bought it
See change, that's ??? ??? favor this time
He sent the angel to sprinkle some flavor on this rhyme
Sent the poor folks, rice, chicken wings and hope
And for Christmas all the kids got brand new coats
I got a letter from my uncle in jail, he said he love us
Ain't no life in this hell, and only friend is God above us
I told him 'hold on', Pac said 'life goes on'
And what's the price of freedom, if they was wrong we could teach 'em
Damn, you don't know the strength of together
We in the house of smiles if outside this bad weather 'til the sun comes

(Chorus)
In the ghetto we hang all day, play all night
Gotta give thanks for life
In the ghetto it's on all day (it's on), just keep it tight
In the ghetto we hang all day, play all night
We gotta give thanks for life
In the ghetto it's on all day (it's on), just keep it tight

I gotta thank God when I wake up and pray before I go to sleep
And hustle all day, 'cause life ain't cheap
The cost of living is an arm and a leg, so crawl around
Tryna' eat and get back on your feet
If you could sleep, you could try this everyday of the week 'til you deceased
You could sacrifice your life to see peace, with all the grief
Can't buy you a minute of sleep, so stay up
Smoke a blunt and get drunk, like us, don't give a fuck
Thugged out all night, 'til the sun come up
Ridin doubles on a bike, probably playin with my life
Sayin 'that's the police' when we see some headlights
They dead right when they tell you that life ain't long
But keep it tight, and it'll be aight
And I don't lie about nothin, know the truth about me, I be for real
If I lie, you don't know how I feel
It's hard to love the place
somethin you ain't never had the structure to feel

(Chorus)

Before I go I want to leave this here, with your acceptance
This experience here, has really sharpened my perception
And I'd love to stay, but we all gotta go
Take ya patience, it's a while before you reach ya destination
It's a lot of love here, it's just mixed with all the hate
And I been waitin, I ain't seen no fallin stars or no comet
I was lookin for a sign he said 'I'm it'
I hit the blunt and dumped the ashes and told the homeboys 'stop it'
What gangstas gotta do as saviors and prophets
Nothin, ain't no connection at all
Except the fact that we created by the All Mighty God
That ain't enough to stand up and clap your hands for this song
'Ain't no supportin Him by myself, I can't stand up for the cause'
Damn, you don't know the strength of together
Didn't wonder when they talked about the power in numbers
I'm the ghetto and I love the hood, what you wonder

[Bad Azz]
The world built like a jail, Long Beach ain't nothing but a cell
Today's paper read, Four injured, Two killed that's real
Life ain't getting no longer, Let's get it popping here
Really though, Just like the song is
In life, it ain't nothing I fear
With young rapper got millionaires stealing my lyrics
That's the truth, In all of this essence
And what's a few Gs? Please when you're rich with more blessings
I don't trip, What comes around, goes around again
Like I own the car of the trunk that they found you in
And ain't no telling like Jack told Helen
They'll sell you a key, but not to open the door to heaven
You was talking to the judge, when it could have been the Reverend
Tell him, you should have been free, it could have been me
What would it have tooked for us to see that life ain't easy
Believe me

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
Life will throw you a job, know you've been robbed
And purposely leave you, stuck when you're down on your luck
Life will lock you in the cell, praying to heaven just to get out of hell
It seems to be to me it ain't no way out
Life will break a nigga, picking up the pieces, ain't the easiest
I wake up every day just knowing there some Gs to get the gang
Cop a few, watch out for the obstacles
 
Tripping off the politics
Wondering what the cops is doing and they just chilling there and lock me up
My homie was scared, he from them, and they just shot him up
He didn't die, but he cried through the stress
and that's a real hard way to learn a lesson
Yes, indeed it hurts to bleed
You've gotta be as strong as Hercules to deal with this
and don't get killed with this
Cause you know that'll hurt ya mothers heart
and where do we go after we done torn our earth apart singing

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
I'm just here, trying to maintain
I let the good times be the medicine for the pain cause life's a headache
I have you bed sick or even dead quick
Cause doctor said to think straight, you need you're head kicked
Left the hospital with stitches, walk and feel like its over like
What could be worse then the police pull us over
Resist the trip and ask the cops
Why you stopping us? Shouldn't you been looking for the trench coat mafia?
He say we look like the type to blast and get popular
Na, we love life more than that, and God's watchin us
It's hard enough for what's up, like for having nigga ? up
Living out his truck
And some times it hurts to live
Doing all this work to live, just to die
I hope my life is justified
I know I'm breathing for a reason, maybe even a purpose
So don't live like you're life is worthless

California's just a dope spot
Home where people sleepin' with they dope locked
Crack spot, jackpot, rob you with a black glock
Cash in my stash, bought my last on a 'Llac drop
It's that, somethin' old school with a ragtop
We tall cans, and tattoos
You smoke weed, we match you
With tank tops, Levi's, and house shoes
We in the alley or the front on the curb
We in the city with the cavi or the valley with the herb
We just the home of gang bangin', keepin' one off in the chamber
County time, and everyday it's on the grind
We got the ghetto bird, sheriff's, and the sea shores
The earthquakes, but that ain't what you packin' heat for

Man, the game ain't changed a bit

It's still - low lifes with the hammer cocked
And you chill, before you find your life half a block
from the spot that I pulled this and shot at that bullshit
You talkin', I'll pull quick and turn the light out in your house
It's on, cause if it ain't, it's grown
Might have to bank that Brougham that's on them Dayton's, that's to make a getaway
We known to start a riot, we ain't home if it's quiet
We wired, we never sleep, and we rarely get tired
We on fire, I wil' out and clap that ass up
You heard of Juvenile bitch, ""Back That Azz Up""
c'mon!, get with it, jump on it and hit a corner with me
I'm on one 'til God come and get me - feel me?
Cause ain't too many niggaz thuggin' like this though
You buggin' like you ate a couple slugs from my pistol

And L.A.'s a playground when you fuckin' with us
(Check it out) My homie asked me could I get him some head
I hooked him up with a bad bitch he slept in the bed with
And that's just a small thang to a giant

If you don't want it, don't buy it
If you gon' suck it, don't bite it
And if you got the feelin', don't fight it
Too many choices make a nigga confused
So find somethin' to do before your life is through

I'm looking for the 105 getting off the 405
Be with this bad bitch, she living in the south
I'm met her at the club with my nigga Gotti
5-3, thick, with a lot of pride

[Kurupt (Snoop Dogg)]
That's what I love about the homes (What's that?)
Its just like a nigga getting trained, the homie spittin game
This shit makes no sense
I'm trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents

[Bad Azz]
Money and funny niggas don't mix at all
And Cali's the perfect whether to get your chips and ball
So you can touch it while you're here or die without
I'd rather have it, since it really don't matter

[Chorus: x2]
The world spin around much longer
They thought that the West Coast leave
But we still be float
Mo' money 2 fold
Nigga ice cold
Mo' money 2 fold

[Kurupt]
A G is a G which we all know
A bitch is a bitch as a hoes a hoe
Watch as I strut these, cousin, I'ma bank æem bank æem
Dammit, it feels good, gangsta

[Bad Azz]
Its three gangstas in a Cadillac
With TV's, CD's, some weed and three weeks
Chucks and French braids, blunts and gold chains
Hats and white T's, fag acts like police

[Snoop Dogg]
When we on the East Coast we get nothing but love
All up in the club, DJ holla'd out who we was
I looked around, seen some MC's and grabbed the mic
And then I lit they ass up to keep the party on the high

[Kurupt (Bad Azz)]
Hit me on the Motorola holla at the homie
What's up sitting down sipping a Corona (What's up Kurupt!)
About to dip through, blaze up a quarter
 
Ounce, bounce with the homies and make the tour bounce

[Bad Azz]
I like my Hennesey with Coke, I like my weed chronic smoke
I like my, Gin straight, my Benjamin's big faced 
My women get big face, my niggas get big lace
Big homes and big Bentley's coup and star chrome

[Snoop Dogg]
We rolling through the wild wild west
No respect to the click, who keeps it so dick
Most niggas probably want to bust us or even duck us
But the thing is we doing the right thing so you niggas can't touch us

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
I been no one fuck a little bit give me a lot 
I want a steak not an 8-gun on a block
I want a skyscraper, not no apartment building
And I want billions in case I got part with millions

[Kurupt]
In case anybody ain't reach the top, that's cause they ain't deserve to
Now shut the fuck up before I get my guns out
And I ain't playing no games
So check a nigga I ain't sayin no names

[Snoop Dogg]
How move it, who I move, but that's what they want
But they just can't see me, I slide up on 'em
Nigga that don't work his shit up off a coke
Work that bitch from a corner into a comba, nigga ya want to?

[Kurupt]
Dipping down the block where all the homies at
Fleetwoods and Lax on the homies straps
Nigga I rise for the hood home boy
What up Dogg, it all ain't good home boy

[Snoop Dogg]
Like we said before, your face to the floor
We holding up your motherfucking candy store
And don't nobody get up til we hit the door
I said lay down and don't get up!

[Kurupt]
Dogg Pound gangstas in gray and blue

[Bad Azz]
Took over the world just by staying true
You can bang to the boogie and hang out all late
But get some money 2 fold cause the game don't wait

[Chorus: x3]",Money 2 Fold,2001

Handle yours
Hey, Life is a Personal Business
You see what I'm handling
It's Personal Business
You handle your Business
Before I handle you, you heard me
Val holla at 'em

[Chorus: Val Young]
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't never let the game catch you slippin'
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't let the game get you and drive you insane

[Verse 1]
This here life of mine down this one way street
So unpredictable, tryin' to run into a Dollar
Drama all I seem to get into, can't rewind time
So the problems that's mine, is either solve 'em
Or deal with 'em tomorrow, can't borrow, ain't got a job
Money ain't circulatin', cops had the spot dropped
So it ain't no work in yay, What's up?
I'm thinkin' 'Damn, I need a Dollar'
I feel stuck and the hard times make me want to holla
God help me out here, oh no I'm with my last
Knowin' I can be the next to die, gone with the pass that
I don't want to feel like real life's hard to live
Fake 'cause when they do me, ay, this ain't no movie
Ain't no take too, you ever think about where your
Life goin' take you? ain't you grateful to be alive
Or you want to die 'cause life hates you, don't let it take you
Or make you or break you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, the game a get ya, hit ya hard and make ya fall
And you get broke with no hope and, no get back
Let's try hard to see success and not the stress and get there
You stay persistent long enough, you probably have shit where
Everything you need'll be exactly where it need to be
 
To me the streets and peace are never seen in 
See really forgot about the kids doin' what we did
Part of gettin' high watchin' time go by
Now they want to smoke and drink and ride on by
Catch a case, be at their pace and it's a long cold ride
Judge just gave Shorty Mack 1-0-5 and I doubt he'll live
To be a hundred and thirty three, they try to tellin' me he gon' die
Yo, in the penitentiary, he mentioned he needed me to send him a 
Package, I'ma shoot it to ya, man I know the game'll do it to ya
Yes it will like that, like that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
For me, it's been a long time comin' with a stretch up in here
I ain't scared but I don't want to be dead
I caught the game tryin' to kill me and found out it's been
Several attempts, it hurts to know this shit gettin' so personal
At once, don't they know you can't do nothin' about it
Least you know the world'll never be crowded
The same thing that'll make you laugh'll make you cry
The same game that got you rich will make you die
Fuck the truth, we like livin' in a lie, it ain't no time
To try to find my lost mind, I'm on the grind, I got rent
I need nickels and dimes would I be sent and life be as a
Personal business, sell your service not your soul
If you ain't got no dough, Nah I ain't tellin' and try to go
And try to sell your brain, if you ain't got you a scale
And a barreler cane, I'm just sayin' got to use what you got
To, do what you want and most folks don't
I gotta handle mine, you better

[Verse 1]
Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
I'm often traffic tryin' to get it 'cause a nigga gotta eat
We can holla if it's 'bout fillin' my plate
I feel like killin' somebody when a nigga ain't late
It's about weight,when you workin' smart shit it don't flip right
Put the wrong ties and dees it won't slip right
Get the wrong blunt for the weed it won't hit right
And money don't grow on trees so what I look like
Make moves,can't lose if I do it that way
Fuck a fight,ain't nobody fin' to put they gat away
That's fast lane,lil' kids here to blow your head away
Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
Who got the cell phones for sale,who got it crackin' with the heat
Who got the club with the top shop and parks for cars
The Ese homies do the paint and body shop in the yard
Who got the hook-up with the burned out 2 way pagers
Can you give me a vest or a infrared laser
See me,I'm just a smart brother everything made for

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Holla at a playa when you see me on the streets
I'm often traffic tryin' to get it 'cause a nigga gotta eat
We can holla if it's 'bout fillin' my plate
I feel like killin' somebody when a nigga ain't late
It's about weight,fuck a few ki's move freight
And you doublin' your money if you take it upstate
Once you outta town get the prices on the pound
Shoot the number to your boy have him come on down
With a few of those who know money like y'all
All Lakers say is ""Damn,y'all niggaz is ballin""
y'all back callin' all shots round here
Used to have to bring two Glocks round here
It's about five different gangs and the cops round here
And today Long Beach's about as crazy as it is
And maybe we'll live,every ever even see it
Believe it and how they get money ain't no secret
But they gon' try to keep it from you when they see you
Learn to keep on movin' you gon' see the tables keep on turnin'
First I was destined with no paper and no hoes
Now I got bitches in the show biz glow
So holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
Don't let the green grab fool you tryin' to test me with some heat
'cause bye bye you outta here,gone see you later
When I'm still here a small part outta everything major",Ready 2 Bang,2001
