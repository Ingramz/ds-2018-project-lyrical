M.Fusion,"Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt  
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys? 
They only talk to her, because, 
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay? 
I mean, her butt, is just so big 
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha 
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me 
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin' 
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet, 
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (Yeah) Fellas (Yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (Shake it) Shake it (Shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

Baby got back (L.A. fits with the Oakland booty)

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (yeah) Ladies (yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back

Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' 
To do with my selection 
Thirty six-twenty four- thirty six  
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none 
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups 
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role 
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

M.I. Fo' Sho',"The real revolution starts within
Locked down and caged
Our lives directed
We can just ignore the real reasons

We are just as much to blame as anyone else
Silent in apathy
We won't make a difference
How can we say that we are not a part of the problem

That's not true
Stereotype values and intoxication won't bring about change
There's a reason to reject
I feel it in my range

A protest of insufficiency
A purpose to save and heal a balance
To recover the distorted picture
Words mean nothing

Action is what counts
And when it comes down to it
Don't count me out",The Real,2008
M.I.A.,"Dein zuckersüßer roter Mund lutscht alle Worte kugelrund
Und selbst im Kampf ergeben sich, deine Lippen meinen nicht
An deinen glühend heißen Wangen verbrenn' ich meine Finger

Was ist mit meinem Willen bloß, machst meinen Willen willenlos

Mein hungriges Herz durchfährt ein bittersüßer Schmerz
Sag mir wie weit, wie weit, wie weit willst du gehen
Mein hungriges Herz durchfährt ein bittersüßes Schwert
Sag nur wie weit, wie weit, wie weit wirst du gehen

Deine Augen sehen durch mich durch jemand anderen an
Wenn deine Hände mich berühren, verfolgen sie einen Plan
Mit deiner rauen Engelszunge dringst du in mich ein
Gewohnt an diese Folter, sag ich ja und meine nein
Du hältst mich fest was soll das bloß, drück ich zurück, lässt du mich los

M.I.A.,"I was missing in action
On the side of a carton
I was taken in a Datsun
From a street in Acton

I was sipping on a Rubicon
Thinking 'bout where I come
It's all this for revolution
Cutting up the coupon
Saving for a telephone
Can I call home
Please can I go home

Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm tree silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under home made lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon
They're holding me ransom

Hello, this is M.I.A.
Could you please
Come get me

Smoking on a Benson
Trying to get me undone
Let me go
I don't want your attention
Under submission
Out of frustration I'll do it
I'll scream for the nation

Painted nails, sunsets on horizons
Palm tree silhouette smells amazing
Blindfolds under home made lanterns
Somewhere in the Amazon
They're holding me ransom

Hello, this is M.I.A.
Could you please
Come get me

Minutes turned to hours
And became our dates
When we shared raindrops
That turned into lakes
Bodies started merging
And the lines got gray
Now I'm looking at him thinking
Maybe he's OK

Eat'em off a table

DJ, MC's, private raves
Keep it secret, light it, mate

Whistle whistle blow blow
Here we here we go go

Some of them drink Heineken
And some of them drink Bacardi
Some of them talk a lot of shit
And act rowdy
Some say people follow me
Some say people is the key
When the music's got a beat
Then that's what gets me
Some say...

Power up that blade on that chainsaw
Go cut me down and I'm still gon grow

Ahh ahhh ahh
Yeah, he left me, yeah
To go far far away

Coz yesterday I met a girl from Warsaw
She walked like a turtle with a saw paw
Why don't they make some kinda new law
That stops making a religioon out of war?
Yeah, happy you know lots of useless info
Keep ticking like a brain on a robot
But I do know some things you don't know
That people you hate come back for more

Ahh ahhh ahh
Yeah, he left me, yeah
To go far far away

A tug of war with me and he was called for
Like he was iced tea, I was always pom more
But you broke me when you act like you want war
Coz my strength makes you feel insecure

Now here we go, we bouncing like a pinball
I let him go so he can go paint time gold
Why don't we live for that love though?

Kites on my radar, life in my palms
We unite through the chaos (only for the purest)
Tell them to obey ours
My cerebellum throwing rebellion from from AR's (room full of broom sticks)
The day I have a J-R, I'll tell him to work for God only
And quit his day job (room full of bullshit)
Radio never play ours
This revolution ain't televised with prayer
Jumping over borders
Ain't no ruler for restriction
Ain't no police to deport us
Ain't no summons for our sons
Ain't no dealings for our daughters
Every prosecution hung, save the verdict for the lawyers
Illuminate the corn, I celebrate humanity and scream back at me in the morning
Every field in Mississippi, every street in California
Know the devil is alive, this the time to be anointed
Trackin' down a stream, that's connected to a dream
Head bussin', it ain't nothin', even if I gotta bleed
Sitting waiting patient for a universal pain
Politicking with the nation, this is as big as you and me
I'll let you find my contacts, okay
Tryna set us up for combat, no way
Waking up the spirit inside every human being
If you with us then you scream so they all can shout way out

Way, way, way up

Hey, hey

These girls in here are the humblest
We drink out of plastic tumblers
While you see us on Tumblr's
We wanna get a job as a baroness
But they don't want no goddamn foreigners
So hey, you, you wanna marry us?
Prayers, the cross, they carry us
I wanna get out 'cause I'm curious
I'm serious, I hope you are feeling us
I'm pained by all of these periods
Where morals are running delirious
It's our dream, out of radius

There's nothin' more priceless than bein' free
Immigrant, that's why they hate me just for bein' me
We ain't wanna leave overseas, we were under siege
Leave us in shallow graves, but still the love is deep
Bloodline royal, need our seat back
40's in the foil, had to boil where I sleep at
Tell you that they love you, that they loyal, they can keep that
They don't want the soil, just the oil that's beneath that
Back to feed the people, fuck your pity and your feedback
Racin' with time, it's gettin' hard to even keep track
They sold democracy for a discount
Nothing's addin' up, that's why I gotta make this shit count, uh

Yeah, lock us behind a wall like we was Mexicans
Broad-day shootouts in front of pedestrians
Young niggas ride in hearses 'fore they touch a Benz

Call from the White House, they said meet with Trump
I'm only comin' if they pardon and put Meech in front
Politic with Robert Kraft while we're eatin' lunch
Tellin' him 'bout how Kaepernick tryna free us up
I don't wanna hear no Stormy Daniels
When a little girl got shot in the head, ain't see no cameras
From no CNN, I'm in the trenches where niggas vanish
And they never show that shit on the TV, it's propaganda
No proper manners, dropped out of school I got a hammer
Get locked in slammer before we could read, no time to scramble
Soon as I came out my mama womb it's time to gamble
'Cause your life on the line when you're young, Black or Spanish, word up

Lock our babies up and then they tell us that it's fake news

It's an illusion that's fueled by confusion
We can't lose if no one feuds within the movement, huh?

Lose when they only run until they lose wind
European plates on them foreign bumpers

Our land is ours and fuck that, victory

We are a border land, we are border people, we are
Country comment
He's talking about
Immigration, as we know it

Pe' ll'aria fresca pare già na festa...
Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole.

Ma n'atu sole
cchiù bello, oje ne'.
'o sole mio
sta 'nfronte a te!

Quanno fa notte e 'o sole se ne scenne,
me vene quase 'na malincunia;
sotto 'a fenesta toia restarria
quanno fa notte e 'o sole se ne scenne.

Ma n'atu sole
cchiù bello, oje ne'.
'o sole mio
sta 'nfronte a te!


When I first saw you with your smile so tender 
my heart was captured, my soul surrendered. 
I spent a lifetime waiting for the right time 
now that you're near the time is here at last! 

It's now or never come hold me tight 
kiss me my darling, be mine tonight. 
Tomorrow will be too late 
it's now or never 
my love won't wait. 

Just like a willow we would cry an ocean 
if we lost true love and sweet devotion. 
Your lips excite me let your arms invite me, 
for who knows when we'll meet again this way.

Mi Sentimiento
Amarte y desperté
Amarte y desperté

He venido a pesar
De que duele
De tan solo pensar
Que me hiere saber
Que tu me engañasteis por primera vez
Después que yo, jure
Amarte y vine aquí
A decirte adiós
Y que los sueños solamente son
Sueños, y soñé
Amarte y desperté
Vine a decirte adiós
Y que los sueños solamente son
Sueños, y soñé
Amarte y desperté

Yo dormía pero ya no duermo no
Yo tenia sueños contigo
Pero ya no
Y estoy buscando la manera de olvidarte
Quédate sola sufriendo sola, sola llora sola
La pagaras sola yo que no pensé dejarte sola
Hoy te dejo
Me voy lejos

Vine a decirte adiós
Y que los sueños solamente son
Sueños, y soñé
Amarte y desperté
Vine a decirte adiós
Y que los sueños solamente son
Sueños, y soñé
Amarte y desperté

Lo serio
De tu amor se volvió
Misterio
Y esta perdido
Todo cambio y estoy buscando la manera de olvidarte
Quédate sola sufriendo sola, sola llora sola
La pagaras sola yo que no pensé dejarte sola
Hoy te dejo
Me voy lejos

Vine a decirte adiós
Y que los sueños solamente son
Sueños, y soñé
Amarte y desperté
Vine a decirte adiós
Y que los sueños solamente son
Sueños, y soñé
Amarte y desperté

Despertaras del sueño
Y te darás cuenta de todo lo que has perdido
Es increíble saber que compartiste tu cuerpo estando conmigo

And make 'em parlez all the way
The kind of flows
That shake the hottest towns
We make the hottest sounds
And make the parties bounce

Joe&Phlowtron:
It's the infamous freak
And venomous Jizzow
We hold on
With Supafreak and AtomdaBomb
From Phlowtron
This how we do(this is how we do)
Yo,you best listen proper
On a Phat fam trip
With more kicks
Than foot locker
Your boots been rocking
Keeping it up in this mother
Your style's fake
Like it get sarcasm
Every time you knock her
It's urgent for us to be
Submerging from the underworld
We the chosen ones
You don't believe me
Ask the oracle
Read the chironicles of this
Mad rapper slash whoever
Yo we fam?
Yeah we fam
And keep it
Through this endeavour
This mission we ain't preaching
Just need to split some knowledge
Time to put fake noise
Wise in cold storage
We beyond
It's your time
You think you Hispanic
We think you charlatanic
Just chilling don't panic
Ain't no beef in this brother
The styles remain unheard of
Too Phat and Phlowtron
We taking this further

Malique & Phlowtron:
Yo what's your name(Malique)
And what you representing
Too Phat
I heard a lot of songs
The filling you now
I'd say now it's too bad
It's poetry of myself
And those cast that filling me
Like all your fans
No doubt
What you seem to hear
Squealing me
The stress is killing me
But remain the trendsetter
Like when push comes
To hold ups jeans
You should know better
A 13th letter song
She never yawn
To remind you of my name
Every time you be counting
One,two
No question
I got some assumption
Now an era of submission
On this repercussion
I superscript patch on
Equipped and all ready
Then everybody best believe
That you fly
Like I was R.Kelly
Yeah,I think this someâ??really
It's revolutionary
When we blow up spots
You know my style unheard of

As I running into the club
Give it up just stop
Don't think you're on top
Gotta be the one
Who's making it pop
Telling you a bit about
That's how we roll

Gotta stick to the plan
Caught a chick do that thang
Better keep to my slang
Got a gig to be hang
Rather be with my friends
Got you sick when I sang
Would you stick to my fang
Bet you flip I say so

Better be prepared
With a red carpet
Gotta move my steps
Taking off your hat
Show me some respect
Doing as I said
Everything's the fact
Flip that and so we roll

the Tarik Crew:
Save the best for last
Coming through
The only crew capable of
Taking this track
To critical mass
We got you open
Off the lines
That we be quoting
Exploding
We leave the venue
With the stage broken
That no sugar coating
Long rage we snipe
Scoping up close
With mic cords choking
Deliver the final blow
The rhyming prose
With melted wax vinyl flows
Oh,its time to go

M.O.P.,"Drama lord

[ VERSE 1: Billy Danzini ]
Billy Danzini is known to the world as a drama lord
Beat more bodies than Mr. Gotti, so I'm not a fraud
If you're clever, then you can put 2 and 2 together
Real niggas do real things, so that mean whatever
You was warned before you came
So I ain't to blame for your ass being torn out the frame
I get nuts off whenever beef occur
All I'm askin ya, is, are you ready for the massacre?
If you want it, then you can get it, homes
What you fail to realize, is, Danzenie is not alone
Come with your boys and roll with force
No need for your vest, cause I ain't in it for your chestboard
Tell my peoples that's real: Get your steel
Nigga slipped up, so grip up and meet me on the hill
Lil' Fame (Whatever) Ruff is with it
Shaq, call for Bang and tell him to bring the thang-thang
Danzenie will never have it, that's why I keep my automatic
In case I run into some static
Search all night, lookin for the gun fight
Troopin from dust to dawn, ready to get it on
Creep through the town, checkin out the scene
Index finger on the trigger of my serve machine
So don't ever harass me, or put nothin past me
Cause you'll be the next when I blast, gee
Bust caps back at your mac, and clap, this is the proper applause
For Billy Danzenie, the drama lord

[ VERSE 2: Lil' Fame ]
Which one of you bitch niggas is ready to start static?
Who want it (I want it) Slap, let him have it!
Clack-clack-pow, buck him down somethin sweet
Cave in his chest, put him to rest on the concrete
M.O.P.'s ready to hurt a muthafucka
Bustin a nigga down with the Brownsville Sluggers
Punk niggas game, and I spot it
When I pack out my joint muthafuckas say: ""You got it!""
Once it's on nobody play fight
Shit jump off, and I pump that ass off broad daylight
Instead of a nigga hurtin me first
I put that shit in reverse and put that ass in a hearse
Though guys come with it and get it
Whenever I got my heat, man
I bring the beef like the meat man
Put him away, send his ass to Jesus
Put his ass to sleep, let him rest in pieces
Me and my peoples got all types of gats
12-gauge shot guns, Tec-9 nines, and Macs
4-pounds and tray-deuce, and a .44 bulldog
To set it off and let the dogs loose
Put up your shit and we can rumble
But if I'm in double trouble
Then I'ma bust a nigga like a bubble
See, the niggas that I roll with, they don't run
Niggas use every muthafuckin bullet in a gun
Son, we'll bring the terror to your territory
Pump em up, dump em off, and after that go get a 40
Word to mama, when it's drama I send em to the morgue
Niggas can't stand the reign of Lil' Fame, the drama lord

But now these so-called gangsta-ass niggas got gased
Herbs are not ready, derelicts are petty

Get a rugged peek and wanna talk about the street

Nigga, your whole shit'll be rearranged
Because I'mma give em a buck fifty and let em keep the change
Another nigga smoked, oh Lord
Because he just finished watchin 'Menace', he musta thougth he was O-Dog
Ass out for the last nigga that wanted drama
Because I smoked him with the 9mm lama
You fake thugs ain't bustin slugs, please

This is how we separate the boys from the men
Real niggas that's ill niggas that kill niggas
The beaver that sneak with his finger on the trigger

Just for my enemies so I can blow they chest in

Gun over rose, choose your weapon or pick your pose

You know the way the motherfuckin' story turns out
Only your life or you're chancin'

See, 'cause you don't know how it feels

Everytime a nigga get killed they try to link that shit to Bill
Mostly because I never of

Brownsville's the place where crews seem the livest
Cops get knocked down, body counts only risin'
Them streets look full to ya, villains look poor to ya
Them niggas'll slaughter ya

For your goose Nautica, you got jewels?
Stash 'em, son, 'cause there's a thousand niggas broke
And we all got guns
And you know what that means

Niggas be open like they smokin' caffeine
Lookin' to do a quick stick, move and swift
With your [Incomprehensible] on your hip, ready to flip
Whenever you empty your grip, dip

And get the fuck up out of Dodge
That's if you know, what's up, kid?
Niggas is gettin' Mandela time
Plus the crackers is corrupted

But then you got them clockers down at 73rd
That was drug associated since the 70's, word
It's kinda skeptic
Livin' these crazy ways unprotected

Every day is a jam
So expect the unexpected, crime time
1-718, Brownsville, Brooklyn
The housin' property be gettin' token

So we're intended
Be under pressure, gettin' blackmailed
Villains usin' their dealings
Makin' killings of crack sales

The theme song of murder, nobody's kiddin'
These fools are forbidden, automatics just be spittin'
And devastatin' and profound, you get lumped up
Soon as you jump up or get gunned down in Brownsville

Everybody claim they represent and do they thing

Beyond twin chrome and farmers

And when I'm double clutchin' my hands
Them fuckers won't jam

So my man, if your seekin' an advance to your grave
It's the land of the 'Drama Lord'
And the home of the fuckin' brave
It's hard to trust us 'cause it's mad ruckus

We toe tax with mufflers for small time hustlers
It's blue steel concealed under my sweater
To calm down whoever, Duke, I move clever
I must keep it steppin' hops when shit be gettin' hot

I step and bop while I stroll with my weapon cocked
The hill that's real, we kill at will
Clack-clack, clack-clack, clack-clack
Mad guns in your grill in the 'Ville

Brownsville, yeah, killings here only bring retaliation
No cryin', see dying's an everyday thing, swing
25 niggas down by my battlegrounds
I'll move in with 8 thugs that love bustin' rounds

You know the deal
In my streets your heater be ready to blaze
Keep cash in your stash in case you gotta be Swayze
For twistin' a nigga cap back

That's that work of M.O.P., who we be? Firing squad of 11233
Clack-clack, whole clips in your back
That's thug style, turnin' a small section of Brooklyn
Into the O.K. Corral

Two paralyzed, three dead
Gunmen fled the scenery
With heavy automatic machinery

And yo it seems to be I'll nigga
Kill or be killed in the 'Ville, nigga
All up and down Mother Gaston, they blastin' steel

Blow your stacks and chips in A.C.'s with rims

Ain't nothing to kid about.
I put one in your wig and bounce.
Leave the rest for the all time see to figure out.
Now, who's that nigga that's tryin' to take my spot?
New jacks in rap must pay dues before they rock.
Yo, I run shit like Mr. Hoppa, because I pop up.
And I rip raps like crackheads strip copper.

You could easily get got by hot sinking slugs.

They still slingin' heavy metal, ain't nothing but the ghetto
But it's like that, ain't that right, black?
When my enemies strike, it's only right that I strike back

Here in Crooklyn, it's trife
Criminals out to take everything from your jewels to your life
One way to survive on these streets, you choose it
Rip up, load your clip up, slip up and you lose it

Cops roll up on you, son, got bodies on your gun
Caught up in some shit that your mom's always warned you from
See she won't understand that it's in the environment
That's why these trigga happy niggas keep firing

I ain't just fall into no grave
If I gotta get bodied, it gotta be goin' out in a blaze
I'm fazed, whether it's him or me goin' down
No matter the repercussions, M.O.P. hold it down in the

Illside of town where they murder niggas
Get down for your crown, murder, murder motherfuckers
In the illside of town where they murder niggas
Get down for your crown, murder, murder motherfuckers

In the illside of town where they murder niggas
Get down for your crown, murder, murder motherfuckers

On the wildside of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion 
It's so cold, you might get frozen 
If you leave yourself vulnerable and time lasping 
Fools collasping and caught up in gun clapping 
No matter who you are if you know many faces 
I don't discriminate, my shot bleed all races 
And coaches, we sorts like vultures 
Eating your insides like ulcers and pour niggas closer nigga

You got a ride 
We got a ride that hit up from both sides 
(X 1.5) 

Yo it's the way of the world right 
And can't nobody change the way that nigga Williams does his thang 
You see I done stomped on 37 beats 
And I'm still stuck in the core of the streets (nigga) 
That's me voted most likely to squeeze (blahaw) 
Now I'm worth 6 hundered G's 
Ghetto warfare, heavy metal warfare 
Plus I got all my motherfuckin' thugs here 
From ? buck ass wild Danz the rapid fire empire expands 
And, shortie take notice, my shit sold 
(Never went gold), but fuck it I'm still dope (broke) 
Don't pretend to be no millionaire 
I'm makin' dust somewhere, in the 7th coll on the third tear (yeah)

Now throw your motherfuckin' hands up (for what?) 
Keep it simple, ask no questions 
We won't pop this Smith-N-Wesso at your temple

We still ill, Sometimes we decide to kill 
But we still in the vill, so sometimes we liable to steal 
Plus we bust, don't mistake us for no other

M.O.P.,"[ Billy Danzenie ]
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
How about some hardcore?

[ VERSE 1: Billy Danzenie ]
(Yeah, we like it raw in the streets)
For the fellas on the corner posted up 20 deep
With your ifth on your hip, ready to flip
Whenever you empty your clip, dip, trip your sidekick
You got skill, you best manage to chill
And do yourself a favor, don't come nowhere near the Hill
With that bullshit, word, money grip, it'll cost ya
Make you reminisce of Frank Nitty 'The Enforcer'
I move with M.O.P.'s Last Generation
Straight up and down, act like you want a confrontation
I packs my gat, I gotta stay strapped
I bust mines, don't try to sneak up on me from behind
Don't sleep, I get deep when I creep
I see right now I got to show you it ain't nothin sweet
Go get your muthafuckin hammer
And act like you want drama
I send a message to your mama
'Hello, do you know your one son left?
I had license to kill and he had been marked for death
He's up the Hill in the back of the building with two in the dome
I left him stiffer than a tombstone'

[ Li'l Fame ]
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
How about some hardcore?

[ VERSE 2: Billy Danzenie ]
(Yeah, we like it rugged in the ghetto)
I used to pack sling shots, but now I'm packin heavy metal
A rugged underground freestyler
Is Li'l Fame, muthafucka, slap, Li'l Mallet
When I let off, it's a burning desire
Niggas increase the peace cause when I release it be rapid fire
For the cause I drop niggas like drawers
Niggas'll hit the floors from the muthafuckin .44's
I'm talkin titles when it's showtime
Fuck around, I have niggas call the injury help line
I bust words in my verse that'll serve
Even on my first nerve I put herbs to curbs
I ain't about givin niggas a chance
And I still raise shit to make my brother wanna get up and dance
Front, I make it a thrill to kill
Bringin the ruckus, it's the neighborhood hoods for the Hill that's real
Me and mics, that's unlike niggas and dykes
So who wanna skate, cause I'm puttin niggas on ice
Whatever I drop must be rough, rugged and hard more
(Yeah!)

[ Billy Danzenie ]
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)

[ VERSE 3: Billy Danzenie ]
Yo, here I am (So what up?) Get it on, cocksucker
That nigga Bill seem to be a ill black brother
I gets dough from the way I flow
And before I go
You muthafuckas gonna know
That I ain't nothin to fuck with - duck quick
I squeeze when I'm stressed
Them teflons'll tear through your vest
I love a bloodbath (niggas know the half)
You can feel the wrath (Saratoga/St. Marks Ave.)
Be-I-l-l-why D-a-n-z-e
N-I-e, me, Billy Danzenie
(Knock, knock) Who's there? (Li'l Fame)
Li'l Fame who? (Li'l Fame, your nigga)
Boom! Ease up off the trigger
It's aight, me and shorty go to gunfights
Together we bring the ruckus, right?
We trump tight, aight?
I earned mine, so I'm entitled to a title
(7 fuckin 30) that means I'm homicidal

[ Li'l Fame ]
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)

[ VERSE 4: Li'l Fame ]
Yo, I scream on niggas like a rollercoaster
To them wack muthafuckas, go hang it up like a poster
Niggas get excited, but don't excite me
Don't invite me, I'm splittin niggas' heads where the white be
Try to trash this, this little bastard'll blast it
Only puttin niggas in comas and caskets
I ain't a phoney, I put the 'mack' in a -roni
I leave you lonely (Yeah, yeah, get on his ass, homie)
Up in your anus, I pack steel that's stainless
We came to claim this, and Li'l Fame'll make you famous
I mack hoes, rock shows and stack dough
Cause I'm in effect, knockin muthafuckas like five-o
I'm catchin other niggas peepin, shit, I ain't sleepin
I roll deep like a muthafuckin Puerto-Rican
So when I write my competition looks sadly
For broke-ass niggas I make it happen like Mariah Carey
I got shit for niggas that roll bold
Li'l Fame is like a orthopedic shoe, I got mad soul
I'ma kill em before I duck em
Because yo, mother made em, mother had em and muthafuck em

",How About Some Hardcore,1997
M.O.P.,"Here comes the revolutionist, executionist
Flip a triple six into three nines, cause a crucifix
Each man holdin, no man foldin
Coast is clear and Premier's in the green tank rollin
Prepare, get on your post and stand clear
They wantin to shut us down but the home team's here
What? You act like you're sweet or something
This ain't no Desert Storm bullshit war, we all dumpin
CODENAME, Jamel wit non-strap
Wit six clips of teflon, suited in camoflagued
Got kevlar helmets wit masses
Wearin mob gear in cause they try to infumigate us wit gases
MISSION--to seek and destroy
We were sent to get rid of you, make the situation critical
First Family will gradually, lift that ass up like gravity
And turn your body frame into a cavity
NFO--that's No Fair Ones
Watch me nine milly turn into a flare gun
Sparkin wit the same marksman
Known for gunnin and runnin and bombin 
Wit the lyrics squeeze of my gun barkin, YA HEARD!!
You know my family style
I'm goin out wit my gun in my hand like Big Mal
I ain't got nuttin to lose, so move on me if there's something to prove, fool
This is war

""There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from"" 
""So what you gonna do since you know now""
""There's a war goin on outside"" ""It's impossible to stop"" 

This world's a twisted maze, but I got the swiftest blades
My swords they can slice and dice precise ways
Those who come against me, can get blazed, sprayed and laid
No trace, just a glimpse of my face, hittin the shade
You look up, there's a full moon in the sky
And all my would-be enemies, yeah they're soon to die
Livin in this warzone, we frequent fly at home
Many of us grow violent prone, ain't tryin to be dyin alone
So I'ma take the competition wit me, Lord forgive me
But a whole bunch, of blood-suckin punks, is out to get me
In a flash of a moment, I slash vital components
Tryin to scheme on me and my team bitch, you know we own this
We can scrap, wit guns, knives, chains and bats
Whatever baby, erase that ass quick fast off the map
Plus they better bring, medical attention after I swing my weapon
Won't be no recovery, no divine intervention
No prevention, from gettin hung in the streets where I'm from
'Nuff blood shed, this war's just begun

""There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from"" 
""So what you gonna do since you know now""
""There's a war goin on outside"" ""It's impossible to stop"" 
""There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from"" 
""So what you gonna do since you know now""
""There's a war goin on outside"" ""It's impossible to stop"" 

How many predators out there that want me
That's how I stand off, NOW
I come to diminsh every one of you blood suckers
Hands off, lay em down NOW
ALL CULPRITS, be alarmed
First Officer Danze reportin for 'Nam
When I'm bringin the storm, I'm all in
Yes I done stepped in the chest of many men
THEN AGAIN, it's a part of my persona like puff stumps and marijuana
IIAAAH, scratch em out,  FIRE
From all angles, that's how we was trained
Either slay or be slain, it's in the game for my soul
To be as cold as the blood in my vein
Knowin my name, help niggas perform abnorm
FIRST FAMILY, let's get it on
Just keep in mind I'm a marksman, I'm sensitive about that there
So you better watch what you say to me, hear?
PLAY WIT EM fierce, know where to run
So I post and defend, forgive me Father I may sin
And thou shall remember the code of the street
(Hold heat), roll deep, (don't sleep) or you'll be murdered
Since I've arrived I learned how to survive on this earth
Holdin down this turf, now I declare WAR!!

""There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from"" 
""It's impossible to stop"" (YEAH!)
""There's a war goin on outside"" ""It's impossible to stop""

Yo, they killin' 'em out there, son
They dyin' out there, son, word up
Yo they killin' us, son, I'm tellin' you

why?all niggas c'mon that's my word
Why?all better c'mon, yo wake up, son
They dyin', son
Yo, c'mon nigga, wake up, c'mon

It took me twenty-four years to figure out
What makes this world go round
It?s not man holding ground with dope sound
We gots to ask

Why do you feel that a meal can make you ill
When you know that broke bill can still
See right through your plastic ass
Before crack was a sport and we had thoughts of getting busy

Before death left and fame had his way
The town Brownsville, the place, the ill
Follow the trail of fresh blood drips
You'll end up on my bricks

The marks, home of the warrior thrown home
Our true thugs that's dead and gone
In the hills most effective chrome
Return to these graves

Showin' youngsters what I'm facin'
'Cause we had trouble
We been strugglin' since single shot gauges
That's straight ghetto bad luck

But, I done passed up more shit
Than you may ever touch
What, we on sacred grounds
Without the guidance of our fathers

All we know is how to double clutch revolvers
Me and my own staff flaunt a different path
I'm tryin' to dip shit minus in your highness
The finest of kickin' half

Honest to god, I'm layin' down my card
It?s been hard, for too many years

Blood, sweat, tears

Blood, sweat, tears

Blood, sweat, tears
These three words
Blood, sweat, tears

Go head nigga
A whole lot changed since my brother left
(I can feel you, baby)
And since my mother?s death
(I can feel you, baby)

But as time past, I could see my life flash
Leavin' the body and there's no breath
(I can feel ya)
I chose not to let my Biretta swing

'Cause I'm a veteran
And I'm livin' for the better things
It?s cold-hearted be
Check the majority of blacks
They slingin' crack, livin' in poverty
(True life testament)

What you gotta do is live what your life give
And make the best of it
(Try to see the rest of it)
'Cause you could easily fall victim to these streets
And death?s most definite

Is for the brothers that died
The mothers that cried
The brothers that tried
All we do is

Steady, puttin' to work
Handling dirt, holding your turf
We all shed for the loved ones

Back from hell, the dramatic, automatic
Rap track flippin' acrobatic

Yo we been in this game for damn near a whole decade
To the death 'til the Firing Squad, cop the next tape
Brownsville slugger, knucka up in the house
Had a rumble with the Grim Reaper, knuckled it out

This ain't for you big willies, this is for my small paws
Thuggin' wit guns in they draws
Go against the grain, break all laws
And keep a bitch wit him, wit drugs in her bra

You heard I was raised with the elements, it's William
And if you feel him then don't fuck with my intelligence
I'm from the Ville

I holds my own being that my father's reflection have connected

And roam, blow 'em and check 'em wit chrome, have ya heard of me
I heard you wanna hit me, split me, murder me
So I, regulate, designate, demonstrate
Blow back you fools wit tools, set 'em straight

What you want nigga? What it's gon' be?
I'ma be leavin' you leakin' with clip in the palmy
I'ma son of a gun, a automatic 4 5th
Gun shots let off for my dogs, leave your boy stiff

Ghetto warfare, heavy metal warfare
Play a part 'fore you fuck around and start a war here

M.O.P.,"""Yeah, they talkin about rap."" 
""We don't rap, its not about rap we livin it what they talkin about. 
It's not about college or what you read in a newspaper or magazine. 
It's hear its reality, this is our nature. Its how we live.""

[Guru]
Now everybody on Earth want to rap, we burnt all of that
Knocked off the game, and cold broke is spat
Gang Starr, will Billy Danze and Big Slap
Word to Laze, big schools and big gats

You didn't whip it right so pick up the pace
Word to grimy niggas, they want to stick up the place
Word to hiphop, plus a crib that's laced
Primo's breaks, activate the mental, that's all

We got credentials galore, fuck a small vending tour
Yet, still, I be at the around-the-way spots
Near where niggas be slinging innocent get hit by straight shots
And brave cops, protect the community

While corrupt cops, be harassing you and me
Pullin me over, in front of the crib, in front of my neighbors
Askin for favors, here's a cassette and why you 
Question my behavior?

Pursuing me, trying to catch me off quard
I shrug scars, you see a lot of hoes at thug bars
I don't care what these beats my do
We'll sun you, plus I see right through

It's way it means to me and M.O.P.
Just To Get a Rep, nigga, you best to step, nigga, Salute!

Holdin it down

Heavy artillery, in my vicinty

[Billy Danze]
Ah-yo, the game's called survival *echoes* I admit
As a soldier, I've done a lot of shit
To the so-called tough dude, I ain't mad at you
But I wish I wouldn't of had to do the shit I had to do

It's true, I would jump up in a Bamma
And travle miles of road to unload this hammer
(And I) Notice ?colors? when they glance
At the baby boy of Haddy and Frank Danze

I won't stress the blazin
But I will think about what size slug best for the occasion
(It's so amazin) ???? pop shit
Like Windy Williams till you fuckers bury me

(Who we be!) What, what's wrong, nigga?

(Ain't nothin cute) My niggas is ready to shoot
For the love of the First Family thugs, Salute!

Before you slit your wrist, bitch, imagine this
M.O.P., Gang Starr (Damn!) hazardous
Thugs that got love for this hiphop and shit
Makin words rhyme at the same time poppin shit

I used to go to jams, and drop grammar
Before I left niggas told me (Boy take your hammer!)
Sure nuff, shit got rowdy
Dumped off my first clip at a house party

I love this rap shit, though, the love is clear
But fuck the parties, my nigga, I lost a brother there
Only if I'm gettin paid (That's right)
And the shit gon' benefit the trade

I snatch a mic, turn it out, bad
Even have you smooth niggas fuckin up yours shoes and your outfit

[Chorus]","Salute, Pt.2",1998
M.O.P.,"A big city baby 

Time to bend on some shit 

y'all people don't understand 

That shit is real out here 

I'm a tell y'all a story 

Now this story didn't happen too long ago 

And it wasn't that far away 

Its about some real niggas 

Niggas doin real things aight 

So let me get to the first page and Ill break it down like this 

Chapter one 



[ Lil Fame ] 

I was a young child  lost  went to church on Sundays 

Walking a narrow road that lead me to gunplay 

I was a good boy respect my mommy 

Looked up to them OGs like Querto, Phil, and Donny 

Felt good as a young nigga 

Comin home from school gettin love from them neighborhood drug dealers 

Wrote change, Cadillac Sevilles 

But spoke real, was a tradition, Brownsville 

That was the first chapter, passin these stages 

But the book is wider and its a lot more pages 

The game changed, people got foul 

And the same little chuch boy is buckwild 

Runnin wit my homeboys from three three nine 

And one five four five, totin four fives 

I kept dreams of being a rap dude 

But I know the streets too well so I pack tools 

I lost a lot of loved ones to these streets 

And lost a lot of loved ones over beef 

That goes to show these streets haunt ya 

Look what society created now, a monsta 



[ chorus: M.O.P. ] 

My day and age was a different role 

Its when a slug take a niggas soul 

(Slug take a niggas soul) 

Follow your dreams and follow your goals 

Cause who knows what the future holds? 

(Who knows what the future holds?) 

Our man died and was left cold 

Because a slug took the niggas soul 

(Slug took the niggas soul) 

Follow your dreams and follow your goals 

Cause who knows what your future holds 

(This is what your future holds) 



[Billy Danze] 

I wish somebody would lend a hand 

So they could see how I fell inside 

I'm on an emotional roller coaster ride 

Nothing to hide 

A long time ago I set aside my pride 

And used my past as a ghetto guide 

A few good men died, several wept stood beside me 

So I could smooth out the road for those that come behind me 

You know where you can find me 

Out on the back blocks 

Grippin black glocks in front of crack spots 

Its just a hobby 

And since I was a baby 

Thuggin, smokin, drinkin, totin is how the first family raised me 

( He who lives as a gangter, will perish in these streets ) 

I know that's deep 

But I still shed tears for my mother, two years 

After shed been laid to rest 

And still some things I need to chisel off my chest 

My remedy for stress, I conversate wit my oldest brother 

Ten years after his death 

I know there's nothin left 

So I'm forced to take a deep breath 

Before I attempt to take another step 

A lot of brothas slept 

A lot of brothas was left cold in the street and told 

This is what your future holds 



[ chorus ] 



So there you have it 

You see, a lot of niggas talk about bullshit 

Talkin about cars, jewels, and money 

But in all reality, we all come out the same bag of shit 

Some of us may never see tomorrow 

So my niggas 

don't you never don't you ever forget where you come from 

Salute

And get to dumpin off a clip

Let your time be, there's a long line of niggas that's ready to wrong

Wacked four niggaz, and I still gotta do it

Welcome new players to these homicide layers to be slain
Look both ways before you cross a nigga
Decent families have lost a nigga, that came across a nigga
He knew wasn't havin shit
He seen him lick off and kickoff a whole fucking click

And nickel M and M's may be pressed against your faces

Verse Two: Lil' Fame *rapping to the baseline*

Or the way I put myself down (cha down) *main beat resumes*

Wanna fuck around with this livest shit?
Chrome 44's, soul survivalers (Unstoppable!)
Got a crew to drop a crew, remarkable

I know ya wanna see me dead 
Sprawled out with some thick red shit leaking from my head

Son you're supposed to be my man, but you ain't wise enough to realize
this is B.I., see I wanna taste the whole cake
Some things in this industry, shit be so fake
Make no mistake, if you're my man you'd understand
about the plan, to stack hundreds of grands (That's right!)
And how to stand, on much more acres of land
And to expand from the days of goin hand to hand
So like I was CEO I do my thing son
and turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
Release a fistful, of rhymes for the fiscal year
MC's are wishful fuckin with this here
They stuck with the tear, for fear they foresake a brother's love
it's clear -- I'd have to be the better man I'm thinkin

And every since then, the whole game changed
Everybody's against, Lil' ass Fame
They wanna see me stretched out with my back smokin
Left for dead in the street with my back opened
So I don't keep friends I just roll with
niggaz I was RAISED WITH, went out in a BLAZE WITH
In the penile, to B.ville, down to Grayson
And we thick together, in these last days kid
So I don't have what you call friends

I know you're jelly, because Fame, Billy and I be
Mashin' out crews of bad dudes for nothin'
Or 'cause they frontin', they corny style, I show 'em somethin'

Don't get infected, like a child that's been molested

I'm still left with a million ways to kill yo ass

Stop yappin' with ya dick in your hand and start steppin'

Where the innocent get slain
And what you visualize will ruin your brain
A lot a blood sweat and tears, pain

Nobody stop a murder, as a dealer does it's muthafuckin' thing
Bang bang, just like that, the man'll slit open you
And put two under your hat
And as you lay flat just another nigga whacked

Before he stepped, he threw three through your chest through your back
And your outta here, lights out, game over
You said, you wanted to live life as a soldier
I told ya, we on shaky grounds, a lot of ups and downs
We on force, to run a crash course and blast off rhymes

And of course we have emotions inside, yeah
That's just some shit that we been trained to hide

Talk low, this ain't no muthafuckin' talk show, this is

I think back about cats, that have passed away
That's why I feel more cursed than blessed
And I wonder what in this world, more worse than stress
I'm a mess with stress, though I present it with finesse
Sometimes I feel as if my heart is comin out my chest
I smoke too many ciggarettes; and the Remi won't
Wash away the pain or get, strain off my brain
See it's the way, we, roll down here, stroll down here

Able to tame my rage

I rub you under your face with single-edged razors
Cold street intelligence, O.G.'s and Rebel Men
Grip quick, cock squeeze and Level Men to settle it

From L.A. to B.K., from B.K. to L.A.
Persistent and insistant on doin' it our way
Do you really wanna fuck with Danze?
When he comin' with them thugs in the van
Double clutch in his hands, my nigga

Make the world flame, face the Fame-ster, part, Fame-ster
Y'all niggaz akin to God and gangsters
It's the M dot, to the O dot, to the P

Look in my eyes, I should not have to say it
Look alive, these streets is complicated

Hunt down, hurt, hang and hate the hater
Watch how you rise, fall and thank me later

Look alive, these streets is complicated

You got problems with us? Start poppin'

Let's move on 'em, must move on 'em
Rush in, gun-bustin', black seven plus tools on 'em

Never snooze on 'em, I'm short, haven't got room for 'em
I send you to God with no shoes
Clueless, real G's run this, we rule this
If you wanna get into some gangsta shit, let's do this

No question, no half-steppin'
Streets is my profession, heat in my possession
Hollow-tips is the answer; look around you see the signs
Say, ""No Smokin'"", but our guns got cancer

Yeah, 'cause I'm not, what you thought I was
Like my career was gon' fade like a fuckin' buzz
Raise the stakes high, I solidify
The grip that I keep on shit, get off my dick

M.O.P.,"The streets is mad right now
Tell em why we mad
Rappers whatever you call yourself
Pack ya bags and get out of town
Cause I'ma strike down on thee wit great vengeance and furious anger
Those who attempt to poison da hood
I'ma let why'all know da preacher's son is back
Uh, Refugee, one time, one time
Uh, M.O.P., two time, two time, one time

Because the block knows hot
You're a masquerade
You're livin in a uh
You're livin in a masquerade
I'm on first 
So, this ain't a rap verse
It's more like a voodoo curse
So when you die the kids'll throw rocks at ya hearse
Cause you lie too much
You don't got no gat
At your arm reach is ink
At your headpiece now you pissin in your briefs
Hold up
We just saw you on your BET and MTV, a public access channel
Talkin bout I'ma thug
You're an animal, a canibal, you even scare hannibal
But when the blackout came no light for your candle
So welcome to the real world where a spade is a spade
And I'ma call it like I see it 
Ay, why'all living in a masquerade
Even though Jacob iced you out wit the baguettes
Money wit no respect ? that makes you a suspect
So you can't ride through Brownsville
You want peace you better call Churchill
If not, feel Clef when he connects wit M.O.P. family and plays guitar at your eulogy
You want to claim you run da block
You're a masquerade
Givin information to the cops
You're a masquerade
I mean you never seen a rock
You're livin in a uh
You're livin in a masquerade

You youngstas better get back before you get a set back and get clapped
That's it and that's that

Hold that 
Take all dat and fall back
I kick too much ass 
Kick ass
To rock jewels, rock Prada
F-ck Gucci shoes, Timbs mo hotta
We still grip arms Brook norm bound sh-t
The streets don't want that watered down sh-t
Fam, we clear the whole stage
You don't wannaa ride wit us 
We got road rage
Now I'ma let my hood tell you 
You're a masquerade

You're a masquerade
I thought we still and we rob
You're a masquerade
You're livin in a uh

I'm hittin sixteen bars
A murder, real murder, baby
This ain't a façade
N?gas pumpin they fist like they punchin at gods 
Over ten years rippin MC
I bring it hard
Don't make me split yo chest and pull yo card
R&B singer the greatest and now barred
Cause he been feelin on booties of too young cuties
Got mo bombs left
You punk n?gas, we used to shake your pumpy hands
You'll have no arms left
You ain't a pimp
You ain't a mack
You keep be	?ches in the house all day
I keep em on the track 
Drinkin cocoa and wearin long mink coats black
Hit em twelve-inch stilettos
Tappin through the ghetto
I can see it in your eyes
Little n?gas you ain't a part of shakin n?gas hand, shakin n?gas heart
I keep the underground in shape
It never be soft
You want to make it like them fat naked be	?ches turnin me off
Now I'ma let my hood tell you

How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
How about some hardcore?

[ VERSE 1: Billy Danzenie ]
(Yeah, we like it raw in the streets)
For the fellas on the corner posted up 20 deep
With your ifth on your hip, ready to flip
Whenever you empty your clip, dip, trip your sidekick
You got skill, you best manage to chill
And do yourself a favor, don't come nowhere near the Hill
With that bullshit, word, money grip, it'll cost ya
Make you reminisce of Frank Nitty 'The Enforcer'
I move with M.O.P.'s Last Generation
Straight up and down, act like you want a confrontation
I packs my gat, I gotta stay strapped
I bust mines, don't try to sneak up on me from behind
Don't sleep, I get deep when I creep
I see right now I got to show you it ain't nothin sweet
Go get your muthafuckin hammer
And act like you want drama
I send a message to your mama
'Hello, do you know your one son left?
I had license to kill and he had been marked for death
He's up the Hill in the back of the building with two in the dome
I left him stiffer than a tombstone'

[ Li'l Fame ]
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)
How about some hardcore?

[ VERSE 2: Billy Danzenie ]
(Yeah, we like it rugged in the ghetto)
I used to pack sling shots, but now I'm packin heavy metal
A rugged underground freestyler
Is Li'l Fame, muthafucka, slap, Li'l Mallet
When I let off, it's a burning desire
Niggas increase the peace cause when I release it be rapid fire
For the cause I drop niggas like drawers
Niggas'll hit the floors from the muthafuckin .44's
I'm talkin titles when it's showtime
Fuck around, I have niggas call the injury help line
I bust words in my verse that'll serve
Even on my first nerve I put herbs to curbs
I ain't about givin niggas a chance
And I still raise shit to make my brother wanna get up and dance
Front, I make it a thrill to kill
Bringin the ruckus, it's the neighborhood hoods for the Hill that's real
Me and mics, that's unlike niggas and dykes
So who wanna skate, cause I'm puttin niggas on ice
Whatever I drop must be rough, rugged and hard more
(Yeah!)

[ Billy Danzenie ]
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)

[ VERSE 3: Billy Danzenie ]
Yo, here I am (So what up?) Get it on, cocksucker
That nigga Bill seem to be a ill black brother
I gets dough from the way I flow
And before I go
You muthafuckas gonna know
That I ain't nothin to fuck with - duck quick
I squeeze when I'm stressed
Them teflons'll tear through your vest
I love a bloodbath (niggas know the half)
You can feel the wrath (Saratoga/St. Marks Ave.)
Be-I-l-l-why D-a-n-z-e
N-I-e, me, Billy Danzenie
(Knock, knock) Who's there? (Li'l Fame)
Li'l Fame who? (Li'l Fame, your nigga)
Boom! Ease up off the trigger
It's aight, me and shorty go to gunfights
Together we bring the ruckus, right?
We trump tight, aight?
I earned mine, so I'm entitled to a title
(7 fuckin 30) that means I'm homicidal

[ Li'l Fame ]
How about some hardcore?
(Yeah, we like it raw!) (4x)

[ VERSE 4: Li'l Fame ]
Yo, I scream on niggas like a rollercoaster
To them wack muthafuckas, go hang it up like a poster
Niggas get excited, but don't excite me
Don't invite me, I'm splittin niggas' heads where the white be
Try to trash this, this little bastard'll blast it
Only puttin niggas in comas and caskets
I ain't a phoney, I put the 'mack' in a -roni
I leave you lonely (Yeah, yeah, get on his ass, homie)
Up in your anus, I pack steel that's stainless
We came to claim this, and Li'l Fame'll make you famous
I mack hoes, rock shows and stack dough
Cause I'm in effect, knockin muthafuckas like five-o
I'm catchin other niggas peepin, shit, I ain't sleepin
I roll deep like a muthafuckin Puerto-Rican
So when I write my competition looks sadly
For broke-ass niggas I make it happen like Mariah Carey
I got shit for niggas that roll bold
Li'l Fame is like a orthopedic shoe, I got mad soul
I'ma kill em before I duck em
Because yo, mother made em, mother had em and muthafuck em

Let's give these bitch niggaz one more chance
Throw them shits up (Throw'em up)
Regulate the real (Regulate)
Ayo we basically know how us fuckers feel (Feel that)
How we running niggaz

Ayo they gave me mad problems you won't amount to nothing
Well look at me now I did amount to something
The rap name in vain just like a four four
No matter were us niggaz rock we watch out for popo
Still up in the struggle I see nothing changes
These niggaz peep the way we roll so we holding bangers
Sport the jewelry cars and the shelto
Gamble for car money drink let the L blows
High school drop out got my G.E.D. though
Don't speak about what I got the d-low
Yo I know nothing but the hot shit creating
Up on the road trips and hot shit we scatting
From the slums stepping representing the jump off (jump off)
What we bump hard what you niggaz bump soft
Lived in Red Hook my pops name is Rudy Chattman
My good times always started with what's happening

(Chorus)
Just call me a hustle
Grinding pies writing rhyme 9 to 5
Pimping chicks doing sticks just getting rich takes muscle
Saga of a every day struggle
Bottom line dolla signs we ain't got a dime we gotta hustle
Clip feeling strip stealing sick villain
Let of a lot of wip pealing gangsta type scuffle
Payback could mean is time to layback and bubble
But other times payback is trouble
Just call me a hustle

[Billy Danze]
Lets give it up for the rusty 32's
And the day before Lymer
For the cold old gold and the loks marijuana
When the G's stood firm
Perfecting their concerns
And a nickel spot with a single shot ready to burn
Now shame on me it was cloudy I was blind
I was thinking that this young coward nigga had a slime
Your not LB your not M.O.P
I brought tripping from my whole different angle to spot me
[Lil Fame]
I was blessed with a cursed
(Curse a blessing within this curse)
When curse became innershment encouragement
I'm immune to the pain now I'm loving it
I'm encourage to fakes the pain and
Everything else I consider is punishment
(Take it one day at a crime)
Sometimes I stare into the mirror
Asking my self we it all went wrong
Back on the grind bomb stash heat in my palm
Is a cold world my nigga so bundle and warm

(Chorus)

[Mr. Cheeks]
Ayo listen my daughter is getting older
I love to kiss'em hold'em
Daddys always gonna be there for you I told'em
The world is getting colder
But imma keep'em warm
y'all niggaz want to get it on I bring a deeper storm
Watch you niggaz like a job if I got to
Fuck scrapping you gonna feel when I spot you
I grew up in this raised around the hard times
Did the thing hustle in boulevard dimes
The red tops yellow tops and the blue ones
Powerful always came through with some new one
I peep them niggaz that was down but turn fuckiness
Ever since Tah pass
Yeah imma represent LB to the death of it
Even though you left kid I'm still gonna rep this shit
Track attacking bitch nigga smacking
Every time I think I'm out these niggaz pull me back in

Hold it down! Home Team back out to sail this
Make 'em collapse with caps and Fame make 'em famous
The ""Downtown SWinger"" gun slingers rock wild
And when I die, I won't be puttin out flames in hell
Cop a 10 milli from the corner store Arab
Fools with truck jewels get stuck for they karats
Hold on you hear somebody comin, you hear somebody gunnin
Them niggas that you run with is runnin
Cause it's (BULLETS OVER BROWNSVILLE!)
I'm from the place where trey-pounds and fo-pounds kill
Fool how that sound? (ILL!)

Serve 'em like bartenders, what's next on the agenda?
Dope rap, we drop off crack, they can't stand it

With this fresh rush, show me on point in this game

こんな強く 願う思い
今も君を ずっと君を I feel
風が街いそがせたあの頃
なぜ君を行かせたのだろう?
目の前の情景 普通に存在してる
しあわせに流されたのかも
i knew that うすうすわかっていた
君の憂いがつのること怖れていた
何も出来ずに僕はそう
ただ君を抱いてた…
孤独を消したいのに
悲しいメロディーなぜか浸みる
ラジオからは随分古い流行歌
(twillght time,lonely night,
and rhyme,in the town,
where I live,there's no light)
二人で文句言った
狭いはずのベッドの上
背中丸め 抱いてた夢が逃げぬ様に
(wanna hold you so light
yes I'm still into
your love and your eyes)
笑ってた君の泣いていた君の記憶達
こころよまだ 起てるならば叫べよ
(weeds in the rain and the pain
in my deep inside of
my mind that cry)
君に愛を とどけ愛よ
こんな強く 願う思い
あの日のまま 僕はずっと I feel
独りで深夜映画ながめてる
monochrome 寂しさ奏でてる
現実という脚本の中
僕はずっと通行人のまま
ハリボテの街(セット)の隅の方
濡れて枯れるだけの運命から
そんなストーリー
台無しにしてしまえ
雑草 叫び声あげろ雑草…
君に愛を とどけ愛よ
こんな強く 願う思い
今も君を ずっと君を I feel
君に愛を とどけ愛よ
こんな強く 願う思い
あの日のまま 僕はずっと I feel",Weeds,2004

But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

With mascara'd eyes, and chapeaux by Dache

Let's go...no time to do your hair, baby
[Starang]
Ayo! There the go kid!
[All]
Right there! Right there!...Oh Oh, Oh Oh...

[MS]
I'm movin' smooth like a wet foot glidin' across ice,
because these fools who be sliding on tracks, braggin' they nice
headz screamin' they need it, but do you really want hardcore?
Stakes is High like De La, plus i'm fiending to start more

[Starang]
Trouble on the double, yet cooler than any hooligan
frontin' on the mic nigga, who you think you foolin' with?
y'all be on the mic kickin' nothing but that nonsense
nigga please, ease back my crew been the bomb since

[Tek]
Tell me to maintain and keep doin' my thang
keep my dick in my pants, and just stack the green
shorties can't be coniving, had to flip about warning
now you in a cell tryin' to post bail by mornin'

CHORUS:
[Starang]:Now in the back of my mind, yo I really do hope
[Tek]:that motherfuckers out here don't take my crew for no joke
[MS]:'cause if our backs against the wall, then we goin' for broke
[All]:but we'll never fall victim to the OHKEEDOKE!

[Starang]:It goes on and on and on and on
[All]:you keep on, and you don't stop
[Starang]Yo, it goes on and on and on and on
[All]: You keep on and you don't stop


[Starang]
steepin' to ya, Dru Ha, you hit the jackpot
Starang bust thangs since Tek found the A-Black spot
me and Mr. Smokee, playin' the lo-key
puffin; on L's, I never fell for the ohkee...

[MS]
...Doke! when your plan goes up in smoke
like a Bob Marley spliff being smoked to a roach
but on the contrair, if I smoked an ounce a day
it'll only make a mess when I bounce this way

[Tek]
The jail scene ain't workin' no more, got me punchin' a wall
fam put a block on the phone, won't accept collect calls
and to top it all off, heard my co-defendant turned canary
stutter steeping through the house lookin' all scary
I'm just waiting to face him in the mess hall
thinkin' 'bout the Tyson loss, gettin' my reps off
and the niggas in the world that I used to roll with
don't even write scripts, that's the ohkeedoke shit

[CHORUS]

[Starang]
Niggas say Starang's smooth, just like ice without cube
I'm nice without dudes, on my motherfuckin' track
niggas call me Starang, others call me Jack
but if you call and I'm not home, you can call me back
but no matter where i'm at, I always rock the show
the niggas next up on the mic, y'all niggas gots to go
Phantom of the Opera, yo I blow scenes North, South, East
West, fuck your chest dukes, get it out your mouthpiece

[Tek]
(I was) laid back sippin' Beck's, gently cleaning off a black Tek
JP's cuban link got my neck laced (shine baby)
steal the show like a thief, blow without a trace
see so many wannabe's steadily tryin' to be me
act grimy, crimies constantly scheme how to fi me
out to get the bonus, becoming assed out like the homeless
no disresepct intended, but it's a fucked up world we live in

[MS]
My lust for hip hop got me strivin' for perfection
and when my inner glow shine, you vision my reflection
and now chumps had to get a closer glimpse at it
as sweat trickle down your face, you break into a panic

[CHORUS]

(phonecall 1-900-GET-DA-BOOT)

like when your shorties put on helmets and shouder pads, that's the ohkeedoke,
when shorties come to see a nigga with...while you bleedin' is the ohkeedoke, 
too

We met skipping school met in a double feature 
Eating popcorn at the back of the theater

Talked to her family her mom and her pop 
She ain't no good for your heart, ugh ugh, rip it apart
My hommies tell me be tough but I could not get enough
We made a connection you see, not sexually but deeper than oceans and seas
See you can't be afraid to because she makes me feel like I am free
If she could be right beside me I'm good, she is my medicine she is my cure 
See you can't be afraid to be, 'cause she makes me feel like I am free 
Wish we could take it right back to the hood

Dear Diary, 
He wrote some letters on his hand 
It wasn't hard to understand 
I figured I'm part of his plans 
But now I'm in his heart 
I don't know where to start 

What can I do? 
Tell me what can I say 
When do I let him know I feel the same way?

Whispering child so cold so mild

Tears on your neck, holding you near
Sparkling shells, three comet tails
Hoping for some magic
To make your heart beat next to mine

Shiny island, blue underground
My everyday is fading away
I fly through the wind and whistling
Some strange melody

Hang on to me, getting out of my corpse

Out of everything that changed before our eyes

Swieci pilotom w oczy,
Ogrzewa niestrudzenie
Zimne, nibieskie przestrzenie.

Ciemne, sklebione zaslone,
Stane wtedy na raz
Ze sloncem twarza w twarz.

Przez okno patrze znuzona,
Z tesknota mysle o burzy...

'Cause you know I gotta win everyday day, day, go!
See they don't really wanna pop me (Blow!)
Just know that you never flop me (Oh!)
And I know that I can be a little cocky
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then I gotta blow and then I gotta shudder any little thing that nigga think he be doing
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna dadadada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, to make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again, and again, and again

And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
A nigga better call a ref, and everybody knows my style
And niggas know I'm the the best when it come to doing this
And I be banging on my chest
And I bang in the east, and I'm banging in the west
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go

See the way we on and we all up in the race 
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we struggling and hustling and sending it and getting it
And always gotta take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through his traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it, have it

Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresher than a motherfucker

Man fuck these bitch ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my Jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said, ""Shoot 'em"", and I said, ""Okay""
If you wanted bullshit then I'm like ole
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil

That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch I'm outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain't hotter than mine, nope, not on my time and I'm not even trying
What's poppin' Slime? Nothin' five, and if they trippin' fuck 'em five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch I been tight since guiding light
And my pockets white, and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild 
Been here for a while I was like ""fuck trial"", I puts it down

I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun.

And at '21' the couples clamor for more**

Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2001

Run and tell your girls about your night with the assassin

My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass
My sisters cute but shes got no gear 
I got three pair of pants and with my brother I share
So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you aint cool
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Now everyday I see my momma struggling
So now its time I got to do something
I look for work
I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs 
And come home like a slob
So here comes dogg his gold is shivery
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once I do it twice
And now there's stake with the beans and rice
My mothers nervous but she knows the deal
My sisters gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and were getting paper
And three months later the whole hood cought the vapors
My family's happy and everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya

Love aint got no price tag
Snoop I want you to kick this shit to them niggas

Hmm
Money is flowing everything is fine
I bought my self and uzi and my brother a nine
Business is booming everyhing is cool
I pull about a g a week, fuck school
A year passed by and I began to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I kick up my feet to watch some t.v.
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55"" television you know
And every once in a while I hear ""just say no""
Or the other commercial I love
That's when they say this is you brain on drugs
I pick up the remote control and just turn
Cause with this bullshit I'm not concerned
Me and my brother bounced in the benz
We driving around our territory again
I pull up at the light like a superstar
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
I hit the accellerater scared as shit
I drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasnt dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was warren
Later I found it was dogg and his crew
Now tell mw what the fuck am I suppose to do

On top of that I'm in it to win it
I cant believe that dogg would dis me
That faggot that punk he soft or sissy
I driving around with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to dogg's favorite hang out
What's cracking dogg and let the bullets stang out
Someone shot back so we took cover
And all I could about was my brother
Dogg jumped up and began to run
Bustin shots hopping to hit someone
So I just stopped and let off three shot
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and began to shout
""ay y'all all lets break out got 'em dip out
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue
They pointin they guns at my four man crew 
They shot down one, they shot down two

Mac,"Imagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know

Imagine life with no jails and no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they want to trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga break bread

I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skins too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rangs
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got me FED's on the scene and they sware I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had a pissed, ask your son, I know he gotta see-Murder disc
Number one in every record store
Mom and pops tap my phones, but you know I ain't slangin' rocks
Take me to jail but I tell em take me off the scene
My first call go to P, he put my mind at ease
You told me not to trip cause it's a bigger picture
And if your tank don't put it on TRU, I'm a come and get ya

Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I went through stressin' (why), cause I'm already strapped,
bulletproof vesting
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, dad, why they come for me
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And from time to time it crossed my mind
What if there wasn't a crime 
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's true for me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, so toss the glocks with the hollow
I would kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don,
nigga woah

Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the dark side before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or that imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker with a bullet stretch
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible, killing its unstoppable
As long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas that's droppin' em
Real niggas from that ????? the world that's all about
Real niggas we won't have a reason to kill niggas, heal niggas
My plane it runs so deep I'm a share it with why'all
While my own niggas is trying to cut throat while I'm tryin' to ball
Dog, you ain't never seen what I seen what I seen",Imagine,1998

Y'all just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man, I think Snoop got somethin' to say

Think fast when you dunk, 'cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk

South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise 
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm 
That's props, that's why I put it in this song 
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour 
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more 
My autograph sessions at the main event 
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent 
At the radio they loving my beats 
Ninety-three while we be mean green streats

When I was underground everybody down 
Everybody show me love, cause I share common ground

supposed to 
But they still on my team cause I got fame 
And everywhere I go people be yappin my name 
Yeah I know Mac, we go back, me and that nigga tight 
As a matter of fact he slept at my house the other night 
It's cool I let a lot of shit go cause I'm ambitious 
When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious 
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts 
And not to mention all the cochroaches 
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel 
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro 
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing 
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little 
pocket 
money 
To get a nigga who was going my way

I'm damn near breaking in tears as I'm speaking these words 
This same motherfucker from the third, show me love nigga

It's four in the morning, mamma got tears in her face 
Love from my tombstone try to relocate 
But in my tank lord I got faith 
Five hundred dollars or so for my block 
Lord knows I couldn't stop 
That's a long way from bad credit cards and selling rocks 
For the love I've got and in return I'm putting it down 
Chi town, on my gd's, on six and thirty hos 
And my vl's on the westside 
I ride with jack time ballers 
Drink alazay (?) and hennessee with Jakeville shot callers 
I'm gettin love from niggas on Breakstreet 
And Watts, and Cappanella park and LA 
The thirties in the Bay, brown love for my esses 
That's a long damn way from the parkway 
So when I'm home, see a nigga drop a nigga from above 
(Cmon, cmon) Show me love

And hit the weed when they stress me 

Niggas die in the ghetto

And bitches love to suck a line

He was a trippy dog runnin' from the po-po 
Robbin' niggas for their rangs and thangs 
He ran up on the wrong nigga re-arranged his brain
Now check it in my city ain't no Crips and Bloods but niggas yell 3rd ward

Come equipped with slugs and niggas soldier rags throwin' at those who bags
Kickin' up dust chasin' paper that say in god we trust

I puts it down like the round out the tank

But I got Mac, Kane & Abel up next 
So Mac hit em with something

[Mac] 
Whoa I puts it down like them killers uptown 
Or like when your momma catch you sucking something 
That you shouldn't suck clown (boy put that down) 
I puts it down like a live round murder murder 
Or like them vegetarians do to hamburger 
I puts it down like when the cops say freeze 
Motherfucker put that pistol down put your hands up 
And drop to your knees 
And when you see me lay it down 
Don't nobody make a sound you know 
I spray it down if I catch you on my ground 
I'm that nigga with that pistol 
That hits you when you flex 
And go to jail do 1 day and get out 
Cause I got connections and umm 
I puts it down like the last don 
Soldiers get your blast on 

[Kane & Abel] 
I put it down like a nigga got snuck in the chin 
Put it down like when the SGT holler give me 10 
Put it down like cement shoes when they drop in the river 
Put it down like my rocks when the po pos chasing a nigga 
I put it down like a casket going down 6 feet 
Or something like them dice when they bouncing off the street 
Put it down like some shit when it hit the toilet 
Put it down like some coke when I'm bout to boil it 
Put it down like babies falling out the bed 
I put it down like the soldier rag sagging on Mac head 
Put it down like Pippen on a fast break 
Put it down like freaks hitting the ground 
After beat down on Jerry Springer tape 
Wait put it down like shells hitting the ground 
When I'm busting rounds 
Put it down like beats by the motherfucking pound 
KL in the 1st round

Mama Drama and Fiend up next 
Nigga What

With the mind of Nostradamus the bombest 
Dropping on Pearl Harbor nigga yeah that's the way I lets it go 
I puts it down like Reece at the stone show 
I puts it down like four flats on the deserted row 
With no gun, phone, or triple eight to save you hoes 
I puts it down like mommsha's lips on Satan's dick 
And you love it
I puts it down like yea ande glass, jars from waters bubbling
Still tubbling 
I puts it down like Roy Jones' opponents 
Looking up at the referees so haters you don't want none 
I puts it down like sit down motherfucker be quiet 
I puts it down like billy clubs smashing heads during the riot 
Excited cause I puts it down like that niggas hands 
When his fingers got a chance to feel past my underpants 
I puts it down like order in the court no doubt 
And lays it down like the motherfuckin rules in mama's house 

[Fiend] 
I come around hype put it down like how it sound like vicious 
I put my name on my game style tight like a dyke does bitches 
Watch me excite these bitches once they know who I be 
Busting out the expedition ? 
Did you see me on MTV blowing zone up in the zone 
Put down my # on paper because I want to put a down on 
I done clown zones, I'm a bust rounds on see I'm a Jones 
And I put it down like Cedric fame by Louisiana up in the dome 
See I'm blown but usually I'm foolie when I'm bad with the toolie 
Putting it down like the first fan at I'm bout it the movie 
Give me my tank and my duty pack a coolies and roll me a sweet 
When I'm up in them seats put it down like my first week to meet",Puttin' It Down,1998
Mac,"Intro:
What them niggas in here wanted to know
They done made beef with one of the realest niggas rollin
Now it's time to go

Verse 1:
Now pump me up so all them real niggaz can feel me
I told y'all what I represent and that's until they kill me
Why these niggas play with me I guess I never know the answer
Well beefin with Mac is like sleepin with lung cancer
You know you gon die, you don't know where
You don't know when, you don't know nothin
But that nigga was camoflauged with a mac 10
I remember y'all faces, I remember the days I remember the times
I remember I was in the mall and this nigga just wasn't respectin my 
mind
I knew the nigga he was with and the nigga he was with was tellin him 
chill
This nigga continued, this nigga couldn't be for real
I never said a word, cause TRU niggas don't be yappin
He must take me for some kind of hoe, cause I be rappin
I look in his eyes and seen the daddy was really soft
Either he just full of that shit, or just tryin to get his nuts off
However, whatever, I don't give a fuck, you done played with the big 
chief
Now asks yourself, do you really want to sleep nigga

Chorus: 2X
We got beef
All my niggas gon ride tonight
We got beef
Somebody's gon die tonight
We got beef
Don't even sleep
Soon as I leave the studio, I'll be headed to your street nigga

Verse 2:
I was by my potnahs house peepin out these beats that he made
Just chillin, free stylin, just thinkin about some ways to get paid
Some new nigga he came around and I never met him
Get close to me, I don't even know why these niggas let him
For some strange reason, he never looked me in my eyes
When he spoke he ducked his head, or just yapped to one of them other 
guys
And we was outside talkin, I was lettin him peep out my new weapon
I walked away for one second, when I came back he started steppin
Look, I thought nothin of it, I just continued to yap and talk
But when I went to go get my shit, I had realized my shit had walked
What the fuck?  Who the fuck got a ride?  Look show me his spot
If I see this nigga with my shit, this nigga gon get got
But the Lord must love the wicked too, cause I had never seen his face
But you best believe when I catch him, him and my bullets they gon 
embrace
Forgive me for my anger, I'm a product of the streets
And I was taught that you never ever ever sleep with beef, peace

Chorus

Outro:
We got beef
When you beefin with them No Limit niggas, it's like beefin with me
When you beefin with Master P nigga, that's like beefin with me
When you beefin with the Shocker, that's like beefin with me
Nigga, when you beefin with see-Murder, that's like beefin with me
When you beefin with any nigga on the tank, that's like beefin with me
And you know what I do to niggas that beef with me
I cook 'em nigga",Beef,1998
Mac,"This here a true story about ghetto love 
This shit that happened to a young nigga like Mac ya heard me 
Check it 

I met you at a fast food spot with your sista 
Lookin' at my lips like you wanted me to kiss ya 
Told me your name And I told you Mac 
We exchanged phone number...Like that 
Off top you told me that you had a man 
But we can talk but that's as far as it go and I said I understand 
Even though I wanted you and you knew 
I was waiting for this nigga to slip up so you can be my boo 
I had a wet dream I fucked you and you screamed my name 
But when I woke up, all I had was some nut stains 
Your baby daddy was useless and abusive 
But me I treat you like you was exclusive 
And even though he gave you drama 
Long as y'all was together you didn't holla
And you knew I was clockin' dollas 
I was mad but it kinda turned me on in fact 
If I was your nigga I guess the next nigga would feel that 

[Chorus: ] 
The pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin' me 
Every night I had to stop myself from fallin' g 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin' me 
Every night I had to stop it diggin' in my pocket 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin me 
Every night I had to stop myself from fallin, g Callin me callin me 
Its like the pussy was just callin' me, keeps callin me 
Every night I had to stop it diggin' in my pocket, Callin me callin me

[Mac] Well I don't know ya dig. I got studio time all night a shit and I

[Peaches] Plleeeasssee? Mac I miss you 
[Mac] All right I'm on my way 
[Mac]The first time I hit the cat I ain't know how to act 
It was callin' me back 
[Peaches]mmmm Mac 

Momma told you was no good but you fucked me so good 
I rushin' home from studio session to meet you where ever, no questions 
Tellin' my niggas ""I'm a holla at ya"" 
This camouflage love every other night got me missin' flights 
You started stressin' me 
And you start depressing me 
But before I could leave you alone you start undressing 
And I remember seeing Hickies on your neck 
They wasn't mine I was in Cali on the movie set, baby girl 
what about respect you said you love me when I'm up in them guts 
We tend to say strange thangs when we caught up in them ???
My nigga Fiend was tellin' me you don't deserve me 
But a niggas gone do what he want to do ya heard me 
I'm a let this go by saying you'll always be apart of me 
I just can't answer you when that pussy call me

To make this million I'm bound to left uptown to go get it 

Once I get it, I'm a split it with those who I'm committed

Call me fake then my niggas will say that's trill 

Check it, funny high hoes be calling me jiggy now 

Cause I gotta little jingle, mingle with the finest and sport diamonds 

When I was broke I was skinny and full of shit 

Now it ain't nothin for me to pull a bitch 

I scratch off and I hear them hoes say he did that 

Every bitch I fuck be saying I'm tryin to have your kid Mac

I'm a try my best not to let these niggas bring me out there 

They know you beefing with the ????, and them niggas don't care 

Who they kill, and tryin to be a millionare on the real 

But I can't a from with that foolishness so I'm a chill 

And just pass through the projects that I used to roam in 

Tote the black and the steel chrome and holler at trill 

niggas like Jim Stone and 

No more hangin, no more slangin pearls and crack pieces 

No more fucking dog bitches carryin deadly deseases 

They burn your dick off, givin you aids through the rubber 

I had to settle down with a boss bitch and now that's my lover 

She down for a nigga 

And when the situation gets heavy she lets loose rounds for a nigga 

And if I don't come home she'll come blood hound for a nigga 

That's the type of bitch I need, no drink, no smoke, no weed 

Hoes label me a hot boy cause I just come home and I don't get D'd 

But I'm a boss baby, I like to floss baby 

Can I ball y'all, can I ball

You camoflauged uptown that was some shit to see 

So when they locked you up I continue the legacy 

Now all these niggas claiming Soulja is you bout that ball 

Would you die for me if a nigga pull up in that tinted car 

I think you niggas sitting around waiting on my fall 

Let a nigga ball, nigga let a nigga ball

First of all, nigga fuck y'all y'all niggas ain't shit
I'm the one who slash rappers and be fucking they bitch
I hate rappers who hate other rappers for making it
Record labels be dickin niggas, niggas just be takin it
Fakin it with videos, with pretty hoe's and limos
But callin No Limit tryin submit them fuckin demos
Fake ass niggas be hollin ""keep it real""
I got family nigga, Keep it real to them god damn bills
I give a fuck, bout hip-hop the culture of the call
This shit is watered down like a scene from Jaws
I done been through all the phases, 
Tampered with all the styles,
Niggas done soldier hated,
Mac retaliated
Tell them niggas in back with semi-autos
You dis me on wax, you might not see tomorrow
I'm like Zorro, I mark D.F.M on they back
[And what's that] That mean don't Fuck wit Mac
They should've told you I was nothing nice
As a matter of fact they should've told you I was nothing nice twice
My rollie was dipped in ice, my g-ride was payed out
Crib was laid out before my record was out
Most of y'all go gold and never see a bank roll
A hundred g's in the hole cause you sold your soul
when your broke, your yellin at TRU to hip-hop shit
I'm known damn well all you niggas tryin to get rich
East, west, middle, south nigga we all the same
We all speak the same shit but with different type of slang
So the next nigga talk about we country and weak
I hope his momma catch cancer and die in her sleep

Verse 1:  Mac
Murda murda I wrote it in braile
Uncut, lyrical dope, certified by my scale
The homicide rapper, there'll never be another after
The Mac's rapture, I represent, that's what I'm on the map for
Who the fuck gonna fuck with the scandalous
1-8-7 on these mothafuckin amateurs of rap
Feel the wrath of a nigga who bust
Makin my clique the shit, bitches want to discuss
?Platonic?, the lyrical killins don't got no motives
In this, in my vein, ain't no way I can control it
When this inside of me is as deadly as them niggas
You know the ones who killed them boys and dumped the body in the river

If they pass me the mic, I'm gonna catch a case

Big Wise that's my nigga, Psycho Ward is my clique
Affiliated with cash, got my foot on the gas
Tailgatin real fast, through my sun roof my verbal gun shoot
Them scriptures, paint the pictures
We believe was cops tryin to catch me like receivers
Scream my name, to all these bitches who be hard to tame
Momma said it's a shame, poppa gave me the game
Experience a soldier, my heart pumps battle fluid
You want to go to war let's get to it
Mac-a-don, put you on teflon style of murder
Deadly as the killer kyle in your hamburger
Till they bury me black, wrapped up in street camo
I rock the microphone strapped off with street ammo

Blood on my kicks
Camoflauged niggas never die, we drop hits
I spit the gospel, to all of my mothafuckin apostles

I minister, words of a mothafuckin sinister
Transform into Liu Kang and finish ya

Witness the street level on the be	-ball court
Bitch I'ma die wit it, cause it's a part of my vein
Hear that word camoflauge when you hear my name
So tell them niggas I'm back affiliated, enemy lines are penetrated

I know my nigga Wop don't love them hoes
My nigga KL he ain't loving them hoes
My nigga Cult definitely ain't loving them hoes
y'all what's up with this Mac nigga feel it

To all the bitches hoes and all that shit
Running around with them tights on trying to find them tricks
Running behind that dick chasing niggas with brand names
I see you tight coming you making it harder for the right woman
Off in the club giving rappers a hug
Trying to get some love letting them put their hands on your glove
Off in the limo you and that slim hoe
They hit the ass and let their partner and them know
So now you on they demo
They wrote a rhyme about cha
They told the world how they got that out cha
All up in the mouth too you with the groupie route boo
They made you famous your man has got to be your bitch
He saw the video tape and said all man that ain't shit
Instead of ending it he defending it I'll give you that much
Either he lame or your pussy is pure gold with diamond clusters
But he a buster cause everybody fucked you
But he the only one saying he love you 
Woo you's a

Hoes hoes You know I'm bout them hoes hoes
But I don't love them hoes hoes hoes hoes
Wop don't love them hoes hoes 
KL don't love them hoes hoes
Fiend don't love them hoes hoes
Coonts don't love them hoes
Check this out 

I seen her in the house in blue shaking her ass
Winking her eye at every nigga who passed
Trying to fell that glass put his pants back
The ass fat but you asked backwards
A trip with a simple effect even don't have to
Simple things you be after you caught up in the rapture
Me and my nigga point at you with laughter
But get down or try to understand you world
And what it did to make you such a shallow ass girl
I know you laid with this nigga that you met last night
You fucking him because his white Land Cruiser's looking tight
Stroking telling you that it was love at first sight
But you don't realize that it was love for the night
Now you at the crib crying you sick of all them niggas lying
But you the one that's doing all the lying
Supplying the cat to all the niggas that be trying to mack
On the celia you wants to be real familiar

Now back at the spot where the champagne pop
You in the club corner getting wet in some rain drop
It's common to you so you except it
It's unknown how many niggas you done slept with

We don't love them hoes hoes 
We don't love them hoes hoes hoes hoes
I'm bout them hoes

And at the end of the night, I rippin' off clothes 
You fuckin' with the realest, from lyrical spillers 
To killers and dealers and cap peelers, and street guerrillas 
From villains to chillers, we made millions 
And paid killers to protect scrilla 
So what the fuck you talk about winners? 
You hear that word camouflage when you hear my name 
I represent the shell shocked 'cause it's in my veins

Everybody's going trigger happy, wanting to blast
I remember we used to play ball and cut class
Now my niggas sport bulletproofs, clutching their gat
We all headed for hell, my grandmama told me that
Even now I'm going shell shocked, wanting to shoot
I was a little cool nigga to tell you the truth
They put the gats in the ghetto, them rotten motherfuckers
Wanted us to get frusterated and kill one another
Now we all beefing and it won't stop till we all sleeping
Everybody's got to die but why we point the finger at the white man
Nigga it's us killing us late at night man
So now I ask my god, is this the way of the world or just the hood niggas

Flowers in the soap saying I felt pain
Through the eyes of the youth I envision your gain
My nigga eric was young when he was caught up in the drama
Them niggas took his life right in front his baby mama
Was that God or the devil, that shit is so deep
It's hard to dig it with a shovel, now we on that other level
That's the tale of the ghetto, never change with the name
It's a constant war, nobody wins, everybody pains
Everywhere they hating
They got me sporting camoflauge when I'm misled, preparing on the armageddon
And everybody to blame for the supplies
To the vibes, little kids they caught up in the crossfires
Is this the way of the world or just the hood niggas

You know I just got outta jail and everything 
and I'm trying to change my life for the better 
You know I got kids to feed but I got a question you know 
Where do I go from here? 
 
[Chorus ][Sons of Funk] 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone

Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone

So many rainy days and gun sprays, I'm hearing AK's out my window 
Close my shades, let me blaze on this indo 
My situation getting sticky, life is green 
I mean I'm 19, and my momma is a dope fiend 
And I think about all the hard times we had 
No dad, no time shared, the buster never cared 
A little bastard child, going wild, 
Another victim of a broken home, my TRU friend was the chrome 
And if it wasn't for bad, I had no luck at all 
I represented my hood, I sprayed my name on the wall 
Fresh outta jail, and I'm here to see the sun rise another year 
But tell me where do we go from here

The ghetto is hot, it's dark, and most of all it's a prison 
Most of my niggas serve life sentences, only the few is risen 
I made it out the hood but my people still there 
Some of them dead, strung out, up in they wheelchair 
I still care from a distance 
and I know that any day could lead me back to that crimey insistence 
I tell the kids be persistent, when they follow they dreams 
Ain't no telling what tomorrow brings 
Ain't no time to be wasting, you want to be a doctor or the patient? 
Hesitation can lead to expiration, only God can predict it, 
Where do we go from here, snorting powder, drinking beer 
Smokin' crack, killin' our peers, I shed tears 
 
Chorus [Sons of Funk] 
Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears? 
The ghetto is a jungle, but I call it home 
I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone

Tell me why must I shed my tears?

I gotta struggle to live, so leave me alone 
 
[Silkk] 
Where do we go from here, after we all gone 
and where do we go after we ain't got no place to call home 
Hell I'm just glad to be breathing 
?? like I was the projects for a reason 
Shit, tell my niggas we gotta live, and some gotta give 
why'all gotta rise above this shit, and turn negatives into positive 
Yeah I struggled, but I'ma hustler, and that's self explanatory 
So if I die trying, the hood can just tell why'all my story 
Niggas seen killings and drug dealings, 
imagine we'd dream through it all 
Old ladies ?? through the window, I guess she done seen it all 
It's up to you, cause nobody seems to jam with us 
We struggled to long at the bottom, nowhere else to go but up

Tell me where do we go from here? 
Tell me why must I shed my tears?

Runnin from the cop who was trying to meet his quota
I'm young and I'm black, I'm a soldier
So he thinking I'm slanging that baking soda
You ain't heard about, nigga from that dirty south
Where the po-po's scout
Everybody, everybody that knows what your bout
Won't leave your house
Cause at night, nigga freaks come out
Grab your gat with that extra clip cause if you catch us slippin
You might connect the grip
Shots there cut up strip bout a couple of ship
Like the peoples in summertime agent trip
Lets take a trip to the land where the niggas
Do the murderman dance on their enemies
And fake niggas pretend to be a, they be them friends of me
Woah, slow your roll and daddy I'm camoflauged

The burn feels like almost a step from death
Fuck spending lives, I barely leave a minute of breath
I'm set, families with teks, release my stress in their chest
Wouldn't know where I'd be without my God and my vest
Killers, we the best fuck all the rest, here hit the cess
Snort, c'mon the test
With the charge the best, cause I open your chest
God bless, I made my way back so I can say that
Me too whatever, should have known that fiend believe in payback
Do it for haystacks, me, slim, twins, and mac
Gotta attack, with the jest to ask, deftly in the act

? ? our sound, tell my niggaz and my bitches
They'll drop in the storm, tell them boys it's on
And these niggaz gettin they ass torn, fuck bein warned
This is a street ? ? , I promise to die violent
Now I start wildin, until you bitch niggaz are silent

Nigga fuck that! I'm bout to send these niggaz life back
They talkin shit about my fam and I don't like that
You know how I react, so why you wanna beef?
It's time for me to say my prayers, and hit the streets
Bullets about to hum, bitch niggaz gon' get numb
Here come ? ? down the block nigga don't try to run
I ain't lettin it slide I caught him slippin and him twice
Next thing you that nigga was on the ground, shakin like dice

These niggaz fail the test so neverthless I split yo' chest
Fuck the rest!
I come through to spit, to show you niggaz what I manifest
A y.g., so I breathe toke three, ? ?
Bullets at you busters please, don't try to test these
Pistol packin niggaz in our town
You get them hot thangs laid in your mouth
My niggaz seek you out no doubt
All about my salary you niggaz ain't gon' handle me
I'm tired of stressin, and all these niggaz pretend they got me vexed

[young guns]
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die
We don't just rap - everything we say is for real
Time to let the gauge discharge, and murder that kill
Nigga fuck that! I ain't bout to let the shit slide
It's time to ride, time for these niggaz to die

Don't play no games, 'cause boy we be bout killin' 
You ain't got shit to die for you shouldn't be livin' 
Get rid the fuckin' smirk ain't a damn thing funny 
All my niggas know we live for weed and money 
Platinum and vogues on the walls of my company 
'cause TRU niggas live life motherfuckin' G's 
Presidents and playin' in every resident 
'cause pumpin' no limit shit is essential 
I make money off the words that I speak 
I flip a cassette like I used to flip a quarter key 
The rap game is like standin' on a block 
Every tape I sell is like a motherfuckin' dime rock 
Give me the money so you can keep the bitches 
They don't play no game see-Murder bout his riches 
The money talk and bullshit walks pay to get delt with 
And haters get they ass kicked 
(Chorus) 
Don't Play no games boy, we be bout killin'

Don't Play no games boy, we be bout killin'

Ya we bad watch us I ain't playin' with your bitch ass

My eyes red my head bad I still fuck over ya 
You know the name you know the game and the pain 
Bitches still the same bigger bank higher rank 
Whatcha thank your head I like your shit don't stank 
But you're gettin' spanked I'm gonna get at yours forgot that thank 
You bitch who wrong move I'm gone get you

We bout murder money weed ammunition guns and drugs 
Fake niggas stand correct show my real niggas some love 
Mrs. Thug I live the life of a motherfuckin' thug 
7 digits bigger niggas still fightin' in clubs 
You think you saw the worst bitch the worst is yet to fuckin' come 
Up jump and take everyone and your best to fucking run 
Shoot first ask questions later 
Quick before I lose ya ask what time it fuckin' was 
I guess when you're too paranoid smokin' too much motherfuckin' bud 
Don't play no games bitch respect the name bitch 
Fuck who you came with and fuck what you sayin' bitch 
You heard of Mystikal, heard of P, heard of me, and heard of see 
Either we solo or we ridin' thirty-d you can't stop me I know 
All they can do is watch me drop ya with your eyes closed 
In a project curb apartment motherfuckin' dealin' 
You want to know why we ain't smilin' 'cause we thugs we mugs 
Ain't nothin' bout being friendly

i came up with blood money that means 
i'm wicked I roll with nothing but ninos 
so they call me a baller i wiped a niggaz ass 
because I'm not a talker 
took a flight to kali came back with some birds 
ten g's for a key from a nigga called dirt 
I like to hear my mack eleven empty out a clip 
shot a fool up in the club and then i changed my outfit
maintain and uphold my statis as a g 
niggaz kiss my ass because i got a lot of money
plain and simple niggaz leave huh when i don't feel'em 
because they know when they fuck up then i'm going to kill'em 
understand i was rasied where the young niggaz roam
if you wanted something nigga you had to get up on your own 
all these want to be motherfucken

You can't feel what I feel cause this shit's to deep

Ain't no seeing when your motherfucking loved ones die
Don't point the finger and criticize what he did
Invest all your thoughts and all the times he hid
Will I ever see my brother again time will tell
I feel like I'm trapped between heaven and hell

Coming out my eyes cause I  hear I miss my homies 
On top of that my court dates tomorrow
Facing ten years added to my pain and sorrow

A lesson was learned when they put you in the grave
It don't matter what you got when a nigger gone get cha
Cause when a nigger gone hit ya a nigger gone hit ya
Bulletproof with ak's with hundred round drums
Can't stop one bullet penetrating your dome

You lose material shit you can get it again
But ain't no coming back when you meet the reaper

He didn't run tore his ass up with a quick fast sight

Oh 
It's life or death in my town 
And I'm standin' on deadly ground 
I just want to live my life 
All by myself
 
Life is full of debt 
And life is full of cnflict 
I'm just tired of seein' all my homies out here dyin' quick 
Society today is all twisted 
Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal

Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig

Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath.

I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody 
Money is the rule to all evil 
Better watch yourself boo
