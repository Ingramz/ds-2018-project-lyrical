Carole Fredericks,"J'irai par la mer, j'irai tranquille
Cherchant tes yeux verts
Vers vers vers l'exil
Dans mon cœur marine j'emporterai ta flamme

J'irai par les airs, j'irai tranquille
Cherchant ton souffle doux
Doux doux doux fragile
Légère face au vent, plus libre qu'avant

Quelle que soit la voie
Où que tu sois
Qu'importe la manière
J'irai jusqu'à toi

J'irai par le feu, j'irai sans doute
Cherchant l'étincelle elle elle elle
Qui envoûte
Renaître à nouveau comme une goutte d'eau

Quelle que soit la voie
Où que tu sois
Qu'importe la manière
J'irai jusqu'à toi

J'irai par la terre, j'irai sans doute
Cherchant ton mystère erre erre erre
Sur la route
Et si je me perds j'irai par les airs

Quelle que soit la voie
Où que tu sois
Qu'importe la manière
J'irai jusqu'à toi
Quelle que soit la voie
Où que tu sois
Qu'importe la manière
J'irai jusqu'à toi",J'Irai Tranquille,1995
Carole Fredericks,"Regarde la sphère elle tournera
Sans qu´on soit là
Dis toi ça et tu verras

Le grand manège, c´est fait pour ça
Pour que la neige fonde au soleil tu verras

Même quand les arbres n´ont plus de branches
Quand sous la tempête ils penchent
Ils restent forts ils restent droits

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter

Regarde moi et sourie moi
Bientôt crois moi, bientôt la roue tournera
C´est toi qui me consolerais
C´est toi qui me diras ne t´en fait pas
Car l´essentiel tu l´as au fond de toi

Même quand les arbres n´ont plus de branches
Quand sous la tempête ils penchent
Ils restent forts ils restent droits

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter",Laisse Pleurer Les Nuages,1995
Carole Fredericks,"Dans mon jardin secret y a des fleurs immortelles
Des soucis des pensées des racines éternelles
Y a des arbres écorchés par des serments gravés
Et deux trois réverbères qui m´éclairent sur hier

L´allée de mon immeuble qui voulait voir le jour
Le couloir vers ma chambre trop étroit pour danser
L´église au toit pointu qui orientait ma vue
Vers un tout p´tit bout de ciel qui me tendait ses ailes

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

Encrés dans mon cahier, je les revoie encore
Les bateaux qui partaient, me laissant sur le port
Le vieux tutu froissé, que j´ai envoyé valser
Le lipstick rougissant de mes premiers baisers

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Avant qu´ils s´évaporent je veux qu´ils brûlent encore
Chaque jour chaque nuit comme l´essence de ma vie",Les Parfums d'Autrefois,1995
Carole Fredericks,"Les p´tites notes que l´on sème
Comme des cailloux des graines
C´est pour qu´on se souvienne
De nos joies de nos peines

Les paroles qui s´envolent
Comme des plumes des lucioles
C´est pour qu´on les retienne
Ces doux rêves qu´on cageole

Un p´tit air qui flotte dans l´univers
Un p´tit air qui rime avec les Airs

On n´sait pas d´où elles viennent
Ces ballades ces rengaines
Qui s´écoulent dans nos veines
Comme du sang de bohème

Un p´tit air qui flotte dans l´univers
Un p´tit air qui rime avec les Airs

Les p´tites notes que l´on sème
Comme des cailloux des graines
Sur les routes sur les scènes
C´est à vous qu´elles reviennent",Les Petites Notes,1995
Carole Fredericks,"A l'heure où la nuit s'éveille
Quand la lune change de quartier
Dans sa robe vermeille
Elle nous glisse des mots de passe à l'oreille

Ailleurs au fin fond du sommeil
On aperçoit des trésors démons et des merveilles
Il en faudra des efforts pour percer le mystère qui dort
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris

Plonger sans bruit et traverser des chemins interdits
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris
Se souvenir au petit matin blême
Des solutions données à nos problèmes

Ailleurs les dunes de sel
Et les plages de sucre roux brûlantes au soleil
Et les traces que je suis pas à pas
Pour sortir du tunnel

J'entends une douce voix qui m'appelle
Qui ne parle que de toi, et toi qui m'ensorcelle
Et qui revient chaque lune comme une dose d'amour nocturne
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris

Plonger sans bruit et traverser des chemins interdits
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris
Se souvenir au petit matin blême
Des solutions données à nos problèmes",Voler la Nuit,1995
Carole Fredericks,"Sans rien dire les pensées se lisent
Sans rien dire les yeux poétisent
Comme des miroirs le reflet de nos histoires

Sans rien dire souvent s'improvise
Le désir lorsque l'on s'enlise
Dans un regard en faisant mine de se voir

Nous on se reconnaîtra n'importe où
On s'enverra toujours des yeux doux
Pas besoin de message entre nous
Nous on a besoin que nos cœurs se nouent
Que nos sangs se métissent et s'avouent
On se reconnaîtra n'importe où

Et qu'importe la couleur des masques que l'on porte
Puisqu'on frappe ensemble à la même porte
Laissons le rideau tomber

Et qu'importe puisque les sentiments nous transportent
Laissons-les chanter pour ouvrir les portes
Et laissons les clés tomber

Nous on se reconnaîtra n'importe où
On s'enverra toujours des yeux doux
Pas besoin de message entre nous
Nous on a besoin que nos cœurs se nouent
Que nos sangs se métissent et s'avouent
On se reconnaîtra n'importe où

Nous on se reconnaîtra n'importe où
On s'enverra toujours des yeux doux
Pas besoin de message entre nous

Que nos sangs se métissent et s'avouent
On se reconnaîtra n'importe où",Les Yeux Doux,1995
Carole Fredericks,"Et si j'étais né en 17 à Leidenstadt
Sur les ruines d'un champ de bataille
Aurais-je été meilleur ou pire que ces gens
Si j'avais été allemand ?

Bercé d'humiliation, de haine et d'ignorance
Nourri de rêves de revanche
Aurais-je été de ces improbables consciences
Larmes au milieu d'un torrent

Si j'avais grandi dans les docklands de Belfast
Soldat d'une foi, d'une caste
Aurais-je eu la force envers et contre les miens
De trahir, tendre une main

Si j'étais née blanche et riche à Johannesburg
Entre le pouvoir et la peur
Aurais-je entendu ces cris portés par le vent
Rien ne sera comme avant

On saura jamais c'qu'on a vraiment dans nos ventres
Caché derrière nos apparences
L'âme d'un brave ou d'un complice ou d'un bourreau?
Ou le pire ou plus beau ?
Serions-nous de ceux qui résistent ou bien les moutons d'un troupeau
S'il fallait plus que des mots ?

Et si j'étais né en 17 à Leidenstadt
Sur les ruines d'un champ de bataille
Aurais-je été meilleur ou pire que ces gens
Si j'avais été allemand ?

Et si j'étais né en 17 à Leidenstadt
Sur les ruines d'un champ de bataille

Si j'avais été allemand ?
Et qu'on nous épargne à toi et moi si possible très longtemps
D'avoir à choisir un camp",Né en 17 À Leidenstadt,2001
Carole Fredericks,"Graver l'écorce
Jusqu'à saigner
Clouer les portes
S'emprisonner

Vivre des songes
A trop veiller
Prier des ombres
Et tant marcher

J'ai beau me dire
Qu'il faut du temps
J'ai beau l'écrire
Si noir sur blanc
Quoi que je fasse
Où que je sois
Rien ne t'efface
Je pense à toi

Passent les jours
Vides sillons
Dans la raison
Mais sans amour

Passe ma chance
Tournent les vents
Reste l'absence
Obstinément

J'ai beau me dire
Que c'est comme ça
Que sans vieillir
On n'oublie pas
Quoi que je fasse
Où que je sois
Rien ne t'efface
Je pense à toi
Et quoi que j'apprenne
Je ne sais pas
Pourquoi je saigne
Et pas toi

Y'a pas de haine
Y'a pas de roi
Ni dieu, ni chaîne
Qu'on ne combat
Mais que faut-il
Quelle puissance ?
Quelle arme brise
L'indifférence ?

Oh, c'est pas juste
C'est mal écrit
Comme une injure
Plus qu'un mépris

Et quoi que j'apprenne
Je ne sais pas

Carole Fredericks,"Y aura des jardins, d'l'amour et du pain
Des chansons, du vin, on manquera de rien
Y aura du soleil sur nos fronts
Et du bonheur plein nos maisons
C'est une nouvelle ère, révolutionnaire
On aura du temps pour rire et s'aimer
Plus aucun enfant n'ira travailler
Y aura des écoles pour tout l'monde
Que des premières classes, plus d'secondes
C'est la fin de l'histoire, le rouge après le noir
On aura nos dimanches
On ira voir la mer
Et nos frères de silence
Et la paix sur la terre
Mais si la guerre éclate
Sur nos idées trop belles
Autant crever pour elles
Que ramper sans combattre
Y aura des jardins, d'l'amour et du pain
On s'donnera la main tous les moins que rien
Y aura du soleil sur nos fronts
Et du bonheur plein nos maisons
C'est une nouvelle ère, révolutionnaire
Un mode nouveau, tu comprends
Rien ne sera plus jamais comme avant
C'est la fin de l'histoire, le rouge après le noir.",Rouge,2001
Carole Fredericks,"Elle met du vieux pain sur son balcon
Pour attirer les moineaux, les pigeons
Elle vit sa vie par procuration
Devant son poste de télévision

Levée sans réveil, avec le soleil
Sans bruit, sans angoisse, la journée se passe
Repasser, poussière, y'a toujours à faire
Repas solitaires, en points de repère

La maison si nette, qu'elle en est supecte
Comme tous ces endroits, où l'on ne vit pas
Les êtres ont cédé, perdu la bagarre
Les choses ont gagné, c'est leur territoire

Le temps qui nous casse, ne la change pas
Les vivants se fanent, mais les ombres, pas
Tout va, tout fonctionne, sans but, sans pourquoi
D'hiver en automne, ni fièvre, ni froid

Elle met du vieux pain sur son balcon
Pour attirer les moineaux, les pigeons
Elle vit sa vie par procuration
Devant son poste de télévision
Elle apprend dans la presse à scandale
La vie des autres qui s'étale

Mais finalement, de moins pire en banal
Elle finira par trouver ça normal
Elle met du vieux pain sur son balcon
Pour attirer les moineaux, les pigeons

Des crèmes et des bains, qui font la peau douce
Mais ça fait bien loin, que personne ne la touche
Des mois, des années, sans personne à aimer
Et jour après jour, l'oubli de l'amour

Ses rêves et désirs, si sages et possibles
Sans cri, sans délire, sans inadmissible
Sur dix ou vingt pages, de photos banales
Bilan sans mystère, d'années sans lumière

Elle met du vieux pain sur son balcon

Carole King,"Oh by loving you
Loving you, my darling
Oh you've become

You're a part of me
Oh and that's why
Why I'm so lonely
Oh I'm so lonely

Carole King,"Long ago we had our dreams
And that was all that we needed
Then all at once we got to see
The cycles we repeated

I said, baby, can't you be real

Anyone can look into your eyes
And tell you what you're missin'

Carole King,"Baby, you're so frazzled
Spinnin' around in a busby swirl
With all that razzle-dazzle

Watch 'em do a few laps around the sun
But if you don't go in for far-off places
I'll take you home with me
When the day is done

Baby, you're so scattered
Your span of attention is shrinkin' fast
Your brain's been battered
By all the disappointments of the recent past

Watch 'em do a few laps around the sun
But if you don't go in for far-off places
I'll take you home with me

Didn't I see you walkin' on Main Street
Lookin' in the windows
Waitin' by turnstiles
Thinking of things you thought you'd like to buy

Living off dreams stored up in film cans
Looking at screens just waiting your turn while
You looked up and saw a rocket in the sky

You've been a real good friend
You're around when I'm down
To pick me up again
Though it could never be said
To my faults you're blind
You overlook the bad
And you keep all the good in mind

Now, there have been times 
When we couldn't get it on
And I thought I'd have to admit 
The feeling was gone
But you just closed your mind 
To all the seeds of doubt
And somehow you found a way

At the close of the day
You got a way of lookin'
That sends a message my way
What this message means
Any old fool could see
And the thing that makes me feel so well
Is you mean it just for me

To love, to love, to love, to love
Baby, don't you make a fool of me

I never will forget our first encounter

What have you got to lose

Yes, it shows you need a change

That the things that made you feel so good before
Have not been feeling good 'cause I'm so much in love with you

Carole King,"We've been knowing each other
For many a year, it's true,
And I can't think of anyone else
Can make me feel as good as you.
Yeah, you make my day
A little bit brighter in every way.

I'm so glad to have you
In this old troubled time;
When true love and understanding, child,
Are so hard to find.
Yes, you make my day
A little bit brighter every day.

Some people live in darkness
Their whole life through.
I just know that I'd have been one of them
If it hadn't been for you.

Now, sometimes I feel afraid
As we all tend to do,

And I know we're gonna make it through.

Carole King,"You've been my life to me.
My very soul and my heart,
But lately something's come over you,
And it's tearing me apart.

[Chorus]
Darlin', I feel you growing away from me
More and more each day.
Whatever you want me to be I'll be
If it keeps you from growing away from me.

Even when you say you love me,
The feeling's no longer there.
I know there's somebody else,
And it's more than I can bear.

[Chorus]

Believe me, I would let you go if I could,
But I don't know if it's a worse thing being lonely
Than having you here, in body only.

It's no use pretending
When the love you used to feel is gone,
Yet even though I'm losing you
I can't help tryin' to hold on.

I feel you
Growing away from me.",Growing Away from Me,1971
Carole King,"All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me 
That's some kind of wonderful

Any time my little world is blue

And every thing seems to be 
Some kind of wonderful

Carole King,"Surely, you know how I stand on the question of my loving you;
Haven't I proved it in so many ways?
Surely, you can tell by the way I kiss your lips that I want you;
More surely than my words can say.

I see you stand and accuse me of no longer wanting you.
Misunderstanding what others have seen.
Surely, you won't let idle people, with nothing else to rely on,
Tear down all our hopes and our dreams.

Tell me, does the rain fall?  (Surely, surely...)
And does the summer always follow spring?
How does a turtle go?  (Slowly, surely.)
That's how my love grows, surely, surely, surely.

Darling, if your head misleads you
Just listen to your heart; it knows I need you.
Just as surely as the sun is gonna rise.
Just as surely as the birds are gonna sing.
Just as surely as everything is part of everything;
I'm a part of you.

And surely, you know that I love you.
I love you.",Surely,1971
Carole King,"If anyone asks you how I am
Just say I'm doin' fine.
If you will do that for me,

I don't want my friends to see me like this.
Maybe some other time.

Too much rain fallin'.
There's just been too much rain, down on me.

One day I'm gonna understand
The way that my heart works,
And then I'm gonna work it out,
So that I won't get hurt.

But if anyone asks you where I've gone,
Oh, don't say where I am,
Just say you saw me and I'm doin' fine,

Carole King,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side

He moved with some uncertainty, as if we didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree
And his hand came down empty

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well

A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black
Now my tapestry's unraveling, he's come to take me back
He's come to take me back",Tapestry [Piano-Voice Version],1971

When my striving seems so senseless, you gentle me
You lift my spirits, I get higher by degree

And ask for more
The only thing you leave is compromise

Well, all right, you go your way, I'll go mine

There's nothing here to hold you now
We left those dreams so far behind
You go your way, I'll go mine

Oh, there's no need for false amending
Things get so confusing when you do
When love's become a loss, we spend our
Nights defending
I feel so damn defeated when we're through

Under the moon, 
You're the light of creation

That I'd come to love you

A case of ""here and gone""

Until you came along
But now each day I'm given
Is one more day I know

With King Kong
Swinging out of a tree
And carrying me
Over that jungle Avenue P

With your face in a droop
On the stoop
Cause your mama the boss
Says you better not cross
That old Avenue P

In a jungle you're free!
The tom-tom beats
The tiger carouses
The jungle creeps over the red brick houses
And for chillers and thrillers
I train giant gorillas
To chase mamas and papas
Clippety-cloppety
Thumping their breasts
Roaring, 'get off my property!'
No one's allowed
Who says maybe or no
They gotta get out
They just gotta go
Right!

To be just spectacular

And fangs in my head

Cover all the trap doors

Was meant for me!
I got the looks
I got the style
I got the bloodshot eyes
And a ghastly smile

Who only would say, I don't care!
Read his story, my friend, for you'll find
At the end that a suitable
Moral lies there

One day his mother said
When Pierre climbed out of bed
Good morning, darling boy, you are my only joy
Pierre said I don't care!
What would you like to eat?
I don't care!
Some lovely cream of wheat?
I don't care!
Don't sit backwards in your chair
I don't care!
Or pour syrup on your hair
I don't care!
You are acting like a clown
I don't care!
And we have to go to town
I don't care!
Don't you want to come, my dear?
I don't care!
Would you rather stay right here?
I don't care!
So his mother left him there

His father said get off your head
Or I will march you up to bed!
Pierre said I don't care!
I would think that you could see
I don't care!
Your head is where your feet should be! 
I don't care! 
If you keep standing upside down
I don't care!
We'll never get to town
I don't care!
If only you would say, I care
I don't care! 
I'd let you fold the folding chair
I don't care!
So his parents left him there
They didn't take him anywhere

Now as the night began to fall
A hungry lion paid a call
He looked Pierre right in the eye
And asked him if he'd like to die
Pierre said I don't care!
I can eat you, don't you see?
I don't care!
And you will be inside of me
I don't care! 
Then you will never have to bother
I don't care!
With a mother and a father
I don't care!
Is that all you have to say?
I don't care!
Then I'll eat you, if I may
I don't care!
So the lion ate Pierre

Arriving home at six o'clock
His parents had a dreadful shock!
They found the lion sick in bed and cried
Pierre is surely dead!
They pulled the lion by the hair
They hit him with the folding chair
His mother asked, where is Pierre?
The lion answered, I don't care!
His father said, Pierre's in there!

They rushed the lion into town
The doctor shook him up and down
And when the lion gave a roar 
Pierre fell out upon the floor
He rubbed his eyes and scratched his head
And laughed because he wasn't dead
His mother cried and held him tight
His father asked, are you alright?
Pierre said I am feeling fine
Please take me home, it's half past nine

The lion said, if you would care
To climb on me, I'll take you there
Then everyone looked at Pierre
Who shouted yes, indeed, I care!

And stayed on as a weekend guest

Carole King,"What do you think, are we gonna stay lost in the maze
Of mind games and power plays
Or are we gonna take the chance of a lifetime
To see the light of day

What'll we see when we've used up the last supplies
Of rainbows and butterflies
I keep believing if we all work together
We will surely find a way

We are lost in a labyrinth
There's only one thing to do

Just break down the walls
And reach out your hand to your brother
We can lead each other
To where destiny calls
Faith and lovin' energy will see us through

After a while we will see
The labyrinth isn't anyplace we need to be
Then we can come out from the heart of the darkness
Into a brighter day

One of these days we will know
The heart will take us anywhere we want to go
I only hope it's not too late for the purpose
Tho' just what that is I can't say

We are lost in a labyrinth
There's only one thing to do

Just know in your mind
You want to stand behind your brother
Reach out and lead each other
To a new age in time
Faith and lovin' energy will free your mind

Carole King,"Poetic phrases come to mind
Whenever I find injustice being done
And I wonder, what am I gonna do
What can one do except to be one
Talking to two, touching three
Growing to four million
Each of us is one-all of us are one

I go through phases when I realize
It wouldn't be wise to try and bring it down
And I wonder, what am I gonna do
What should one do except just be around
Staying alive, putting out love
Growing to five billion
Each of us is one-all of us are one

Open your heart and let the love come shining through
And you will do what you need to do
To know just where the other you is coming from
He is one-she is one
A tree is one-the earth is one-the universe is one
I am one-we are one

It just amazes me that I can be
Part of the energy it takes to serve each other
And I wonder what am I gonna do
What can one do
Except be one

We are one
What am I gonna do

Carole King,"The winds of time set my mind at ease
Like a gentle breeze, they let me know that I love you
Over and over again, we light the flame
Re-discovering that we are the same and I love you
Ah--it feels so good to know that I love you

With each new morning it's a good feeling to know
There is something to look forward to these days
As time sets in, we still begin to know each other
Even now as we go our separate ways
Ever together

Like the sun and the moon we give each other room
To shine and to glow and to grow and I know that I love you
Ah--it feels so good to know that I love you




",To Know That I Love You,1977
Carole King,"Waking up alone, I find my mind is reaching out to distant corners
Crystal mourners are drawing me to Babylon
Can you really stay yourself and flow with dedication
You're the one who knows and now you're gone

We got a feeling and I'm gonna try to keep it for a long time
It was a wrong time, though we had so much to travel on
Can you hold the love I gave in joyful consummation
You're the one who knows and now you're gone

Can you see my reflection in the facets of the prisms that you gave me
One day I am yellow
One day I am blue--can you save me

I'll be yours forever in the secret magic forest
That we dreamed about together
Can you see the color that I am today
I know I wanna stay in a good way

Waking up alone I find my mind is calling out
And I know you feel me
You know the real me is whatever color love takes on
Can you live with someone who's a mistress of illusion
You're the one who knows and now you're gone

Carole King,"So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door

Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Oh how I wish I could but you're so far away

One more song about moving along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

Like a thunder rope

And fell into the wrong end of a telescope
So I began to run
I knew not to where I'd come

Carole King,"When my friends told me you had someone new,
I didn't believe a single word was true.
I told them all I had faith in you.
I kept right on sayin':
Oh, no, not my baby.
Oh, no, not my sweet baby.
You're not like all those other girls 
Who play with man's hearts like they were toys.
 
My mama told me, ""Son,when rumors spread 
That there is truth somewhere 
And you should use your head.""
But I sure didn't listen to what she said;
Don't you know I kept right on sayin':

Carole King,"No I'd rather go and journey 
Where the diamond crescent's glowing
And run across the valley
Beneath the sacred mountain
And wander through the forest
Where the trees have leaves of prisms
That break the sight up into colors
That no one know the names of

And when it's time I'll go and lay
Beside the legendary fountain
Till I see her form reflected
In its clear and gentle waters
And if you think I'm ready
You may lead me to the chasm
Where the rivers of our visions
Flow into one another

And I'll stay awhile and wonder
At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it
Cleanse my mind and body
And I know at this moment
As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive
Beneath the white cascading water

She may beg and she may plead
And she may argue with her logic
Mention all the things I'll lose
That really have no value
Though I doubt that she will ever
Come to understand my meaning
In the end she'll surely know 
I was not born to follow

Was enough to fill my cup
Now I offered all I got

Who got the least amount to give

Once I met the devil Ã¢?? he was mighty slick
Tempted me with wordly goods

But I'm in too great a need of mind.Ã¢??

Carole King,"If you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you

You've got a need for company
Someone you know will be there
Don't let your bruised and battered soul deny it
My scars are plain to see
But love's been good to me
And I know it's because I was willing to try it

So if you want to love again
Don't hesitate any more
Love is like a boomerang
It comes right back to you

Throw it out, let it fly
Let it soar, watch it sail across the sky
Mountains are there for you to climb
People are doing it all the time
You can make it to the top if you make your attempt a strong one

So if you want to give your heart
Don't be afraid to try

Carole King,"When I was young I used to see her
Herdin' her goats on the hillside
No one knows
And she ain't tellin' her age
I'd say she's just about seventy-five

She's an old timer tryin' 
To hold on to what she's got
They call her Goat Annie

I still remember the stories
The townspeople told to each other
Just because she liked her goats
Better than people
They said the devil was her brother

She never paid them no mind
She just kept on
Bein' herself Goat Annie

She's a rare individual
One of a dying breed
Everything she's got
Right now
Is all she'll ever need

One day the government decided
They had to have
The land she lived on
They came with the papers
Polite as could be
They said she had just thirty days
To get gone

You could see them smirking
We're just doin' our job here
You understand, Goat Annie 

She said, I was born and raised here
Ain't never done wrong to no one
You ain't gonna
Throw me off my land, not
Me or my goats or my shotgun

Then she leveled her 12-gauge
With a blast, she sent 'em packin'
Go, Goat Annie

Next day they came with the lawmen
But that didn't get 'em nowhere
Rather than shoot 
At a poor old lady
They decided to let her
Live her days out there

But there are still some people 
With heart

Make it nice, play it clean jazzman.

When the jazzman's testifyin' a faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise or bring you to your knees.

It's a gospel kind of feelin', a touch of Georgia slide,
A song of pure revival and a style that's sanctified.

Jazzman take my blues away;
Make my pain the same as yours with every change you play.
Jazzman, oh jazzman.

When the jazzman's signifyin', and the band is windin' low.
It's the late night side of morning in the darkness of his soul.

He can fill a room with sadness as he fills his horn with tears.
He can cry like a fallen angel when risin' time is near.

Like the sailor's lost horizon,
He needs some place to rest

And those stranger's cold perceptions
They've killed his confidence
Nightingale, she sails away upon a sea of song
Nightingale, she serenades his lonely, lonely life along
When his tired voice is broken
His golden hope is gone
She makes a lost soul's simple longing
somehow not so wrong
Nightingale, nightingale

He was strong, but he was taken
By the thought of his success
Those spotlights shadows
How they lured him and took him like all the rest
But that old dream don't look good now
No it don't seem quite the same
He needs to hear a tender word
Won't you sing him home again
Nightingale, she sails away up on a sea of song
Nightingale, she serenades his lonely, lonely life along
When his strength is slowly going,
His pride is all but gone

An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side

He moved with some uncertainty, as if we didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree
And his hand came down empty

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black

Are the times when I can really know you

Why must I be denied the thrill of your kiss
What did I do to you to be treated like this
Why must I spend another night with the boys

We wouldn't get serious or mysterious

I wasn't gonna fall in love, no I wasn't gonna fall
I wasn't gonna fall in love, till I fell in love with you

Can't lose I want to spread the news

As long as you're a part of me
Nothin's gonna take me down, oh

Cold city it was hard to commit
You were out there lookin' for the perfect fit

So why can't we reach across the line

C'est un mot merveilleux, un appel qui jaillit
Et de souffle en murmure aboutit à ce cri
Déchirant par instant
Le silence angoissant
De la nuit
Ton nom
Que répète ma voix et que reprend l'écho
Mets le trouble en mon âme
et le feu sous ma peau
et tant qu'il vibre en moi

Et me guide à travers

Se transforme pour moi en simple mot d'amour

Et le crie sur les toits, dans le vent comme un fou

Il plane autour de moi, il me frôle et me serre

For Machine Gun, took the poor boy away.
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison

The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way

What she says them mostly just to calm me down

Carole King,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

That he no longer wished to live

The chestnuts pop. Pop! pop! pop!

Nothing in the world can buy,
When they pass around the chocolate
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives!

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling,
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling ""Yoo hoo,""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go, Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand, Just holding your hand,
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two

For a sleigh ride together with you.",Sleigh Ride,2011

Carole King,"Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings

Snow flakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes

There's alot of things I want, a lot of things that I'd like to be.
But girl, I don't forsee  a rags-to-riches story for me.

There's just one round I've gotta win,
I can't be a loser with you.

Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life,
let me hold on to one good thing I found!
Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',
 
Cause I couldn't face a day if you weren't here by my side.
If you went away then I'd be left without any pride.
I've given up on schemes, 'Cause all of them fell through,
I've given up so many things, Don't ask me to give up on you.

That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find,
But if you stand by me, I'll keep my peace of mind.
I can't give you the world, But I I'll work hard for you, girl.
I'll work hard, ev'ryday, all my life. 
So baby, please don't leave me, just do this for me.

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams

Je, je suis libertine
Je suis une catin
Je, je suis si fragile
Qu'on me tienne la main

Fendre la lune, baisers d'épine et de plume
Bercée par un petit vent, je déambule
La vie est triste comme un verre de grenadine
Aimer c'est pleurer quand on s'incline

Je, je suis libertine
Je suis une catin
Je, je suis si fragile
Qu'on me tienne la main

Quand sur mon corps tu t'endors
Je m'évapore
Bébé tu dors et moi j'attends l'aurore
Quand de mes lèvres tu t'enlèves
Un goût amer
Me rappelle que je suis au ciel

Cendre de lune, petite bulle d'écume
Perdue dans le vent, je brûle et je m'enrhume
Mon corps a peur, la peau mouillée, j'ai plus d'âme
Papa, ils ont violé mon cœur

Je, je suis libertine
Je suis une catin

Carole Rederieka,"Triste, elle est prête à tout
Pour rien, pour tout
Dans la ronde des fous
Elle pleure tout doux
L'amour a tué les mots qui la touchent, touchent
Contre ta bouche elle veut qu'on la couche
Triste, elle fait la grimace
Devant sa glace
D'un coup du cœur enlace
L'ombre qui passe
Et rien jamais n'effacera les traces, lâches
Du sang qui coule des corps qui se cassent

I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star
""Life is around you and in you""

You and your group at the club, trying to shoot your slugs
You think a nigga won't box you, or shoot your mug

I just came here to party baby, drank and roam blocks
Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz

I'm here often nigga (doing what), buying the bar
Getting crunk with my click, might be eyeing a star
I see white eyeing a bar, while I sip my Belve
Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

(get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know
If she cutting tonight shorty, then I got to go

Get fucked up, chunk up your hood in the club

Twenty inches spinning slow, as I crawl in the lot

But oh no, a nigga recognized disguise
I looked past that thick ass, and them big ol' thighs
I'm A G, I peep game constantly
So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me

I'm at the bar, taking shots to the head
Trying to find a yellow bone, that give shots to the head

Spit a line and she mine, while she drop in my bed

From love before
When it got serious I took off
Runnin' for the door

Oh man, it's been a while, a half a mile's all I could do
Then I pulled a couple weeds out of the cracks
In the sidewalk to my front door
Poured out the coffee pot, stuck it underneath the cabinet
Drank a tall cool glass of water, gonna break that caffeine habit
And quit steppin' over all my winter clothes
And pick em' up off the floor
Stop by bobby hendons, pay him back that twenty bucks

Yeah, this mornin' in the mirror by the door
I caught a glance of the man I've been lookin' for

A couple weeks ago I met a nice girl at my church
She reminded me of you, so sweet and down to earth
Well I finally mustered up a little nerve, and asked her for her number
I met her at the deli on her lunch break yesterday
We both went dutch, so I guess it's not a date

Takin' her hand, kickin' up sand
Sneakin' behind the old band stand

Down on the shores of the Chesapeake bay
The wind in her hair, salt in the air
Down in the dunes on a blanket there
All alone on a night like this I miss

Where I left my foot prints long ago

Caroline Doctorow,"Well that's a real nice jacket son
It looks like it cost you too
And that car you're driving
Hey does that belong to you
Well you don't look familiar
Are you new in town
Here's a local girl
Who wants to show you around
How do

Where'd you get that accent son
It matches your cowboy boots
Tonight those lone star ladies
Must be lonesome and oh so blue
'Cause we're a thousand miles
From the Texas line
And if you've no objection son
Tonight you're mine
How do

Well I've been to Paris baby
I've been to Dallas too
But I didn't see no one there
Who looked half as good as you
So if you ain't in a hurry baby
Just sit tight
I'm sort of in the mood
To speak some French tonight
Et vous?

Caroline Doctorow,"Come wander quietly and listen to the wind
Come here and listen to the sky
Come walking high above the rolling of the sea
And watch the swallows as they fly

There is no sorrow like the murmur of their wings
There is no choir like their song
There is no power like the freedom of their flight
While the swallows roam alone

Do you hear the calling of a hundred thousand voice
Hear the trumbling in the stone
Do you hear the angry bells ringing in the night
Do you hear the swallows when they've flown?

And will the breezes blow the petals from your hand
And will some loving ease your pain
And will the silence strike confusion from your soul
And will the swallows come again?",A Swallow Song,2003
Caroline Doctorow,"Tell me,
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

Caroline Doctorow,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Caroline Henderson,"This is a man's world, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
Man made the trains to carry heavy loads
Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

This is a man's, a man's, a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little baby girls and a baby boys
Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can
You know that man makes money to buy from other man

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

They're writing songs of love but not for me

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2008
Caroline Henderson,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

And that madness is directed at you
The touch of you unwinds me
And entwines me in a vision of you
I'm drowning in sweet desire

the scent of you attracts me
And entraps me an invisible snare
The thought of your lips on my skin
Bringing you back again
Loving you, the feeling
Loving you, I'm reeling

the darkness doesn't calm me
It alarms me
In the night with no sleep
The daylight brings no healing
Just the feeling
That you've cut in too deep
I'm drowning in sweet desire

alone now you are with me
I could give you

Not the living breathing me

When you hold the secret in your hand, the magic's tamed
There are no lights in my eyes now
And I sit for hours in a daze, cause I've lost the sweetest madness
That could baffle and amaze

She said come away from windows of glass
If you don't wanna follow then leave them there
And you'll find that the feeling will pass

""you don't know me yet, but you will find
I've been with you all the days of your life
When I took on the job I didn't realize you were such a difficult type,""
And she said:
""I'm so tired of fighting your wildest of ways

Can you feel all the voices pulling you?
I can't save you from what you dread,""

""I'm so tired of fighting you
It's why you're here now,""
And she said how I'm fading fast
""you must say goodbye now
I feel this is the place I leave you

I assure you that there's no-one will care,""

That is me and the cloud
That is you in the rhythm of stars
And the shining wet grass in the morning
And we're all born of a wish
An unlikely form of coincidences
Each one a bridge between stars
So small universal
Each grain of sand a person I could fall in love with
So small universal
And every time I look up know I'll be coming home
Endless re-arrangement a tearing apart the gift of a spark
The clash in the cloud that spawned your heart
Out of turmoil a bright flash in the sky

I'll march beneath your banner
While fortune she do smile
And we'll comfort one another
Along the banks of the nile

Your fingers they're too small

And the bullets they do fly
And the silver trumpets sound so loud
To hide the dismal cries
Oh, then cursed be those cruel wars

And I, from the white summit of your roof
In the light of the star-studded night
Listened to the fearsome flow of the euphrates below

I heard with tears, with tears
That on a day of horror massacre and blood
Your broad walls were shattered stone by stone
And thrown on the gardena around you

Did the blue room also turn to ashes
Where, within it's walls and carpets
My happy childhood rejoiced, my life grew
And my soul took flight?

My fathers' home!
Be assured that when I die
My soul will come to you as an exiled turtledove
To sing in tears its song of sorrow over your black ruins

But tell me, who will bring to me a handful
Of your sacred ashes the day I die, to put in my grave
And mix with my ashes, a singer of the homeland? 
A handful of ashes with my own, ancestral home

Of your memories, your suffering and your past
A handful of ashes to scatter over my heart",Handful of Ashes,2004

That thou & I were seen
It's a cold winter's night my love
It's now that I must lie alone
My bonny boy you were young
But a-growing
Oh, father dearest father I fear you've done me harm
For you've married me to a bonny boy
But you know he is too young
Oh, daughter dearest daughter
If you will stay at home with me
A lady you shall be while he's growing
We'll send him to the college for one year or two
& then perhaps in time my love
A man he'll make for you
I'll buy you white ribbons to tie around his bonny waist
To let the ladies know that he's married
At the age of sixteen he was a married man
At the age of seventeen he was the father of a son
At the age of eighteen my love, his grave it was a-growing green
And death had put an end to his growing
I made my love a shroud of the holland o-so fine
And every stitch I put in it the tears they did run down
Oh, once I had a sweetheart but now he's lying in the ground
But I'll nurse his bonny boy while he's growing

I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I won't even hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

'Cause I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you,
You, baby!

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding onto me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you,
You, baby!

Oh, yeah!
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Ooh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know

I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of

There is no heart so lost it cannot be found
There are no hopeless circumstances
There is no such thing as a godforsaken town
?Cause there are always second chances

Until this life is over
There is no point of no return
?Cause everywhere you turn

His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of

Wherever you may go
You haven't gone too far
Love is always there

Is no night so long it can stop the sun
From taking over come the morning
And there's no road so wrong, it can keep anyone
From finding home around the corner

So even in your darkest hour
Even when it?s more than you can bear
You've always got a prayer

His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of

Like a light in the window
Love calls you in from the dark
Like a tireless suitor
Heaven pursues your heart

His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of

So many living for the love of power
Wanting more until their final hour
The day has come for us to be part of

Rich man - your pockets are full
Money - it burns a hole in your soul
Poor man - with the hungry heart
You can be the place where the changes start

Carolyn Arends,"There's a time I can recall
Four years old and three feet tall
Trying to touch the stars and the cookie jar
And both were out of reach

And later on in my high school
It seemed to me a little cruel
How the right words to say always seemed to stay
Just out of reach

Well, I should not have thought it strange
That growing causes growing pains
'Cause the more we learn the more we know
We don't know anything

But still it seems a tragic fate
Living with this quiet ache
The constant strain for what remains
Just out of reach

We are reaching for the future
We are reaching for the past
And no matter what we have we reach for more
We are desperate to discover
What is just beyond our grasp
But maybe that's what Heaven is for

There are times I can't forget
Dressed up in my Sunday best
Trying not to squirm and to maybe learn
A bit of what the preacher preached

And later lying in the dark
I felt a stirring in my heart
And though I longed to see what could not be seen
I still believed

I guess, I shouldn't think it odd
Until we see the face of God
The yearning deep within us tells us
There's more to come

So when we taste of the divine
It leaves us hungry every time
For one more taste of what awaits
When Heaven's Gates are reached

We are reaching for the future
We are reaching for the past
And no matter what we have, we reach for more
We are desperate to discover
What is just beyond our grasp
But maybe that's what Heaven is for
I believe that's what Heaven is for

Terrified you'd run away, I made sure you couldn't stay

Down by the shore
There is a blind man
Who is not blind anymore

Everybody's talking
How can this be?
A little mud, a gentle touch
And now he can see

And he squints up at the light
And he wipes his tears away
And he whispers when
He sees his Healer's face

Oh, this is what love looks like
Oh, this is what love looks like
I never dreamed, I would see such a sight
This is what love looks like

There is no sorrow
In all the world
Deep as a father's
Who has lost his little girl

He begs the Healer
Come to her side
A whispered word
The daughter stirs

And now she's alive
And over by the door
Her father stands amazed
And when he tells the story he will say

Oh, this is what love looks like
Oh, this is what love looks like
I never dreamed, I would see such a sight
This is what love looks like

Well, I have seen it too, in the ways a soul can see
When I doubt like Thomas all these things are shown to me
The nail prints in His hand, the wound deep in His side
The body has been broken but His arms are open wide

This is what love looks like
This is what the folks like
I never dreamed, I would see such a sight
This is what love looks like

When I'll settle down
They tell me time is passing
And there's not too many good ones still around
I tell them I am not afraid to be alone

Or you might be in Virginia

I'd like to sleep in on Saturdays
But I hate to miss the good yard sales
In my dreams I pay a buck for matching lawn chairs
I don't like people who are rude to waitresses
I like to leave a big tip 'cause God knows I've been there

I ain't no angel baby, far from it!
But I never broke a heart, just for the fun of it
That's all you need to know
A little mystery is not so bad
What you don't know won't hurt you, I can promise that
That's all you need to know right now

I used to cruise down on main street
I wished I had my own boyfriend
I like to watch your hands while you're driving
I like the way you smile when no one's watching
I have to catch myself here I go flying

There's so much moreâ?¦â?¦and it's all worth waiting for!

And the diamonds from the deepest ocean

I would want again tomorrow

Take heed of stormy weather

Carolyn Martin,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peeped through the crack
And I looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you",I Thought About You,2005
Carolyn Martin,"I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine",I Wanna Be Around (To Pick Up the Pieces),2005
Carolyn Martin,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me

Carolyn Martin,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Carolyn Martin,"Now, listen while I tell you 'bout a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday Night

Their music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

And she told me a story yesterday 
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea 
Then she spread her wings high over me 
She said she's goin' now, come back tomorrow 

And I said, Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky 
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side

Fly away, high away, fly away 

Sure enough this morning came unto me 
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise 
And my angel she said unto me 
Today's the day for you to rise 
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise 
Then she took me high over yonder

You got g's man please
I'm overseas
I got the beats to keep you blowing on trees
Keep them hoes on they knees
I'm as cold as Mr. Freeze
Making music in this game
Like flipping coke into ki's
Everyday is the same when I'm rolling on chop
Got a cop on my left so I'm riding non-stop
Till I die
I'ma win 
See it's time to make ends
Thinking bout how I'ma make it so I'm sitting on rims
20 inches on chop
Hit the scene on the lean
Burban clean

Biscuit tucked at the seams
Make my dreams so real
Plot to make a mil
Let these haters know the way a player really fells
When I'm rollin' g

Bout to hit the switch
So I can dip on the strip
Pull in sideways than I cock it on 3

Carousel Kings,"I’ve been thinking of giving up
‘Cause every time I fill my cup
It goes away, my motivation

It’s too bad you can’t see through the shady lies that hide behind my eyes
I’m just a tin man searching for something that I’ve never had
You just could never get that

All along I was something you could always take for granted 
So it goes, I’m the one left standing stranded 

I keep on trying to stay awake 
I’m staking out my own place
I’m counting stars to keep my head straight

I’m not saying sorry anymore",Grey Goose,2017
Carousel Kings,"I spend my days just thinking ‘bout nothing
I’ll waste away just taking my time
I’ll do my best to try to rewind this
So I can find a place to unwind

Ever since I met you
All I really wanna do is restore all the faith that I have in my heart
I don’t really know why I never really even tried to make any changes on my end and thats why

You hate me, for everything that I am
You love me, for half of where I came from
You’re an actor, you blame us all the same
Betrayer, you lie yourself to shame

You’re a walking disaster
You played me for a fool
We keep moving backwards
Spinning out of control

If I could go back and try to change one thing
I’d try to take away all of this pain
I’d show you that your life is worth something
That things don’t have to stay the same","Hate Me, Love Me",2017
Carousel Kings,"Sitting all alone on the long ride home
You were next to me, now we’re both alone
Something that was said, getting in your head
Tumbling thought now you’re crumbling under me
Bodies turn away, nothing left to say
Progress isn’t made
Hearts are far away
I can feel the pain in you drowning me
Why are you hiding all from me?
I start to think about how all I’ve ever wanted was you
And I would hold you in my arms until your heart could hear the truth
If you could be alone, you could be the one
To lie to me , don’t lie to me
My eyes will never stray
It takes two hearts to open for love but right now…it’s just me

How do I know if I still do?
How can I see?
Can you show me right now?
How do I know if I still do?
What do you see?

Floating all alone, living in my head
Wish I wouldn’t be sinking with regret
Wonder how you feel living without my love in you
Far from you
Don’t want another you
Call you up again, say what isn’t 
Energy is red
Now you’re in my head spinning in circles again and again

I start to think about how all I’ve ever wanted was the truth
And life together on the mountainside as far as I can see
If you could be alone, I could be the one
For love and wealth , to fill your lungs, to kill your thoughts and steal your heart
Truth is love holds more beauty than words could say
I needed you","Here, Now, Forever",2017

I can’t leave it alone

Your goal is to control a heart and this time it’s mine
Can you tell me how you feel now?
I guess I’ll see the look on your face when the sun goes down

Don’t you waste your life away
Straying away from a good thing
Remember every step you take
See yourself in everything

Can you tell me what it feels like?
Or should we leave it alone?
You’ve been pacing the whole night
Living your life through the lens of your phone

We don’t even talk or text anymore

I love you unconditionally 

Hey girl, open up your mind
It’s time to face the limelight
When I’m sitting next to you, that’s when I feel alright
If you can lend me shoes, I would roam the earth with you
Forget everything, we would never have an issue
I could be your everything
I love you unconditionally

‘Cause I found you standing there all alone 
Then you looked up at me and we ran

But you already know
Let me summarize how I never met your expectations
You’re wrong
You’re wrong
I’m not afraid ‘cause pain is temporary and my soul lives forever

I’ll say goodbye for the last time
To everything I had
So let me try to live my own life
‘Cause I’m not coming back

You don’t see the value in creation
I guess it’s hard to show
My aim is to explain how we all can reach our own salvation
You’re lost
You’re lost
It’s not my place to try and help you find yourself 

I let you take me for granted
I’ve always been second handed
I’ve been living a lie, hiding all of my life
You never have, you never will
Love me just the same

You take me in, you push me out
You desire being desired
Throw me away too many times

I've been gone too long

That you give your light so freely
Won't you shed your beams on me

Can't afford no diamond rings
And wouldn't wear 'em if she could

Then she's gone on the wind
I can hear her whisper in the wood
I can hear the ocean
When I look into her eyes

My heart is swept away
Like a paper boat on the tide
I'm destined to run aground
With her by my side
Together we'll wake up
To a watercolor sunrise

She, she's been running in the rain
She's like whiskey on my brain
She makes me feel so high
She, she's got holes in her stockings
Now she's up and unlocking the door for me

No one really knows where she's from
She comes and she goes
Like a watercolor bleeds and runs away
What am I afraid of? Here she comes

And wouldn't wear them if she could
