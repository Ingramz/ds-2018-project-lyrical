Cartel de Santa,"Asesino de asesinos como ra y los elimino
Por que solo son mierda estorbando en el camino
Mi destino esta en la sima por hacer mejores rimas
Mientras que aquí en la tumba te bajan de la tarima
No gastes la saliva queriendo competir por que del alma
Al nacer yo soy el mejor mc`s aléjate de aquí que tu rap
Es asqueroso pinche prieto piojoso ya salte
De ese pozo 10 años y no sabes como se hace
Un buen hip-hop conozco principiantes que te dan
Una lección escucha bien mi vozy ya cállate el hocico
Pinche mico de circo que yo soy tu domador
Mi latigo es el flow que te causa esas heridas
Andas buscando fama retando a la artillería
Porquería que creias yo soy el real emesias
Me tienes envidia por que yo soy el estigma el enigma
Que siembra a todos tus secuaces con solo 2 frases me desago
De sus ases brisas se abren y rompen el estilo de tontos asesinos
Que querían jugar conmigo ahora con mi filo te voy a eliminar
En el cuarto de control te acercaste a saludar meintras que por detrás
Nos estas deseando muerte pero en ese momento
Chido les deseo mucha suerte
De frente eres un joto te faltan muchos huevos
Y mucho mas te falta para llegar a ser bueno
No llegas ni a pedo y dices que una mierda
Gordo por favor ya vete mucho a la verga
Que estoy arto de escuchar todas tus estupideses
Pagaras un alto precio con muy altos intereses
No hace falta que rezes al real emesias
Se te cumplió el deseo ya te conteste las rimas
Y decía tu pandilla que tu eras el mejor
Ahora ponen veladoras al mega rimador
Osea yo
No pudieron con mi flow mucho
Menos podrán con todo mi batallón
Soy la acción soy la gloria en mi micro la victoria
Tengo mas audacia que los topos de camboya
Soy la olla donde hierben los mc`s
Cuando tratan de acercarse con su micro a combatir
Me los paso por aquí todos juntos de uno en uno
Mi rima al rey neptuno grande como atila el uno
Visible como el humo de un incendio forestal
Te cagas en los calsones cuando suelto mi freestyle
Ayayay
En la mano traigo un mic y en los ojos
De infierno del que me quiera enfrentar
Vas pa' tras en retroceso
Como hacen los cangrejos
Aun recuerdo los consejos que algún día me dio
Mi viejo hacer caso de un pendejo tan solo es
Engrandecerlo siéntete gigantesco por que en
2 minutos 28 acabo de hacerlo",Asesino de Acesinos,2003
Cartel de Santa,"Campesinos asesinos, latinos 
Cámara con cuidado si te cruzo en el camino 
Que llego pa´mis vecinos el boleto pa´viajar 
Soy el dolor de cabeza que no pudieron parar 
45 burreros caminan por mis senderos 
Y la 187 me la paso por los huevos 
Por qué no somos nada nuevo tu nación vaya inundar 
Por más dólares que inviertas nunca me vas a parar 
Porque soy el criminal que nunca se echa pa´tras 
13 bolas para el frente ni un gramo regresara
Mi gente ya está tranquila porque ahora puede tragar
No necesito de aviones, no necesito camiones
Tengo toda mi confianza sobre un grupo de ladrones
A los cuales yo respeto cuando cruzan el desierto
Ya van demasiadas veces  muchos han caído muertos
Llevando grifa al gabacho saben todos mis atajos 
Y si hay que darles tirón 
Ellos saben no me rajo 
Aunque este muy duro el cuajo, cuajo, cuajo

Si te tumbo fácilmente es por qué yo soy más chingón 
Cámara, cámara jou, cámara, cámara jou
Si te tumbo fácilmente es por qué yo soy más cabrón

Ahora que le pongas marca la vas a querer sembrar 
Pero allí es donde revotas
Por eso limpio la mota 
Pa´ que el ritmo sea perfecto 
Y me des un alto precio 
Me mirabas con desprecio 
Y ahora te vas humillar 
Con saliva o sin saliva como a ti te guste mas 
Nada mas nunca olvides yo consigo lo que tires 
Y aunque la migra me mire 
Nunca me van a encontar 
Seguiré cruzando mota que traigo de michoacán

Pero sembramos pánico
Tenemos más poderes que los cuatro fantásticos 
Con delas record vamos haciendo ecos 
Llenando la cabeza de cualquier

No busques la salida no tienes donde esconderte

Sediento de dinero
Autos nuevos y mansiones y para conseguirlo
Voy sobrado en pantalones 300 maldiciones
Cargo en vocabulario, con mi estilo blasfemo
Hago que se incline el diablo
Llamado el emisario, aliado de la muerte
Eterno sobre el suelo ni lo sueñes no lo intentes
Que para detenerme solo dios omnipotente

Con las ideas bien claras dando firme las pisadas
Adictivo y contagioso como gripa colombiana

Con estilo de psycho loco, navegando calles del vago
Jake mate sale caro cuidado, que mi barrio 
Hay batos matones, canceros y malos, descansamos como paisas
Le cantan corridos a batos difuntos
Crimen aunque son mito raro
Disparo techado llamado cholos fortifícanos puro pedo

Por callejón del sapo con mis familiares

Que te esta pidiendo yate y un anillo de diamantes

El brillo de la luna es igual al de tus ojos

Las futuras biblias narraran mis historias
Asombrosas victorias quedan en mi historial
Soy como david derribando a goliath
Muy lejos te encuentras de mi nivel de combate
Avanzadas torturas mentales cargo en todos mis ataques
Si intentar enfrentarme es demasiado arriesgado
Todo pasa en plomo soy como un campo minado
Microssand detonando ante la fuerza de mi estrategia
Haciendo temblar imperios tan solo con mi presencia
Siempre listo y agresivo para la guerra
Talando versos con el poder de mi sierra
Me escurre el flow como a un gordo el sudor
En un baño de vapor no hay nada mejor
Mi palabra es continua soy la espina qu te lastima
Soy la crema y nata en la real academia de la rima

Sopresa mira demente domina tu cabeza
En multitudes siempre resalta mi presencia
Como el sol alumbrando este planeta
Asi me encuentro yo incrementando mi destreza
Formando torbellinos terremotos en tu conciencia

Somos somos algo mas que los demas
No intentes pararme que conmigo no podras
Soy mas potente que una bomba nuclear
Si se trata de rimas en la cocina me encontraras
Alianza de titanes que nadie podra vencer
Y la academia de la rima es la que te hara descender

Ejecutorias asi son mis oratorias
Quedan plasmadas en los libros de historia
Dejando a todos en paranoia
Liricas mas duras que los golpes de oscar de la Hoya
Escribiendo epopeyas en las enciclopedias
Dejando caer mis versos como un rayo de centellas
Encubando a los Mc's para que puedan madurar
Haber si con el cabus se pudieran enfrentar
Ejecutar es derribar es como ir de caza a Jurasic Park
Cuatro elementos tatuados en mis entrañas
Trepo paredes salto montañas
Soy mas asombroso que el mismisimo hombre araña

De pose a pose de verso a verso
Disfruta las palabras que te sueltan estos labios perversos
Capitan lujuria! creando eroticos textos
Orgasmos perfectos cuerpos contentos
En el juego de la seduccion a mi lado eres lento
Tirar buenas rimas es mi unico defecto
Soy el maestro de tu entrenamiento
Eres mi entretenimiento

En tu cara pues no tenia eleccion
No encuentro competicion
Y si quieres la revancha seria de nuevo tu perdicion

Gigante colosal como el everest asi soy soy
Dime como chingados el puto ojo te quedo
Parte fundamental en la grandiosa academia
No me causan gracia liricas que otros mcs blasfeman
Letras finas para gente conocedora
Dadius posee lo que muchos raperos añoran
Maravilloso flow partiendo artefactos en dos
No sabes que fue lo que del gran cielo cayo
Puedo darle diez vueltas al mundo en menos de ochenta dias
En el desierto del sahara si quiero saco liricas frias
Congelando tu porqueria en el oasis de mis rimas

Cartel de Santa,"El arte del engaño resulto ser tu mejor don
Y no digas que no, lo conoces a la perfección
Conocí que es el perdón en nombre de un tal amor
Pero la traición fue la flecha que atravesó mi corazon
Hay dolor, hay rencor y sentimientos encontrados
Hay deseos de morir por no tenerte a mi lado
Pero ya no importa nada, el pasado quedo atrás
Y así como llegaste ahora mismo te me vas
Jamas te di la espalda y eso no puedes negarlo
Jamas te traicione y nunca quise hacerté daño 
Pasaran los años y seguirás en mi memoria
Pues tu haz sido la única en llevarme hasta la gloria

Todo se derrumbo dentro de mi, dentro de mi
De humo fue tu amor y de papel, y de papel
Mira mis sueños como se queman 
Mira mis lagrimas como no cesan por ti

Y ya te habías tratado en inyectarme tu veneno
He caído de tu cielo y no he chocado con el suelo
Pero solo quiero y pido, seguir estando vivo
Para verte darte cuenta del error que has cometido
Cuanto tuve entre mis manos, te lo di sin interés
Pero nunca fue suficiente por mas que lo intente
Demostré que era primero el sentimiento, no el dinero
Y si algo nos llevamos, ha de ser lo mas sincero
Se que no fui bueno demostrando sentimientos
Pero siempre he sido rudo, frio, duro como el hielo
Me hundiste en el infierno y la verdad no me arrepiento 
Por que se bien que te ame hasta el ultimo momento

No cruces la valla, me sobran agallas

Nadie me seguirá, todo saldrá bien, no tengo preocupaciones

La mujer pero ella lo esquivo, va el segundo intento dejame 
Ver si puede, ya lo hizo pero le dio un golpe a tu vochito

Vengo soltando lo que tengo al chile tan macuarro
Que se que los entretengo
Y todo por el sueño de llegar hasta la cima
Sin dejar de ser el Pomel que conociste en la esquina
Mi sangre es malandra y esta llena de maldad
Si te metes con mi gente yo invado tu propiedad
Cuál será mi razón para rapearles y tirarles tanta rima
Tal ves es por el desmadre que les armo en la tarima

Y sobre la hoja mi pluma volo
Pa contarles que paso
Y porque estuve encerrado
El estado dijo homicidio calificado
Vamos nunca he dicho que soy un angel
Yo soy el perro guardian de mi barrio de mi chante
De mi gente de mi clika y de todo el que me apoya
Ulises era compa y también buena persona
Recuerdo aquella tarde que llegaste a visitarme nomas para avisarme
Que el traidor de Miguel Chavez estaba planeado matarme
Que me pusiera al tiro porque el vato carga cuete
De lo unico que hablaba era de que me iba a dar muerte
Te agradeci el informe y me despedi de ti
Te dije caele al rato para hecharnos una weed
Porque ahorita toy jalando arreglandome unos beats
Me dijiste ya se hizo al ratote te wacho aqui

Como son las cosas de la vida
Te llevo presente mi memoria no te olvida
Siempre fuiste mi compi desde que llegaste al barrio
Y toda la flota sabe que nos juntabamos diario
Como son las cosas de la vida
Te llevo presente mi memoria no te olvida
Siempre fuiste mi compi desde que llegaste al barrio
Y toda la flota sabe que nos juntabamos diario

Me quede en el estudio un rato trabajando
Mery dee subió para ver si queria cenar algo
Le dije ahorita bajo deja apago el equipo vete con cuidadito
Que Miguel anda muy loco y esta tirando mucho pico
Eso dice el Ulises y al chile se lo creo
Ya varios de mis perros me dijeron de ese pedo
Y como en Babilonia la escalera esta por fuera
Cuando oigo que Mery grita pues que salgo a la carrera
Voltie pa todos lados buscando a mi mujer
Pero dos trocas parquiadas no me dejaban ver
Como ya estaba advertido pues ya traía mi escuadra
Que salgo hacerle frente parado en medio de la cuadra
Y ahí estaba Miguel con una mano en la espalda
Me dijo hasta aquí llegaste te voy a chingar por cabra
No lo pensé dos veces saque el cuete luego luego
Pero pa bajarle el pedo por eso tire pal suelo

Como son las cosas de la vida
Te llevo presente mi memoria no te olvida
Siempre fuiste mi compi desde que llegaste al barrio
Y toda la flota sabe que nos juntabamos diario
Como son las cosas de la vida
Te llevo presente mi memoria no te olvida
Siempre fuiste mi compi desde que llegaste al barrio
Y toda la flota sabe que nos juntabamos diario

Miguel Chavez se siente como si fuera un Dios
Dicen que hasta se burla de lo que paso
Sale haciéndose la victima en la television
Pero todo el mundo sabe que el vato es un hocicon
Y a mi compa Ulises que llego a tirar mezquina
Una bala de rebote le arrebato al vida
Tu sabes carnalito contigo ni era la bronca
Tu siempre has sido compa siempre fuiste de la flota
Eso lo sabe todo el mundo en Santa Catarina
Como saben que Miguel ya tenia la mente podrida
Que esperas de una lacra que encañona hasta a su jefa
Golpea a su carnala y hasta sin casa las deja
Yo estuve tras las rejas casi me empino la vida
Pero tu te hechaste encima a todos los de mi jauria

Trae más que coraje
Ya me trepe en el viaje

Ni como me bajé, ni como me raje
Ya estoy en la jungla y no traje camuflaje
Pero pa' delante que la vida es un instante
Aprendo de maleantes cosas interesantes

Extraño mi chante y a todos allá afuera
Aventarme una loquera con toda mi bandera
Fieras aquí salen domadas
O más alteradas pesadas y conectadas

De bajada es fácil porque hasta agarras vuelo
Pero yo pa' arriba porque nací sin frenos
Todavía ay veneno y no creo que se termine

Duro para arriba zumbando en las esquinas
Para el big men y raza de juaritos
Para el Cesar y su carnalito
Pa los de tijuas y todo bajo califas

Somos de los mismos 
Vamos pa lo mismo 
Pero ahora son un chingo

Sencillamente el bueno del hip hop mexicano 
Por mucho que les duela van a tener que aceptarlo 
Estoy descontrolando

No traje bamboleo pero te lo meneo veo

Aquí tengo el sordo te invito a darle mate 
Acostarnos al zacate para que me mates 
Mata matadora que se nos van la horas 
Rólame el gallito que la ganya anda mora 
Vamos pa' la aurora hay que seguir la fiesta 
Que nos amanezca es mi última propuesta

Cartel de Santa,"Y esto es pa' que wachen los muchachos
Desde mi Mexico hasta el Gabacho

Hace tiempo que esperaba este momento
Y no ha sido por lento ni falta de talento
Al fin el hombre grande de Juárez
Bajó de entre los cerros
Se puso bien contento

Salió bien rayado y conoció nuevos perros
Pura gente fina, basados en muchos huevos
Recibido con calor de familia
El ejército del norte
El general aquí en la corte
Y preparado pa' el exporte

A ver compadre pasa el fuego
Pa' prender aquí la fiesta sigue
Hasta el amanecer funky bless
Y de santa el cartel

Uniendo la huasteca, esperando el pastel
En la pista rabiosa bailan ritmos para usted
Hidrofónicos cartel y santa si saben de placer

Yo ya lo sé, lo que quieres y buscas yo lo sé
Dale fuego compadre préndete
Con las nenas rozándotelo al 100
Que la fiesta esta puesta sírvase
Ándale pues
Trampe en viaje como es
Cartel de santa conectando con los de funky bless

Llego mi compi, santa se puso funky
Cumpleaños el monkey, vamos por unas pompis
Tracas, hierbas, polvos, yonkis
Huamas, aguas, brownie, monchis
De fiesta con el Big Man, formando un gran clan
Tramando un buen plan, viajando sin van
Andamos todos arriba en el humo región 4 norte
Tirando las rimas sin corte
Que conste que es hecho de cora
Directo de la aurora
Y para Juárez como Nora
Pa' su raza chingona y pa todas sus mamitas
De parte del cartel de santa y de toda su clica
Mi rap no se limita suena por todas partes
Lo entrego a domicilio no más pa' alucinarte
Tu sabes que funciona y yo sé que te emociona
Cuando en el teibol bailan mis rolas las cachetonas

Yo ya lo sé, lo que quieres y buscas yo lo sé
Dale fuego compadre préndete
Con las nenas rozándotelo al 100
Que la fiesta esta puesta sírvase
Ándale pues
Trampe en viaje como es
Cartel de santa conectando con los de funky bless

Hey rolate el toque carnal pa' que juaritos pegue el grito
Cuando llegue a cantar
Por eso hay, como me gusta caray que no les tiembla
Y pala hierba siempre se dejan caer
Disfruto el hi como el bombai, puchaste el play
Ya viste que hay, where it today partiendo el cake
Recordatorio por el Friday
Planeando bien vamos al 100 nos para quién es el cartel
Con el Big Man súbete al tren
Que no queremos que puede ser

Yo ya lo sé, lo que quieres y buscas yo lo sé

Que onda
Que onda loco
No está contigo babo
Le he estado marcando
Pero no me a contestado
Seguro anda de cabrón

Jaja, nel, esta grabando una canción
Si agarramos fiestón pero ya andamos tranquilón
Saliendo de cabina yo le digo que te marque

Pues pa' luego es tarde, dime la neta
Que quiero más detalles

U sigues
No te paniques, ya sabes que nosotros
No ocultamos cuando andamos con mujeres

Es que nos enojamos, dale mi recado
Quiero que me marque y dejar todo arreglado

No hay pedo, ya sabes como es babo
Al rato se contenta

Bueno, luego hablamos

Y nos vemos en la fiesta

Ora' ya sta', ahí nos wachamos",Dale Fuego,2010
Cartel de Santa,"Escucha y aprende a ver si entiendes monigote
Wacha

Carnal desapendeja el seso que le voy a meter peso
Como en el comienzo
Liriqueo intenso pa que wachen que me acuerdo
Pura protelyrica pa nutrirte el cerebro
Muchos no están de acuerdo y yo sigo demostrando
Que seguimos gustando, vamos mejorando
Pa muchos carnalillos soy el chofer de sus vidas
Vidas que son vividas en el cotorreo de esquina
Muchos andan muy arriba y empezaron muy abajo
Y es donde se conectan mis rimas con tu relajo
Por eso yo no encajo con el que se queda abajo
Mi gente va pa arriba la neta son un cuajo
Andamos en el ajo por eso sabemos
Los que aprenden de la vida y los que aprenden en cuaderno
La verdad todos aprenden pa ganar dinero
Así que aunque distintos a veces nos parecemos

¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! Todo el público en corto grito
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! En los barrios también se escucho
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! El desmadre chido mamalón
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! El cartel de santa zumbando a millón

Loco yo soy subterráneo pregúntale al que quieras
Y no es mi culpa compa que sobresaliera
No me alucina el oro tampoco los diamantes
Lo mío es el puro sumi el pelican y el tales
Diferentes canales diferentes opiniones
A veces uso Nike y a veces uso Converse
Todos andamos sobrios del vivir del liriqueo
No es que yo sea comercial es que ustedes lo hacen feo
Apegados al boqueo cuantos no serán iguales
Muy pocos originales cuantos traen el mismo jale
Yo digo que chale que es mejor que entiendan
Que para vivir de esto lo mejor es que se vendan

¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! Todo el público en corto grito
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! En los barrios también se escucho
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! El desmadre chido mamalón
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! El cartel de santa zumbando a millón

Macho de mi mente desde el rancho
Mexicano de los chichos me arrestaron los gabachos
Ando sin premiso como quiera se hace el guiso
Y aunque me atizo macizo yo mantengo a mis chamacos
Roban mi trabajo los piratas son muy gachos
Quieren verme abajo como quiera no me rajo
Gracias a los fans que compran originales
Ustedes mis carnales son los que apoyan mi jale
El resto se la saben porque son pegajosas
Frases peligrosas como la rimorosa
Lirica apestosa a pura maleza
Puedo sonar a todo pero menos a fresa
Mi grito en la mesa aunque no suene prendido
El micrófono encendido conmigo no es aburrido
De todo entretenido y alegrando tus oídos
Elevando una plegaria por todos mis enemigos

¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! Todo el público en corto grito
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! En los barrios también se escucho
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! El desmadre chido mamalón
¡Oh, oh oh oh-oh! El cartel de santa zumbando a millón

Te inspira mi lirica creativa
Te tengo ganchao como al tecato la chiva
Esto va pa arriba en definitiva
Cannabis sativa improviso si se me olvida
Dos o tres jotos tiran pero de lejitos
Los que estaban en corto se quedaron calladitos
No me siento maldito me siento bendecido
Si nada les pido pa que se meten conmigo
Andan bien ardidos les duele el orgullo
Si se meten con los míos yo me meto con los suyos
Se tronaron el sorillo de tanto cagar pa dentro
Sigo sacando discos tengo al publico contento

Y me gusta que es lo peor, que rara sensación
Sin pánico ni nada pura felicidad, felicidad exajerada
Eres alivianada y es lo que a mí me gusta
Sabes aguantar bara, y casi nada te asusta
Lo que cualquiera busca pero pocos encuntran
Sabes que para mí tú eres una mujer perfecta
Te la tiro directa pa' que andar con rodeos
Eres parte de mí, como de una carcel los reos

Al ratón le gusta el queso, y a la ardilla la tortilla
Y yo sé lo que le gusta a todas las bailarinas
A unas le gusta el dinero y a otras le gusta la fiesta
Pero lo que más les gusta es sentarse en mi mesa

Así que vamos sigue bailando
Que a mí me gustan flojitas y cooperando
Ando bien pedo y como quiera puedo
Le doy hasta que lleno y lo que sobra me lo llevo
Enserio pal cementerio pisteado mamado casi sonriendo
Por eso es que hoy celebro solo haber despertado
Ya nada más por eso voy de gane bien cuajado

Al ratón le gusta el queso, y a la ardilla la tortilla
Y yo sé lo que le gusta a todas las bailarinas
A unas le gusta el dinero y a otras les gusta la fiesta
Pero lo que más les gusta es sentarse en mi mesa

Flow perrón y todavía falta mas acción
Largo y tendido le damos por aquí al pachangón
Y qué mejor que invitar buenos amigos
Que se calen sobre el beat y se discutan chido
Sean todos bienvenidos y siéntanse en casa
Tomen todo lo que quieran y escojan una muchacha
Ando bien caliente voy al privado a matar
Ahí dejo que los presente mi carnalito el big man

Aquí solo va a estar lo mejor que de la mata
Ya estuvo de los juegos es tiempo de la plata
El jefe ya escogió y a ustedes les toco
Cabrones espero no desperdicien esa acción
Adelante señores a hacer lo que nos gusta
La fiesta ya esta puesta ustedes saben si resulta
Esto es lo que les gusta no es pa los que se asustan
Enseñen lo que traen y luego vemos las preguntas

Represento al bando de este lado
El mero guadalupe bien plazeado
Con los warriors de mi barrio
De rolling stone agarrando el fiestón
El que se deja cayetano con su flow
El Master llega pa' sacar la casta
Aunque a veces grifo y aunque a veces pasta
Haciendo el business en este pachangon
Listo pa' hacer la F con la casa babilón
Los envidiosos wachan y se quedan cabra
Que sepan que no es cuento que la CBR manda
Que no cualquiera con el cartel se rifa
Aquí nadie se mete aquí pura banda maciza
El W de la corona con la clica
Tomando un buchanón un tabacón y unas morritas
Vine a la cita porque se lo que traigo y
Quiero celebrarlo con un toque de la hydro

Ok vamos a hacer este jale
A ver como sale

Soy la oveja negra más negra de la pandilla
Brilla el cerro de la silla centauro de pancho villa
Fuma marihuana buena que cruza la aduana
Sinaloense, Michoacana Jamaiquina y Colombiana
A ver quien me hace jeta lo destrozo en la libreta
Lo dejo en la banqueta agujero con metralleta
Hago lo que quiero y lo que quiero es el dinero
Yo quiero dinero porque soy bien congalero
Yo soy él que mezcla business party y pandillero
Siempre verdadero sueno bien culero
A mis 24 con el diablo tengo un trato
La sangre de mis venas con ella firme el contrato
Que fluya que se distribuya que rompa tu radio
Las otras que se prostituyan yo soy millonario

Jotos siguen en el closet
Tengo varias quejas y reportes en el pozo
Los traigo bien pilas y pendientes a envidiosos
Mucho de lo mío no lo gozo y ladraron los perros
Sigue mamando como becerro aterro
Al wey que venga hacérmela de pedo enfierro
A los panochones pone dedos
Los tengo vigilados con mi gente desde el cerro
Llego la ja ya los planes no me fallan
Tengo mis tiradores y mis truco de pantalla
Llego el drop dealer hablaré claro soy el killer
Traigo a mis socio en la avenida controlando el business
Y es que yo tengo plan déjese caer por la avenida
Y es que estoy con mis carnales sin perderme la bebida
Muevo a mi gente clandestina de alguna forma fina
De un lado al otro controlando las esquinas

De nuevo las palabras que se meten por los barrios
Que cruzan las ciudades entre los diablos y santos
Resulta que mi tribu trabaja con Babilonia
Corriendo vibraciones embrujadas por colonias
Mi nombre es vida baja, escupo caras falsas
Ando tras la feria mi familia y mi casa
Camino por las palmas orillas de la city
León, perro y gato y un pinché oso grizzly
Es lo que tenemos dentro de la mente
Amistades con la Zetas ya lo sabe dios viviente
Te cuento es tres seis y mi barrio es san berna
Sientan esta vida y conocerán el planeta
Síguele buscándole amigo no te me agüites
Míralo todo claro trabajando sin los chismes
Unos tan fumando otros tan cantando
Tú síguele bien recio en tu vida de embrujado
(Embrujado)

Bueno como está este pedo 
Les tan quitando vuelo a todos los reggaetoneros
Y todo por mi maña de ser bien peleonero
Mientras se les acoplan tan jalándose los pelos
Agarren la onda la plaza esta cachonda
Manos a la obra juntos hasta la victoria
Hay que llegarle al toro por la cola y por los cuernos
Si alguno no la libra nos fugamos del infierno

(Así que aunque muchos se llenen la boca diciendo que no
Hay que admitir que todo sucede gracias a dios locos y y)",El Ratón y el Queso,2010

When through the kitchen door, up popped her father

Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!""

I had to marry of face ruin

Where are they hurled

Carter Sisters,"Oh I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtles so bright with the emerald dew
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

I will dance I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart in each crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idols were clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning no words of farewell

Oh he taught me to love him and call me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
How I long to see him and regret the dark hour

Times were hard and things were bad

But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud

Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine,"You win some and you lose some
And I've lost the will to lose
With my part time job and my faith in God
Falling on a bruise

And this no star bed and breakfast
And insolvency abuse, make me feel like throwing myself
Off the kitchen shelf
Falling on a bruise

And all of my unworldly goods, the bailiffs took them too
For all the ducked bills and silly sods
From Brian Mills's catalog
Something borrowed, bartered and blue

You win some and you lose some, you save nothing, nothing for a rainy day
You need your nutrasweet daddy or some peppermint paddy
Or just a hackneyed old cabbie
Who can drive you and your baby away

Two fives or a ten
Could get me back to you
And stop me
Falling on a bruise

It's not that I'm acrophobic
It's just that it's not safe to go out anymore
So I just stay indoors with my TV Times
My petty rimes and my nursery rhymes

Someone said, that the sound of a baby crying
Is the world and beauty in the eye of the beholder
But as my heart grows colder, and colder
I just feel so tired

The fridge is empty, the walls are damp, there's no hot water
And I look like a tramp and tramps like us
Baby we were born to walk
But where does a mother's girl go, when her mother's gone?

Some you win and some you lose

And if I had the chance to do it all again
I'd change everything

Across the shifty sands to the war
By the time I get to read them, she'll be rising
To a fifty, fifty chance and nothing more

Through the sleet and drizzle
You can hear the sounds of soldiers
The Kalashnikov and splutter
On a sunny day

From the east of middle
To the north and south of nowhere
People earn their bread and butter
In some funny ways

In the corridors of power
Where the talks are in full swing
If you can't say it with flowers
Then don't say anything

I want to see my children
Grow up into healthy human beings
I want to see them walking, running
Playing, laughing and singing

In the corridors of power
Where the talks are in full swing
If you can't say it with flowers
Then don't say anything

I'm just outside the home of Christmas, now
And I'm dying, all across the shifty sand there's blood and guts
By the time I get to Jesus, she'll still be crying

Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine,"The distant echo -
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps - repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrapers and this mornings paper
Mr. jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow - they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And Im down in the tube station at midnight

I fumble for change - and pull out the queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows - gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
Hey boy they shout - have you got any money? 
And I said - Ive a little money and a take away curry,
Im on my way home to my wife.
Shell be lining up the cutlery,
You know shes expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork
And Im down in the tube station at midnight

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses
Couldnt see, hear, speak any longer
And Im down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw
As I lay there on the floor
Was jesus saves painted by an atheist nutter
And a british rail poster read have an awayday - a cheap holiday -
Do it today!
I glanced back on my life
And thought about my wife
cause they took the keys - and she'll think its me
And Im down in the tube station at midnight

In town and country locals he's Mr. Antisocial

He's a coldblooded vulture he won't respect your culture
He's nothing like your good self he's come to burn your bookshelf
He'll gobble up your children destroy what you've been building

One day the Devil was in high good humor for he had created a mirror
Which made everything good and beautiful reflected in it shrink to almost
Nothing, and everything bad and ugly stand out more clearly than ever.

All the little imps who went to the Devil's school ran around with the
Mirror until there was nowhere and no one that had not been distorted in it. 
The Devil was much amused, and the mirror itself grinned wickedly.

Then the little imps decided to fly up to heaven and make fun of God and
His angles. The higher they carried the mirror, the more it grinned, until
It was shaking so hard with laughter that it slipped out of their hands
And fell to earth, where it broke into millions of pieces.

And then it caused even more trouble than before, because all the tiny
Splinters, scarcely the size of a grain of sand, went flying around the
World, and whenever a splinter flew into anyone's eye, it had the same
Power as the whole mirror, and made people see everything distorted.

Sometimes a splinter of glass even entered someone's heart, which was
Worst of all, for then that person's heart was turned to ice.

And by his royal appointment there'll be no more enjoyment
There will be no more bandera no more service will be rendered

For gentlemen and ladies
The little biddy babies
And the household pet

The punches and the Judys
The crunches and the bruises
The Humpty Dumpty boozers
Who are trying to forget?

The future that we're building
Something to be skilled in
How to teach the children
And to teach them well

From domestic science
To domestic violence
The right to remain silent
In your prison cell

You can dial M for Mother
Your sister and your brother
Or anybody other
If you really want

But it's the terrorist and traitor
That lights the blue touch paper
The fuse and detonator
Of the worry bomb

The worry bomb has gotcha
Your brain's about to rupture
And there's no wood to touch here
And you need some quick

The furniture's Formica
The doors are all glass fiber
You touch the floor beside you
And it's made of brick

The worry curse is on you
With paranoid insomnia
Twenty golden slumbers
Wouldn't get you forty winks

Alcohol enhanced it
And smoking's not the answer
Heart disease and cancer
Are the worry bomb kings
Worry bomb

Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine,"I'd like to teach the world to sing
And put an end to suffering if I could
With the dedicated heart and soul
Of Britain's greatest rock 'n' roll Robin Hood

But your eyes are dim you cannot see
Your middle name is misery
And you'd like to teach the world to sing
You're gonna get your head kicked in

Don't lose your temper
In the shopping center, son
Just remember
The young offender's mum

All God's children snatch a handbag
Spot the ball and match the grand dad
To the pictures on the news
Count the stitches on the bruise

Lock your sons up with your daughters
Stay at home, don't drink the water
Intercept all interference
And blame the parents

But don't lose your temper
In the shopping center, son
Just remember
The young offender's mum

Down the front of the church
For the second time in life love hurts
This time there's no buttons and bows
She's wearing non fast colored clothes

The service seems to last for hours
No one wants to catch the flowers
On the shoulder of an older brother
The young offender's mother

Don't lose your temper
In the shopping center, son
Just remember
The young offender's mum

What music will they play
At the end of every day

'I'm A Yankee Doodle Dandy'
Or 'The Lady In Red'
Before we go to bed

On the pillow of self pity
Feeling sorry for ourselves
Because we've got nobody else

We must have broke so many mirrors
Or licked our knives
In previous and better lives

On the useless and dead end

And get permission first before you use the phone

And don't get caught with your trousers down
If you're under eighteen on the underground
When the boy of your dreams in the cut down jeans comes 'round

And fifty-two lovely black eyes

Knocks you about with its fists

And I should be in prison

Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine,"I walked from my baby's Brixton flat
Into a riot
I thought of maybe turning back
Till things were quiet

When all the buildings to be burned
Had been burned
And all the cars to overturn
Were overturned

Outside the prison they were screen testing the free
Open auditions for closed circuit T.V
Your baby brother would be there outside the jail

Throwing bottles as the police sirens wailed
And a love song might not be suitable
But you look beautiful tonight

Death and disaster only make me love you more
The morning after the night that went before
When the brains of Brixton with conflicting points of views
Are outside The Ritz on the local TV news

A love song might not be suitable
But you look beautiful tonight
And if you feel the same way as I feel
Everything will be alright

I was thinking
Let's forget about the car
And do some late night drinking
In a late night drinking bar

It isn't far, well, it's my local anyway
I know the barman
And there's a small vocal P.A

Now the insurance man has left you with the news
That your third party fire and theft would be no use
And I know a love song isn't suitable or right
But you look beautiful, beautiful tonight

And if you feel the same was as I feel
Everything will be alright

Tonight, big brother is watching you
And I am watching too
I will watch over you
Like a thunderbolt out of the blue

Something told me it was true

And God created Brixton too

Tonight you can rest assured
The Father, Son, the Holy Ghost and I
Will love you more than most tonight

And now I only see you, in a memory or two

When we ran like wild horses through the night
Sticking to the back roads and staying out of sight
Making the most of what little time we had left
How sweet it is, how sweet it was,
Making the most of what little time we had left
How sweet it is, how sweet it was, young love
Young Love
Wild horses
Oh you'd better fly
How sweet, how sweet it was",Young Love,2008
Carter's Chord,"Don't wanna go through the motions
Just because its easy
Won't you give me that 'ol look
Like you used to when you'd see me
Let's get back to livin' life
A little less comfortable

When we didn't have a nickel
Not a nickel to our names
Yea we were rollin' pennies
We were happy or insane
Our love would burn burn burn
A little less comfortable

Back when you would wake me up
In the middle of the night
Kiss me like your lover
Instead of just your wife
Unpredictable, oh and wonderful
A little less comfortable
A little less comfortable

Didn't think about tomorrow
Cause we didn't have a plan
But boy you took my breath
Every time you took my hand
We were young and scared and happy
A little less comfortable

Back when you would wake me up
In the middle of the night
Kiss me like your lover
Instead of just your wife
Unpredictable, it was wonderful
A little less comfortable

Carter's Chord,"The other day I started watching
A story 'bout starving children
As I drank my four dollar coffee

Kinda felt a little guilty
Looking at the faces on the TV
Made me think about how blessed I am

So I decided that I, I
I'm gonna sing a little louder
Gonna pray a little harder
Gonna run a little faster
Let them know, I'll never want another

Gonna tell my mom I miss her
Gonna learn to never say never
And love, love, love a little bigger

So what is it we really live for
After all we have, we still want more
I think we all could use a wake up call

Single mothers, out of work fathers
Families losing their homes everyday
People's hope in God fading away

So I decided that I, I
I'm gonna sing a little louder
Gonna pray a little harder
Gonna run a little faster
Let them know, I'll never want another

Gonna tell my mom I miss her
Gonna learn to never say never
And love, love, love a little bigger
Love a little bigger

Not gonna judge my sisters
'Cause in His eyes we're all sinners
Gonna write my friend a letter
Learn to keep in touch a little better

Gonna fill my days with laughter
Hold on a little longer
And love, love, love a little bigger
Love, love, love a little bigger
Love a little bigger",Love a Little Bigger,2011
"Carter, Cantrell & Nightwing","So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again would only do me good
Oh how I wish I could but you're so far away

One more song about moving along the highway
I can't say much of anything that's new
But if I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't  help to know you're so far away
So far away, yeah, you're so far away

Nothing else to do but close my mind
And I sure hope the road don't get to own me

Carver Blanchard,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Carwyn Ellis,"There's something intriguing about you, that's for sure
Seems like you walked right out of my past
Oh, you swore we never met before?
And I know the reasons why you're shy
Of these feelings that we can't deny

But it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

Some kind of magic about you, I can't explain
And now you put your spell on me
And I know I'll never be the same
And I'm wondering is it self deceit
'Cause without you I feel incomplete

But it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

And I can still see you when I asked if you would stay
Well you looked right through me when you turned and walked away
But intuitively I knew that someday I'd make you mine
And even though our pasts were a skew, I knew they'd cross in time

And it's not forbidden, why keep it hidden
I know your love is tender and warm
Caught in your head lights shimmering bright
'Cause you got it on and I've got it bad

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break!

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine.

Cary Grant,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top!

You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine.

Might think that your song is bad,

I am vivid and magical; I'm careless and practical
I've got music in my soul
I can be spectacular, I am straight laced and angular
You'd be surprised to know just what I know

I like to just sing my cares away, but I can't seem to stay away
From the joy and the gloom of her
It's all the same to me, my hair brained philosophy
Absence makes the heart go under

Running always comes easy to me

Till I found you, I walk a little lighter now
And I've got you, to smile a little brighter now
This is all new, I feel a little younger now

It fell on me and now I'm drowning

With a busted windshield and rusted out doors

But she's getting stronger the longer she's alone

Caryl Mack Parker,"I can't sleep with all these things around me
Its just the past that's getting in the way
If I could sell these memories in the paper
I'd place an ad tomorrow and it would say

One double bed
Almost new
One chest of drawers
Barely used 
One jewelry box
One golden band
One broken promise and 
One night stand

I thought that all my lonely nights were over
I thought that I would spend my life with you
I thought that we were supposed to last forever
What a shame it all just came down to

Faded pink
One phone number
In purple ink
One pocket with
One golden band
One broken promise and

Full of empty things

I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?

Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Sí no vas a bailar
No me vengas a nebular
Y hablé claro sí es que va amarrar
Que quiero bailar contigo, bacilar contigo
Dale ma' vámonos a fueguillo

Nena no me pongas esa cara
No te queda el flow de mala
Déjate llevar por las ganas
Pórtate bien, no te pongas malcriada
O te voy a tener que dar par de nalgadas

Llego tu mansa guapo, tu león palgo, zato
Que se come hasta los platos
Así que túmbame ese guille potrona mamita
Llegó el que te estruja
Vámonos a bacilar con tu selvita un rato

Y tú decides mai te mato, te mato
Después no me acuses de maltrato
Da una vuelta mami hazme un garabato
Se me está subiendo el arrebato

Sí tú no vas hacer na'
No te me pongas potrona mamá
Sí tú no vas hacer na'

Sí no vas a bailar
No te me pongas potrona
Que a ti no te queda ese papel de nena
No, me vengas con que no haces na'
Tú eres grande ya

Sí no vas a bailar
No te me pongas potrona
Que a ti no te queda ese papel de nena
No, me vengas con que no haces na'
Tú eres grande ya

Siento que perdí la mitad de mi corazón

Siento que perdí la mitad de mi corazón
Que ti valla bien hasta siempre mi amor

Van varios meses que no se de ti mujer
Desde que te fuiste mi vida cambió
Ya no hay placer hoy desahogo
Este intenso dolor

Que no deja que yo siga sin pensar en tu traición
Que destrozo mi corazón y sin ningún perdón
Se entrego en otro brazos sin haber razón
No supo valorar todo lo que por ella sude
Me quiso engañar acompañada del interés, oh

Y como yo no hay nadie eso tú lo sabes
Me perdiste te embalaste
Ahora no me llames y como yo no hay nadie
No hay nada que repare mi dolor
Y ahora dime tú

Y que paso ya dime por favor que paso

Que t valla bien hasta siempre mi amor

Y que paso yal dime por favor que paso

Siento que perdí la mitad de mi corazón
Que te vaya bien hasta siempre mi amor

Mis sentimientos se van hundiendo
En un mar de llanto y sufrimiento
Cuando me despierto y a mi lado no te siento
Te soy honesto me estoy muriendo

Y no hay vuelta atrás todo llegó al final
Fueron muchas tus mentiras y no aguanto más
Y aunque tenga que aguantar
No te voy a confesar que por ti no vuelvo a llorar

Y como yo no hay nadie
Eso tú lo sabes me perdiste
Te embalaste ahora no me llames

Y que paso ma' dime que yo no entiendo
Ma' que paso que ti perdiste y te fuiste d mi vida
My love me abandonaste
Y te me escapaste como el viento

Ya me olvidaste y ya olvidaste lo que siento
Y aunque mi vida no es la misma
Desde el día aquel querida
Aunque vacías mis pasiones

Eh, siempre hay salida
Aunque siga el lloriqueo por ti
Paca no miras
Así que baby, lo mejor para mi
Es que lo sigas

Y como yo no hay nadie
Eso tú lo sabes me perdiste
Ti embalaste ahora no me llames

No hay nada que repare mi dolor

Hey! (Yo!)

Hemos hecho este género trabajando duro!
Sobrepasando situaciones!
Sobrepasando el sistema!
Así somos nosotros!

Definitivamente y sin duda!
Volviendo a marcar otro nivel en la música!
Este nivel solamente es alcanzado por aquellas súper-estrellas!
Lo único que, ahora, junto a Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Estas son ""Las Gárgolas: The Next Generation""!
Prra!

Alex 'Gárgolas'!
Ahí les dejo al mío!
Mario!
Comételos vivo!

Ya hace su entrada inesperada
El que menos pensaban (¡Mario, dale!)
Hoy dejo atrás todos mis modales
Pa' los que pensaron que yo no me podía ir calle
Pues confundieron mi humildad con no tener coraje
Se equivocaron de nuevo, les vo'a pasar el rolo
Pa' los que pensaron que en esto no podía solo
Alex, dame la verde y solo los desplomo
Al fin de cuenta, si vamo'a morir que sea a nuestro modo
Gárgolas, poniendo reglas desde antaño
Sé que en esta liga solo llevo un par de años
Que las estrellas de este género ya están jugando
Pero yo soy el sexto hombre que los mata saliendo del banco

Si saben que con nosotros no salen
(¡Say yeah!) Hago que mis gárgolas se preparen
Que 'tamos en guerra, listos, sin miedo a morir

Okay, llego el turno del Vale'
Precaución que ando con mis anormales
Un combo de artillería que a cazarte salen
Y que a plena luz del día revientan cristales
Zúmbale, Alex, si se pegan y dales
Sácale furia, no corre...
Y si acaso dudan de la cría de este flaco
Bajen pa'l barrio que no salen vivos de la 24

Como los pompeo, me voy hasta abajo si se forma un peo
Si frontean yo los sueno y aquí no hay duelo
Tú lo que hueles es a sepelio
Pague tu entierro porque mi vida en esto es primera
¿Quién dice que no te bajare de ese globo helio?
Aunque frontees tú no eres Grayskull
Cambio ese CD de Terminator
Que aquí nadie es intocable
Y to's somos iguales
Viviendo en una selva
Que los que viven no son tan anormales
Dando break, pero conmigo no te resbales
¿Okay? (¡Conmigo no te resbales!) ¿Okay?

Llego la maquina de guerra, el truck Mackal
Yo no vo'a atacar si tu combo saca'l* (¿?)
De la jaula el chacal que 'ta loco por machacar
Quieren inventar y te vamo'a maltratar* (¿?)
Yo no 'toy fácil, considérame difícil
Yo controlo el zodiaco desde Aries a Piscis
Tranquilito, papo, que usted mea como missy
Y el gorila tiene letra pa' dejarte en crisis
Considérate un ""cover"" pa'l pecho
Que tengo escobas pa' barrer
A los que se fueron por techo
Se me hizo largo, estrecho
Pero de hierro estoy hecho
Y este artista de WyY tiene derecho

Y mira ahora quien llegó, la gárgola de ""Agresivo""
Rompiendo y partiéndolos, educándolos con mi flow
Son las mujeres las que hacen que yo salga de noche
(¡Tuti!) (¡Blam, blam!) WD-40 pa'l Lacoste
Suelto suelto y sigo envuelto
Y viendo como paralizo tu momento
Heyyyy, yo siendo la voz del momento
La única gárgola que el sol no convierte en cemento

No dejes que se te hunda el barco y cómprate un parco
Te aplasto, chequea en tarima cómo es que parto
Le caí de asalto, el bacalao reparto
Tú pediste tres tazas y saliste harto
(¡Ah!) Ya resolvimos marroneándola
No busques más, somos las gárgolas
La quinta parte fundiéndola
La compe', tu combo de la envidia se rompe
Porque ahora estamos encendidos, ¿y tú a donde?

Ese negro es gárgola, es el negro
No hablen mucho, saben 'e donde vengo
Tengo mi propio flow, no me vendo
Si no sirve es que es sendo cerdo
No amenaces, nunca tiemblo
Mala mía si te ofendo
Yo no ofrezco si no tengo
Tú quieres que encienda
Prendo prendo (¡Ma'!)

Esto es pa' las gárgolas, sin miedo
Entra Cosculluela y to' el mundo se cae al suelo
Pa' tirarte contra mi 'tas bien loco
Hay muchos que suenan como tú
Pero como yo suenan pocos o ninguno
Salgo gigantesco y oportuno...
Consumo el humo mientras cargo el peine de la sumo
Gilipolla, prende bien atrás que 'ta la hoya
Que quien no atiende la cocina el kiosko se la arrollan
A mi me encanta saber que tengo lo mío plancha'o
Y si me muero mañana te juro que me fui gasta'o
Cuñao, brega en el norte que yo sigo las señales
Suenen los timbales, jale, bajen los metales
Disque 'toy en guerra, ¿con quien?, nunca se sabe
Cuando sientas la presión, men, esa es la clave
Sigo firme, me paro en la mía y que van a decirme

Casa Loma Orchestra,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,
Casa Loma Orchestra,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue

Before I'd part from you, my dear

If I'd a cow that gave such milk
I'd dress her in the finest silk
Feed her up on oats and hay
And milk her twenty times a day

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk
She jumped the fence and strained her milk

And when I die don't bury me at all
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep

The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop
We'd better take another drop",Little Brown Jug,1990

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1990

Good morning

With no vivid reason here to find

You don't know, never know

Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

She said she'd never love again
Because he broke her heart
And now she's blaming him
But he told her from the start
That what they had was special
But it ain't really love
Although he gave her everything
She never had his heart
But that's all that she needs
So what's tearing her apart?
'Cause loving him is hard
But that's all she really wants
She treats him like a king
And he treats her like a queen
But when he don't come home
He don't tell her where he's been
But she already knows
He got lipstick in his clothes
It's the message in his phone
And the smell of his cologne
But she don't say a tone or even moan
She don't stress, fight or fuss
She just keeps it to her own

When she cries, she dries her eyes
She never lied in her life
So his lies sound like knives every night
In the morning she's all right
'Cause she don't wanna fight
But tonight she'll be gone forever

Love is a refugee

When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey

He said he'd never love again
'Cause he don't want the pain
Of having someone special
Do that shit to him again
And though it ain't his fault
There ain't no-one else to blame
For all those sunny days
When all you see is rain
All you got are memories
But that just ain't the same

'Cause the woman that he loved
Must have simply gone away
And everyday he wakes up
Feeling like he's up in chains
And now her sweetest touch
Is like a shot to his brain
And this is just a shame
'Cause she don't say a thing
Except to break his heart
Like she's in a wicked game
That he ain't trying to play
But he's stuck trying to win
'Cause he's stuck loving someone
Who just ain't in love with him

But he's in love with her
And this is where it hurts
No but she don't give a damn
Or even know his worth
She treats him like he's dirt
That she can throw away
But he ain't going away
'Cause today's gonna be the day

Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

So forgive me but I'm gone now
'Cause I'm free and I'm never coming home now
I'll find hope in forever
'Cause I'm thrown now
And I'm flying and I ain't gonna go down
I used to think we were magic but slow down
You didn't know what you had when you had it
And now you realise that it's gone like magic
And I guess you really want me back, right?
Well, forget it

With blood comin' out his head like sweat, knowin' I could be next
So, what about all the babies that ain't fully born
That's less fortunate, like that man walkin' with one arm

They tried to throw me up in a orphanage, with all the kids
But I stayed up in the offices 'cause they couldn't get me, off a kid
It's sad when a good mother put hard work
Like wash clothes, off the shit we played on and got hurt

Why she gotta pay for the dirt
'Cause her only son is up the street with the whole block sour
'Cause you know bodies lay for 'bout for eight hours
Want to talk about our chrome whips

There's niggas out there don't own shit
While we sit at home and bone a bitch while niggas is homeless
See niggas get piped over dice, wiped out, over 4 digit price
Damn near broke my heart, made me so sick, I had to go shit

Found her up the steps a bloody mess, hopeless
It wasn't cops 'cause only street niggas empty the whole clip

Yo bullets don't have no name
Or maybe y'all niggas should get better aim
And stop puttin' these innocent people in pain
It's a damn shame that life ain't, nothin' but a game

And we all at the 4th quarter, 'cause our time is shorter and shorter
'Cause y'all got time to tap our phones and hear the orders
And stop the coke from comin' across the waters
But y'all can't stop the slaughters

Or the people from starvin'
The guns is not standin' still, they still revolvin'
Uptight and still mobbin'
Blacks still sling cracks and know I know why they call it

Fishscale, from Colombia to New York on a boat the shit sells
Tell a weak whore, and when I score
I'm a open up my door and give to the poor
Til they tell me they don't even want no more

Y'all keep raisin the rent, then tell us how to raise our kids
And categorize us on, where we live like by on Broadway
It's all Dominicans and blacks that's packed in projects serious
And why Y'all call it a project, are we an experiment?

Yo, I wasn't tryin to be a slave
Or encaged up with braids
I was saved by a guy with a older age with grades
Told me the other ways to get paid, than lettin my gun wave

We know you brave, get yo' shit tight and here's a pen
It's much lighter, like click click, that's a gun sound
Blau! That's a round now hit the ground
That's what Drag learns 'cause his pop's back was turned

Now call the cops, what about that gat that just got pungin'
Or that kid that got it 41 times, you call that justice?
If it is, then what the fuck is this
Somethin' I must have just missed

Maybe Christmas and get a nut off, we get our hot water cut off
Off my Timbs I wipe the mud off, 'cause I put the stomp in it
Pretty rivers, and lakes and ponds, Drag was in a swamp in Bronx
Well death is where I could of gone

'Cause where I'm from the bullets long
Y'all see the news, but why my block gang got no footage on
'Cause my life is like a movie, when you die, ain't no comin' back shit

Make you smack hit it from the back 
While I'm creeping in the hood blowing on dubs sac

No matter the color or size, I can't hate

I even think I'm country for fat monkeys like Beyoncé
Wet lips and as ghetto as Vivica 
Nasty long tongue known for licking ya

Yes it's only you
And I say I do, I do, I do

Face to face
I knew from the day we met
That you were the one God sent
That you had my heart
Although you fought hard
You had to give in

I've messed up enough in life (life)
To know when something feels this right
I've got to hold on
Keep both of us strong
Let nobody leave

Now my heart had been your trusted hand
(I realize your love)
I was there to give you what you need, for you
(I have given love)
Now there's all these things I need to say, that
(happen in my heart)
Because you've been right here
That's because I care
And now we can never get enough

[Chorus: ]

Face to face
You're what I was waiting for
Everyday I prayed for
And now I love, I love you
Took some time for me to see
And now you're the best part of me
And I'm grateful, so grateful
That we've found love (Yes it's only you)
(And I say I do)
And I always here for you
No matter what (And I say I do)

Face to face
Baby you're the only girl for me, baby
And you're the only boy for me
Nobody else but you
Nobody else but you baby
You and me baby
You and me baby, baby, baby
I don't see nobody else but you baby
I don't see nobody else but you baby

Sing this song again

Case and Davidson,"I was born by the railroad tracks 
Well the train whistle wailed and I wailed right back 
Well papa left mama when I was quite young 
He said now ""One of these days you're gonna follow me son"" 
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I ain't ever satisfied 
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
I ain't ever satisfied 
Now I had me a woman she was my world 
But I ran off with my back street girl 
Now my back street woman could not be true 
She left me standin' on the boulevard thinkin' bout you 
I got an empty feeling deep inside 
I'm going over to the other side 
Last night I dreamed I made it to the promise land 
I was standin' at the gate and I had the key in my hand

I said ""No thanks Pete, I'll just be moving along""",I Ain't Ever Satisfied,2006
Case and Davidson,"Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh! The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh, my but that little country boy can play

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

His mama told him, some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight

Hear a way we die.
You can make the mountains ring,
Hear the angels cry.
Tho' the dove is on the wing
You need not know why.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Some will come and some will go,
We shall surely pass.
When the wind that left us here,
Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Hey, people now,
Smile on your brother.
Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Case and Davidson,"Daddy came around every once in a while
But momma, she was there all the time
And summertime in Compton was not like TV
But we were right there where we needed to be

And the Thurmond Boys on Peach Street with only their dad
So proud of themselves and that old Pontiac they had
And Miss Brooks, her Bible and her three little boys
At the Double Rock Baptist Church makin' a joyful noise

There's more than one way home
Ain't no right way, ain't no wrong
And whatever road you might be on
You find your own way 'cause there's more than one way home

Got me a job at the grocery store
Workin' weekdays after school from 5 to 9
And Tommy, John and Charlie were the neighborhood stars
With their midsize homes and their big fancy cars

And when the eagle flied on Friday I'd go out to play
Wastin' time with Otis out on the dock of the bay
And my ticket to adventure was a ride on the bus
Different places, different faces but they were just like us

Well, there's more than one way home
Ain't no right way, ain't no wrong
And whatever road you might be on
You find your own way 'cause there's more than one way home

Well, there's more than one way home

Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed.
I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it,
I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies.
I seen them trying to bring you down, but f**k that dog you one of the greatest!
Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters.

I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat.
I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street.
Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat.
I love it when these boys come from out of town and thinking Miamis sweet.
All of them down looking for pussy , trying to Miami skeet.
That's when they run up in they hotel room and give them a Miami treat.
When the choppers start a raining, its hard to stop a Miami leak.
That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach.

Ha, You know how this ain't a neighborhood right?
Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash

Casey,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Pining to be sweetly reclining

Casey,"Six years ago, I developed a shake in my hands
As they carried the weight of a love I was too young to understand
But had convinced myself I couldn't live without
Now the only reminders I have of a life I no longer miss are my terrible cursive
And problems holding my cutlery right when I sit at the table on family occasions

And I know my mother still worries from time to time
I guess after so long she's learning to realise 
More often than not when I'm silent it means that I'm already sorry
For not speaking up, for not using my voice
To talk about what I've been going through
And that's why I'm scared of you

Because even before I had chance to explain
You were tending to my wounds and soothing my aches
I never thought I'd feel comfort again
And I know what this is 'cause my hands have stopped shaking
I hesitate to call it by name
Just in case it gets taken away again
I know that it's love, but what if I'm not enough?

Because regardless of how soft the touch
I still bruise and I break when I think about how it must look to you
As I tremble and shake in the bed that we've only just started to make",Bruise,
Casey,"I'd watch the furniture dance slowly, as you dragged it around the room
Unaware of my attention, you were alone for all you knew
But in the moments when the analgesia would briefly fade
I could collocate the words your body spoke; you were always so afraid

Your hands would shake as you rearranged flowers by the bed
I heard visitors pass comments, I looked well, or so they said
And every morning, as the sunlight slowly filtered through the shades
You'd awake, disappointed by me sleeping through the day

And it pains me knowing that you were taking time out of your life
To make sure that I was still on the medication that made me stay when I didn't want to
And you always say you're not, but I know you're disappointed
When you visit and the doctor tells you that I've stopped talking again
It's just when I had no one, I had depression
It's the only constant in my life that I could depend on

Your hands would shake as you rearranged flowers by the bed
I heard visitors pass comments, I looked well, or so they said
And every morning, as the sunlight slowly filtered through the shades
You'd awake, disappointed by me sleeping through the day",Flowers By the Bed,
Casey,"Does it help if I say that I'm sorry?
I know the burning in my blood has made you worry a lot
Like the medicine they gave me that hurt me
If you leave when I'm sleeping, could you turn the lights off?
My eyes ache if I wake up bathing in fluorescence
It's hard to shake the phosphenes and iridescence
When intravenous makes me feel heavy
As frail as glass, and fading fast, I think that I'm ready to leave

So give me one good reason to believe I'm getting better
My weight keeps fluctuating and I struggle to remember
The last time I slept through the night without needing to shed my blood
I'm so sick of feeling alone

But I can't stop thinking about
Every time that you'd leave me alone in the house
And I'd lay in my bed, suffocating with doubt
Over whether I'd manage to function without
Having you there to make sure I take what they gave me
To kill off the pain that I'm going through daily
In every way that I am strong, I am also weak
For all the words my lungs have birthed
I struggle to speak
To you about anything
That makes me feel like a burden

Does it hurt you if I say I can feel the decay?
In a hospital bed I wither away
Behind the curtains I've been crying almost every night
I don't wanna ache like this for the rest of my life

So give me one good reason to believe I'm getting better
My weight keeps fluctuating and I struggle to remember
The last time I slept through a night without needing to shed my blood
I'm so sick of feeling alone",Fluorescents,
Casey,"Once again, my caution bends to soft amnesia as I forget that I've been here before
The melatonin fails again, and melancholy settles in
My mouth neglects the shape of words that I know you adored
And every night it hurts a little more

And I can't seem to satiate
The sadness that still resonates
Every bone in me will break
Beneath the weight of guilt that I can't place

If my happiness isn't permanent, then I am no more than a surrogate father
Lead to the alter to marry the mother despite all of my reservations
If the joy that I feel is so juvenile, how do I reconcile all the aggression that I seem to harbour?
The selfish depression that makes it so hard to feel loved?

Promise me you'll stay a while, I know I ask you all the time
Must be getting hard to pretend
And safe in the warmth of the sun I let myself undress
Revealing wounds that time neglects
Hesitant, I acquiesce to the softest embrace of your bed

Where shamefully I supplicate
For anything that seems to sooth my aches
Watch me as I dissipate
Dissolve into a solvent fear of change

Despondency bleeds into everything
Removing my hands from the wheel of the vehicle
I couldn't care at all
Sing me to sleep with my mellifluous misery
Drunk and delusional, numb at the funeral
Love was once sacrosanct, but now it resembles the sound of a language that I am scared to speak",The Funeral,
Casey,"You saw it all fall apart, you saw the person I was before and after the illness started pulling out my teeth, and draining the colour from my cheeks
And I can't blame you for leaving me here
But I wish that you'd told me how it upset my mother
Seeing her son's condition fading daily, it must have been so hard
She's been through hell with me so far
Between depression and colitis, I lost half of my weight
She'd find me bleeding in the bathroom, too exhausted to shake
I was embarrassed to speak up because a ""man"" should be able to care for himself
I shouldn't need medication to make it through the day",Making Weight,
Casey,"My fingers broke holding the rope that tied me to the past
I choked on every simple syllable I'd stitched into my teeth
Since the bones reset I guess I think about you less
Unless I'm drinking or upset, but honestly that doesn't happen frequently

I'm not even sure why I'm still calling you up
When I know that your phone's been disconnected for months
I guess it's hard to break a habit that reminds you of love
I just needed you to know that I don't miss you at all

And needlework would never hurt, I embellished all that I was worth
With words so passionately birthed by lovers losing hope

But in the end I hated all the metaphors we made
Every sickly sentiment that I had sewn into my skin
I'm learning to remove your every suture, every wound is proof
That even love is ruthless
But I survived no thanks to you

But in the end I hated all the metaphors we made

I'm learning to remove your every suture, every wound is proof
That even love is ruthless
But I survived no thanks to you",Needlework,
Casey,"I feel the veins that sit behind my eyes grow varicose 
As gentle light starts filtering through fractured blinds 
That shade the world from me
You'd always watch me as I'd wax and wane
Fluoxetine and slow decay
Dependence on a medicine is Hell without relief

I am bereft of the ineffable 
Affections I feel I am owed
My vacancy and apathy are all that I have left to show
For years I spent in isolation
For chemicals that took the place
Of fleeting moments in which I found reprieve from misery

And it seems the only solace I'm afforded is now 
Instead of wanting to kill myself, I just sleep
I guess progress really isn't want I thought it would be

And as I lay supine and let the phosphenes fade 
After another collapse, I'm left to contemplate if I'm really getting better
Or if I'm just numb to the feeling of falling apart

My dichotomy has always been 
That I'm scared of burdening those who love me
But knowing I need help before I die afraid and lonely
But maybe it's all in my head

The irony I face 
Is that whenever I try to medicate my aches
It kills the only part of me 
That makes me want to stay

And as I lay supine and let the phosphenes fade 
After another collapse, I'm left to contemplate if I'm really getting better
Or if I'm just numb to the feeling of falling apart",Phosphenes,
Casey,"I've let melancholy permeate my epidermis
It resonates with every word and I'm stirred awake at night
Because my mind is but a pendulum that oscillates
It swings from grief that suffocates
To brevity my voice can't shake
I stutter when I speak 'cause I'm still so weak

I guess the notion of content has always felt incongruent
But it took a long time to be honest with myself
About the solipsistic attitude I take towards my health

Oh, how it pains me to admit it
But I'm far from self-sufficient
My independence stolen
By persistent mental illness

Please, don't mistake my silence for ignorance
I'm trying to be better at this
But I'm sick and tired of self-abusing
And making excuses for why

I hesitate to lead a life that should elate me
I'm reminded daily that my depression can't be justified
But I can't seem to quieten down my mind
I've always been ashamed to say that maybe I need help
But it's either that, or face the fact I may end up killing myself

I can't tell if I'm a coward for being scared to leave
Or if I'm brave for staying when I'm riddled with worry
So, this is an open letter to myself in ten years' time
I'm sorry if you're not around to read this
I swear that I tried",Wavering,
Casey,"From a soapbox, I have glorified my slow disintegration
Nothing more than my verbose, romanticised self-deprecation
I've little more to offer than advice on letting blood
My cynicism serves no purpose, and my love is not enough
To eschew negative behaviours that I've tried to use to cope 
Abuse of prescribed medication lay as a hand around my throat

But sobriety failed to sedate high functioning depression
My levity has always been a wound that needs a dressing

And the diagnostic lens through which my health is often viewed 
Fails to take in to account the uncomfortable truth
Perhaps my pessimism prospers in the absence of progress
Is my cynicism premature or justified by my emptiness?

But sobriety fails to sedate high functioning depression
My levity has always been a wound that needs a dressing

""Since becoming an adult I've tried to think about it less often
But at the tender age of sixteen I'd already hit the bottom
My brother found me sitting on the floor of the family bathroom
Crying hysterically, and desperately clutching to two or three packets of painkillers 
That I'd been terrified of for weeks I'd been feeling low for a while
But I never truly felt comfortable speaking about it
And he wasn't really able to understand what he'd seen 
But he knew that I was upset so decided to sit beside me
And that was enough for me to view the situation from a new perspective 
While true I knew what I was doing, I'd neglected to think beyond that moment 
And ironically it scares me to death now knowing that I may have left him without a brother 
Because of a mindset I'm yet to fully recover from 
But I guess the memory also invigorates me with a hope that evidently I was lacking at the time
Which is fortunate because now, ten years down the line
I've thought of leaving more than I care to remember
But while the bad days still hold weight, they're definitely getting better 
Every day I dilute the nefarious self-deprecation and loathing 
A little more with the help of my loved ones
Whose constant support I certainly wouldn't be here without 
In all the ways that I am weak, I am also strong
Learning how to speak gave me the strength to carry on""",Wound,

Falling into this great bright morning

Counting clouds and chasing dreams
Through the streams and the waterfalls

Our gait will begin its saunter at the source, when the infant learns to crawl.

Place your hand on mine.
Untie your mind.
Let your bloated brain balloon and float away.
Wet the end of the thread.
Thimble upon your index.

Set the needle on its path,
Bobbing up and down and past.
Tears and seams all turn to one
With every stitch and each spool spun.

Feed the line through its eye.
Draw it from the other side.
Pull the strand to satisfy.
The need to compose.
The genetic map.
The scientific gap.
The detailed blueprints.
Swept away under carpets.

All we did was thread the eye
Of the silver splinter.
We simply planted the seed
And nursed it through the winter.

The rest is up to you and what you'll do.

To learn and love and laugh
Until the cycle circles back
I'll just separate, weigh anchor, disengage
Divide and disappear. And see you in the mirror.

I'm a slave to the night.

O the Scientist was the author and the architect. 
The angels were His ink slingers, His actors and actresses. 
His two purest talents were Ahrima and Nidria, two destined hearts,
Bound by the same idea; the unrelenting constancy of love and hope 
Can rescue and restore you from any scope. 
In her, Ahrima confided his curbing frustration. 
His gifts had been exhausted. 
Oh, how they'd misused them. 
She averted his passion and eased his blood. 
And so he confessed it to her, he had fallen in love.

It's funny, I like me best with a broken heart.

So, when winter started to thaw,
You may be tempted to come around
And it's likely to be too late.

Casey Dienel,"I called in sick to the bathtub today
Somebody pulled the plug on me
So I’ll gather up my skirts to the sink
Made a bubble bath until ?

You held me like a tundra
Shifting blocks of ice, pulling asunder
Come a little closer, you’re in for a long haul
Because the water gets deeper the further we drift out

I used to watch the weather channel twice a week
? calculations of the water levels rising
But since my bay’s been emptied I can’t bear to look at it
Disaster is as disaster does, and it doesn’t like forecasting

Oh you held me like a tundra
Shifting blocks of ice, pulling asunder
Come a little closer, you’re in for a long haul
Because the water gets deeper the further we drift out

You didn’t have to tell me or even say her name
The evidence was plainly written by the expression on your face
It ain’t intuition, it ain’t ESP
I could even tell while you were making love to me

Oh you held me like a tundra
Drifting blocks of ice, pulling asunder
Come a little closer, you’re in for a long haul
Because the water gets deeper the further we drift out

The water gets deeper the further we drift out
And it’s too bad, it’s too bad
It’s too bad, ‘cause I knew it all along

Baby, you held me like a tundra
Pulling us sideways, dragging me under
Come a little closer, you’re in for a long haul
Because the water gets deeper the further we drift out
The water gets deeper the further we drift out
The water gets deeper, and soon enough we’ll drown",Tundra,2006

We got hand rolled cigars and a 3 foot driftwood bar
With Cap’n Earl’s Sarah Mae is the workin girl
Now you can have warm flat beer or a jar of cherry moonshine
And you can have a shot of Copperhead Whiskey
You can have a pull of Thunderbird Wine
It’s always cash in hand, and you can still drink if you can still stand
Floatin on a bayou barstool prayin to God we don’t sink

On this boat I’m the king of the sea
There ain’t nobody that don’t know me
Now I’m a riverboat bandit mean as hell known near and far
And If you hear a rumor I’m dead and gone
Know this legend will still live on
Throw me in the river with concrete boots like a bottle of whiskey I was bound to drown

We got a dirty blonde waitress her name’s Scarlett
Her red lipstick she’s a sailors harlot
She can drop it down low and make ya head spin if the money gets right
She’s got a snake skin wallet on a wallet chain
Her faded tramp stamp says “Bring the Pain”
And she’ll be gone without warnin in the mornin don’t fall in love

And you can throw bones if you like to watch dice fall
You can cut cards with Tennessee Slim we’ll play 7 card stud

And there ain’t no law to get all the way to White Trash Bay

Finally you come
Just as I swear I'm done
I reach another lightbulb moment

The assembly craved relief 
But he himself had given up 
So instead he offered them this bitter cup 
""You're gonna die, we're all gonna die 
Could be twenty years, could be tonight 
Lately I have been wondering why 
We go to so much trouble to postpone the unavoidable 
And prolong the pain of being alive""",Priests and Paramedics,2002
Casey Foubert,"Here we have our dust free dining set
We guarantee it won't collect a spec
Freeing up the children to instead
Grow into your molding
Heed more of your scolding
Go early to their new self-making beds

It seems like you'd be tired of losing face
Like you'd want to put the children in their place
The more you have to tell them to do their chores
The more you run the risk of being ignored

If you're lucky they'll turn out as good as you
You tell them that they're good kids
But you know that it's not true

Your father drank a little
You're on liver number two

Progress has a way of feigning ease
Convenient new inventions bait the tease
For, though it is impossible to cure
A husband bent on cheating
The oxygen's depleting
A child who's always bragging
A wife's persistent nagging
We're equipped to live as though it were

Casey Foubert,"This is how we multiply
Pity that it's not my wife
The friction and skin
The trembling sigh
This is how bodies move
With everything we could lose
Pushing us deeper still
The sheets and the sweat
The seed and the spill
The bitter pill yet undiscovered

Gideon is in the drawer
Clothes scattered on the floor
She's arching her back
She screams for more

Oh, my sweet rapture
I hear Jesus
Calling me home

Finally a chance to breathe
Reaching for the the fallen sheets
Collapsing in a glowing heap
We've gone too far
We've done too much
We have to quit it
Just one more kiss
Just one more touch
Please ten more minutes

This feels so good
Just barely moving
The tension building
Our bodies working
To reach the goal

Oh, my sweet rapture
I hear Jesus and the angels singing
Halleluiah
Calling me to enter the promised land",Rapture,2002
Casey Foubert,"It's so priceless when you say you have to work late
When we both know you're at a motel
Here's the thing that's so much more depressing
Than the infidelity itself

Darling, you are so unoriginal
Each move more obvious than the one before it

You know I always said that I would kill you
If I ever caught you stepping out
Now I see I did not know the half of
What hatred and revenge were all about

Darling, you are so unoriginal
Each move more obvious than the one before it

And I guess I could be bigger but I'd rather make you pay

Darling, you are so unoriginal
You'll see that I can be so unoriginal just like you",Rehearsal,2002

The aftershave
The European cigarettes

The taxi

You tell yourself
It isn't over yet

I can learn to live with this
Plus, I really need a rest
After all, what's wrong with second best
What's wrong with second best

The motel
The distances
Cave into kisses, cold and wet

Familiar exchanges
Like needle pulling thread

The empty movements that once were so inspired
Desperate attempts to fan the flame without the fire

The mattress creaks beneath
The symphony of misery and cum
Still, we lie jerking back and forth
And blurring into one

Your silence means much more than all of your movements
Softly whispering my name without a window
Laugh again and breathe me far away
You were safer when I knew you as today

Crash into the ocean I know your devotion
Crash into the ocean and wait for the night

I could have guessed that you were wishing for a way out
You can't seem to fall apart without an earthquake
Take my hand and I will show you how to break me
Open up your eyes and see the glare

And crash into the ocean I know your devotion
Crash into the ocean and wait for the night

Light me up like a devil, a monster lying in the grass beyond the line
Light me up like the china white powder falling from the sea into the sky
Light me up like a dime store angel Mary Mother holding onto sight

Waves crash down on our souls as I
Relive the past and say goodbye

No use pretending there's a sky
We are trapped inside a world where
Nothing can be justified

I produce like eagles
Soar in the highest clouds to let my conscience free
So I can feed ex girls like sea gulls with better egos in out work
While these ambitions girl with the tip of my penis
To write stories, a young boy the genius
And I mean this, there’s never been a day off
Never been laid off, my own boss and my payoff is to get laid off

Think about my grandma, she blessed
You never left my heart since we laid you to rest

Eyes closed, you had already left us that evening
We buried you mama but your soul is still the same
I know that you're blessed cause your life has so much meaning
You'll always be with my in me mind
As I live, I grow into the man that you designed
Don't worry bout your daughter, just know she fine
She got superman right here and I'll be there right in time
I'll forever care for you
I promise I'll never forget about you
I know that you hear me screaming girl

Don't ever take for granted all the loved ones in your life

Oh I know that I'm blessed
Grandma, I know that you blessed
Momma, I know that you blessed

My son, I knew that since you were a little 
Bitty boy that there was a blessing upon your life
When that car hit you, your dad and I almost lost our minds
But faith and prayer got us through
And your attitude. it was your attitude, the way you handled it
Let me know that you were going to be special
Your granny and nanny always prayed over you and your brother
We are blessed

I just want to leave y'all with something
You know what I mean I just wanna let y'all 
Know that we're blessed if you got a dream
Follow your dream. don't let nobody tell you you can't get it
Keep grinding. keep shining
Keep being blessed
Let's get it",I'm Blessed,2015
Casey Veggies,"Hey Casey, where you about to go?
I'm about to go to the studio, man
Man nigga, you know we got practice
Bro, I ain't going to practice today
Man you miss practice again, dad gon' fuck you up
Oh well, I'm tryna do this music, man
Shit, you tripping but fuck it bro, be safe nigga

Like any parents would, we wanted our son 
To have more than we did. So we pushed for him 
To use basketball and academics to get out the hood

Picture me on my side of town with the top down and I'm riding
AC on cause it's hot outside, got a bad one beside me
We done came up
It's been a long time coming, I'm still getting excited
Foreign whips, exotic trips, my whole family got a pot to piss
See I'm the one to put the blame on, I grew up getting my fame on
They hear me but don't see my name on it
You took my swag, shame on you
If you knew better, then lil nigga you'd do better
My mind right, my whip clean
My money match my new sweater
Who better? They slept on me, we taking this to a new level
I be over shit, I dropped her off and I got right back into the cheddar
Nigga this my city and I run it like Usain Bolt
I been on tour not the videos and I always see the same hoes
Every track I spill my pain on it, nothing been the same for me
Wake her up in the morning and I make her tat my name on it like

After a while, my little man gained a strong will and different plans
It was then that he picked up a mic
I knew about the rap game and the last thing I wanted him to do was lose focus
He didn't. Not only did he make the honor
He had several acceptance letters to colleges
And a mixtape so compelling he was buzzing everywhere
He won my respect and he was allowed to pursue his dream
Now today when I listen to his music, there is no bigger fan
I'm Big Joe, Casey's father. Watch it work

A lot on my mind, I'm trying to show ya
That's part of life, you live and you grow
She sucking me slow, making me feel I'm on 
Top of the world and I'm letting her know
I'm a young man, shit I'm getting manners
I just get this feeling, I don't understand it
I'm high off life and she faded off me
Love is a drug and I'm bout to O.D

I can tell shit gon' change
The crazy things she would for them diamond rings
Baby girl got her own she can be my main
I wonder if she all the way so that she wanna stay
The good ones go, no I can't let her down
I can't wait for it no, I need it right now
She tryna lay me down, know she a turn around
My mind go to different places when I spend time alone
It's sounding like ""la-la-la-la-la-la-
La-la-la-la-la-la-la""
What's on your mind, I want you to tell me right now
Lately I been feeling down and she go down
Go down, go down
Baby do it so good, she deserve a crown
And I'm the king
(Aw man, aw man, aw man
Aw man, aw man, aw man
Aw man, yeah)

It took a long time for Casey to get here
The trials and tribulations of life
The things that turn a boy into a man
The things that made my son live and grow
I know you waited patiently for this album
I hope it was worth the wait I hope you see his vision
I hope you see his vision",I'm the King,2015
Casey Veggies,"I'm the man shorty, come put them bands on it
If I get my hands on it, I can't let go I promise
My momma know I love her, she gave a chance to me
All my fans love me, they wave their hands for me
She do a dance for me, took off her pants for me
I had to catch myself and get another glance of it
I keep it 100 if you keep it 100
Real recognize real, we might get through something
Shout out to LA, shout out to Inglewood
Up at Crenshaw 9th grade then I went to Inglewood
I love to rep my city, just hope you reppin' with me
On the block all day with the extras with me
I'm a made nigga, made something out of none
On the way, all the gangstas ask me where I'm from
I said ""I don't bang, I just play sports
And I write raps, don't sell my life short""

Oh, it's just the little bitty things in life
That make it sound like a song
But why it takes so long, why it take so long
You got me saying oh
You know I love ya but tell me why you make me wait so long
Make me wait so long and why it take so long

Why it take so long, boy I'm tryna get on
In the studio til the morning, from the street lights come on
I swear it won't be long, got the top where we belong
And I had to experience life then I put it up in a song
I knew it all along, I could be your favorite
Girl I gotta keep it 100 with you, I can already picture you naked
Shouts to the people who hated
The ones that were telling me I never make it
But I never listen, it’s out of my statement
And I'm bout to go down as one of the greatest

Oh, it's just the little bitty things in life
That make it sound like a song
But why it takes so long, why it take so long
You got me saying oh
You know I love ya but tell me why you make me wait so long

And when I'm gone, she said she feel alone
I'm getting grown, I'm tryna buy a home

When we get together, it's a different zone
We upgrade each other like Beyonce's song
Girl I ain't thirsty for any of these R&B singers
But I respect your mind and I love your demeanor
When you spending bands, you'll get paid to love
I'm talking sex in the shower, candles in the tub
I pull up on you in a brand new car
Bonnie & Clyde, we against the law
We should start over just because
Meet again and then fall in love
Act like we didn't know each other

The label wanna get a hit from me but I play the game like a symphony
Fuck you to my enemies, I ain't showing no sympathy
Fuckboys can't censor me, can't change my identity
Money and the fame ain't switching me

Thank god that we blessed the streets
Carrots and the peas is gone but I continue the legacy

Dead to me but I forgive and I forget and now they distant memories

Put away your tray tables in the upward position

I wonder where they gon' be when all the plans get cut off
All the rights turn in to wrongs and all the lights get turned off
All the preachers turn in to clones and everybody starts singing songs
That sound the same, I can't sing along
Got my phone off I'm in a different zone
Wheels up, I'm leaving home, they try to box me in but I needed mo'

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

And she's gone.

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

That grow so incredibly high.

Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds

I've been dancing with the devil, he was always good to me
And I've been walking in the shadow of a friendly enemy

You knew I wasn't good for you
But you swore you hit the jackpot
And you swore you struck gold
You were stepping on your toes
Always tripping over nothing
But nothing's on the floor
I swear the time it takes
To congregate and conversate
Just so things don't complicate
I just don't have the time of day
To try to pay attention to what your momma say
She just moving lips, moving lips
Talking 'bout stupid shit, stupid shit
And she don't know how to keep the man
But she can move them hips, move them hips

And the way she bending over and she touching on her toes
Momma see me looking at her then she wanna pose
I don't even know why shawty got on any clothes
And you really know already what I'm gonna drop
Hella money, mami wanna come up to the top
I walk a little closer then I do my Diddy bop
I love the way she moving and the way she make it pop
And I'm loving the way that you're making it bounce and you're moving it, doing it
See the way that you're breaking it down and the way that you got them all losing it
Get it, lit, shake it, shake it
Bounce, turn up, level, level
Do it nasty like you out here dancing with the devil

Hey, hey, hey
I knew you were trouble, trouble, trouble
Don't wanna look you in the fa-a-ace
I knew you were trouble, trouble, trouble

My mic is sweatin' with steam, when I hear the crowd scream
People, ugly ugly people is the name and the theme
I'm the microphone master, money makin' man
And I got more rock than Bon Jovi's band
Cash constantly controls, corresponds the mix
He's my homey, he's my DJ, he's my sidekick
So as you listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet
",Ugly People Be Quiet,1999
Cash Money & Marvelous,"Intro
All the ugly people be quiet!
But before we get this party started right
Hey Cash! [Tell the people what you're the king of]
Verse 1
Just clap your hands, just make your hands clap
To Marvelous the mic marvel, dictator of rap
Get on the dancefloor, let me see what you got
'cause the sound we're throwin' down it makes you want to rock, ha
Hurby Luv supplying the beat
They make my rhymes sound fresher to the highest peak
A-check it out, check it out, get down
A wild style form of rap, my dazzling sound
The style I'm reciting, just reciting my style
The double words, words double but I call it wild
So girl just keep grabbing, keep grabbing my tip
Long as the money's flowin' everything is legit
'cause my rhyme is on time, on time is my rhyme
Already on top, ain't no need to climb
And to the bone, he shocked the record down to the bone
Call him Cash Cash Money but his name is Jerome
The green-eyed brother, brother with the green eyes
He shakes your booty, boom shaker from 9 to 5
So listen to this tune, don't knock it till you try it
People, ugly ugly people, will you please be quiet
Verse 2
This is a hard rocker that will rock your house
Turn up your radio and stereo and check it out
It's crazy wild and illy, bang boomin' your butt
My name is Marvin call me Marv the wacky Marvelous nut
The raving rhyme roller, rock roller that rolls
Gettin' laid, stayin' paid so you know that I'm cool
The stunning smashing super, super serious sound
The devastating death defying dictator who's down
The mighty hard rocker who's rocking your butt
And everybody check him out, Cash Money's on the cut
Verse 3
Boy, I'm rough and I'm tough, never pullin' your bluff
I'll turn a hard rock heckler to a cream puff
Got rhymes and rhymes, gettin' better with time
Hit so many def lines you have to rewind
Play it back, listen, observe my rap
'cause my lyrics are strong, and it's like that
In Philly down the way, hard rockin' alone
Marvelous and Cash Money, Marv and Jerome
We make your party hearty and say [La-di-da-di]

So won't cha come outside with me
How bout chu take this ride with me

And we stopped over at the Ramada
And I got her to come out on that powder
And right jump on just swallow
And swallow and drain damn she wild
Make her trip out Lil' Wayne
Damn she loud, now

Cash Money Millionaires,"(Chorus)
12:30 in the morning on a one-ten
New black Benz new girlfriend
Celebratin cause the boy done did it
Hit the biggest lick in L.A. history
Listen to me now
The man made a deal with the devil
The F.B.I.
I always thought it was a no no
And he said why
Should I not get this government paper
Plus I didn't like these niggas no way
We downtown around 11:30
About to get up with some niggas that we know is dirty
We got the federally money in the briefcase
That we done replaced
Believe it when we see the whites of they eyes we gonna ride

(Chorus)
I got to go cause they tryin to get me
I got the money and the drugs I left the building
So now the fedz and the thugs wanting both of my endz
And I ain't trying to let them get near me
Because I got to go
Cause they tryin to snatch all the goods from my lick and it ainthappening like that
See I done stole a lot of shit you think i'm giving it back
They sayin give me the loot hold and were the coke I gotta go

Oh see them coming as they move into the street lights
Showin on them like beeds to they eyes
Seems like I'm always in the same position
You know the money and the yay dippin on the freeway
But I won't be broke this time
Cause now I run a six and my chick got the 5
I throw my phone out the window
Cause the boys is coming wondering why they wasn't informed of thedropoff point
So we boys and boys we keep rollin
Over to my girlfriend and don't think
When I talk to my homeboys I don't hear
They said our time was almost up but this is business

(Chorus)
Supposed to go now i'm thinkin hard
Something odd with this braud
And I knew it dogg
Federally
Now I'm lookin down the barrel as she yelling pull over
Saying show over baby should of stopped when I told you
I ain't stoppin yo ass gonna have to shoot me
She cocked the joint so I guess she didn't get my point
We hit a truck in the back
She dropped the gat I pressed the gas and mashed

I got that work
(For sure)
I got that work, nigga
Hustle - death if you hustle with us
(I'll front ya, boy)
'Cause I'ma put that work on your life, lil' one
({too low to hear} if you're shined out with a nigga)
It ain't no secret

[Baby]
I'm that nigga, Baby
But my niggas, they call me Atrice
Every bitch I fuck gotta be above average
On another level, nigga - millionaire status
Just bought two mansions: one in Florida, one in Dallas
I'm a boss nigga
Buy whatever, don't give a fuck 'bout the cost, nigga
I like to floss, nigga
It ain't no secret: I'm the number-one stuntman
You come at me wrong, you'll be in the trunk, man
I'm a O.G. shot caller - Big Tymer
Cadillac, Hummer, Jaguar, Benz driver
Thirty-six-ounces-in-the-glove-compartment hider

[B.G.]
Don't test the water - look, believe B.'ll ride

[Baby]
Nigga, I'm a millionaire
Tote two guns 'cause I've been there
Lil' wodie, you don't wanna go there
I'm fuckin' all these hoes

Y'all better believe!

[Baby]
And I'm tellin' the next rappin' bitch what's up my sleeve, wodie

[Hook (Turk)]
Bitches say we stunt too much (much)
It's okay 'cause we can back it up (up)
Know you gon' let us do what we do (do)
Rock our Rolie, ride drop-tops, too (too)

[B.G.]
(Look, look, it's a- it's a- a checkmate, checkmate)
Ain't it a bitch how I be stun'n - I know, but I can do that
I pull up, top down on a Prowler, they be like, ""Who that?""
Common sense should tell 'em it gotta be a H.B.
'Cause don't nobody stunt like them niggas from CMB
Baby had me reppin' since I was in the sixth grade
'Cause niggas wonder how I'm eighteen and already made
I done been through it - from bustin' heads to doin' time
Now I'm on that level to where I got the right to shine
Me and my clique hit the scene - Ree's, jeans, and T's
Wrist, neck, and ears just shoutin' *bling*bling*
We be thuggin' to the fullest - stay handlin' hoes
'Cause all of 'em the same: straight scandalous hoes
I ain't trippin' - they can ride in the whip with a nigga
But put your head down and donate your lips to a nigga
Tossin' bitches is a hobby 'cause me and my niggas share
Gotta respect that's the life for this Cash Money Millionaire

[Hook (Turk)]

[Mannie Fresh]
(What, what, what)
I know y'all sayin', ""Look here - what the fuck is that?""
A Space Shuttle, lil' daddy - made by Cadillac
Take that other shit out, and put Corinthian leather
Put a sun-roof top for sun-roof weather
They go, ""Whooooo!"", when I fly by they shit
They go, ""Oooooh!"", you diggity? Just don't quit
I like 'em one short, one tall, one a doll
I like 'em on their head in the bed against the wall
Turbo-charged dick slinger...
...pussy banger
...pain-bringer
Nasty in-and-out finger
See that girl that you're with - I did that shit
Any girl that you get, I'ma hit that bitch
Last year: helicopter playa - hello
This year: plushed-out, pimped-out Space Shuttle
You like gorgeous Lovely, I know you do
And if you're a real hot girl you'll let me fuck your crew
For real, though

Playin', ya die

Prey every time
I'm straight off the porch - I live down the court
Lookin' for that dope
Kickin' in your door
Tyin' up your hoe
And break the bitches up - run 'em in the cut
I don't give a fuck - if them people rush, they ain't catchin' us
I gotta make the green
Smokin' nicotine
Know a nigga's scheme
Run em' with the beam
Runnin' with my team
¡­And get it how I live
Keep it how it is
Make a nigga cents
Take a nigga bitch
Hit him with it quick
If it mean bustin' a head, I'm gon' do it
Whatever it takes to get the bread, I'm goin' through it
Tryin' to get my pockets swole up
Juvenile is 'bout to blow up
That third-ward sign I'ma throw up when I take it off of your shoulder
They come with they mask on
They be a clique, but I get 'em gone
Hit niggas in the chest when I'm slangin' chrome
Tryin' to kill me a nigga when the beef is on

Baby, let me get the keys to that Rover Truck
Man, let me get this beef shit over, bruh
Ain't no bitches here up in Magnolia, bruh
Bust your big head is what was told to us

[Juvenile]
Nigga, I'm straight from out the P.J., they murder easy
Well, if you're spankin' out for three days, believe what we say
Niggas be shootin' that shit in they van, some of 'em sellin' it
The rest of 'em sniff the cocaine, high off that yellow shit
Young niggas already got they mind made up
Nigga fuck with one of they boys, they get sprayed up
A lot of these children don't have A/C in they house
Cockroaches crawlin' all over the wall and they couch
Little mites runnin' through the kitchen lookin' for crums
While they mom hittin' they (?) in the bathroom
Everyday you see a fight or shootout for a minute
It ain't the projects, it's the niggas that's up in it
Man, half of these motherfuckers ain't even from 'round here
If they didn't have that work, they would never come 'round here
And when they come they draw all the heat with 'em
Lookin' for some niggas to get in the beef with 'em

[Juvenile]
You better know that me and Wayne want the cash, or we bustin' ass
¡­soon as I get out of my Jag with a gun a mask
Now play it how you say it - I bet ya won't, bitch
I'll have you leakin' from your head when I take (?)
What you want, huh? Boy, that weed or that coke?
I don't know what the fuck you on, but you about to get smoked
I'll bring it to your front door right up on your porch
Until your bitches tell me, ""Juvie, we ain't beefin' no more.""
Now, where the dope at? Paraphernalia?
Give me twenty ki's before I kill ya
Don't be makin' noise, nigga - shut the fuck up
You know where the dope at - now shut the fuck up
Bring me straight to it - don't be tryin' to act crazy
I want her - I need her, ya know - that's my old lady

Like Rob Deniero, Rob Banks
And bang out with the law

[Lac]
Look here I come from the projects
And the ghetto streets
I'm cooking up whole thangs
'Till they hard like concrete
I fronted the O.G.s
A bag of that olzes
For niggas that don't know
I got something whodie

[Baby]
The same ol' nigga
Just a different game
Fuck bitches, tote heat
Things never gon' change
I'm the number one stunna
Nigga, Baby's the name
I like cooking crack
And watch how quick it come back

[Stone]
I rock a oyster-faced Roley
With the crust out bang
Ice cover the wrist whodie
Like I sprung my hand
I sport Prowlers, whips
With the T.V.s playing
Iceberg, Prada dick
Like here come the man

[Baby]
I'll pull up at Washington [and] Six
In a six
I'll slide out quick
Bet I could fuck any bitch

[Lac]
I push a lavender Porsche Carerra
Seat sprayed leather
The top goes off and on
To floss with the rainy weather
The seats they ain't customized
They made by Ricarro
A ruby red CF5
I'll cop by tomorrow

[Baby]
For catching me on the interstate drunk
Running the law
With a bitch in my lap
Tasting my balls
I don't like when they too much
Act like they stuck up
Leave Atrice nut up
I'll bat that bitch up

[Stone]
The king of the Nolia
I crowd both the wrists
Lock down slanging towns
Took the top off the six
In the club I be thugged
With ten topless chicks
T-shirt, Girbauds, Reeboks
In it

Six foes hoppin', got the whole world poppin', collaz!
Milluem Dots, mo' ice than eskimo
Motherfucking money strong, y'all got the game wrong
Four scale pimpin' whodi, wrist glistenin'
I know you whisperin', but SUCKA I ain't listenin'
Heard she pick the Wheezy up
'Cause she back that ass up
Got a pocket of hand-cuffs and wrote the pony so tough
Tell me why you're mad at me
I know you thinkin' breezy, creepin' to the heezy

It's so equsit, come and pay a visit
please believe it, don't miss it

Forty fines for relly in the home with mack sheezy
But leave your women and your troubles behind you
We mackin' for a livin', it's only a right that I remind you
From beanies to Bossolini's we used to struggle
Surpise rapper forty eyes all my dogs bubble

From the North, to the South, to the East, to the West,

Workin' on your opponent, workin' on it too much, you dreamin'
This shit you see on these videos ain't always what it seems
Life is based on game, and game is based on witch dot
Trippin' off what the next man got
And get your grip
Remember, love don't love nobody but we love the way it feels
And let it be a good damn thing, if love can pay the bills
Got you in my zone now, shoot them crooks now
Now I'm booked out on my own now, it's goin' down, platinum bound
Here we go again two nappy heads in they plot (plot)
Dog, you be surpised with all these capers I be spottin'
that's why murder rates increase, it should be peace
But now, who am I to speak when all I did my youth was creep? (creep)
Duckin' it dodge to my so-called homeys, they phoney
Tryna get me, tryna hit me
I'm takin' that sucka with me before he split me 
 
[Chorus]
[Verse III]
If you came where I come from, YOU KNOW WHERE I'M COMIN' FROM
Takin' so many chances, livin' life on the run
No fun, espcially for a playa situation, get critical
murder one and that's pitiful but yet it's soblentioul
Way beyond your knocks fool, peep fool, check the ????????
Death ain't got no date and no time, don't never go away
But playa-haters gon' hate on how much money you make
Because, money makes the world go round
Livin' life like ?????, this is cabbage
With hundred stick situation, so savage
So tragic, need a hot meal in my baby's belly
Remenise no hard times in my pen in my selly
I ain't tryna go back, 'cause backwards ain't part of my PJ
I need that might dollar to survive in these ghetto streets
Them devils want me isolated, like chicken drawers
I'm tryna get mine (mine)
I hope you get yours (yours)
I hope you get yours, get it, get it

Wipe you off the land, it's a concrete jungle
A tear for the gangstaz, O.Z.'s and bundoes

Find the strength to forgive my jinx

Get peace and disagreements

Know when niggas either say that you don't mean that
I heard that before, I don't believe it

They tell you everything in how they treat you
View kindness as weakness, say you don't need me
Hard to let go but I'm leaving faceless right now, what is easy?

What you see's your reflection of what you think you perceive
Don't make a promise you can't keep
But keep what needs to be released

Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
(You copy?)

Sittin' in the back of the, all-gray Acura
Gun to the passenger for actin' tough
Turn the wheel in the passin', heart of an assassin
Plus I'm on the draw down, quick as fuck
Last move 'fore I give all street shit up
Put a nigga in the ground face down, feet up
This nigga here tried to cuff me for my re-up
When I went to his crib he called police up
Now you on the way to bein' paraplegic
For sendin' messages through bitches like you go see us
Shady, Ca$h king of the dope fiends plus
Give 'em a square mile by blocks and I'm creamed up
Took the bullet out of Obie head, put it in my pistol
And use it, ammunition on the niggaz they hit
Damn, I go to war on the regular man
Cause I'm part of the dream team, you a regular man
Far as rap I don't see no competitors and
You see things like me, with my medal in hand
I'm a state case boy with a federal plan
A hundred in beats, beatin' the shit out skinheads
I'm the spirit of a G bringin' lyrics of the street
I'm Ca$his, a real dope boy on the beat (beat)

Who's to pass the driver?
O tries to flow to die fo' and the death blow survive (woo!)
I echo through your external vibe
With internal experiences I've acquired (uhh)
I'm probably the most honest hip-hopper alive
A victim depictin' images from my own eyes (yeah!)
Never livin' through homes, why?
Homie got his own set of cajones, stand up guy

Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that ""Renegade"" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi—
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big—ba—big—big bay—ba—baby

So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Shady (Stat Quo!) we're back!

This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him ""suck my dick""
Take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the ""Detox"" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns own, Aftermath, Shady!

Shady!(Bobby Creek!) we're back!

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't write yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'til I show I
Go out on a limb with Em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track nigga

Shady! (Ca$his!)

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in the Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Prozac, D's and E-Pills, it's a wrap

It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass

Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin'' G
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it

Do the same thang, killin off black folks 
Selling on the side, string save a mean mo' 
To anything I own, rocks, crack, E and smoke 
Got the picture of the seven little reasons 
that keep, any nigga disrespectin me breathin 
Still I be high, every time I see them 
My babies, my angels, and they are my freedom 
I know I'm on the grind, lately I ain't comin home 
They keep you in my life, I never leave your mom alone 
You know I'm whylin out, strayin strapped, ride or dyin 
You hear the stories 'bout your daddy floatin 'round town? 
But you call me up like, ""Daddy I been findin out 
that you caught Rico slippin, beat him up and stomped him out"" 
So when you go to school, you wanna do it too? 
You just like me, how can I be mad at you?

You ain't had to live like I did 
And still you are just like me (you are just like me) 
Hell I even did a bid and came back to see 
You are just like me (you are just like me) 
The only reason I ain't kill myself 
Is for fear you'll be just like be (you'll be just like me) 
You got the demons that's within myself 
Now I see, you are just like me (you are just like me)

I'm the breadwinner, I don't fear nann nigga 
I don't trust nobody, I'm a man - liquor 
runnin through my veins, you runnin through my brain 
I start to see your heart, we feel each other's pain 
I talk to all of y'all when I say I love you mayne 
One day we'll ball and I'll never have to leave again 
Until that day comes, shorty be a G 
I ride with y'all everywhere cause y'all are part of me

I teach 'em young, don't be rollin on no scary shit 
Long as you love each other, you'll be very rich 
Everybody question how I be affordin this 
I make my money off of dicks and spend it on my kids 
I'm sendin messages in bottles of imagination 
so they can feel my presence, though they at home just waitin 
My soldiers still in trainin, throwin up forks like they bangin 
Know how to bogart, and never trust a stranger 
They the ones I look to whenever I'm in danger 
We walkin holdin hands, interlockin trigger fingers 
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger 
and a father so my conversation must remain gangsta

Just tryin to be down with anybody who's left now
Better be down with them, huh
But I dare some bitch to say somethin about, Eminem

We all got shooters, yeah these days who doesn't?

And I can't change cause, I entertain

You just realized that, I'm insane
I'm enraged, engaged in a war with ways
They can have me spray shots off the stage
If I die like Malcolm will you feel my pain?
Or just cry like a bitch while I lay in my grave?
If I die like 'Pac, cause I yearn to bang
You discredit me, like I never learned a thang
If I die like Big would you praise my rhymes?
And give me the spot, ""Best of All Time""
If I die in N.Y. will the West Coast ride
And the beef not stop 'til, hip-hop die
Will a nigga who don't, understand that line
Try and damage my safety, in N.Y.?
Will the rap game embrace me cause I got skill?
Or for the lies of that man, will I get killed nigga?

Is it envy from the fellas, cause I got signed?
Will the whole hood hate, cause I speak my mind?
Will I die for a rhyme before I reach my prime?
If I kill my bitch like Robert Blake
Do I got enough money, to beat the case?
If I crash out, right before I end the race

Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed

I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him

Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked

Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga

Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah

My smile is my make up

Replaying conversations in my head by my ex-wife
From the house work that I did, to the kids, even our sex life
She said I was crazy so I threatened to prove her dead-right
So she got court orders, restraining me, put on the red lights
Frustrated, thinking how the fuck could I clean it up
Traffic stopped, about 1000 degrees in my truck
Loosened my tie, wiped the sweat out of my eyes, mixed with tears
Mind thick with fears, I've lost everything that I done built for years
Bright yellow school bus fucking up my limbo
Kids bitchin', cussin', flickin' boogers upon my window
Start rolling it down for some air and the handle breaks
Kick my door open, dive out, feeling some escape

""We said vows and shit, that shits' for life right?!
Yeah, that shit's until death, death...
That shit can be mended
But that bitch don't be listening to me!
She'll prolly throw a fucking fit and shit!
I'ma go there that bitch is gonna listen to me
She'll see I'ma fix this shit, FUCK THAT!""

[White man in the background]: ""Move your fucking car, maaaaan!!""

Motherfucker is my own car really haulting movement
I got some powerful shit in my trunk want me to use it?
I grabbed that shit, cocked it now talk like you're silly!
If you needed some release would I fuck with you, Billy?
""Look away lady, before I swiss cheese your Mazda""
Am I crazy for wanting my babies to have a father!
Gonna show my bitch of a wife she better work a little harder
Stop them kids from screaming, it's pushing me even farther!
It's my daughter's birthday, Billy, you like this gift?
Your name's not Billy? Really? Then why do you react to it?
If you're an actor, am I your fuckin' audience?
Kids, look how many different directions his body went
It's okay, I'm not crazy, I got kids your age
Don't be afraid, I said don't be afraid! Behave!
Now y'all be cool now, I'm leaving now, it's beyond hot
'Bout to visit my wife after hitting the pawn shop for more glocks
I got some shit to fix (sinister chuckle) I got some shit to fix

[Mr. SOS]
Today's about to be one of the biggest days of my life
'Cause I'm about to ask the women I love if she'll be my wife
I just know that she will, for this women, I'll KILL
I used to clean dishes at Micky D's, now I'm on GRILL
So I've been able to save up enough money for this necklace
Along with this ring for when I pop the big question
But my manager's been stressin' the way I been dressin'
Tellin' me I need new shoes but I can't afford to get them!
He's all about perfection and does shit that I hate!
Today he wrote me up and I was only five minutes late!
And then he threatened to take me off grill and make me scrub plates
And the toilet where people shit out all the food they just ate!
AW FUCK! I'm starting to hear my screws bust
Screw it, I'll do it, He gives me Windex and a toothbrush
Now I'm scrubbin the toilet like, FUCK MY BOSS and HE STINKS!
I'm asking my girl to marry me, fuck what everyone thinks
Let me look at the ring now to calm me down like my shrink
NOOOOOO! I JUST LOST IT AND NOW IT'S LOST IN THE SINK
And today on my lunchbreak my girl's supposed to come through
I want to ask her but without the ring what'll I do?

Dialogue:
[SOS]: Wassup baby. Listen I want to tell you something.
[GIRL]: ""Yeah?""
[SOS]: Well, we've been together for a long time and...
[GIRL]: ""Uh huh...""
[SOS]: ...I love you more than anything in this world... Will you marry me?
[GIRL]: ""So where's the ring?""
[SOS]: I... I had one but... I dropped it in the sink...
my... my manager... he... he made me get off the grill and clean the toilets
and...(sob)
[GIRL]: Yeah... WHATEVER! I'm seeing somebody else anyway, loser!""

[SOS]: Grrrrrrrrrrr......

FUCK YOU FOR REAL! SNUFF TO YA GRILL! SMACK TO YA FACE!
FOOT TO YOUR CROTCH! Look at the cops...
THANKS FOR THE GAT! RAT-A-TAT-TAT! CRIME IN THE ACT!
BITCH, DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT???
SICK cause my mind just snapped pretty hard!
Fatality... RIP YOUR TITTY OFF!
Pull out the gun that I got from the cop
And make her face look like Barbecue sauce.
Bite off her nipple like it's on the menu
And spit it out the drive through window inside a pinto and leave the driver
crippled
When I fire my pistol like it's a missile. (BLAOW!)
Start to hear sirens whistle I've lost my mind, it's official!
Grab my manager's pencil and stick it in his eye tissue
For having a time issue go to the bathroom and try to kick through
The sink. I made a mess and shot cops. Let off a couple of pop pops
ON THE CLOCK let me go before the alarm stops
I'ma take this damn ring to the pawn shop

To get my FUCKIN money back... (cries) fuckin bitch!

[Kno]
Ignition contact in my little compact
Nissan piece of shit and I need to quit
Funneling Night Train pummels my right brain
Feel the pain of a hangover, I smell the faint odor of piss
I need to lower my risk
Hittin my liver with this liquid deliverance
I'm fuckin laughin and stuck in traffic
As my 8-track tape deck pumps some wack shit
Its drastic
I walked in on my friend with his hand caught in my wife's panty elastic
While she was wearin em!
Started tearin em a new asshole verbally
I don't think I hurt em
Twisted off the MD and Bourbon
Got the straight vodka in my coffee thermos
Put on my game face and walk in the door
Of my job at the strip mall discount department store.

Dialogue:
[Boss]: Dan-O! Happy Birthday
[Kno]: Thanks!
[Boss]: Oh, before I forget uh, we're gonna have to let you go Dan-O.
[Kno]: What?!
[Boss]: Yeahh, we've been monitoring incoming packages for a while now, we
noticed you have a fetish for naked pictures of Janet Reno and Will Smith
CD's. Yeahh.
[Kno]: (crying)
[Boss]: Hey, uh...what's the machine gun in the paper bag for?

No, Mr. Johnson! YOUR ASS IS FIRED!
here's your pink slip get hit with six clips
Salepeople out front, I ain't forget ya'll
Split ya'll, and everybody in this strip mall
Walk in the Dollar Store and just let off
Now even the managers body is 50% off!
Hit up Toys are Us and bust my shit
(ratttatat) TRICK LUH DA KIDS!!
Music store massacre, cus they're trying to tell me
21.99 for a Nelly CD?!
Verizon fucked up my service so they ain't out of the woods
Can you hear me now? BIATCH!(gunshot) GOOD!!!
Shop owners, cashiers, even the patrons
This is punishment for gettin caught in my matrix
the chance for survival is miniscule
I see two dudes walking towards the pawn shop they bout to get it too",Falling Down,2003
