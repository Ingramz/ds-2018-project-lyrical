Tall Jazz,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2001
Tall Jazz,"Bless the beasts and the children,
For in this world they have no voice,
They have no choice.
Bless the beasts and the children,
For the world can never be,
The world they see.

Light their way
When the darkness surrounds them;
Give them love, let it shine all around them.
Bless the beasts and the children;
Give them shelter from a storm;
Keep them safe;
Keep them warm.

Light their way

Give them shelter from a storm;

Tall Jazz,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago
Was you",Long Ago and Far Away,2005

Steele
Up early in the mornin', take position on the streets of NY
My state like Bed-Stuy, either do or I die (do or you die)
So I try not to rely on godz in times of need
And focus on my dough cause I must proceed (must proceed)
Mama used to say Id make it and I take her advice
She was on her 9 to 5, I was out on heists
Tryin' to get mine, how to commit crime
Only way ma dukes find out is if I get time
Jucks after jucks, til I got hit with the book
Even though I hurt her ma dukes still looked out
Kept me strong ever since she let the seed out
The womb
Wanna take it from em, or take it to em

Whats the reason of life, stack doe or live trife
Become a family man supportin' kids and a wife
Like your pops who break his back to bring home likle scratch
Or black who pushed the AK ot with gpacs
Makin' a killin' by fulfillin' dreams so by his man borne
Who says duke kasoffer hate the ground that he walk on
Or do I greez my steez, purchase a 2-piece
Walk in some company, talkin' bout hire me
Watch your heart catch money bags
With kids from Nostrand ave
Poured out some liquor when I heard
My nigga Black passed (pour out some liquor)
From multiple gunshots between 3 and 5
Mama always told me only the strong survive

And now

I realize that I gotta keep my eyes on the prize
The road of success is a long drive, 2X
So I struggle and strive cause I'm told
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive

Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
(only the strong survive)

Now I realize, I gotta get my eyes on the prize
The road to success is a long dri-ive yeah
So I struggle and strive, 
Just to make it right
So I been told, 
Only the strong will survive, 
Only the strong will
Survive

Tall Sean, Ruck
Ladies and Gentlemen
In shoes, sneakers, Timberlands,
Get out your seat, move your feet, 
With more love than Wimbledon
For who Sean Price, no relation to Vincent

Or indecent exposure
In possession, the verbal weapons

Tall Ships,"Say you'll never think of me
I was gone without a trace, lost at sea
I am simply moving on
Breaking down my chemical bonds

And I'll return everything I've borrowed
Back into the ground from which I was reborn
So say you'll never think of me
As gone without a trace, lost at sea

This is the way it's meant to be
You can't stick around forever
So please forget me

And I'll return everything I've borrowed
Back into the ground from which I was reborn
I'll fall apart, filter down into the soil
To be reused again

All that's lost is found in the end

All that's lost is found in the end

And I'll return everything I've borrowed
Back into the ground from which I was reborn
Don't fall apart, a passing is no reason for sorrow
It's just the fusing of beginning again",Lost & Found,2017
Tall Ships,"I heard the TV and it told me
I shouldn't grieve
There is something more
If you believe in god's love

But I've seen too many scenes
In which the people I love fell to their knees
With no cause, at a loss
Only questions and gordian knots

So as I am without faith
Tell me, what should I dream of?
Oh tell me, why should I do anything at all?
'Cause I'm caught up in a race
I don't know what I'm running from
for or to

So breathe in, breathe out
Take note, take count
Tell me honestly, my friend
What did you live for
And would you make amends?

'Cause I wanted to believe
But I can't see the wood for the trees
It's not long before
Your heart won't beat anymore
And then you're gone, the knot is cut
Meditations on loss

So as I am without faith
Tell me, what should I dream of?
Oh tell me, why should I do anything at all?
'Cause I'm caught up in a race

Tall Tale,"You, get me feelin' crazy
There always on my mind
And I get to feelin' lately
If I never knew your name,
I'd love you all the same
But I have you to myself
Wanting nothing else
Knowing that you're mine

Good time,bad time,all the time
Hands reachin' 'cross a room

Talla 2XLC,"I always knew what I wanted to be
I knew for sure, I knew for sure
Always knew it was them or me
I wanted more, more and more
It's all right, it's O.K.
None of them people gonna take it away
They don't know like I know
And I can't stop 'cause it drives them crazy

It drives them crazy, 'cause I won't be cool
It's too late baby

It's  the same old desire
Nothing has changed, nothing's the same
Burning like fire
Don't you ever take my name in vain

Always moving, somewhere else to be
Moving on, moving on
Scream at you and you scream at me
Right or wrong, right or wrong
It's all right, it's O.K.
No one's ever gonna take us away

I gotta keep rockin', 'cause it makes me crazy

Talley Trio,"In the morning when I wake I'm so thankful for another day 
And I wanna testify.
Got a job a roof overhead don't live fancy but my family's fed
I wanna testify.
Got my strength and I got my health you can't buy that with fame or wealth And 
I just wanna testify.
I get overwhelmed with thankfulness for things I have received.
More than fame or wealth I feel the spirit inside movin' me 
Looked around and can't ignore, there's so many things to be thankful for.
And I just wanna testify
I got a joy that comes from within, deep in my soul I feel so content
And I just wanna testify
I searched high and I searched low, to find the answers only Heaven holds

Talley Trio,"Who here among us has not been broken
Who here among us is without guilt or pain
So oft' abandoned by our transgressions
If such a thing as grace exists
Then grace was made for lives like this

There are no strangers
There are no outcasts
There are no orphans of God
So many fallen, but hallelujah
There are no orphans of God

Come ye unwanted and find affection
Come all ye weary, come and lay down your head
Come ye unworthy, you are my brother
If such a thing as grace exists
Then grace was made for lives like this

O blessed Father, look down upon us
We are Your children, we need Your love
We run before Your throne of mercy
And seek Your face to rise above",Orphans of God,2006
Talleys,"How you spend your minutes are what matters
All tomorrows come from yesterdays
When you're feeling broken, bruised and sometimes shattered
Blow out the candles on the cake
Like everything's a big mistake

It seems you always wait for life to happen
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break
If all we've got is us then life's worth living
And if you're in, you know I'm in
I'm ready and I'm willing

[Chorus:]
I am
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you
No one's there to understand
I am
I'll be there to be that someone
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand
I am

We're just who we are, there's no pretending
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending
And if you're in you know I'm in
I'm ready and I'm willing

[Chorus:]

I ain't got no halo hanging over my head
I ain't gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you
I am, I am

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
I am
I am
I am",Wherever I Am,2001
Talleys,"A hand of fear gripped the crowd
That day at Jairus' home
When the doctor shook his head
and said she's gone
You could feel that mother's heart break
You could hear them cry and mourn
Their little girl was only twelve years old

Somewhere in the distance
Outlined against the sun
There came a Man on a mission
From the throne
They said ""look somebody's coming""
But what they did not know
It was their Promise coming down
that dusty road

There's a Promise coming down that dusty road
From His holy hand healing virtue flows
He's got the keys to what you need
Death and hell He will defeat
There's a Promise coming down that dusty road

The wonder turned to mocking
When Jesus did speak
'Cause He said your daughter's not dead
She's just asleep
Then He turned to the unbelievers
And He told them all ""go home""
They heard Him say
""Leave Me and death alone.""

And then He laid His hand upon the child
And He looked death right in the eye
He said, ""All power in Heaven
and earth it belongs to me""
And with a voice that sounds like thunder
He hurled death and hell He will defeat
Oh there's a promise coming down your dusty road

There's a Promise coming down that dusty road
From His holy hand healing virtue flows
He's got the keys to what you need
Death and hell He will defeat
There's a Promise coming down that dusty road",The Promise,2001

Talleys,"Maggie came home one day with a raggedy, Raggedy Ann.
She said "" Mama, look what I found in the neighbors garbage can.""
It had a missing left arm, and a right button eye hanging by a thread
She carried it gently up to her room and laid it on her bed
with her other dolls.

She loves the broken ones, the ones that need a little patchin' up
She sees the diamond in the rough and makes it shine like new
It really doesn't take that much, a willing heart and a tender touch
If everybody loved like she does, there'd be a lot less broken ones.

Twenty years later at a shelter on Eighteenth Avenue
A seventeen year old girl shows up all black and blue
with needle tracks in her left arm, almost too week to stand,
She says,""I'm lost an I need help"", as Maggie takes her hand
And says, ""Come on in!""

She loves the broken ones, the ones that need a little patchin' up
She sees the diamond in the rough and makes it shine like new
It really doesn't take that much, a willing heart and a tender touch
If everybody loved like she does, there'd be a lot less broken ones.

If you call her and angel, she'd be quick to say to you
She's just doing what the one who died for her would do

See the diamond in the rough and make it shine like new

Would of thought I gave you life, had me bent like a comma

Played games, told me lies, steady pullin' these strings

Hittin' the clubs with my girls, wasn't no stoppin' a bitch
Throwin' bills like I'm Mickey, I was spendin' it fast

Sure money nice but sure as hell don't make relationships last

Now I'm gone and you're lonely, it's a shame
But I did it for the love of you, babe

[Sole']
Would of gave my life to save yours, nigga
Push came to shove
A bullet with your name I'd change to mine
And nigga, that's love

Prayers that you'd be spared from wickedness that lived in the streets
And when them niggas you was beefin' wit start bringin' da heat
I got involved in dumb shit that didn't involve me at all
Had bitches scratchin' up my car and then you havin' the gall

To say it wasn't your fault and that you wasn't to blame
Thought you would come home after drama, have me screamin' your name
Young and dumb, I took you back pretendin' I couldn't see
You havin' babies on the side while you still fuckin' wit me

Things was never right, forever fight that's what we would do
Then I saw the light my game was tight from runnin' wit you
You had me stressed out and thinkin' that its time that I quit
So I wouldn't leave, had me believe I wasn't worth shit

It's crazy, yo it amaze me, these afairs of the heart
I look back and realize it wasn't love from the start

[Chorus: x4]

[Sole']
How things can change, one day infatuated, washin' your drawls
Another day, it's screams and fightin' dishes breakin' on walls
Walk in relationship, I'm sane thinkin' that you were too
A year later, I'm fuckin' crazy, throwin' glasses at you

And scratchin' up yo car, I take it far, I'm cuttin' yo tires
Don't understand it, why my heart is steady playin' wit fire
I turned psychotic, you got it, in this sick relationship
I'm tryin' to run you off the road, you and that broke-down bitch

I'm too fly for that shit, I'm lookin' back in disgust
The nights I cried, the times you lied all blown away with a gust
Things I did for your love, they was never returned
Gave all the jewelry to my moms and then your pictures I burned

You can't turn no little boy into no grown ass man
So change yo game and get it tight, if that's your previous plan
Boots is made for walkin', finally learned what life was about
Pulled it together, grabbed my Gucci boots and stepped the fuck out

Only in love and war

Sometimes you're my general, you quarterback all these plays
Sometimes you're my enemy and I'm throwin' grenades
We'll just be chillin' and laughin', I'm layin' on your chest
Don't know what happened 'cause things just went left
But here we go back down that road
That's just the way that it goes

You know I'm comin' home right there where I belong
I'm takin' off this armor oh-oh-oh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh

And we could live with the mistake, tearing us apart everyday

Fight til there's nothing left not one single strand of the love we had
I wanna stay and fight for us
Fight like hell before I give up

And go about the days, put on the happy face

Please just survive baby
If you know where I stand, then, I'll be away
Cause it'll never be my choice baby

We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only in love and war

You know I'm comin' home right there where I belong
I'm takin' off this armor oh-oh-oh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh

Yeah but we're still here after the bomb drops

Everybody’s got a man but me
Again missin' you
Well it would be nice for once in my life
To get this love right this time of year right

I’ll be alone but you won’t find a better woman
And to tell the truth
She can have you

‘Cause I put up with enough
(She can have you)

With a bag of gifts that should be mine
‘Cause she ain’t put in the time,
Caught you in a bunch of lies
Tried and I tried and I sacrificed
Now here you are
Actin' like you so in love
But we broke up two weeks ago
‘Cause you wanna find yourself
But you’re here with her
So now I’m all alone

I’ll be alone but you won’t find a better woman
She can have you

‘Cause I put up with enough

Now we’ve been back and forth for a whole year now
And you say that by Christmas we can work it out
‘Cause who wants to be alone?
Who wants to play alone?
For someone who do you wrong
‘Cause I am worth it!

Ring ting tingle-ing too

And friends are calling ""You Hoo""

Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're gliding along with the song
Of a wintry fairy land
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two
Birds of a feather would be
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop! Pop! Pop!

Shut the eyes in the cupboard

Yo dudo que el tenga tanto amor

No vayas a decir mi nombre sin querer

Desesperada intentar llegar al fin

How high is the sky? what makes it so blue?

He's as golden as wheat dancing over the plain.
He looks like the star when the night's crystal clear,
He looks like a baby when mother is near.

His face is the moonlight reflected on snow,
His hair like garden where all flowers grow,
He's heavenly eyes are as true as the sea,
My son, that's what god really looks like.

What I think I already know
It's very clear that something's changed
That neither of us can ignore

There's something a little sweeter
In the way that we relate
Something in the way we linger
At the very kiss of it something in the way

You're keeping secrets from me
That's so much from yourself, keeping secrets
Oh, but this one's going to tell itself
You're guarding sweet dreams tightly
You turn around the truth, lie blindly
But it's in your eyes I can see that you're falling for me

It's up to no one else but you
Whatever you decide
The hardest part is giving up
The feelings you deny

It's what I see in you
Only a reflection of my own dreams
It's what I see in you
Only the heart and soul in me, well

You're keeping secrets from me
That's so much from yourself, keeping secrets
Oh, but this one's going to tell itself
You're guarding sweet dreams tightly
You turn around the truth, lie blindly
But it's in your eyes I can see that you're falling for me

We think that we are safe
There's an unspoken commitment
That love initiates, it doesn't matter how long we wait

So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.

Prieto azabache
Y cuando en ti me montaron 

Y prepararon, la ejecucución
Mi voz de mando esperaste 
Te abalanzaste sobre el pelotón
Con tres balazos de mauser
Corriste azabache, salvando mi vida
Lo que tu hiciste conmigo 
Caballo amigo no se me olvida
No pude salvar la tuya
Y la amargura me hace llorar
Por eso prie to aza bache
No he de olvidarte nunca jamás",Caballo Prieto Azabache,1990
Tambora,"Nació bajo de una higuera
Su madre fue yegua fina
Le llamaban La Catrina
A el potrillo el cantador

Era un potro con más brío
Que otro caballo cualquiera
Y como yo lo hice mío
Resultó muy corredor.

Era lindo mi caballo
Era mi amigo más fiel
Ligerito como el rayo
Era de muy buena ley.

Cuando era de falsa rienda
Daba ventaja a su madre
Muy pronto dejó a su padre
Con dos cuerpos le ganó.

Era de pelo retinto
Rosalbo como un lucero
Muy fachoso mitotero
Y lindo de corazón.

Era lindo mi caballo

Nació bajo una higuera
Y en el potrero quedó
Qué lástima que muriera

Por éso cuando el sol muere
Y la luna va a salir
Me voy hasta aquél potrero
Mis recuerdos a vivir

Vinieron a la carrera del relámpago 
Y el moro dos caballos de primera 

El moro de pedro frizby 
Era del pueblo de cumpas 
Muy bonito y muy ligero 
El relámpago era saíno 
Y era caballo de estima 
De su amo Rafael Romero 

Cuando paseaban al moro 
Se miraba tan bonito 
Y empezaron a apostar 
Toda la gente decía 
Que aquel caballo venia 
Especialmente a ganar 

Cheques, billetes y pesos 
Le sobraban al de cumpas 
El domingo en la mañana 
Por la tarde las apuestas 
Pasaban de cien mil pesos 
En esa Copacabana 

Frank y Jesus Valenzuela 
Casaron quince mil pesos 
Con el saíno de Romero 
Y dijo el Pullo Morales 
Se me hace que con el moro 
Nos ganan todo el dinero 

Andaba Trini ramirez 
Tambien chino valenzuela 
Paseando ya los caballos 
Dos corredores de faja 
Dos buscadores del triunfo 
Los dos eran buenos gallos 

Por fin dieron el sandiago 
Y el moro salio adelante 
Con la intensión de ganar 
Ramirez le tupió al saíno 
Y arriba del medio paste 
Dejaba al moro pa'tras

Como me hiere esa fecha
A don Lamberto Quintero
Lo seguía una camioneta
Iban con rumbo al Salado
No más a dar una vuelta

Pasaron el Carrizal
Iban tomando cerveza
Su compañero le dijo
Nos sigue una camioneta
Lamberto sonriendo dijo
Pa' que son las metralletas

Ya cerquita del Salado
Rugieron dos R-15
Ahí dejaron a un muerto
Enemigo de Lamberto
Quisieran que fuera cuento
Pero señores es cierto

Un hombre fuera de serie
Alegre y enamorado
Platicando con su novia
El estaba descuidado
Cuando unas balas certeras
La vida le arrebataron

Clínica Santa María
Tú vas a ser mi testigo
Dos días después de su muerte
Vuelven a sonar los tiros
Ahí quedaron diez hombres
Por esos mismos motivos

Puente que va a tierra blanca
Tú que lo viste pasar
Recuérdales que a Lamberto
Nunca se podrá olvidar
Yo por mi parte aseguro
Que hace falta en Culiacán

[Verse 1]
I had to listen to yo' mixtape, grttin my teeth
The last song on the tape, oh what a relief
The music sounded booty and as rigid as tin
So I took it out and put my own tape in
Now I'm happy as can be it's workin out so well
People said I couldn't do it on the mic without L
It's the year two-thou, niggaz soundin like hell
Put out independent singles, hopin my shit sells
Now back on the scene, I don't bother no one
I roll strictly with the Sqwad who let me do Tame 1
All my blackin out is over, it's time to have fun
I be smokin Isabella with this kid named John
Gettin blunted up in front of clubs in NYC
We went to this open mic event and got in free
Grabbin all the girlies booties, takin ecstasy
'cause I'm a wild north nigga and they don't stress me
Durban Dayer spit the vapor for some light ring smoke
And the club security was lookin all down my throat
Is it 'cause I'm Tame, and I'm always blunted?
Security ran down tellin me to gut it
It was the moment I feared..

[guard] Yo yo yo, you can't blaze up in here
[guard] Take it down five times George
[Tame1] This is the moment I feared
[guard] Yo don't make me take it from you
[guard] Put it out or get out muhfuckers

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Yo this is the deal, we only came for the girls
And for you takin my dutch, ain't no way in the world""
He said, ""Tame you know the game and how the NY change""
Kicked us out the club and had to go back home in the train
So I went to a buddha spot, yo we got us a nick'
So we smoked and we joked about some industry shit
Saw my money on the block with this chick named Brenda
I used to hit, but I acted like I couldn't remember
She shouted me out, but I really couldn't hear her
So I got a little bit closer just to hear a little clearer
She said, ""I'm lookin for Salem where I think they sell weed at""
I said, ""I know where that's at, 'cause it's around where I be at""
I gave her the information and she went on her way
I went home and took it down till almost two the next day
Someone's ringin my bell, I opened up word bond
It was Brenda half-naked with a edible thong
Tried to suit me and seduce me, and at first I wasn't wit it
Then she licked it and I hit it, then we did it, and we did it
She said it was great, she said she was glad that we done it
I walked her to the bus but money grip was on it
It was the moment I feared..

[money] Yo what is you doin wit ya hand all over my girl's ass duke?!
[Tame1] Easy, easy duke
[money] Easy? Yo what is you doin up here
[Tame1] Hold up hold up, take it up witcha girl
[money] I just KNOW y'all ain't get to fuck that lil' bitch!

[Verse 3]
While he was wylin out and blackin then he swung on me (word)
Then I pulled out the weapon then I silenced the hump
Then he was dead to the head, I took the cash and the Visa
She said, ""We gotta merk"" not wantin people to see us
We went up to the crib, she had some leak in the freezer
She said, ""We're rich! We're rich! We can have whatever would please us""
Now I don't fuck with nothin that ain't good for my health
So I put this boogers head out then I went for Delf'
Now I was rich, yes I was rich, I could have whatever would please me
Rock jewels in front of the haters that used to tease me
Pop me, spot me jumpin outta the truck
Kids be runnin up all screamin, ""Yo Tame whassup!!""
I guess I was too flossy, but I'm sorry to say
Because this copper ran up on me, tell ya make my day
I said, ""Relax brother"" but he had proof that I had done it
'cause he had poor Pervis' underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my ill lifestyle
'cause I was the main event on the TV for awhile
But now I'm in jail doin life, and it's beat
'cause everytime I take a shower niggaz tryna peek
It was the moment I feared..

[inmate] Yo whatchu got up under that towel nigga?
[Tame 1] Man, move ya fuckin hand man!
[inmate] Nigga, come here for a minute!

Tame Impala,"I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which was standard for me
Thursday, 12:30, I gotta pretty solid routine these days
I don't know it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rearview mirror, but in its reflection
Just for a second, I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories of what I had learned, stopped me in my tracks
Who was that? it was my lover, my lover, from a past life

From a past life (feel like I saw a ghost)
From a past life (not what I expected)
From a past life (it's transfixed)
From a past life

Well somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then, surreal
Poetic so I'd say, like a bizarre shape or a confusing image
But I shot it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells of of [?] together
A cheap solution to block out a friend, but it was real
It just feels like a past life

From a past life (crazy)
From a past life (Things look [?])
From a past life
In the long time

So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me, I thought I was moving on
But I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it suddenly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

From a past life
(I guess there's no harm in trying)
From a past life
From a past life
In the long time
From a past life
From a past life
From a past life

I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather
And I hope they slept together
Oh the less I know the better
The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see a child on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said it's not now or never
Waiting years we'll be together
I said better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change it's mind
I was doing fine without ya, 'til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Eating in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya, 'til I saw your eyes turn away from mine

Now I gotta add yours to my list of faces to try and not think about
Now I gotta tell 'em I don't care and hope that nobody might work it out
It was obviously an illusion 'cause there's never been so much I've been wrong about
And I don't want to spend all my days thinking of the one I can't live without
So I'm gonna have to add you to my list of people to try and forget about

Your name will fade out gradually

I'm gonna have to keep you on my list of people to try and forget about

Tame One,"[tame one]
Wait'll niggaz hear that tame and fatal got down and made it straight
From uptown with six sacks and this track that's in the background
Stop stressin from the chest up, we messed up
Off that best stuff that fits up in yo' dutch
Situation like this, you get blown to bits
Fuckin with this brick lyricist, more complex than the pyramids
Here it is, strictly biz like small print
In between them bong hits, we drop the strong shit
Chickenheads say, ""who him? "" with fucked up timb's
Knotty fro and baggy denims, spendin up the benjamins
In city tenaments, the boom skwadron odd man
Don't give a fuck like rodman (""what are you doing? "")
With no rings like patrick ewing (""what? "")
Still I play hard regardless
Acquitted from the charges throwin darts up at the heartless
Aimin for your brain, tame one, one of the darkest
Brown like the chocolate, poppin your metropolis

Chorus: fatal hussein

Around my way, all they do is shoot dice all day
Escapin secret indictments, gettin nice all day
Don't let em fold ya, outlawz, the getto star soldiers
Give this letter to the president, before this shit is over
(repeat 2x)

[fatal hussein]
When hussein aim, puttin they brains on walls like tame name
Blastin these motherfuckers cause they just can't maintain
Y'all plain jane's gel in the ? well's? county of sing-sing
Me and young noble, got em strung hold em for hostage
Lyrics verbally toxic, spit like doubled edged optics
My shit is milk, wearin silk shirts with chocolates
Y'all broke and can't cop shit, I get, physically fit
On some evil eye ready to die shit
This thug shit, niggaz get beat down and shot up
I saw this one nigga, get stolen on and your soul got up
Stolen car, roll past the bar, toured a lot of city
Gave him an eighth and he cooked his whole product
It's a shame how you cowards change the game for narcotic
You don't get it, don't got it, the love of money get exotic
If you old you get shot at, and can't walk the streets
Without gettin your lil' money hungry soft ass spot

Chorus

[fatal hussein]
We adapt to the system like ? eddie bap? on mission
Get an ounce of izm, two six-packs, and kid listen
Just a dip on the task, my little niggaz on the ave
Do a bid and laugh, come home and cop a half
Hit me with twenty hundred, what you got was fronted
Now run it, I got this fuckin drug spot where I want it
So don't be dissin new, when you ain't got shit to do
Five thousand dollars, charge free, right out municipal

[tame one]
Niggaz get played off to the left like they was southpaws
Toss you to the outlawz, then let them shoot it out
For what you clock for -- got more than you expected
When I inject correct shit, it gets hectic
Fuckin comin up with that next shit, thug niggaz and bugged niggaz
Luce? steel is tight, I'm straight up like midnight
We burn mics on turnpikes, we swervin through the lanes
We throw chains at bitches, it's back to new jeru to get these riches

[Verse 1]
I had to listen to yo' mixtape, grttin my teeth
The last song on the tape, oh what a relief
The music sounded booty and as rigid as tin
So I took it out and put my own tape in
Now I'm happy as can be it's workin out so well
People said I couldn't do it on the mic without L
It's the year two-thou, niggaz soundin like hell
Put out independent singles, hopin my shit sells
Now back on the scene, I don't bother no one
I roll strictly with the Sqwad who let me do Tame 1
All my blackin out is over, it's time to have fun
I be smokin Isabella with this kid named John
Gettin blunted up in front of clubs in NYC
We went to this open mic event and got in free
Grabbin all the girlies booties, takin ecstasy
'cause I'm a wild north nigga and they don't stress me
Durban Dayer spit the vapor for some light ring smoke
And the club security was lookin all down my throat
Is it 'cause I'm Tame, and I'm always blunted?
Security ran down tellin me to gut it
It was the moment I feared..

[guard] Yo yo yo, you can't blaze up in here
[guard] Take it down five times George
[Tame1] This is the moment I feared
[guard] Yo don't make me take it from you
[guard] Put it out or get out muhfuckers

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Yo this is the deal, we only came for the girls
And for you takin my dutch, ain't no way in the world""
He said, ""Tame you know the game and how the NY change""
Kicked us out the club and had to go back home in the train
So I went to a buddha spot, yo we got us a nick'
So we smoked and we joked about some industry shit
Saw my money on the block with this chick named Brenda
I used to hit, but I acted like I couldn't remember
She shouted me out, but I really couldn't hear her
So I got a little bit closer just to hear a little clearer
She said, ""I'm lookin for Salem where I think they sell weed at""
I said, ""I know where that's at, 'cause it's around where I be at""
I gave her the information and she went on her way
I went home and took it down till almost two the next day
Someone's ringin my bell, I opened up word bond
It was Brenda half-naked with a edible thong
Tried to suit me and seduce me, and at first I wasn't wit it
Then she licked it and I hit it, then we did it, and we did it
She said it was great, she said she was glad that we done it
I walked her to the bus but money grip was on it
It was the moment I feared..

[money] Yo what is you doin wit ya hand all over my girl's ass duke?!
[Tame1] Easy, easy duke
[money] Easy? Yo what is you doin up here
[Tame1] Hold up hold up, take it up witcha girl
[money] I just KNOW y'all ain't get to fuck that lil' bitch!

While he was wylin out and blackin then he swung on me (word)
Then I pulled out the weapon then I silenced the hump
Then he was dead to the head, I took the cash and the Visa
She said, ""We gotta merk"" not wantin people to see us
We went up to the crib, she had some leak in the freezer
She said, ""We're rich! We're rich! We can have whatever would please us""
Now I don't fuck with nothin that ain't good for my health
So I put this boogers head out then I went for Delf'
Now I was rich, yes I was rich, I could have whatever would please me
Rock jewels in front of the haters that used to tease me
Pop me, spot me jumpin outta the truck
Kids be runnin up all screamin, ""Yo Tame whassup!!""
I guess I was too flossy, but I'm sorry to say
Because this copper ran up on me, tell ya make my day
I said, ""Relax brother"" but he had proof that I had done it
'cause he had poor Pervis' underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my ill lifestyle
'cause I was the main event on the TV for awhile
But now I'm in jail doin life, and it's beat
'cause everytime I take a shower niggaz tryna peek

By your sweet face, the style and grace

Down the path along side the lake
A tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake
His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew
""Poor thing,"" she cried, ""I'll take you in and I'll take care of you""
""Take me in tender woman
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in, tender woman,"" sighed the snake

She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk
And laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk
She hurried home from work  that night and soon as she arrived
She found that pretty snake she'd taken to had been revived
""Take me in, tender woman
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in, tender woman,"" sighed the snake

She clutched him to her bosom, ""You're so beautiful,"" she cried
""But if I hadn't brought you in by now you might have died""
She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed and held him tight
Instead of saying thanks, the snake gave her a vicious bite
""Take me in, tender woman
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in, tender woman,"" sighed the snake
""I saved you,"" cried the woman
""And you've bitten me, but why?

Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I feel so unsure
As you take my hand and lead me to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all it's sad goodbye

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
I know it's easy to pretend
I know you're your not a fool

Should have known better than to cheat a friend
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend

I know you're your not a fool

Should have known better than to cheat a friend
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you, oh
The way I dance with you

Ooh, tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
I know it's easy to pretend
I know you're your not a fool

Should have known better than to cheat a friend (I should have known better)
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you, oh

The way I danced with you
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Why'd you have to leave me alone
I'm never gonna dance
That way again
With nobody else
I can only dance like that with you, huh",Careless Whisper,1998

Until now, feeling this way won't do
I'm ready to give all of me

Will he say the things he needs to say?
Or touch me in a certain way?
I told myself just to be strong
One day the man will come along, so

What will I do?
Where will I go?
When it's my turn
How will I know that you're the mea I'm dreaming of?
I hope this time it's love

Showed me there's someone besides myself
That I can depend on

You touched me in that special way
Said all the things a man should say

Tamia,"Oh yeah, oh

You had just walked in from work
And there's a letter in the kitchen with your name on it
Inside, you will find an
Answer for each question you had
You had to know the day would come
That I'd find out that you are a liar
And a player, and the list goes on
So it hurts you now
But it would hurt even more if I stayed, so

Hope that you can understand
That you were once my man
But it's time to move on
Since you're playing games, oh

Chorus 
You thought the day would never come
Never ever thought that you
Would be reading Dear John
You be sure to read each line
Line by line, and take your time
You thought the day would never come
Never ever thought that you
Would be reading Dear John
By the time you read this letter
I'll be feeling much better
So long, it means I'm gone

Guess that you are wondering
How did she know that I
Was the type to play you
If you read, you'll find out

I have to end it
Bet I was right from the start
And I never took the time to ask myself
Why, oh, why would you waste your time
On a nigga in the club with a group of thugs
You shoulda known it was on
When I kept callin' your job
And they said that you were sick
So I paged you, don't get no call back
Now it all makes sense

The two of us are not meant to be
So by the time you read this letter
And try to make things better
Save your lines
But read each one of mine

Wish you'd see your game was not
Strong enough to keep me holding on
You be strong, time for me to go 'cause

Chorus x2

I wish I could see the look on your face
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
And you wish you could just see my face
No no no, no no no
You thought I was playin' when I said you had
One more time, one more time
But if you can play this game
Then I can play it too, 'cause...

Tamia,"I sat outside your house today
Just thinkin' you'll never learn
It's like the time I packed your things
And dropped 'em off where you were
I know you love to wash your car
So I left it in the lake
They say the strongest part of love is called hate

(do you feel like I should)
Sit around with your touch
And your smell on my couch
And your hair in my brush
I loved you too much

Get it on, I'll be gone

That someone loves me the same way

This time I just don't know

I knew I heard it in your voice
Something was wrong with our date
I feel I didn't have the choice
My heart was not in the way
Found out that I'm up in the cut
Some chick was wearing my face
You're lucky I'm in a good mood
Or she'll lay

Do you know how it feels
Sittin' 'round, smellin' sheets
Feelin' down, watchin' heat
But my friends where you been
I'm with her again

To rock the fool in my house
I put you out, you come back in

'Cause he wouldn't touch me like dat
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me and he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced, there's a stranger in my house

Tamia,"If you're sitting down
Time to get up
Sippin' on something
Drink it up, Hit the floor
And rock your body
Wil'out 'cause its a party HEY!

I saw you for the first time
When you were walking on to th block
You had a fine throw-back, timberlands to match
And now I don't see you no-more
And I'm tryin to find out where you at
'cause you would look so much better next to me
OHH-wait you sexy baby come back this way

[CHORUS x2]
And now I know I'm looking good and no need to frontin'
All eyes on me
I must be working somethin'
'Bout to hit the floor so tell me who want it
You looking at me so won't you come & get it?
Playa's what's crackin
I'm asking who's dancin' with me tonight? 
UHH DJ don't stop playin my song!

[CHORUS x2]
I'm hot but I don't get sweat on my hair
It's still gettin atcha
Girls roll with me, but I can't find 'em
Gimme a second & let me locate 'em
Tell me watcha doin after we close 
We're going where everyone goes
On the west is hot spot, and the east is the copshop, south the waffle house
Baby come dance with me!

I gotta escape this poverty, I gotta find a new reality,

I recognize there is a sudden change
I notice you haven't been calling me

And even when I say, I love you
I notice there has been a slight pause

Please tell me what do you think it could be.
Headache, tired, or cheating on me?

Please answer questions from one, two, three.
Do you love me? Lost Interest? Is he cheatin'?
Oh ladies help me out.
Do you love me? Lost Interest? Is he cheatin'?
Said I'm tired of all these ups and downs
Do you love me? Lost interest? Is he cheatin'?
Fellas tell me what you're thinking
Do you love me? Lost interest? Is he cheatin'?
Here's the reason why I ask these things

I was giving him the best of me
But my best stopped being good enough
I'm telling you I will do anything
Talk about a woman who loves tough
and now he's coming home real, real late
I let him know its starting to bother me
He never once even touched his plate
and no response he just went to sleep.

Used to take me shopping all the time
Used to go club hoppin' all the time
Where you were I would be all the time
Now all you do is leave me (behind boy)

Sometimes I sit at home
By the phone hoping he might call me
But he don't call me
But then I realize
Dreams come true aren't for girls like me
Not like me
And so I go around with my head up
Like it ain't no thing
And when the boys around with all my friends
I'm into other things
Because you never let them see you sweat
Don't want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord knows it's killing me

So I put on my make-up
Put a smile on my face
And if anyone asks me
Everything is okay
I'm laughing cause no one
Knows the joke is on me
Cause I'm dying inside 
With my pride and a smile
On my face

It's not an easy (thing)
Sometimes it's hard to (face the truth)
It's not the life that I would choose (that I would choose)
But what else can I do?
If he don't love me
If he don't want me
I'm not about to sit around
Let myself go

That great of a friend to me, lately.

Because I know myself and I will change my mind 
And want to love again 

I really wish we were made to be 
Happy with our love in our life.

Over being happy, happy

I cannot live without love

Tamia,"Love was the former owner
But quiet is renting our house
It ceases my lips from speaking
But forms a sarcastic smile
Suspense now raised one of your eyebrows
You asked me if there's someone else
I replied, ""yes, hell yes""

You asked if it's another man; I said (no)
You laughed and say, ""Is it a woman?"" I say (yes)
Surprisingly you ask me for her name

And her name is me
And she loves me more than you'll ever know
And I finally see that
Loving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all
So patiently
She's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love
And to choose between you two
Boy, you know if I have to choose, I choose me

And she told me to tell you to never to hurt me again
'Cause if you haven't heard, she's a bad chick
Even though I haven't been
Yet and still you try and test me by raising an angry hand
Put it down, put it down

I'm leaving; don't try and stop me (no)
I'm late, and she is waiting (yes)
My love for me is to much, so I can't stay

And her name is me
And she loves me more than you'll ever know
And I finally see that
Loving you and loving me just don't seem to work at all
So patiently
She's waiting on me to tell you that she needs love
And to choose between you two
Boy, you know if I have to choose, I choose me

'Cause she's actually forming a threesome
And I'm happy that I can join them
Their names are me, myself, and I

And the name is me
She loves me more than you'll ever know

She was beautiful inside and out 
How could he just let her go
He had girls on the side and he tried to hide
But somehow she knew
Still she stayed

but she would always cry every night
But then he noticed a change

She has a new plan
She preparing for somethin new something that doesn't include you
When a woman cease to cry 
She's already to say goodbye

when you stay out late
She don't call to ask where you are
(where you at?)
She just gives you this look when you come home that says
You betta watch yo back

That she's all cried out
You'd better pray
That she's stay 

if she no longer crys every night
If she doesn't comlain any more

when a woman stops cryin

She has a new plan
She preparing for somethin new something that doesn't include you
When a woman cease to cry

just as long as she is arguin
Fussin & complainin
As long as she will cry sometimes
Everything is all right
Oh but as soon as she is quiet
When you mess up she's silent

I'd like to help you with a suitcase or two

locked your love away from me.

you turned and you walked just one way.
Spoken:  You stripped me of my dreams, 
you gave me faith, then took my hope, look at me now.
 
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
And you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep.

But you're not there

Without anything else 
And you give so much 
That you lose yourself

When's the last time that you, 
Said that you care?
Just a simple thing like that.
Did you forget and just freeze over?
Rewind; back when,
We first met, you were such an emotional man.
What happened to that?
So sure, Id be always there,
You somehow, Let the feeling drift away..

But this heart, this mind
Needs to be a little more, Tender. Tender..
Love's not remote control, I,
Need to get treated a little more, Tender. Tender..

I'm kind of numb; feel nothing,
But I'm beautiful, 
Can't you give back something?
Anything, at all?
I'm still here, I'm waiting,
For you to notice, and remember.

At times I dread my now and envy where I've been.
Cause that's when quiet wisdom takes control
At least I've got a story no ones told

I learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe (the good)
Cause although we like, to know what lifes got planned
No one knows if shootings stars will land

These days it feels naive to put your faith in hope.
To imitate a child, fall backwards on the snow
Cause that's when fears will usually lead you blind
Now i try to under analyse

Whatever will be, will be

The good, the bad and breathe (the good)
Cause although we like, to know what lifes got planned
No one knows if shootings stars will land

Is the rope I walk wearing thin?
Is the life I love caving in?
Is the rain on your mind
A heavy black bird caged inside.

Say, Whatever will be, will be
Take, the good the bad just breathe

'Cause although,(yeah) we like, to know what lifes got planned,
No one knows if shooting stars will land

Tammin,"I trembled in your presence 
I was lost the very minute 
That you came my way 
There was no escape 

I pictured us together 
But you told me you weren't ready 
Said it's much too soon 
That's a year ago 

You asked me to be patient 
So I told myself that I could wait 
And time went by 
Somehow it's different now 

So if you start to make regrets 
It's a little late 

All that you've been wishing for 
Was right in your hands 
But you covered your eyes 
When you could have seen through its disguise 
You didn't realize 
All that you've been wishing for 
Was not out of reach 
You discovered as I walked away 
You complained 
But it won't bring me back 
Can't you see that 
It's a little late 

Everything's the opposite 
Of what it used to be 
I guess and now you know 
What I was going through 

You are counting days apart 
But can't find one way to win back 
My heart but babe 
What is it they say 

Good things come to those who wait 
Not if you only hesitate 
Like you in doubt 
So your time ran out 

So if you start to make regrets 
It's a little late 

All that you've been wishing for 
Was right in your hands 
But you covered your eyes 
When you could have seen through its disguise 
You didn't realize 
All that you've been wishing for 
Was not out of reach 
You discovered as I walked away 
You complained 
But it won't bring me back

Tammin,"She never had a break 
He was always running late 
Did she push too hard 
Didn't mean to go that far 

He never had no faith 
Spent his whole life in the shade 
He was never satisfied 
He had a different frame of mind 

She said 
I want you for my own 
I never see you anymore 
You're always walking out that door 

He said 
I want some time alone 
So don't wait 
I'm not coming home 

It's just an ordinary day? 

Maybe it wasn't meant to be 
I guess they didn't even see 
Is this love to hard to mend 
Is this where the story ends 

Just another story told 
As I watch it all unfold 
It's another day of life 
But it's gonna be alright 

She said 
I want you for my own 
I never see you anymore 
You're always walking out that door

This place, ain't where, I thought Id be,
I'm trapped in.
I need fresh air. 
When's the last time that you, 
Said that you care?
Just a simple thing like that.
Did you forget and just freeze over?
Rewind; back when,
We first met, you were such an emotional man.
What happened to that?
So sure, Id be always there,
You somehow, Let the feeling drift away..

[Chorus]
But this heart, this mind
Needs to be a little more, Tender. Tender..
Love's not remote control, I,
Need to get treated a little more, Tender. Tender..

[Verse 2]
You're caught up, consumed,
I'm kind of numb; feel nothing,
But I'm beautiful, 
Can't you give back something?
Anything, at all?
I'm still here, I'm waiting,
For you to notice, and remember.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't complicate it baby,
'cause I ain't asking for much,
Just for you to,
Leave me breathless and move me,

Ohh no!
I need a little more.. Now!

At times I dread my now and envy where I've been.
Cause that's when quiet wisdom takes control
At least I've got a story no ones told

Whatever will be, will be
I learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe (the good)
Cause although we like, to know what lifes got planned
No one knows if shootings stars will land

These days it feels naive to put your faith in hope.
To imitate a child, fall backwards on the snow
Cause that's when fears will usually lead you blind
Now i try to under analyse

I finally learned to say

Whatever will be, will be
I learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe (the good)
Cause although we like, to know what lifes got planned
No one knows if shootings stars will land

Is the rope I walk wearing thin?
Is the life I love caving in?
Is the rain on your mind
A heavy black bird caged inside.

Say, Whatever will be, will be
Take, the good the bad just breathe

'Cause although,(yeah) we like, to know what lifes got planned,
No one knows if shooting stars will land

Are you afraid what I might see
If you should look at me.
Now, tell me about her, if you can

If you can look me in the eye and say we're over
If you can kiss my lips and feel no fire inside
If you can hold me body close and still say you love her most
Then you can walk out of my life, if you can.

Everyone makes mistakes; tell me she's the one you made
And I'll forgive, and I'll forget, if you can.
Who was right and who was wrong
Doesn't matter if the love is gone.
Honey, I'll keep holding on, if you can.

If you can look me in the eye and say we're over
If you can kiss my lips and feel no fire inside
If you can hold me body close and still say you love her most

And there was a time

All the way down to Alabama, 
Said he had a job down there. 
But we were gonna drive just a little bit further and get a room somewhere.
We drove past little white houses, 
With porch swings and there was always someone else's kids in the yard, 
And I remember sayin', hey wouldn't it be nice if we could live that way, 
And he was always sayin' we were gonna, but sometimes you should listen to your mama, Cause someday, some boy is gonna tell ya 
How he'll treat you like a princess, 
But sometimes they're just little white lies with picket fences. 
Well I spent most of that year waitin' tables
Cause Billy's job well it didn't work out 
And one night he took the cash in the kitchen 
And he cut clean out of town 
Now I'm looking out the window of this run down apartment,

With big wings and Barbie dolls

On a trampoline in their backyard

And a simple bouquet
Arrived at the church 
On her wedding day

The bridesmaids gather 'round her
Last details done
But a dozen red roses
Who could they be from

The moment was close now
The church filled with light
She stood like a picture
In a glow of white.
All her friends awaiting
The music softly playing
Yet, she reached for the roses
On the table where they lay.

Then from the roses
She picked up an envelope
Her hand was guided by her heart
And for every rose
A single teardrop fell
As she lifted her veil and slowly read the card:

""You're in your room sleeping
As I write these words
I know you won't read them 
Till years from now""

""God will call me home soon
I'll miss you're wedding day,
So your mom will keep
This note to send
With a rose bouquet""

And I'll be beside you,

Finding another world.

But I can break a fella down like sex
You eat Wheat Chex but still light in the ass and can't flex
If one nigga front I'mma make more pay
Cause tonight, we gettin off like O.J
And yo I got a Dawg that bites, fuck the barking
Yo I got a crew with the beats and the smarts and

I fought my shit up on Linden in the one-nine-two
Forever writing never biting ain't shit else to do
Hoping to battle, but most MC's ain't ready yet
But if they utter one word then it's as good as set
You have MC's dropping bombs that's incredible
Some of the brothers, their styles are just despicable
As for me see I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag along
The freaking fame, someone tell em that this shit ain't games
You gots to do this from your heart meaning your inner soul
And if it's real only then will you be on a roll
I try to stay on top my game there ain't no time to lose
Four albums deep as a Quester but still we payin' dues
So hear me out one time, you gots to be yourself
Cause if you ain't yourself you end up by your freaking self
I'm coming rugged with the Linden Boule type of slang
And yo, we'll see who can hang yo

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

It's alright, it's okay
To put your hands together and praise the Lord in this way
It's okay, it's alright
To lift your voice in this place and get down tonight

Available without a cable or a satellite dish

A reconciled generation to the Rock we've missed

With some promise made of gold
That for you my door stays open

And it's knowing we're not shacked by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks
And I'd be planted on some column now that binds us
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When I'm driftin' through the market place and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and you were gone

I still might walk for hours tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you moving on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

The shadows freak in the autumn winds
That make me draw inside myself in silence
Cross legged night I sit and watch
The endless chase of leaves across my yard

And layin' down my hair brush
I lean back within my window seat and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind

But that it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big

That I'd been all alone and cryin'
Over some sad and lonely late, late show.

And honey, I miss you too
And I know you're being good
And I'd love to be with you

I wrecked the car and I was sad
And so afraid that you'd be mad, but what the heck
All afternoon you stormed around
But I knew how to cool you down, I hugged your neck.

You came home unexpectedly
And caught me crying needlessly in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing, I went away.

And I know you're being good
And I'd love to be with you

One day you were not at home
While I was there and all alone, the angels came
Guess you thought it strange of me
To leave the way I did that day, it was a shame.

And even though you miss me hon, you must go on
And when the snow fly passes overhead
And cries down on my flower bed.
You know you're not alone.

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
 
Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a guy with a drink in his hand. 
He had bay blue eyes, coal black hair 
And a smile that a girl understands. 
Then he came and sat down at my table,
And as he placed his hands over mine,
I found my self wanting to kiss him 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and he whispered, ""I need you!""
""Let me take you away and be your man.""
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.",Almost Persuaded,1969

And it's a shame that neon lights will make a man lay out all night
With a girl in a bar down the street

You never meant to be that man but last night you held another's hand
Though her kisses tasted sweet that's not what made you cheat
So I'll try and explain it if I can

Where where where could you go oh when you needed love I wasn't there
And her two open arms offered love sweet and warm
Where could you go but to her

I'll forgive your one mistake if you swear it's the last you'll ever make
I let those arms you need the most take you back and hold you close
For loving you is a habit I can't break

Where will you go you'll come home

Won't you beckon to our lonely Christmas call?
You left a year ago this Christmas and we're wondering if you miss us.
Don't know why you up and left and went away.
The kids are lonely here without you, even wrote old Santa about you.
Please don't leave them all alone this Christmas day.
Don't you miss their arms around you? Do their memories surround you?
Don't you know it's not their fault things are this way?
Why not show consideration to the ones whose heart you're breaking?
Give them your gift of love this Christmas day.
If you could see their little faces, as round the tree they take their places,
They're looking for the biggest gift of all.
So why not show consideration to the ones whose heart you're breaking?
Won't you beckon to our lonely Christmas call?

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love

Mommy I love you and all of my toys 
But I want a daddy like the other girls and boys
Then she gave me her pennies her nickels and dimes

And as usual his mommy was gone
So he came over this morning and sat down next to me
And asked why does mommy leave me alone.

And why a woman needs arms to hold her tight
And that she would stay at home and not leave him all alone
If his daddy didn't stay away at night.

He said I wish I had a mommy like you just like you
To hold me in her arms the way you do
When I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And I ask for a mommy like you.

Though a tear fell from his eye he was trying not to cry
I said don't worry everything will be all right
So you just wait and see and I held him close to me
Just like I held his daddy last night.

I could tell by the sunshine on your face
I know he bought you pretty things
I know he made your world a happy place

And I remember when she loved you
And in those days you had someone to care
And through your long and lonely nights
When you needed someone, she was there

Ah, but lately you're not smiling
And I don't see that sunshine like before
I know you've tried to make it work
But I don't think he loves you any more

And I know she must have hurt you
'Cause I've seen the tears, you try so hard to hide
But if we had each other
It might just stop this hurt we have inside

Change to me and keep the change
And I won't do you like he did
And I won't hurt you, like she did

And we'll never need another
Once we have each other

Save all the secret things you did and tell me when I get to town
And on your graduation I wanted pictures to look back on
But then I wasn't there to take them, as usual I was gone

You cooked biscuits and ham
And you called it to me how good it was 'cause I was out of town

And at the party for fathers and daughters, well, I know you felt out of place
And even the pretty dress I bought couldn't fill that empty space
And the time when you got sick and the doctors turned you down

And Tina, you're such a pretty girl with big almond eyes, brown

And you've heard almost every nursery rhyme
So, tonight before you go to sleep
And pray the Lord your soul to keep
Here's Mommy's favorite story one more time.

Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
With the softest golden curls you've ever seen.

But then one day, he met this pretty lady
And she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your Mommy sad
'Cause, oh, what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far a way. 

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive Mommy if she cries.

Then it came to pass, the King grew lonely
And the pretty lady wasn't all she seemed
He realized that he was wrong
And started his long journey home
For he misses little Princess and his Queen.

Then he was back and safe inside his castle
And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain
Then the castle rang with laughter
They lived happy ever after
Knowin' he would never leave again

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes

And I took you in

To live

Tammy Wynette,"Oh Lord, you know that I'm not one to bother you with little things
And you and I have never been too close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched you with doin' things
And tried to understand you more than most

No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshiped you
While even your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way you go about the things you do

I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, you could have saved

But I believe that in your eyes this little child was something special 
And you wanted it to be with you, no doubt
So with out-stretched arms you beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way you worked it out

Once I saw a young man growin' till he neared the age of knowing
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at your way of bein' kind

They tried everything in vain and I was there when they explained it 
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess you looked into the future, watched him turn his back upon you
Lovin' him so much you couldn't take the chance

It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why you've never given up on me
You understood when some denied you and even when they crucified you

Saint or sinner calls and always finds him there.
Though it makes him sad to see the way we live,
He'll always say, ""I forgive.""

I guess some souls get restless under the skin
There's a shortage by half of marrying men
You know that I love you but I love to be free
So tell me what do you want, yeah from a gypsy like me

I need a ring on my finger, champagne on ice
One man to show me the best part of life
Is that what you want
Yeah, that's what I need

A home and a family makes sense for us
A solid foundation built out of trust
Do you think you can find that with someone like me
Two arms to hold you, one place to be
Are just some of the things that a woman needs

I've been shortchanged and cheated so many times
But you're all that I've wanted For all of my life
I've searched for the reasons, known how I've felt
But what can I give you when I can't trust myself",A Woman's Needs,1993
Tammy Wynette,"I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night
Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven
And just as I arrived the old curtain lifted
And there on stage stood who else but Roy Acuff and Tex Ritter
They said well how you doing come on in here
I know there's some folks you want to see
Over there's our newest member your old friend Conway Twitty say Hello Darlin'
And there's gentlemen Jim Reeves singin' with heaven's choir
Roger Miller he just got here he's making everybody laugh
Course you know Roy Orbison can sing just as high as anybody here
And Ernest Tubb can sing as low
And Patsy Cline well bet she's the best singin' angel here
And Dottie West is probably the prettiest
There's the old pea-picker Ernie Ford
Jimmy Rodgers George Morgan Hank Williams 
And the wandering boy Web Pierce
The old honky tonker himself Lefty Frizzell
My goodness what a group
Would you just listen to Mother Mabel
Over there pickin' the Wildwood Flower with the angel band
You know I personally think she's just about God's favorite
And Marty Robbins well he's still gettin' more encores than anybody else up here
Just like he used to down on earth 
Yeah well there's Elvis they still call him the King
But we know they're not talking about the real king up here
I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven oh what a star studded night
Then I ask Roy and Tex I said well who do you think will be showin' up
Say within the next 40 50 60 years
They handed me a big tallybook and in it I saw names like Johnny Cash
George Jones Merle Haggard Don Gibson Mel Tillis Farren Young Kitty Wells 
Some of the newer ones like Vince Gill and Garth Brooks 
Course they talked about Minnie Pearl the Judds Tanya Tucker Reba McEntire Hank Jr
Oh of course Buck Owens Roy Rodgers Gene Autry Randy Travis and Willie Nelson 
There's old Chet
I said well where's Porter Wagoner's name oh there it is
And then there was Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton
Oooh that's when I woke up
I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night",I Dreamed of a Hillbilly Heaven,1993
Tammy Wynette,"I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you'll find heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You stole her love from me one day
You didn't care, oh, it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be.
You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.",I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know,1993
Tammy Wynette,"Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk through
Turn away from me, darling
I'm begging you to
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you
I belong to another
Whose arms have grown cold
But i promised forever
To have and to hold
I can never be free, dear
But when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing
The will to be true

Please help me, I'm falling
And that would be sin
Close the door to temptation
don't let me walk in
For i mustn't want you
But, darling, i do
Please help me, I'm falling
In love with you",Please Help Me I'm Falling (In Love with You),1993
Tammy Wynette,"When troubles surround us, when evils come 
The body grows weak 
The spirit grows numb 
When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us 
He sends us His love 

On the wings of a snow-white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above 
On the wings of a dove 

When Jesus went down through the river that day 
Well, he was baptized in the usual way 
And when it was done 
God blessed His son 
He sent him His love 
On the wings of a dove 

On the wings of a snow-white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above 
On the wings of a dove 

On the wings of a snow-white dove 
He sends His pure sweet love 
A sign from above 
On the wings of a dove",Wings of a Dove,1993
