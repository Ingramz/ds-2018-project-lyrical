Carpenters,"A good-bye Joe, you gotta go, me oh my oh
He gotta go-pole the pirogue down the bayou
His Yvonne the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'
A kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dressed in style they go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya, crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
For tonight, I'm-a gonna see my ma cher a mi-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Settle down far from town, get him a pirogue
And he'll catch all the fish in the bayou
Swap his mon to buy Yvonne what she need-o
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Jambalaya, crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
For tonight, I'm-a gonna see my ma cher a mi-o

Carpenters,"Maybe it's you
Maybe it's me
Maybe it's just the constant rhythm of the sea
Maybe it's just that I've never been
The kind who can pass a lucky penny by
Maybe it's wise
Maybe it's not
Maybe it's you who brought the caring I'd forgot
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way
That you smile whenever I'm around
Rising on the shore
The ocean came
Walks along the waves of velveteen
His only thought
Was love for me
Couldn't we stay?
Or must we go
Couldn't we stay?
And watch the splashing rock we throw
Only a fool would want to leave this paradise
That I find whenever you're around
Only a fool
Isn't it nice to talk about the special way
That you smile whenever I'm around
Rising on the shore

Ever had a love as sweet as my love

For nowhere in the world

Making each other cry

Hurting each other

Without ever knowing why


Closer than the leaves

On a weepin' willow baby we are

Closer dear are we

Than the simple letters a and b are

Over you

'Cause baby it's you

You should hear what they say about you
They say you've never
Never, never been true

Why don't you come to your senses
You been out ridin' fences
For so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you
If she's able
The queen of hearts
Is always your best bet

Now it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones
That you can't get

Desperado
Oh you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger
They're drivin' you home

Freedom, Ah freedom
That's just some people talkin'
You're prisoners walkin'
Through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time
From the day

You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences
Open the gate

It may be rainin'
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late",Desperado,

Eve I can't believe

That you could mean

What you just said

How very far you are from being real



Look into the mirror

Nothing there to see

Eve I can't believe

You'd really leave him



(*) Notice how her image saddens

How lonely she's become

Just once I'd like to see her happy

Before the winter comes



Eve, I wouldn't lie

The open sky is not your home

Wide as it may be

Reality is here among the stones



Thorns among the roses

Add to what is real

Eve, you are a rose

Among the thorns here

",Eve,
Carpenters,"When I was younger do much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone I'm not so self-assured
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the door

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please?
(Please help me, please help me)

And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
And every now and then I feel so insecure
(Every now and then so insecure)

I know my dream is comin' true

Just one touch and then it happens every time
And there I go I just fall in love again, and when I do
Can't help myself, I fall in love with you

Magic, it must be magic

Easy, for you to take me to a star

Carpenters,"To say I'm romantic would be quite semantically true
But make-believe passion has fallen from fashion's milieu
It's understandable why we're a little confused
It's asking for trouble just watching the six o'clock news
But for a moment, all things aside, look to yourself somewhere inside

Look yo your dreams
Don't they still seem worthwhile?
Don't they still seem in style?
Aren't you glad they're still there?

Look to your dreams
There's a need for them now
When the world has us down
Aren't you glad they're around?

And like a seed, visions need constant care like a child would, we should

We can still break the bars
We have built here on earth

[Chorus 2]
Look to your dreams

The future may say
Blame blind yesterday for taking dreams away

Leave your sadness behind

Now that I have your hand to hold
The winds might blow through me

There's no harm in thunder if you are there

And now, now when we touch
My feelings slide
Now when I'm smiling, I know why
You light up my world like the morning sun
You're so deep within me we're almost one
And now all the feelings that I have start to fade
I was always afraid life might forget me
Love might let me down
Then look who I found

(The winds might blow through me, but I don't care
There's no harm in thunder if you are there)

And now, now when I wake, there's someone home

Without somebody else
Someone like you make it easy to give

I could find a way
To leave the past behind

Carpenters,"Getting away from all the things that need doing

Lazily here to lose the afternoon

Lying around here on the ground

It's as close to getting up as I can go



Taking a chance to free myself from my worries

Cover them well enough and no one sees

Nobody knows until they show

And the only thing to do is try to cover them again



(*) Hurry yourself, what's the use?

Mountains of wealth, I refuse

To be somebody's slave for a dime

I've got plenty of mountains

I'm lookin' to find, spending my time



Lying around, here on the ground

It's as close to getting up as I can go

Pleasing myself is all that really needs doing

Everything else begins but never ends

That a man is better off

If he has come to realize

I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

Well, there's two sides to every creation

You and me babe, we're no revelation

Well, there's darkness in our light, and there's wrong in our right

There's sorry babe, I'm workin' late tonight



Well, there's two sides, there's another side of me

There's the one you think you live with, the one you never see

It's never really lived, but it's never really died

It's never really made it but it's tried



Well, there's two sides to every conversation

But with you babe, that's no consolation

Silence is golden, let me put you on hold

Danglin' on your love line, baby, it's growin' old



Well, I don't know how to say it

Cause I never thought I could

God know I've tried so many times





But there's two sides, there's another side of me

There's the one you think you live with, the one you never see

It's never really lived, but it's never really died

It's never really made it, but it's tried



To every creation

We're no revelation

One sees the wrong, and one sees the right

The other side of me just caught a flight

In the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie

And so it continued both day and night.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting Light;

I seem to lean on old familiar ways

And I ain't no fool for love songs

That whisper in my ears

Longing my life away

I'll never worry

Why should I?

It's all gonna fade

And I watch the cars

I fear I'll do some damage one fine day

But I would not be convicted by a jury of my peers

Is she coming round for me once again, around or was that just the end
I just hope she's coming round again
I've been keeping myself busy with my books and with my tapes
Every day's much better since I've slowed my drinking pace
There's no swimming in the bottle it's just someplace we all drown
I lost myself in sorrow lost my confidence in doubt
Is she coming 'round for me once again, around or was that just the end
I just hope she's coming round again
Get in the car and drive through town
Down the block and back around
Pretending that she's there with me we drive
Gone forever
My patience keeps me plaintive my high hopes keep me alone
My lover's will is shaken I wish she would just come home

Where dancing clowns with tassels made of fur

Welcome her into their world

She's guarded by a brave tin soldier

Sitting on her shoulder

It's just impossible
It's impossible
Ask a baby not to cry

Get only just begun

In the daylight it dies

And he can't go on trying to live a lie

And when he cries, I know it's over

But I may never know why



There's no face in the locket

There's no place for the past

I'll put it back in my pocket

It was never meant to last

It's just gone



Repeat (*)



There's no word for the sadness

There's no poetry in the pain

There's no color in the stain where the tears have fallen

It's gone, it's just gone



It's gone, it's just gone

Well, it's gone

Carpenters,"Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say and as we go from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow for all we know

Carpenters,"The hardest thing I've ever done
Is keep believing
There's someone in this crazy world for me
The way that people come and go
Through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know

I used to say, no promises
Let's keep it simple
But freedom only helps you say goodbye
It took a while for me to learn
That nothin' comes for free
The price I've paid is high enough for me

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
But none of them will comfort me tonight
I'm wide awake at four a.m.
Without a friend in sight
Hanging on a hope, but I'm alright

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

Carpenters,"Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Carpenters,"Day after day, I must face a world of strangers
Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care, you're always there

When there's no gettin' over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

So many times when the city seems to be
Without a friendly face, a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile

When there's no gettin' over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

Touch me and I end up singing
Trouble seems to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near
When you're near, my love

If all my friends have forgotten half their promises they're not unkind
Just hard to find
One look at you and I know
That I couldn't learn to live without the rest
I've found the best

When there's no gettin' over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

When there's no gettin' over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true

Carpenters,"When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile

Those were such happy times and not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's, so fine

When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry, just like before
It's yesterday once more

Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad, so much has changed.

It was songs of love that I would sing to then
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine

All my best memories come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry, just like before
It's yesterday once more

Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine

Things ain't right between us 
Not the way that used to be the love

Sometimes a love goes wrong 
Just when you think you got it

Why couldn't it remain the same

A vision once when you were young?
Does the circle lead you back,

She's my my my bowling alley queen
She don't seem to see or even notice me
But she's all the woman a boy like me could need

She's got a pink bowling ball and oh man can she throw it
It makes my knees get weak just see the way that she hold it
When she follows through with that killer hook
She strides on back and don't even look
That's bowling cool and she wrote the book
Uh huh

She drinks diet Coke and she don't ever tease her hair
I like those black stretch pants and v-neck sweaters she always wears
And she never jumps or shouts or screams
She has an almost perfect swing
Her roll is hard and usually mean
Uh huh

Last night I wore my new blue jeans combed back my hair with water
Trying hard to look cool and cas' just leanin' on the counter

Both hands in my pockets I watched her take off her bowling gloves

No it isn't good, and I can't let go
Must have been something or someone I hurt,
In some other life somewhere long ago

[Chorus]
I don't know how I started down this tailspin
Why one more time I just did not see it coming
And you'd think by now,
I'd have figured out the pattern

I shook my fists I've left too soon
The soft wounded animal inside of me
Stood up on its hind legs and howled at the moon,
Anger rises in a violet storm,
And when I am wisest lay down beside it
And hum in it's ear until it gets quiet

[Chorus x2]

It isn't fair, it isn't' right,
I've wished on a million or billion bright stars,
Prayed like the devil with all of my might
And somebody said, ""What's really true
Yeah all of this stuff is different I know
But what is in common has always been you.""

I'm learning to see, the heavens are so starry
And if I'm not too proud I'll learn to say I'm sorry
You'd think by now I'd have figured out the pattern",You'd Think by Now,2008
Carrie Newcomer,"I've always had long arms and my sleeves never fit.
And my mother would worry about my dangling wrists and
I never grew to tall, but it did me no harm
To never grow into the length of my arms

What I have embraced, what I've carried for years
Like a bucket of self doubt, like a basket of fears
But we finally cherish what we got from the start
Like the length of our own arms and the shape of our hearts

I dreamt I was flying, and I dreamt of my mother
She was walking in paradise with one saint or another
And I looked out at my own arms they felt so strong
And really quite lovely though ridiculously long",The Length of My Arms,2010
Carrie Newcomer,"The dust settles after a hit and run 
Bewildered by the damage done 
I don't know why we chose the roads we travel 
Or how a life could get so unraveled 

[Chorus: x2]
We live our lives from then until now 
By the mercy received and the marks on our brow 
To my heart I'll collect what the four winds will scatter 
And frame my life into before and after 
Once a trick of light made me believe 
A red fire was blazing from every tree 
We held hands as the evening gathered 
I forgave myself for what I didn't ask her 
I once saw the sky filled with falling stars 
Bumped my head in the dark and it left a scar 
Held on too tight before I let it go 
Then forgave myself for what I didn't know 

I've stretched my soul over fifty states 
I have lived on fumes and religious cornflakes 
And once I dreamt my shoe had grown thin and battered 
And forgave myself for what didn't matter 
God said Cain where is your brother 
And who will tell his grieving mother 
Jacob dreamt an angel called his name 
And he never was quite the same 

[Chorus]",Before and After,2010
Carrie Newcomer,"There have been too many leavings to list in one place 
Too many arrivals to ever retrace 
And all who have wandered have not fallen from grace 
Just done a few things they'd like to erase 
And met with their shadows face to face 

Up on the ridge top a coy dog cries 
It's the mother a coyote with bright yellow eyes 
A coy dog's half friendly the other half wild 
Half is homebody and half is streetwise 
It can't help its nature but God know it tries 

[Chorus]
Star light star bright 
All the dogs are restless tonight 
Leave on the porch light 
I'll be home after midnight 

It's all blessed and restless and up for debate 
A season and chance to alter a fate 
But a moment can pass just because it can't wait 
And time hits you hard with terrible weight 
Like a rock to the forehead stamped with ""Too Late"" 

[Chorus]

Our vision is often faulty 
We see but through the glass darkly 
And yet, we know deep down 
When we hear the sound 
When it speaks our name 

The moon eats its center until it dissolves 
Then conquers the shadow with a single resolve 
Here's to hoping for wholeness no matter how small 
Asking the questions that cannot be solved 
And following the ache of unnamable call 

[Chorus]",Coy Dogs,2010
Carrie Newcomer,"When Adam went out to name the animals
He sat on a rock and he figured
Horse and cow and goat and sheep
Were the best names that he could deliver
But Eve looked around at all of that glory
Said Hon I think we should consider
Something a bit more unique and refined
For each and every critter

It's a crash of rhinoceros a pomp of Pekinese
It's a gaggle of geese and a swarm of bees
A parliament of owl and a gam of whale
A pandemonium of parrot and a watch of nightingale
A huddle of walrus, company of moles
Exultation of lark and a murder of crow
A simple flock sheep and a herd of deer
Its a bask of crocodiles and a sleuth of bear

Adam looked shocked and scratched his head
Eve stood there happy and beaming
The animals gathered in close to their feet
With roars of delight, barks and singing
She's on a roll and just getting started
The birds and beasts held their breath
What fine appellation would they receive
And which one of them would be the next?

It's a team of oxen and a mob of kangaroo
It's a charm of flinch if there are more than two
A troubling of goldfish, a cluster of cats
A bloat of hippopotami, a cloud of bats
Ostentation of peacock, a barren of mules
An army of ant, nursery of raccoon
A parcel of penguins, a dray of squirrels
A bed of oyster with or without the pearls

All that naming lasted far into the night
Until even the insects had groupings
Eve was still bright eyed and willing to finish
Though her shoulders and fig leaves were drooping
Adam said, Ã¢??Darling I'm proud and amazed
You're really one heck of a woman
So let's go to sleep and tomorrow we'll rise
And we'll start naming the rocks plants and woodlandsÃ¢??


It's a tittering of magpie, company of mole
It's a pride of lions and a tribe of goats
A plague of locust and a pack of dogs
A leap of leopard, an array of hedgehog
It's a caravan of camels, a drift of swan
A sulk of foxes and the list goes on
It's a an prickle of porcupine, a battery of hens
A cohort of zebra and now once again

It's a colony of rabbits, and a sounder of boar
An ambush of tigers, now just a little more
It's a business of ferrets, a swarm of eels
A covey of quail and a pod of seals

It's a parade of elephant, a dole of dove
A bale of turtles and all of them I love
And she kissed the horde of hamsters
On their furry little heads, sighed with satisfaction
And she went to bed",A Crash of Rhinoceros [*],2010
Carrie Newcomer,"John Roth had a heart like flame, 
He believed all souls were loved the same 
He packed up his hopes and his family and moved to Ohio 
There in the deep dark wilderness, 
With a newborn son he soon was blessed 
Raised him up in the ways of the old prophets, 
And named him Isaiah Roth 

[Chorus]
Do no harm, shed no blood, 
The only law here is love 
We can call the kingdom down here on earth 
Beat your swords into plows, 
Don't be afraid I'll show how 
Lift your eyes to the skies, 
All is holy here 

The forest people soon came near, 
His message to the red children clear 
We can build the peaceable kingdom here in the shadow of these trees 
They planted oats and beans and maize, 
They planted their hearts in the dirt of that place 
And they learned to speak of hope 
And grace in the language of John Roth 

[Chorus]

When Isaiah Roth had just turned ten, 
He was working in the loft again 
He looked out and saw eight white men come riding up that day 
The men shouted out from the deepening glade saying, 
""Y'all come on out an' we can trade""
The forest people walked out unafraid with smiles and open hands 

The white traders lifted up their guns 
And shot them down each and every one 
And the Eden that John Roth begun 
Lay bleeding on the ground 

[Chorus]

The world has aged by 50 years. 
The Quakers came and settled near 
Old Isaiah Roth still preaches here, 
That the greatest law is love 
Some people say it's all a scam, 
Just the ravings of some old man 
But Isaiah Roth says he still can, 
See Eden on the hill 

Do no harm 
Shed no blood 
The only law here is love",Do No Harm,2010
Carrie Newcomer,"There's a light in the darkness just barely out of view
From the corner of your vision it beckons to you.
After the crops have all come in amid the stubble and the chaff
Keep on walking when it whispers and don't look back.

Some say it's the Ghost Train's headlight or poor Wayland Smiths' pyre
Some say it's the Will o the Wisp or St. Elmo's fire,
Or the ghost of wandering spirits that got lost between the worlds.
Keep on walking when they whisper or if the lines begin to blur.

When it's done it's said and done.
What it's gone it's good and gone.
Sometimes there's nothing left to do,
But pack it up and move along.

I'm not saying don't remember or that all things can be repaired
But after the truth's been told where do we go from there?
Sorrow is a constant companion we learn to walk beside.
Keep walking when it whispers and don't listen when it lies.

When it's done it's said and done.
What it's gone it's good and gone.
Sometimes there's nothing left to do,
But pack it up and move along.

There are stories that we were told just to keep us in our place.
There are stories that we made up ourselves to save a little face.
There are the ones that made us crazy and the ones that kept us sane,
Keep on walking if the stories all start to sound the same.

When it's done it's said and done.
What it's gone it's good and gone.
Sometimes there's nothing left to do,
But pack it up and move along.

Sometimes there's nothing left to do,
But pack it up and move along.
Sometimes there's nothing left to do,
But pack it up and move along.",Ghost Train,2010

A crazy old lion with his hair all backlit 
Grinnin' like a little boy who has a secret 

I do not know its name

And I believe it must look like an old man shining

Juice running down like laughter on our chin and on our hands 
When we were done we looked around and smiled at each other

We chatted that gray morning 'bout the choir he sang with Wednesdays 
He sang a haunting gospel hymn shameless and clear 
With only me a wandering stranger sitting there to hear

Elusive and subtle 
But I believe it must sound like that man singing in the shuttle 

Standing in the river barefoot in the current 
I hear a bird call and try to learn it

I saw fish go swimming out too far for me to reach

So many plans I had made 
I'd check the mail, I'd make the calls 
Save the world and sweep the hall 
Finally get my accounting done 
Sort the beans one by one 
But I got waylaid by the morning sun 
And I got absolutely nothing done 

I thought I'd live a louder life 
I'd learn a lot and get it right 
I'd rent a loft I'd drink all night 
I'd be a living archetype 
And in a blinding flash of light 
I'd see that one great insight 
But silence called me deeper still 
Like nothing else ever will 

I woke to hear an owl nearby 
Hunting something large enough to cry 
Nature's always beautiful 
The change of season always right 
The moon shines cold and true and bright 
And sets at dawn without a fight 
And yet I could not find a way 
To get myself back to sleep last night 

I never knew just what it meant 
The way you smiled while you dreamt 
And why my heart can overflow 
And why mistakes can haunt me so 
Why nothing ever stops or stays 
Dust shimmers in the morning rays 
I didn't do the work that I'd had said 
I just wandered through these thoughts instead",I Meant to Do My Work Today,2010

When this moment ends
You'll look back to see
The love you left behind

The closer the feeling
The more you recognise
Familiar, the faces
Reflected in your eyes
I'm with you, I know you
If only in my head
I always remember
(I always remember)

No more holding on
To a fading memory
Of how things used to be
Life will carry on
Love will always be your guide
If you just set me free

The closer the feeling
The more you recognize
Familiar, the faces
Reflected in your eyes
I'm with you, I know you
If only in my head
I always remember
You looked and me and said

Time goes by
From the point of no return
You've gotta be strong enough to learn
Time goes by

Builds a temple in your mind",Time Goes By,2006

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

And suppose I cried and said ""I think I finally learned my lesson""
And I'm tired a-spendin' all my time alone.

If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away.
Would you tell me that you loved me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say:

""I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"".

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?

Would we get that old time feelin', would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began?

Would you tell me that you'd missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you waited for the day that I return.
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

Would you say

Carrie Underwood,"Well she seemed alright by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losin' end
Some folks whispered, some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out, there was no one about
On Independence Day

Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know
That today is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay
On Independence Day

Well she lit up the sky the fourth of July
By the time that the firemen came
They just put out the flames and took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

Carrie Underwood,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati on a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Carrie Underwood,"Since the day they got married,
He'd been praying for a little baby boy.
Someone he could take fishing,
Throw the football and be his pride and joy.

He could already see him holding that trophy,
Taking his team to State.
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket,
All those big dreams changed.

And now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl.

Sixteen short years later,
She was falling for the senior football star.
Before you knew it he was dropping passes,
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her.

The coach said ""Hey son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?""
Daddy said ""You'll lose your free ride to college.
Boy you better tell her goodbye"".

But now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American

And when they got married and decided to have one of their own,
She said ""Be honest, tell me what you want?""
And he said ""Honey, you wanna know,
Sweet, little, beautiful, one just like you.
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American.""

Now he's wrapped around her finger,
She's the center of his whole world.
And his heart belongs to that sweet little beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl

Hairbrush singers, dashboard drummers
Hello, you wild magnolias just waiting to bloom

There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true

I've stood at the bottom of some walls
I thought I couldn't climb
I felt like Cinderella at the ball
Just running out of time
So I know how it feels to be afraid
And think that it's all gone and slip away
Hold on
Hold on

Street climbers, porch swingers, air-guitar players
Here's to you fearless dancers shaking walls in your bedrooms
There's a lot of wonder left inside of me and you

Thank God even crazy dreams come true

Never let a bad day be enough
To go and talk you in to giving up
Sometimes everybody feels like you
Oh, feels like you
Just like you

I've met some go-getters, some difference makers
Small-town heroes and big-chance takers
I've met some young hearts with something to prove

Sixpence in her shoe
Something borrowed, something blue

She put her veil down trying to hide the tears
Oh she just couldn't believe it

And the flowers fell out of her hands

Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt

And sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag

And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could've been
And then guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Then it turned into ""oh no! what have I done?""

His yellow silk tie

Stood a young pretty bride

The blooming within
And how her heart seemed to flutter with the wind

Cried and held me then

Asking when she’s coming over

As Tom creeps across the floor
Some days it almost kills me

Said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha

One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing

And having dinner at the country club

But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes

It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

Carroll Baker,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung

Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet

Carroll Gibbons,"Verse 1
 
 We must be kind
 And with an open mind
 We must endeavour to find 
 A way-
 To let the Germans know that when the war is over
 They are not the ones who'll have to pay.
 We must be sweet-
 And tactful and discreet
 And when they've suffered defeat
 We mustn't let
 Them feel upset
 Or ever get
 The feeling that we're cross with them or hate them,
 Our future policy must be to reinstate them.
 
 Refrain 1
 
 Don't let's be beastly to the Germans
 When our victory is ultimately won,
 It was just those nasty Nazis who persuaded them to fight
 And their Beethoven and Bach are really far worse than their bite
 Let's be meek to them-
 And turn the other cheek to them
 And try to bring out their latent sense of fun.
 Let's give them full air parity-
 And treat the rats with charity,
 But don't let's be beastly to the Hun.
 
 Verse 2
 
 We must be just-
 And win their love and trust
 And in additon we must
 Be wise
 And ask the conquered lands to join our hands to aid them.
 That would be a wonderful surprise.
 For many years-
 They've been in floods of tears
 Because the poor little dears
 Have been so wronged and only longed
 To cheat the world,
 Deplete the world
 And beat
 The world to blazes.
 This is the moment when we ought to sing their praises.
 
 Refrain 2
 
 Don't let's be beastly to the Germans
 When we've definitely got them on the run-
 Let us treat them very kindly as we would a valued friend
 We might send them out some Bishops as a form of lease and lend,
 Let's be sweet to them-
 And day by day repeat to them
 That 'sterilization' simply isn't done.
 Let's help the dirty swine again-
 To occupy the Rhine again,
 But don't let's be beastly to the Hun.
 
 Refrain 3
 
 Don't let's be beastly to the Germans
 When the age of peace and plenty has begun.
 We must send them steel and oil and coal and everything they need
 For their peaceable intentions can be always guaranteed.
 Let's employ with them a sort of 'strength through joy' with them,
 They're better than us at honest manly fun.
 Let's let them feel they're swell again and bomb us all to hell again,
 But don't let's be beastly to the Hun.
 
 Refrain 4
 
 Don't let's be beastly to the Germans
 For you can't deprive a ganster of his gun
 Though they've been a little naughty to the Czechs and Poles and Dutch
 But I don't suppose those countries really minded very much
 Let's be free with them and share the B.B.C. with them.
 We mustn't prevent them basking in the sun.
 Let's soften their defeat again-and build their bloody fleet again,
 But don't let's be beastly to the Hun.",Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans,2012

Knock three times (knock, knock, knock sound)

And here's what I'll do: 
I'll yell, ""GO AWAY!"" 
'Cause I don't wanna see you. 

If you want to take me driving, 
Out riding in your car, 
Drive on up and honk three times, and I'll know who you are. 
Honk three times (honk, honk, honk sound) 
Honk three times (honk, honk, honk sound) 
Honk three times (honk, honk, honk sound while he sings:) 
I'll just stay in my trash can, 
'Cause I don't wanna ride with you. 

Now I don't care it you're big or small, 
And I don't care if you're sho-hort or tall, 
'Cause every spring and summer, winter and fall, 
I don't wanna see anybody at all! 

BUT! If you want to call me, 
When I am all alone, 
Dial my number and ring three times, and I'll know it's you on the phone. 
Ring three times (bring, bring, bring sound) 
Ring three times (bring, bring, bring sound) 
Ring three times (bring, bring, bring sound while he sings:) 
And here's what I'll do:

Carroll Spinney,"I can't think of anything that's dumber 
To a grouch, Christmas is a bummer! 

Beaming faces everywhere, happiness is in the air 
I'm telling you, it isn't fair! 
I hate Christmas! 

People loaded with good will, giving presents, what a thrill 
That slushy nonsense makes me ill 
I hate Christmas! 

I'd rather have a holiday like normal grouches do 
Instead of getting presents, they take presents back from you 
Heh heh 

Here comes Santa, girls and boys 
So, who needs that big red noise! 
I'll tell him where to put his toys 
I hate Christmas! 

And if you want the truth, I ain't so crazy about Thanksgiving or Labor Day either! 
Christmas carols to be sung, decorations to be hung 
Oh, yeah? Well, I stick out my tongue! 
I hate Christmas! 

Christmas bells play loud and strong 
Hurts my ears, all that ding dong 
Besides it goes on much too long 
I hate Christmas! 

I'd rather have a holiday with a lot less joy and flash 
With a lot less cheerful smiling, and a lot more dirty trash, yeah! 

Christmas Day is almost here 
When it's over, then I cheer 
I'm glad it's only once a year 
I hate Christmas!",I Hate Christmas,1996
Carroll Spinney,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you see

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

You may not believe this but
He is making a list and checking it twice
Going to find out who is naughty and who is nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Your town and my town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you are wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Believe me I'm ready for him

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start

Carroll Thompson,"I remember when
I was five and you were ten, boy
You knew that I was shy
So you teased and made me cry
But I loved you

Then one day you came
You told me you were leaving
You gave your folks the blame
And made me cry again
When you said

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

I'm waiting
Ooh, still waiting
I'm just a fool
Ooh, I'm a fool
To keep waiting

Then someone finally came
He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes
So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you
But you said:

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
And I'm still waiting

Love has never shown his face
Since the day you walked out that door
You filled my life with empty space
Come back
Can't you see it's you I'm waiting for

Don't you know I'm waiting
I'm waiting for love
For you, I miss you
I'm waiting
Come on back, boy
I need you
I want you

We go swimmin’ down by the rope-swing at night
Night air made us ice cream shiver
In the wadin' rushing river
And the night echoes all through the day

In the middle of her flight she calls out
That she don’t want me though I know she cares

Now I can hear her calling distance from Oxford Way
Now I can hear her calling distance from Oxford Way
And the night echoes 100 years of days

We go stepping on opposite coasts tonight
I feel the silly moon laughing
Because here and there my love is

It wasn't all I’d expected it to be
Thought being free would be a good high to have
But coming back home with nothing to do is not a way to be

I feel I’ve known you and I don’t want to screw that up
Flick of the switch moving you up the totem pole
And mixing metaphors and drinks down on the floor
Calling out your name every night at three

And you’re years apart
You blow them all away

You summarize ends and destinations
Spring rise, summer slow, and autumn cessation
And I catch myself following you with my eyes
Just as sure as I ride

And you just standing there
You blow

I could not hold onto you with these hands
Time - worst week since I saw you
Since you saved me the trouble of asking you to stay

I want to see your green eyes tonight
In color beneath the moon’s black and white

Well I did build all that was torn down
I was a different man in a different town
Structure - foundation laid so well
Taken aback when it fell with no sleight of hand

I rode a horse 'til I cried
And all these pictures they’re eating holes in my walls
Like a path laid bare at low tide then none at all

You can write with words from in you
Love so deep feels like it will divide you
While tickets to ride pass like dead flowers before you

I could not deliver you
King’s cavalier in sorrow my grace has burned
And it’s a lesson too late to learn
Times not a quantity full to fool with

Making us think we have reparations due us

Since our Alaska passed away

Hoping on a wishbone
You're just lying in bed
Gotta built it - build it of stone
Paint it cherry red
Now I got it I'm suffering alone
Stuck inside my head

And stay the night

Interpreting graffiti as we went
You scuffed your shoe through
Green bottle glass

I had a pack of saltines in my back pocket
We stopped beneath streetlights searching
Old pay phones for quarters and dimes

Cartel,"I guess I gotta crawl before I can walk
I guess I gotta grow before we can talk
And I have the upper hand
I'm good at letting go but I'm getting better
You're never gonna know but you'll get a letter
I hope you understand

I never wanted it to go this far
Never thought it would be so hard
I never thought I would lose myself
But now I'm left with nothing else

'Cause you're so typical
You're so damn difficult
You're so typical
You're so damn difficult

I guess you gotta lose before you can listen
I guess you gotta choose to see what you're missing
I am a better man
I'm good at letting go but I'm getting better
You're never gonna know but you'll get a letter
I hope you understand

I never wanted it to go this far
Never thought it would be so hard
I never thought I would lose myself
But now I'm left with nothing else

'Cause you're so typical
You're so damn difficult
You're so typical
You're so damn difficult
You're predictable, cynical
I see it in your eyes
You're so typical
You're so damn difficult

And I see what this does to you
I'm holding back like I've got something left to prove
You're so cliche
I can see it in your face
See it in myself
The rest is up to you

'Cause you're so typical
You're so damn difficult
'Cause you're so typical
You're so damn difficult
You're so typical
You're so damn difficult
You're predictable, cynical
I see it in your eyes
You're so typical
You're so damn difficult
You're so typical
You're so damn difficult",Typical,2009
