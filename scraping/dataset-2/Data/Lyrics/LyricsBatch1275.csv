Willie Nelson,"Come on now, Willie,
Don't look at me that way.
I know you like a paperback book,
'cause I've read every page.
I know what you're thinkin',
And I don't think you're thinkin' at all.
This is old Hoss that you're talkin' to:
The one with the perfect recall.

No I ain't goin' down on the border with you tonight.
Drinkin' tequila, taking chances on our lives.
All the women are crazy, they like to party 'til daylight.
On second thought, if I can find a clean shirt, I might.

Wait a minute, Waylon,
I ain't said a thing about that.
Sometimes I just like to wear my spurs,
And my old Mexican hat.
But we sure had fun the last time,
That we were down there.
And when we woke up, you had that weird tattoo,
And somebody had curled my hair.

No I ain't goin' down on the border with you tonight.
Drinkin' tequila, taking chances on our lives.
All the women are crazy, they like to party 'til daylight.
On second thought, if I can find a clean shirt, I might.

All the women are crazy, and they like to party 'til daylight.

On second thought, if I can find a clean shirt, I might.",If I Can Find a Clean Shirt,1996
Willie Nelson,"Tempted and tried
We're oft made to wonder
Why it should take us
All the day long
While there are others
Living about us
Never molested
Though in the wrong.
Farther along
We'll know all about
Farther along
We'll understand why
Cheer up my brother
Live in the sunshine
We'll understand it
All by and by.

When we see Jesus
Coming in glory
When he comes down from
His home in the sky
Then we shall meet him
In that bright mansion
We'll understand it
All by and by.
Farther along
We'll know all about
Farther along
We'll understand why
Cheer up my brother
Live in the sunshine
We'll understand it
All by and by.
We'll understand it
All by and by",Farther Along,1996
Willie Nelson,"O Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds
They hands have made
I see the stars
I hear the rollin' thunder
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed.
Then sings my soul
My Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul
My Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art!
When Christ shall come
With shouts of acclamation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And there proclaim,
""My God, how great Thou art!""
Then sings my soul

Willie Nelson,"I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee

[Chorus]
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me shall be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom's shore, to Thy shore

When life's sun sinks in the west
Lord, may I have done my best
May I find sweet peace and rest
In that happy home of the blessed

[Chorus]",Just a Closer Walk With Thee,1996
Willie Nelson,"I went to a Turkey roast down the street
The people down there are eatin' like wild geese
So I'm on my way I'm goin' back in Alabam
Well you talk about your people havin' a lot of time
Eating up their chickens and drinkin' their wine
I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam
Now some folks say that a tramp won't steal
But I caught three in my corn field
And I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam
Well one had a bushel and one had a peck
And one had a roaster near tied around his neck
I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam

Well there comes Sal walkin' down the street
With the run down shoes tied on her feet
I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam
When I get ready to leave this earth
I'm going back to my money's worth
I'm on my way I'm goin' back to Alabam",Alabam,1996
Willie Nelson,"Met a girl that I loved 
In a town way down in Texas
'Neath the stars up above 
She was the sweetest girl 
I ever did see
So I held her in my arms 
And told her of her many charms
And I kissed her 
While the fiddles played 
The 'Bonaparte's Retreat'
And all the world was bright 
As I held her on that night
And I heard her say 
Don't you ever go away
So I held her in my arms 
And told her of her many charms
And I kissed her 
While the guitars played 
The 'Bonaparte's Retreat'

Willie Nelson,"A thousand miles, dear 
A thousand more across the water 
Across the shore
I'll say a prayer, dear 
For yours and mine 
Please think of me, dear 
Each night at nine

I hold your picture 
Close to my heart 
It takes your place, dear 
While we're apart
Helps remind me 
That you're still mine 
To feel your nearness 
Each night at nine

The bugle's playing 
Out go the lights 
Even it's lonely these army nights
Go tell kids I'm doing fine 
Give them my love, dear 
Each night at nine
A thousand miles, dear 
A thousand more across the water 
Across the shore
I'll say a prayer, dear 
For yours and mine 
Please think of me, dear 
Each night at nine",Each Night at Nine,1996
Willie Nelson,"I've traveled o'er the country wide a seekin' fortune fair
I've been down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
From Portland East and Portland West and back along the line
I'm goin' now to a place that's best that old home town of mine
Eight more miles and Louisville will come in to my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I 'll never more be blue
I knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville the home town of my heart

There's sure to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all
Mine lives down in Louisville she's long and she is tall
But she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land
I'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand
Oh eight more miles and Louisville...

Now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
A humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
The place that's right for that love site is in those bluegrass hills
Where gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville
Eight more miles to Louisville...",Eight More Miles to Louisville,1996
Willie Nelson,"Out where the bright lights are glowing 
You're drawn like a moth to a flame
You laugh while the wine's overflowing 
While I sit and whisper your name
Four walls to hear me 
Four walls to see 
Four walls too near me 
Closing in on me

Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting 
But my walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love not for hating 
So here where you left I stay
Four walls to hear me 
Four walls to see 
Four walls too near me 
Closing in on me

One night with you is like heaven 
And so while I'm walking the floor
I listen for steps in the hallway 
And wait for your knock on my door
Four walls to hear me 
Four walls to see 
Four walls too near me 
Closing in on me",Four Walls,1996
Willie Nelson,"It's a sin ,my darling, how I love you 
Although I know our love can never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you 
When silence proves that you've forgotten me
The dreams I built for us have tumbled 
Each promise broken like my heart

Why pretend that I can't live without you 
When deep inside I know that it's a sin

I hope you're happy with another 
Who shares the dream I could not win

Why pretend that I can't live without you 
When deep inside I know that it's a sin",It's a Sin,1996
Willie Nelson,"Just one love that shines for me 
Shines a light that I can see
Just one love shines for me tonight 
Just one love shines for me tonight
Just look at all those stars up in the sky

The wind is blowing through the trees 
Weather that's inside of me
Makes a sound that follows me around
It makes a sound haunting me to hear
It blows me round and round when you are near
Just one love...

[ guitar ]

Well, babe, as far as I can see 
Stars are what they want to be
They want to be the one to make you smile
Just a little love of your heart is all they need
Just a little of your love could be for me
Just one love...
Just look at all those stars up in the sky",Just One Love,1996
Willie Nelson,"Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold 
With the ways of a gentleman I've been told
A kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
But if me and a certain character met 
That guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree

That ain't that I don't smoke myself 
And I don't reckon they'll injure your health
I've smoked 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But nicotine slaves are all the same 
At a pheasant party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop when they have that cigarette

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Now at a game of chance the other night 
Ol' Dame Forson wasn't doin' me right
Them kings and queens just kept on comin' round
Well I got a full and I bet it high 
But my plug didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept a risin' and a layin' that money down
He's raise me and I'd raise him 
I sweated blood I had to sink or swim
He finally called and he didn't raise the bet
I said ""aces is full pal how about you?"" 
He said ""I'll tell you in a minute or two
But I just gotta have another cigarette""

Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

The other night I had a date with 
The cutest gal in the fifty states
A high bred uptown social little dame
She said she loved me and it seemed to me 
That things were like they ought a be
So hand in hand we strolled down Lover's Lane
She was oh so far from a chunk of ice 
And our smoochin' party was a goin' real nice
So help and I think I'd of been there yet
But I give her a hug and a little squeeze 
And she said ""Willie excuse me please
But I just gotta have another cigarette""
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette
Smoke smoke smoke that cigarette 
Puff puff puff 
And if you smoke yourself to death
Tell St Peter at the Golden Gate 
That you hate to make him wait
But you just gotta have another cigarette

Willie Nelson,"If time itself was his demeanor
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer
Of sunlight landin' on the street
Some say girls must be discreet
Some say girls must be discreet
Nursing their fathers locked inside
They masqueraded as his bride

I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's somethin'
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never
Never say never

They slump by the courthouse with windburn skin
That man could give a fuck
About the grin on your face
As you walk by, randy as a goat
He's sleepin' on papers
But he'd be warm in your coat

I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's somethin'
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never
Never say never

There's no easy way to lose your sight
On the street, on the stairs
Who's on your flight
Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin
But he's got her, she's got him

I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's somethin'
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never

Willie Nelson,"I see trees of green
Red roses, too
I see them bloom for me and you

And I think to myself, ""what a wonderful world""

I see skies of blue
And clouds of white
The bright blessed day the dark sacred night

And I think to myself, ""what a wonderful world""

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying, ""how do you do""
They're really saying ""I love you""

I hear babies cry
Watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, ""what a wonderful world""
And I think to myself, ""what a wonderful world""",What a Wonderful World,1996
Willie Nelson,"I guess I've come to live here in your eyes
This must be the place called paradise
You are so precious to me
What a special time within our lives
And I guess I've come to live here in your eyes

A thousand times I see you
And a thousand times you take my breath away
Fears and doubts consume me and I'm afraid someone will take it all away
I hope I'm here forever, but I think it's time that we both realized
That I guess I've come to live here in your eyes

A thousand times I see you
And a thousand times you take my breath away
Fears and doubts consume me, I'm afraid someone will take it all away
I hope I'm here forever, but I think it's time that we both realized
That I guess I've come to live here in your eyes

Willie Nelson,"I'm not trying to forget you anymore
I've got back into remembering all the love we had before
And I'd been trying to forget someone that my heart still adores
So I'm not trying to forget you anymore

You were just someone who brought happiness into my life
And it did not last forever oh but that's all right
We were always more than lovers and I'm still your friend
And if I had the chance, I'd do it all again

So I'm not trying to forget you anymore
I've got back into remembering all the love we had before
And I'd been trying to forget someone that my heart still adores
So I'm not trying to forget you anymore

Willie Nelson,"I'm waiting forever for you
For this is my destiny
This is what I am to do

But forever ain't no time at all

Between telephone calls

And the love that I hear
And your voice is so clear comin' through
Keeps me waiting forever
Waiting forever for you

I'm waiting forever for you
For this is my destiny
This is what I am to do

I can't belive that it's just me and you
Seeing worlds so far apart
Come together in our hearts

You're a dream come true

These are changing times

But she was here
And her presence is still heavy in the air
Oh what a taste
Of human love

It was love
Without disguise
And now my life will never be the same again",She Is Gone,1996
Willie Nelson,"I've been too sick to pray, Lord
That's why we ain't talked in a while
It's been some of them days, Lord
I thought I was on my last mile

But I'm feelin' okay, Lord
And I'm glad that I called You today
Never needed You more
I woulda called You before
But I've been to sick to pray

Remember the family, Lord?
I know they will remember You
And all of their prayers, Lord
They talk to You just like I do

And thank You, my friend

We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

You are the road, you are the only way
I'll follow you forever more
We'll look for love, we'll find it in the eyes
The eyes that see through all the doors

There is a train that races through the night
On rails of steel that reach the soul
Fueled by fire as soft as candle light
But it warms the heart of a love grown cold

And we don't run and we don't compromise
We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

Words that feel, words that sympathize
Words that heal and understand

Willie Nelson,"God painted the bluebonnets in the fields,
By a tough little scrub oak, on an east Texas hill.
And he plucked the star from a lone star sky,
And he put it in the twinkle of a cowboy's eye.

The wide open spaces he made wild and free.
Texas, as far as any eye can see;
And he made her sons grow tough and strong.
They still cry when they hear a sad song.

[Chorus]
No place but Texas
Would I ever roam.
No place but Texas;
My home, sweet home.
No place but Texas;
My home, sweet home.

Where I can see the longhorns graze
And the cactus flowers blooming in the morning haze.

Yet in thy dark street shineth...",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1996

Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door

Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories?

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for?
Awf'lly diff'rent without you

I can't help but ponder, life is such a wonder
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way

Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way

When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger
The storm's even beautiful in it's own way

When I see the leaves drop from off of the treetops
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder
God, made all things beautiful in their own way

Words can't describe what I feel inside
When I see the beauty in each coming day
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold
An' everything's beautiful in it's own way

We don't do nothing you don't want to do and I won't tell you no lies

I can't do what them people tell me to do

And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
And wonder, ""Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?""

We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
And an old school man of the world
He let me drive his car
When he's too drunk to

And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like some old western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid
They all called his ""Sidekick""
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men

Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

A day before he died, I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone
So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang another verse to that old song
""Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' ""

Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

And you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need

I leaned against a bark of birch
And I breathed the honey dew
I saw a North-bound flock of geese
Against a sky of baby blue
Beside the lily pads
I carved a whistle from a reed
Mother Nature's quite a lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need.

A cardinal sang just for me
And I thanked him for the song
Then the sun went slowly down the west
And I had to move along
These were some of the things

On which my mind and spirit feed
But flesh and blood need flesh and blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need.

So when this day was ended
I was still not satisfied
For I knew everything I touched
Would wither and would die
And love is all that will remain
And grow from all these seeds

Mother Nature's quite a lady
But you're the one I need
Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
And you're the one I need.",Flesh and Blood,1998

 I saw my first pistol in the general store 
 In the general store, when I was thirteen 
 Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen 
 
(Willie Nelson) 
 So I asked if I could have one some day when I grew up 
 Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up 
 She really blew up and I didn't understand 
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 
[Chorus (All together)] 
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 
(Kris Kristofferson) 
 My very first pistol was a cap and ball colt 
 Shoots as fast as lightin' but it loads a mighty slow 
 Loads a mighty slow and soon I found out 
 It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out 
 
(Waylon Jennings) 
 So then I went and bought myself a Colt .45 
 Called a peacemaker but I never knew why 
 Never knew why, I didn't understand 
 'Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 Well I got into a card game in a company town 
 Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down 
 Shot the dog down, watched the man fall 
 Never touched his holster never had a chance to draw 
 The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed 
 Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said 
 Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man 
 Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

There's a lady they call the gypsy
She can look in the future
And drive away all your fears

If you'll only believe the gypsy
She could tell at a glance
That my heart was so full of tears

She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you

But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday

That uproots the harvest and hurls it away
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger

Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder

Leroy was an outlaw wild as a mink
One day she saw him starin' and it chilled her to the bone

Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul.

Linda was a lady blonde and built to last
Benny was a no good guitar picker runnin' from his past
She heard all of his songs tellin' nothin' but bad news
But she made her mind up to try to get him win or lose.

Willie Nelson,"On a greyhound bus,
Lord I'm traveling this morning
I'm going to Shreveport and on down to New Orleans
Been driving these highways,
Been doing things my way
It's been making me lonesome on'ry and mean

Now her hair was jet black,
And her name was Codene
Thought she was the cream of the Basin Street queens
She got tired of that smokey whine dream
Began to feel lonesome on'ry and mean

We got together, and we cashed in our sweeps.
Gave 'em to a beggar
Who was mumbling through the streets
There's no escaping
From his snowy white dreams
Born lookin' lonesome on'ry and mean

Now I'm down in this valley,
Where the wheels turn so low
At dawn I pray, to the Lord of my soul
I say do Lord, do right by me
You know I'm tired of being lonesome on'ry and mean","Lonesome, On'ry and Mean",2000
Willie Nelson,"Low down leaving sun, I've done
Did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't I see
I'D best be leaving well enough alone
Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
Them keep a-haunting me in memories
There's one in every crowd, for crying out loud
Why was it always turning out to be me

[Chorus: x2]
Where does it go,the good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay
Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes

For loveable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me",Honky Tonk Heroes (Like Me),2000

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you

I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine

Willie Nelson,"You didn't know I wasn't free when you fell in love with me
And with all your young heart you learned to care
It brought you shame and disgrace, the world has tumbled in your place
Because they call our love a back street affair

They say you wrecked my home, I'm a husband that's gone wrong
They don't know the sorrow that we've had to bear
For the one that I'm tied to was the first to be untrue
And yet they call our love a back street affair

We have each other now, that's all that matters anyhow
Why the judgment of gossip's never fair
We'll just be brave and strong, then someday they'll see they're wrong
So let them call our love a back street affair

We'll be free to love someday when all the talk has died away
And the happiness we've hoped for then we'll share
I'll climb a mountain high and the world will hear me cry
That our love is not a back street affair",Back Street Affair,2000

So touch me
And you will know how you'd feel 
With the blues

Watch me
Watch the eyes that have seen 
All the heartache and pain in the land

And be thankful 
That you're happy though standing so close 
To the world's bluest man

Don't forget me
Take a good look at someone who's lost 
Everything he can lose

And then touch me 
And you'll know how you'd feel with the blues

Willie Nelson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Star Dust,2000

Ridin' all alone

I love your flowers I love your ocean rolling in

I've sure found myself a friend

Willie Nelson,"Now, many many years ago
When I was twenty three
I was married to a widow
Who was pretty as could be

This widow had a grown-up daughter
Had hair of red
My father fell in love with her
And soon the two were wed

This made my dad my son-in-law
And changed my very life
My daughter was my mother
'Cause she was my father's wife

To complicate the matters
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father
Of a bouncing baby boy

My little baby then became
A brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle
Though it made me very sad

For if he was my uncle
That also made him the brother
Of the widow's grown-up daughter
Who, of course, was my step-mother

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

My father's wife then had a son
That kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild
For he was my daughter's son

My wife is now my mother's mother
And it makes me blue
Because, she is my wife
She's my grandmother too

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

Now, if my wife is my grandmother
Then, I am her grandchild
And every time I think of it
It nearly drives me wild

For now I have become
The strangest case you ever saw
As the husband of my grandmother
I am my own grandpa

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

I'm my own grandpa
I'm my own grandpa
It sounds funny I know
But it really is so
I'm my own grandpa

Willie Nelson,"Woke up this mornin' with the sundown shinin' in
Found my mind in a brown paper bag again
Tripped on a cloud and fell eight miles high
Tore my mind on a jagged sky

And Lord, I just dropped in to see
What condition my condition was in
Lord, Lord, Lord
What condition my condition was in

I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and I followed it in
Had myself crawlin' out as I was crawlin' in
Woke up so tight, Lord, I couldn't unwind
I saw so much that it blew my mind

So I just dropped in to see
What condition my condition was in

Lord, I just dropped in to see
What condition my condition was in
Lord, Lord, Lord
What condition my condition was in

Somebody painted 'April fool'
In big black letters on a dead end sign
I had my foot on the gas
And when I left the road it blew out my mind

Eight miles out of Memphis
Lord, I got no spare
Eight miles straight up
Downtown somewhere

I just dropped in to see
What condition my condition was in
Lord, Lord, Lord
What condition my condition was in

Lord, Lord, Lord
What condition my condition was in

Willie Nelson,"Once I knowed a guitar picker, lived his life on wine and liquor
Runnin' around in one of them new machines
He was about the proudest feelin', wheelin', dealin'
Sneakin', stealin', aggravatin' man I've ever seen

Nothin' but a midnight rambler, biggest drunkard and a gambler
He'd do anything that wasn't nice
Huntin', golfin', fishin', swimmin', runnin' around with other women
Playin' dominoes and shootin' dice

Then one night as he was dinin', while the moon was brightly shinin'
With his secret love he was so gay
He would laugh and call her 'Honey' while she proudly spent his money
As they hugged and smooched the time away

Laughin', jokin', dinin', dancin'
Plannin' parties and romancin', havin' fun regardless of the price
Eatin' caviar and chicken, strummin' his guitar and pickin'
Playin' dominoes and shootin' dice

Then his wife walked in and found him with that pretty girl around him
Started makin' headway for the gate
When he seen those girls dividin', he commenced to slip and slidin'
But he seemed to know it was too late

Crowds began to gettin' thinner, they jumped up and left their dinner
No one seemed to have an appetite
Not a person dare defend her, everyone jumped out the window
No one hung around to see the fight

Then she grabbed him by the collar, he commenced to squeal and holler
As she plastered him betwixt the eyes
And then his old guitar she swung it, o'er his head she proudly hung it
Bruises, knots and bumps began to rise

He leapt up and tried to squeeze her, but she warped 'cross the beezer
Pulled a pistol and shot him once or twice
When the wicked fight was over, he was laid beneath the clover
No more dominoes and shootin' dice",Playin' Dominoes and Shootin' Dice,2001
Willie Nelson,"Why are there so many
Songs about rainbows?
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions
But only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told
And some chose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see

Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
And what's so amazing
That keeps us star gazing
And what so we think we might see?

Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic

Have you been half-asleep?
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That calls she young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
There's something that I'm supposed to be

Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me",Rainbow Connection,2001

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance

Listen to my heartbeat now
If you want to love me
Baby, I can show you how

And sing along
Find the harmony
The rhythm and the rhyme to me
On and on
All night long

It was meant to be

We know how to live this love once more
Like a wave returning to the shore
It's gonna be easy, we've done this before

We know this boat may sail
Into stormy weather
But we don't fear the endless sky
That brought us here together

So, for a thousand thousand years

I orchestrated paradise, couldn't make you stay
You dance with the horses through the sands of time
As the sun sinks west of the Mendocino County line

To remind me of a time
These pictures and these photographs
Let me know I'm doin' fine
I used to make you happy once upon a time
But the sun sank west of the Mendocino County line

Feeling near immortal every Friday night
Lost in our convictions, left stained with wine

Talking to those rich folks that you know
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
You know that I could never be alone

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flower by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Well when you're sitting back in your pink rose Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Days
I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
And another girl can take my pain away

Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flower by US mail

In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair

And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons

Willie Nelson,"I was looking for America, in a western movie
Saw a young gun slinger with something to prove
And I came lookin'...like anybody else
I came searchin'...like anybody else
Lookin' for that golden calf

And I came shooting for the stars, like any young blood
I found a fat cat city and crooked judge
I killed anything standing in my path
I killed anything till I laid my hands
Laid' em on the golden calf

Now it's our last sand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance for this kind of man
I'm still lookin' for something to prove

I come around full circle, aged like an old dog
Lookin' at them young bucks just green as frogs
But I ain't layin' back no time to laugh
I ain't layin' back
There's new kids a comin' gunning for that golden calf

I was was looking for America in a western movie
I saw pike bishop stridin' through aqua verde
He was headin down that dusty path
Headin down that blood path
Runnin from his crooked past
He's lookin for another life
Sick of chasin' down that golden calf

Now it's our last sand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance for this kind of man
I'm still lookin' for something to prove

But there's always someone faster
Someone quicker on the draw
Someone with a hunger closin' in
Some younger steppin' up to be
The next out law

Now it's our last sand in open country
This is my last chance to be with you
This is the last dance for this kind of man
I'm still lookin' for something to prove

And up and down our block there's not a sound

And just then the local memory comes around
Piles of blues against the door to make sure sleep will come no more
He's the hardest working memory in this town
Turns out happiness again and then lets loneliness back in
And each night the local memory comes around

Each day I say tonight I may escape him
I pretend I'm happy and never even a frown
But at night I close my eyes and pray sleep finds me
But again the local memory comes around
Rids the house of all good news then sets out my crying shoes
What a faithful memory never lets me down

now I can't stay there no more

to move some old cars around
maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out

and they showed me to the hall

we're headed down into fall


I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
hustled up a little dough
but I got drunk and I woke up rolled
a couple of months ago
they got my harp and they got my dollar
them low life so and so's
harps cost money and I ain't got it
it's my own fault I suppose


The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
two freights everyday
if it was just me I'd be headed south
but Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
says we gotta wait and see
in my heart I know it's a little boy
hope he don't end up like me


Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
hope she don't break down and cry


Marie she didn't wake up this morning
she didn't even try
she just rolled over and went to heaven
my little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them

Another love, with a heart more bold and free. 
But in the end, fairweather friends may break your heart, dear.

Willie Nelson,"With the twilight colors falling
And the evening laying shadows
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
And I feel my own heart beating out
The simple joy of living
And I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling
Was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me 
And I lifted me up with you 
So, I believe it was a road that I was meant to ride

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war

There are nights I don't remember
And pain that it's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me
In my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all

But in my dreams parade of lovers 
From the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey
And that I've survived the battles
And that's my spoils of victory is you

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
Everyday gets betther than the day before
I'm like a soldier getting over the war",Like a Soldier [*],2003

In my old sharecropper's one room country shack
They said my mommie left me the day before she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And I just like to mention that my grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning and a milking and a churning
Picking cotton raisin' hell and baling hay

I been to Georgia on a fast train honey
I wouldn't born no yesterday
I got a good Christian raisin' and an eight grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

And now sweet Carolina, I don't guess
I'll ever find another woman put together like you are
With your wiggle and you're walking and your big city talking
And your brand new shiny Plymouth rag top car

Hey, let's hurry up and wait in this world of give and take
It seems like haste it makes me waste every time
I declare to my soul when you hear those ages roll
You better know I get my share of mine

Doing all he could to please his mommy and his dad
But he never planned to be the man

And somehow or another Jesse's little baby brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son

The way he spat upon his family and scandalized their name
And his parents never really ever said he'd been disowned
But somehow or another now his little baby brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son

Can you dare to treat your parents so unkind?
You have selfishly refused to live your life the way they planned
And you've started going your own way and speaking your own mind.
Jesse Younger's parents wonder where it all went wrong
Now that Jesse's name has turned to ashes on their tongues
But he chose to starve asnd try to carve a future of his own
And he got his druthers because now his younger brother
Is his father's and his mother's only son.

Willie Nelson,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana,
Rode into town one day.
And under his knees was a ragin' black stallion,
And walkin' behind was a bay.
The red-headed stranger had eyes like the thunder,
And his lips, they were sad and tight.
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside,
And his heart was heavy as night.
Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow,
He's ridin' an' hidin' his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him,
Just wait till tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window,
An' watched as he passed her way.
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion,
But cast greedy eyes on the bay.
But how could she know that this dancin' bay pony,
Meant more to him than life.
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin',
Had ridden when she was his wife.

Don't cross him, don't boss him.
He's wild in his sorrow,
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him,

Of the city streets at night,
And the alleyways and ugly things
Are hidden from the light.

For a custom tailored lady-killer

And every cheap hotel,
Asking for my baby; they all knew her well.
Well, they said, ""She's out there working
For the wages of her sin,
And if you want to find your baby, Baby,
Look for Sugar Man.""

Well, tonight I found her
On the sorry side of town
Lying cold upon the bed
Where she had laid her body down.
I picked up the needle that had fallen from her hand
And stuck it through the money she had made for Sugar Man.

I find it all so amusing

And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues

And a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone

There must be a glow 
To open each door there's a key

Willie Nelson,"[Chorus:]
In my own way I'm a believer
In my own way right or wrong
I don't talk too much about it
It's something I keep working on
I don't have too much to build on
My faith has never been that strong

There's a man in that old building
He's a holy man, they say
He keeps talking about tomorrow
While I keep struggling with today
He preaches hell, fire and brimstone
And heaven seems so far away

I do believe in a higher power
One that loves us one and all
Not someone to solve our problems
Or to catch me when I fall
He gave us all a mind to think with
And to know what's right or wrong
He is that inner spirit
That keeps us strong

One with the sun, you and me
One with the sun, living is free
I got you now, won't let you go
Tomorrow's a memory we'll never know
One with the sun I'm listening to you
One as the sun
I hear what you say
I love you so much
You are the way it is
The planets are the stars I think they are your eyes
And all of the stars will always be ours
We'll always be One with the sun
Because we are one with the sun
And we've just begun
There's another sun, sun is on it's way
And we'll be one

In your funny way

You won't cross my mind
And I'll get over you

In your clumsy way

I almost found the words to make you go

Cause I know you're going home to her
Cause you belong to her and you go home to her
I know you steal away I know that'll be another day
That you'll come back again
And I'll keep wondering will I be here till then

Willie Nelson,"It was a $1000 wedding supposed to be held the other day and
With all the invitations sent
The young bride went away
When the groom saw people passing notes
Not unusual, he might say
But where are the flowers for my baby
I'd even like to see her mean old mama
And why ain't there a funeral, if you're gonna act that way
I hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
He took some friends out drinking and
It's lucky they survived
Well, he told them everything there was to
Tell there along the way
And he felt so bad when he saw the traces
Of old lies still on their faces
So why don't someone here just spike his drink
Why don't you do him in some old way
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
The Reverend Dr. William Grace
Was talking to the crowd
All about the sweet child's holy face and
The saints who sung out loud
And he swore the fiercest beasts
Could all be put to sleep the same silly way
And where are the flowers for the girl
She only knew she loved the world
And why ain't there one lonely horn and one sad note to play
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day

Willie Nelson,"I guess my heart has settled back to Earth.
I rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth.
But true love is both a blessing and a curse.
Today my heart just settled back to Earth.

Now I know just how you felt that night so long ago.
But the dream for you had ended and you let me know.
So I bounced from sky to sky,
Tryin' to keep the dream alive.
But everything I did just made it worse.
Guess my heart just settled back to Earth.

Love created songs that I still sing.
Love we knew still makes the rafters ?red?.
Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.

Songs our love created I still sing.
Love we knew still makes the rafters ?red?.
Tonight I'll sing for everything I'm worth.
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth.

Our hearts just finally settled back to Earth",Back to Earth,2006

It fits in with all the suggestions and lies and empty tables
With food untouched,
I couldn't see the future.
I liked the past too much
I've been going door to door like I got something to sell,
Wandering like a fool
Through the halls of a blue hotel.

So go on and rain down on us
Go on and rain
Go on and rain down on us
I give up, I give up.

Something about her that's cold.
She's blowing through the trees,
Leaving me raw
As the words come out,
I get confused.
I get shattered like a light bulb in an October moon.
She's inside me like a secret
And I got no one to tell.

Through the halls of a blue hotel.

That david played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do you? 

It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your crown and she cut your hair
And from you lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to you? 

There's a blaze of light in every word
And it doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

A broken angel sings from a guitar.
In the end there's just a song comes cryin' up the night
Thru all the broken dreams and vanished years.
Stella blue. Stella blue.

When all the cards are down, there's nothing left to see,
There's just the pavement left and broken dreams.

In the end there's still that song comes cryin' like the wind.
Down every lonely street that's ever been
Stella blue. Stella blue.

I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel, can't win for trying.
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time,
Gonna make them shine, shine

It all rolls into one and nothing comes for free,
There's nothing you can hold, for very long.

It seems like all this life was just a dream.

Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field.

Said, ""Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing.""

And the first easy loving I found

But soon all of the good times
The gay times and play times
Like colors run together and fade
Oh Lord, if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
And keep me from blowing away

There are times when I trembled 
When my mind remembered
The days that just crumbled away

With nothin' to show
But these lines that I know
Are beginning to show in my face

Oh Lord, if you're listening 
I know, I'm no Christina
And I ain't got much coming to me
So send down some sunshine
And throw out your lifeline
And keep me from blowing

Oh Lord, if you hear me
Touch me and hold me
Keep me from blowing away",Keep Me from Blowing Away,2008

Would gather around the quilting frames
They'd always call out for me to come inside

Willie Nelson,"I was sittin' beside the road in blackjack county
Not knowing that the sheriff paid a bounty
For men like me who didn't have a penny to their names
So he locked my leg to thirty five pounds of blackjack county chain

And sll we had to eat was bread and water
And each day we had to build that road a mile and a quarter
And black snake whip would cut our backs when some poor fool complained
But we couldn't fight back wearin' thirty five pounds of blackjack county chain

And then one night while the sheriff was a sleepin'
We all gathered round him slowly creepin'
And heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain
When we beat him death with thirty five pounds of blackjack county chain

Now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankful
That there's nothing but a scar round my ankle
But most of all I'm glad no man will be a slave again
To a black snake whip and thirty five pounds of blackjack county chain

Willie Nelson,"You called me country Willie
The night you walked away
With the one who promised you a life of joy
And you thought my life too simple
And yours was much too gay
To spend it living with a country boy
I'm writing you this letter
I write you every day
I hope that you've received the ones before
But I've heard not one word from you
And every day I pray
That you will not forget your country boy
You're living in the city
With riches at your door
Is this your love, is this your kind of joy?
Or do you find there's something missing?
Does your heart cry out for more?
And do you sometimes miss your country boy?

A cottage in the country
With roses round the door
Could not compete with flashing city lights
But it's all I have to offer
Except for one thing more
A heart so filled with love
That it could die
It's time to end this letter

A lonely night has passed but there'll be more
And just one more thing in closing
For all the world to hear

Willie Nelson,"Funny a woman can come on so wild and free
Yet insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch me
And stand by the bed and shiver as if she were cold
Just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were gold

One night of love can't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
Though sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
She could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all

Right or wrong a woman can own any man
She can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
Then leave him as weak and weary as a newborn child
Fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes

One night of love don't make up for six nights alone
But I'd rather have one than none Lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone

She could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all",If You Can't Touch Her at All,2008

Willie Nelson,"The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a ragin' black stallion
And walkin' behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like the thunder
And his lips, they were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again

A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
An' watched as he passed her way
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that this dancin' bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darlin'
Had ridden when she was his wife

Don't cross him, don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him
Just wait till tomorrow

The yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
An' looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink, an' he gave her some money
He just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
An' laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick, they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say

He's wild in his sorrow
He's ridin' an' hidin his pain
Don't fight him, don't spite him

Who's tryin' to steal your horse
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the ragin' black stallion

Willie Nelson,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying

And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines. 
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul, 
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal.

Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
And it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.

It's a-many a man I have known in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines. 

And it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
And it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.

O midnight, or the morning, or the middle of the day
It's the same to the miner who labors away
Where the demons of death often come by surprise
One fall of the slate and you're buried alive

And it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
And it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines.

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll, 
My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.

Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from

Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books, one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs

In a crystal sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one loved to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole live saving souls
When he looked at me his blood ran cold
He didn't even try

I had no dreams, I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
The warden asked, “How come you killed that man”
I said, “I don't know why”

Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one prays for life
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my mortal soul be blessed
By someone close to me

He came to me with trembling hands
He swore he'd never understand
I said it's just what life had planned
It's destiny

Don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
I chose the dark, you chased the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain

And the demons of a lesser me are beckoning me in

Walking my baby back home.
We stop for awhile she gives me a smile
Snuggles her head to my chest
We started to pet and that's when I get
Her talcum all over my vest.
After I kind of straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
One kiss then I continue again
Walking my baby back home.

La, la, la, dee
La, la, la, dee.

Know she's afraid of the dark
So I have to park
Right outside the door 'til it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
So I dry her tears off all through the night.

La, la, la, dee

When the old battery gets running low

Way up high in a coconut tree
Layin' low, just my baby and me
Sunny skies as far as I can see
High up in a coconut tree

Not to green, not too brown
I shimmy up and I shake the good ones down
Coconuts, a couple of bucks a piece

For I know that I just dream about you

Watched the ring on the stove turn red
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee
Pulled on my boots and made the bed

Is dry lightning on the horizon line
Just dry lightning and you on my mind.

Like it was the holy grail
Descend beautiful spirit
Into the evening pale

Kickin' in the corral smelling rain
There's a low thunder rolling
'Cross the mesquite plain

Where she'd dance to make ends meet
I'd spend the night over my gin
As she'd talk to her men

Well the piss yellow sun
Comes bringin' up the day
She said ""Ain't nobody can give nobody
What they really need anyway.""

Well you get so sick of the fightin'

Shots rang out as I stumbled home
So I hid behind a dumpster in an alley down the street
I didn't want to know if they were shooting at me
Next morning in the paper read a man had lost his life
Twenty feet away from me but I got out alive

I learned more from these cities than I ever did in class
And I stand accused of living way to fast
Out here on this highway one thing stays the same
It's gonna find me trouble knows my name

At four in the morning in the city of New Orleans
The tables got my money even though my friends had warned me
So I hopped in the taxi, we headed down Canal
By the time we got back to the bus it had already gone down
It was a bucket full of concrete through our window
We were getting robbed but the cops they never showed

I learned more from these cities than I ever did in class
And I stand accused of living way to fast
Out here on this highway one thing stays the same
It's gonna find me trouble knows my name

No I wouldn't want it any other way
Not knowing what might happen today, ain't that a shame

In Missoula Montana we were out on tour
With country music's brightest star that we knew for sure
And I won't say what we did but one of us went too far
Got picked up by the police after we all left the bar
That next morning we looked everywhere
Bout the time we hit the stage he'd barely posted bail

I learned more from these cities than I ever did in class

We're the songwriters

Half the world thinks we're crazy
The other half wants to be us

In the back of some big stars tour bus

We're old boots and tee shirts and blue jeans
We're cables and strings and E Chords
We only dress up in November
When they hand out some writers awards

We're heroes, we're schemers,
We're drunks and we're dreamers
We're lovers and sometimes we're fighters
We're the truth, we're the lies
We're stupid, we're wise
We're true love but mostly one nighters
We're the songwriters

We ride bridges, we cross 'em and burn 'em
Teach lessons but don't bother to learn 'em
Our mamas don't know what we're doing
Why we stay out all night long

Glad that I ain't used to her no more
She always burned my bacon,
And she could never shut a door
And I'm glad that I ain't used to her no more

I wish I wasn't used to her back then
I wish I wasn't used to her back then
Could've picked a good girl who did not crave other men
And I wish I wasn't used to her back then

When I start gettin' used to her
I get down on my knees
Say ""Lord I know not what I do""
Forgive and help me please

When I get used to her, I'm sick of me
When I get used to her, I'm sick of me
I want to run and hide

When I get used to her, I'm sick of me

When I start gettin' used to her
I get down on my knees

'Til one of us was riding in a hearse

I wish I could tell you, but the words cannot be found

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cries

Yippie I ohhh ohh ohh
Yippie I aye ye ye
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught em yet
'Cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Tryin to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

Willie Nelson,"A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the nighT
For lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks
Their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself
In the glow of city lights

Lights that say ""forget her name
In a glass of cherry wine""
Lights that offer other girls 
For empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture
Of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness
Behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars
To brighten up the night
But the God who put the stars above
I don't believe he made those lights
For it's just a place for men to cry
When things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away
And hide behind those city lights

Lights that say ""forget her love
In a different athmosphere""
Lights that lure are nothing
But a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture
But my arms can't hold her tight
I just can't say ""I love you""
To a street of city lights

I just can't say ""I love you""
To a street of city lights",City Lights,2016

Willie Nelson,"A woman's love goes deeper than the man's
Into a place only she understands
It's a healing touch, it's a blade of a knife
But so much love, a woman's love that gives you life

A woman's love is stronger than a man's
But it can hold your heart in the palm of its hands
It'll keep the faith through the long dark night
It takes a woman's love, a woman's love to see the light

It'll make you fly, sink you like a stone
It'll leave you high or leave you all alone
If you believe her word, no matter what you've heard
Anybody say about it, there's no life for you without it now

But it'll leave you high or leave you all alone

If a woman's love ever finds your soul
It'll break your will and take control

Is a woman's love, this woman's love and nothing more
It's a woman love you're living for",A Woman's Love,2017

And lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my hard-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days

I learned all the rules of a modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Take what you need from the ladies and then leave them

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You can die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare

Willie Nelson,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Willie Nelson,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all, all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh no, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows 
And did it my way

And did it my way",My Way,2018

That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearnin' burnin' inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you

Came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there
To touch your hair

All summer long we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And that summer wind

Like painted kites
Days and nights went flyin' by
The world was new
Beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man
One day it called to you
Well I lost you
I lost you to that summer wind

Now the autumn wind
And the winter winds, they have come and gone
