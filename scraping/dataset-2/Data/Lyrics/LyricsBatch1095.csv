The Band,"Now there's a certain thing
That I learned from Jim
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And that is that there's a certain way that all must swim
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land

Open the door, Rachel
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Rachel
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more

Now there's a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
That fella who never blushes
And that is that one must always flush out his house
If he don't expect to be housing flushes

Open the door, Rachel
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Rachel
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more

""Take care of all of your memories"", said Mick
""For you cannot relive them
And remember when you're out there
Tryin' to heal the sick
That you must always first forgive them""

Open the door, Rachel
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Rachel
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more","Open the Door, Homer [Restored Version] [Version]",2014
The Band,"Well, i've already had two beers
I'm ready for the broom
Please, Missus Henry, won't you
Take me to my room?
I'm a good ol' boy
But i've been sniffin' too many eggs
Talkin' to too many people
Drinkin' too many kegs
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees
An' i ain't got a dime
Well, i'm groanin' in a hallway
Pretty soon i'll be mad
Please, Missus Henry, won't you
Take me to your dad?
I can drink like a fish
I can crawl like a snake
I can bite like a turkey
I can slam like a drake
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees
An' i ain't got a dime
Now, don't crowd me, lady
Or i'll fill up your shoe
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy
An' tonight i am blue
I'm a thousand years old
And i'm a generous bomb
I'm t-boned and punctured
But i'm known to be calm
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees
An' i ain't got a dime
Now, i'm startin' to drain
My stool's gonna squeak
If i walk too much farther
My crane's gonna leak
Look, Missus Henry
There's only so much i can do
Why don't you look my way
An' pump me a few?

Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!

An' i ain't got a dime","Please, Mrs. Henry [Restored Version] [Version]",2014
The Band,"Santa-Fe,
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe,
My woman needs it ev'ryday,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
She's rollin' up a lotta bread
To toss away.
She's in Santa-Fe,
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe
Now she's opened up an old maid's home,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
She's gonna write herself a roadside poem,
About Santa-Fe.

Santa-Fe,
Dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.
Since I'm never gonna cease to roam,
I'm never, ever far from home,
But I'll build a geodesic dome
And sail away.
Don't feel bad.
No, no, no, no, don't feel bad
It's the best food I've ever had.
Makes me feel so glad
That she's cooking in a home-made pad
She never caught a cold so bad
When I'm away.

Santa-Fe,
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.
My shrimp boat's in the bay
I won't have my nature this way,
And I'm leanin' on the wheel each day
To drift away
From Santa-Fe,
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa-Fe.
My sister looks good at home,
She's lickin' on an ice cream cone,
She's packin' her big white comb,

The Band,"Now, I try, oh for so awf'ly long
And I just try to be.
And now, oh it's a gold mine
But it's so fine.
Yes, but I know in my head
That we're all so misled,
And it's that ol' sign on the cross
That worries me.

Now, when I was just a bawlin' child,
I saw what I wanted to be,
And it's all for the sake
Of that picture I should see.
But I was lost on the moon
As I heard that front door slam,
And that old sign on the cross
Still worries me.

Well, it's that old sign on the cross,
Well, it's that old key to the kingdom,
Well, it's that old sign on the cross
Like you used to be.

But, when I hold my head so high
As I see my ol' friends go by,
And it's still that sign on the cross
That worries me.

Well, it seems to be the sign on the cross. Ev'ry day,
ev'ry night, see the sign on the cross just layin' up
on top of the hill. Yes, we thought it might have
disappeared long ago, but I'm here to tell you, friends,
that I'm afraid it's lyin' there still. Yes, just a
little time is all you need, you might say, but I don't
know 'bout that any more, because the bird is here and
you might want to enter it, but, of course, the door might
be closed. But I just would like to tell you one time,
if I don't see you again, that the thing is, that the sign
on the cross is the thing you might need the most.

Yes, the sign on the cross
Is just a sign on the cross.
Well, there is some on every chisel
And there is some in the championship, too.
Oh, when your, when your days are numbered
And your nights are long,
You might think you're weak
But I mean to say you're strong.
Yes you are, if that sign on the cross,
If it begins to worry you.
Well, that's all right because sing a song
And all your troubles will pass right on through.",Sign On the Cross [Unreleased] [#],2014
The Band,"Silent weekend,
My baby she gave it to me
Silent weekend,
My baby she gave it to me.
She's actin' tough and hardy
She says it ain't my party
And she's leavin' me in misery.

Silent weekend,
My baby she took me by surprise.
Silent weekend,
My baby she took me by surprise.
She's rockin' and a-reelin'
Head up to ceiling
An' swinging with some other guys.

Silent weekend,
Oh Lord, I sure wish Monday would come.
She's uppity, she's rollin',
She's in the groove, she's strolling
Over to the jukebox playin' deaf and dumb.

Well, I done a whole lotta thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of cheatin',
And I, maybe I did some just to please.
But I just walloped a lotta pizza after makin' our peace,

The Band,"We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day
And now you'd throw us all aside
And put us on our way
Oh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun
Would treat a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot
And always tell him ""No?""
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I the one who must be the thief ?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone
And life is brief

We pointed out the way to go
And scratched your name in sand
Though you just thought that it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand
Now I want you to know that while you watched
You discover there was no one true
Must everybody really thought
It was a childish thing to do
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I the one who must be the thief ?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone
And life is brief

It was all very painless
When you went out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse
But oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse ?
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why am I the one who must be the thief ?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone
And life is brief",Tears of Rage [Without Overdubs] [Version],2014

The Band,"Too much of nothing
Can make a man ill at ease
One man's temper might rise
While another man's temper might freeze
In the day of confession
We cannot mock a soul
Oh, when there's too much of nothing
No one has control

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Give them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion

When there's too much of nothing
It can cause a man to weep
He can walk the streets and boast like
Of what he'd like to keep
But it's all been done before
It's all been written in the book
And where there's too much of nothing
Nobody should look

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Give them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion

And too much of nothing can make a man a liar
It can cause one man to sleep on nails
It can cause others to eat fire
Everybody's doin' somethin'
I heard it in a dream
But when there's too much of nothing
It just makes a fella mean

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian

The Band,"Soap box preachers tanding on the corner
And all the people they would gather round
You speak of faith with a blaze of glory
But those that fear they wanna knock you down

Nobody knows where you live
Where do you go in the naked night
All of the prophets that come before you
They can hear your lonesome cry

When you're out there in the night
All alone
When you're staring in the light
At the end of the road

In those proud shoes coming on up the alley
In those proud shoes walks all over the sky
Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote
And said don't let the rapture pass you by

Heard a bugle blowing in the misty morning
What a haunting sound over Times Square
Heard of the ghost of 52nd Street
Looked out the door but no one was there

Out in the cold Harlem rain
I went searching for this minstrel man
Played me a song to ease the pain
With a Salvation Army band

When you're out there in the dark
All alone
When you're sleeping in the park
At the end of the road

In those proud shoes coming on up the alley
In those proud shoes walks all over the sky
Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote
And said don't let the rapture pass you by

In the neon wilderness and the asphalt jungle
He carries his cross of passion
Through the wreckage and the rumble

In those proud shoes coming on up the alley
In those proud shoes walks all over the sky
Then he tipped his hat just like Don Quixote
And said don't let the rapture

Any style that would back her
They say she's a chooser
But I just can't refuse her
She was just there, but then she can't be here no more

And as my mind unwheels
I feel the freeze down in my knees
But just before she leaves, she receives

She's been down in the dunes
And she's dealt with the goons
Now she drinks from a bitter cup
I'm trying to get her to give it up
She was just here, I fear she can't be there no more

It's long, long when she's gone
I get weary holding on
Now I'm coldly fading fast
I don't think I'm gonna last very much longer

She's stoned said the Swede, and the moon calf agreed
I'm like a viper in shock with my eyes in the clock

With six younger siblings who look up to you

Having nothing in common with the outside world
The only way to reach them is to spray it on the walls
Because no listens to your calls

Surrounded by a border that isn't even there

Would you hit a guy with glasses?!!

And they are after me
They want compensation for the optometry

With my little girl who was back in the States.
I was stranded in the jungle, afraid and alone,
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home.
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted, and my girl in Lover's Lane?

And meanwhile, back in the States

Baby, baby, let's make romance,
You know, your old-time lover hasn't got a chance.
He's stranded in the jungle, glad as he can be,
So come on pretty baby, just you and me.

And meanwhile, back in the jungle

The boys in the jungle had me on the run,
When something heavy hit me like an atomic bomb.
When I woke up and my head started to clear,
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear.
I smelled something cooking, and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was cooking me.

So come on pretty baby, just you and me.

And meanwhile, back in the jungle

I jumped out of the pot and finally got away,
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say.
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim,
But my chance of survival was getting mighty slim.
So I thumbed down a whale who was heading my way
And I reached the States in about half a day.
And when I got to Lover's Lane, I was almost dead.
But my soul was gone and here's what I said:

Baby, baby, the man is no good.
Oh baby, baby, you should have understood.

The way you lie

Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive until the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long bridge
And then I'm gonna cry well maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring that you put on my finger
And give it a big ol' fling and watch it sink
Down, down, down
There it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around

Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug on a rich man's floor
You lie like a coondog basking in the sunshine on my porch

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
Oh but not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' caldron in some train yard
My beard a rustling, a cold towel,
A dirty hat pulled low across my face (across my face)
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the back roads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind

A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,1986

From holding broken glass punching echoes in the face
Can't see you, eyes covered, not looking your ice blue eyes pierce like
Lightning through the space
Thirteen arrows tear tunnels right through me
My fingers stuff the holes but the bleeding it persists
Check my mirror its cracking distorted
My vision could be questioned but the visage no doubt mine
And now I'm teasing with these rattlesnakes
I'm kissing cobras on the head
I roll the dice despite my past mistakes
Only the lucky end up dead
I'll face the pain but the pain ain't mine
I shouldn't walk this late at night
Asking for trouble when I climbed that fence
I'm out of my mind she's out of sight
Hey mom I'm going out tonight so put my calls on hold
Now joey no fights tonight, I'd bet shed wish I was
Hey mom I'm going out tonight so tell em' I'm not home

The Banner,"Kill yourself all by yourself
Your eyes cried dry and you've gained nothing
Hearts in shreds your own knife
Refuse to escape your self made torture
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into...
And I'm sorry, if my momentary lapse just caused you one more thing
And knowing what I've done can tug a fraying tear
Like thread slipping through my fingers and that's not much to show for pain
Endured
But in the end you'll learn its worth
Alone by yourself only hurts if you need someone
To need truly need anothers touch can lead you into hell
Longing, desire, burning inside her
Crawling in darkness, only a glimmer of hope as she yelled these words.
I'll face my pain
On my own - standing strong
Prove for myself.

It was a ho-down, another ho-down

Walked into the club and farted
Damn! Look at shawty off in the cut actin' naughty
Eye contact, made sure that she saw me
Said y'all, don't get it twisted like I'm ballin'

Down south stripper from New Orleans, thick as mud
Baby show me love, with a little tittie rub
Said, ""Hit me later on baby, maybe we can what?""
Said, ""Sound like a plan"" wit my hand on her butt

But shit hit the fan sho' nuff, nigga hold up
Baby doll had a man, matta fact was a soldier
Ain't that a beyotch! He was sittin' on the sofa
Smokin' on some doja, tryna see some exposure

Had the whole spot sold up, legs tired
Bar done closed up, all of a sudden her man showed up
Automobiles, planes, and locomotives
Train with the focus see both ran through hunger

Tag-teamed that beyotch, then I called my niggaz over
They smashed in the 'Lac, popped that twat like a soda
Fuckin' with his wife so you know when I ain't sober
And niggaz in the back seat with the freak in the Nova, it was a ho-down

I can't believe that she's real, it was a ho-down
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew, it was a ho-down
You would be down in there too, another ho-down

Uh, now peep game of a star, stepped out the car
Walked through the door, checked the bitch at the bar
Eyin' her down, while I split my cigar
Can I offer you a drink or some dick in the park?

You know I'm just sayin' that to get you mad
But you knowin' damn well I wanna hit yo' ass
Yo I ain't the type of nigga that be jumpin' the gun
But you lookin' like a dime piece and I'm huntin'' for one

What's ya name? Nah, better yet, what's ya game?
Wanna ride in the Navigator, switchin' four lanes?
Or chill up in the bedroom, sniffin' cocaine?
Said she's the type of girl to get down with no shame

And everything I said before was no thang
We ran outside, and jumped in the ride
Next thing I know I'm gettin' head while I drive
Eyes open wide, down 65, it's a ho-down

I can't believe that she's real, it was a ho-down
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew, it was a ho-down
You would be down in there too, another ho-down

I can't believe that she's real, it was a ho-down
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew, it was a ho-down
You would be down in there too, another ho-down

It was a ho-down, I knew it was all great
When the hoe caught me late in room 508
Oh, she got live on tape, the price was low-rate
Plus she had a nice showcase, you thought she was ya soul mate?

Just because she got some shove in her can
Doesn't mean your 'sposed to go and fall in love with her man
Kissin' and huggin' and actin', in love with her, man
Takin' her out to restaurants and, rubbin' her hands

If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't do what you do
But it's true that you, had no clue what she do
'Cuz you trust her through thick and thin
You missed it when, she was gettin' live offa fifth of Gin

Get rammed in by me, while she lick my friends
When she finally came home you probably kissed her then, lame-o
The more you tried to claim the hoe was an angel
The quicker I realized the freak was a stank-hoe, it was a ho-down

I can't believe that she's real
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew
You would be down in there too, it was a ho-down

The Baron von Aphid,"Well you never flew the colours
And I never saw you bend a knee
To any man
But you were never short of brothers
There was always someone
Holding out a helping hand
Well, I remember the summer
We were riding to a show
And our road went on forever
So we were riding nice and slow
And then I heard the band play
And the sun broke through the sky
It was a fine day for a funeral ya
But I never wanted you to die
No one ever wanted you to die
We were watching at the crossroads
When I saw you wiping out
Some metal box just slipped down
Right into the side of you
I was screaming
I was screaming
I was screaming
But nothing was coming out
They always said you were
A dark horse
Because you rode the land alone
But you know I think the real reason
That you were always riding home
And your road goes on forever
The sun will always shine
One day we'll be together
When we cross the final line
When we cross the line
If I turn to you and call you a friend
When all is said and all is done
Will you meet me on the other side

Talking to you and me about the sky

The Barrio Boyzz,"Hacía tanto que no me detenía
A contemplarte que había olvidado
Hasta la sensación de disfrutarte
Pero hoy bajé hasta el fondo de tu vientre
Hasta ahí donde se vive de esperanza
De donde un día yo me fui a buscar mi suerte

El tiempo vuela que hare
Que en estas calles yo era un niño
Como cualquiera ganándome la vida en mil oficios
En el barrio ya no hay nadie conocido
Nuevas vidas han brotado why pido al cielo
Que dios bendiga el futuro de estos niños

Toma esta canción patria querida
Escrita con nostalgia why con melancolía
Es mi corazón el que se inspira
Pues en la distancia te añoro cada día

Toma esta canción patria querida
Escrita con nostalgia why con melancolía
Es mi corazón el que se inspira
Pues en la distancia te añoro cada día

Tú estás más bella cualquiera
Pensaría que no has sufrido
Por que las huellas las has
Cubierto con perdón why olvido
Muchas cosas han pasado en estos años
Pero quiero que se enteren mis amigos
Que todavía los recuerdo why los extraño

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear

But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, ""Will we loved your last hit""
So I'm thinkin' I'mma scoot me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the Carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused the scene

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,

I have watched as all the green fields turn to brown
But I shall not disavow all these ties that bind me now
There'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown

Shining down some day I know
Brighter than all their streets of gold
When the burdens that I carry I will lay down
And the sorrows I have known

And what you say doesn't matter much 
You're moving your lips 
But your mind is on fire 

Ah the steam is rising 
I did once, I 
Love came right through me from above 
And I sang up to my god 
And it saved me once again

And ride the wild surf they come to try
To conquer those waves some 30 feet high

Ride ride ride the wild surf

And hanging round the beach you'll see the best
They're waxed up and ready just waiting for
The surf to build up on the northern shore

Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside
Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride
The heavies at the pipeline are OK
But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay
It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown
To catch the last wave and ride it in alone

California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather

Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea

A mother deer with their newborn fawns
All under Big Sur skies

 That's where I belong.

Big Sur I've got plans for you
Me and mine are going to
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers
(Big Sur mount)

And live in canyons covered in springtime green
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen
And with my old guitar 
I'll make up songs to sing.
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water

And so while stars shine brightly from up above
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log.

She looked awful nice and so I hoped she might take a chance

And then I kissed her

Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend

I didn't know just what to do
And so I whispered I love you
And she said that she loved me too
And then I kissed her

I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
I kissed her in a way that I hope she liked for evermore

I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had

The Beach Boys,"There's a story told of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
The world they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring

As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wind
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring

And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round

And sit beneath the trees by the railroad tracks
Engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
And people passing by would stop and say
My my but that little country boy can play

And now that she's all mine, they'd better just forget her
Betsy was a lady and that she will remain

If our lifestyle's over now it sure is sad

Sail on, sail on sailor

Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail

Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering

I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor

Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

The Beach Boys,"There's a story told of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
Thy love they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring

As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wind
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring

Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round
For their hearts were full of spring

",Their Hearts Were Full of Spring [Demo Version],1993
The Beach Boys,"The boat rides we would take
The moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite songs

The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The midway and the fun
The Cupie dolls we won
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong

The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike, the rented Tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back

The leaves began to fade
Like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?

The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
Lots of different people everywhere
And when I go anywhere I see love I see love I see love

Many times they're just putting on a show

Now before i melt away""

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, ""catch me if you can""

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard them holler, ""stop!""

Ooh
Well way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas
That you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
All he spends all year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel

Whoa

He don't miss no one

And haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead
He's got to wear his goggles cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every path with a little surprise

The Beach Boys,"The night was black, rain fallin' down;
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""

You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her

Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow

They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones

They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through their day
And waste all their thoughts at night

Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better

The Beach Boys,"I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash , they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash
They did the mash , they did the monster mash

If you've ever seen a monster before
Dancin' across the dance floor
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout
Turn around and help the monster turn it out

Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash

Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
And if you don't have core hard cash
You can still do the monster mash

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'

They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash

Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?

It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you

Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash

The monster mash

Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash
Get down with the monster mash

Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her

There's nothing worse than a burning heart
Or a past that tears the world apart

I've been thinking about my situation
Nothing ventured nothing left to lose
When it's easier to just say nothing
I had thought about what I might lose

But through the child's eyes
There were feelings
Touching my violet skin
When the love games start appealing
YOu better get out and move on in

'Cause there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Or a pioneer of a dying trend
Nothing worse than a silent ghost
Or to lose your head at the starting post

When it's love it always has an end
Under the sheets of life it's just frustation
While the body goes in search again

There were feelings

When the love games start appealing
You better get out and move on in

Who will die on you till the bitter end

Who wants to break your heart
Why do you need someone
Who wants to tear your world apart

For a hundred years or maybe more
I've been talking to a million people

And workin' your fingers right down the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone

You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
The teacher don't know how mean she looks

Are you ready?

Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books get out of your seat
And down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
And all day long you've been wantin' to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
And round and round and round you go

Hail hail rock and roll

Rock rock rock and roll

Don't go near the water
Ain't it sad
What's happened to the water
It's going bad

Don't go near the water
Don't go near the water

Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath
So let's avoid an ecological aftermath
Beginning with me
Beginning with you

Don't go near the water
To do it any wrong
To be cool with the water
Is the message of this song

Let's all help the water
Right away
Do what we can and ought to
Let's start today

The Beach Boys,"Unfolding enveloping missiles of soul
Recall senses sadly
Mirage like soft blue like lanterns below
To light the way gladly
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
Where the wind withers memory
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away
Feel flows (White hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feel goes (Black hot glistening shadowy flows)

Unbending never ending tablets of time
Record all the yearning
Unfearing all appearing message divine
Eases the burning
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
Whether hope dampens memory
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
Feel flows (White hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feel goes (Black hot glistening shadowy flows)

Encasing all embracing wreath of repose
Engulfs all the senses
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
Retire the fences
Whether wholly heartened life fades away
Whether harps heal the memory
Whether wholly heartened life fades away
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away
Feel goes (White hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feel flows (Black hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feel goes (White hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feelings to grow (White hot glistening shadowy flows)

White hot glistening shadowy flows
White hot glistening shadowy flows

And watch some T.V. too
You can do something for me
And I'll do the same for you
We'll fill the hours with things
That we both most like to do
Spending a sweet Sunday lovin' you

Why don't we unplug the phone?
Let's pretend nobody's home, quietly
Just you and me, oh how nice that will be

All through the week I'll look back upon that
Sweet Sunday time
While looking forward to that special happiness
We'll find
When we awaken to hear from a songbird up above

Standing by the ocean's roar

While our love would grow
In my woody I would take you, everywhere I go

So I say from me to you

And watch 'em they'll hit the road and all be surfin' soon
And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world

Catch a wave and your sittin' on top of the world
So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy

But don't treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin on top of the world

Home of the heroes and villains 

Once at night Catillian squared the fight 
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually 
Brought her down

You know they suddenly rise 
They started slow long ago 
Head to toe healthy wealthy and wise

Transcending all time and space

Turned by different fingertips 
I never learn the lesson until I learn the lesson too late I fold and I start again 
Rise up and over and collapsing in

Like a bottle brought back then thrown away 
My soul's in the process in the cycle of change

No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

And left me all alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through all these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
Although you're gone
I keep holding on
To those happy times
Oh, girl when you were mine

As I peer through the windows
Of lost time
Keeping looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt baby
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects a hurt I can't control

All my hope and trust
Right before my eyes

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,

I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh, and on the way it grows
But it never disappears

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

Always just beyond my touch
You know I needed you so much
After all, what else is livin' for?

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts

leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
it's where the wind blows
