Barry Manilow,"I don't know how to begin 
To let myself let you in but you 
Maybe you could show me 

There's so much more I would say 
If someone showed me the way 
Like you maybe you could show me 

I've been so used to getting what I want 
Doing what I want to do 
I've always been the one who took the lead 
Now I find I need 
I need to follow you 

So won't you help me come through 
My future's long overdue 
It's time I think I'm ready now 
And you could show me how",You Could Show Me,1979
Barry Manilow,"There's a women in this town
Drownin' in a river of her own tears
Cryin' for a man who's name she can't remember
'Cause it's been too many years

Made up her mind the day he left her behind
She'd never find a man like him again
So she closed the door and never looked any more
So of course she's been alone since then

She gave in to the blues
So you know she just had to lose
Soon as she gave in to the blues

There's a man who won't try her, why
He says only fools even play the game
Never have the breaks, the money that it takes
So he says he's not to blame

Started to drink, the day he started to think
The world was out to bring him down for good
So he close the door and drank a little bit more
And went down just like they said he would

He gave in to the blues
So you know he just had to lose
Soon as he give in to the blues

They give in to the blues
So you know they just had to lose
Soon as they give in to the blues

No, don't you give in to the blues
No, no, don't you give in to the blues
No, don't you give in

Don't you give in, don't you give up, don't you give out
Don't you give in to the blues
No, no, don't you give in to the blues

",They Gave in to the Blues [*],1979
Barry Manilow,"I should have known right from the start
You never understood the feeling in my heart
I thought you were just afraid or maybe just naive and so

I let myself believe again
I let myself believe that you could love me
I let myself believe that you would stay
I swore I'd never do this, go through this again
But I let myself believe and now I can't believe you've gone away

I should have learnt from times before
Why can't I stop myself from coming back for more?
I fall too fast, I say too much, my heart is on my sleeve and then

I let myself believe again
I let myself believe that you could love me
I let myself believe that you would stay
Though I swore I'd never do this, go through this again
But I let myself believe and now I can't believe

The signs are always there as they were with you
And still I did what I always do

I let myself believe that you could love me
I let myself believe that you would stay
Though I swore I'd never do this, go though this again
But I let myself believe and now I can't believe you've gone away

",I Let Myself Believe [#][*][Demo Version],1979
Barry Manilow,"We decide to get away 
And have some fun 
Book a room and catch a flight 
For two weeks in the sun 
She says, ""Hawaii's too expensive."" 
I say, ""Barbados isn't bad."" 
She says, ""I'd love to see Bermuda."" 
And I say, ""Woman, are you mad!"" 

Bermuda Triangle It makes people disappear 
Bermuda Triangle Don't go too near 
But she Doesn't see my angle 
And she thinks I'm being dumb 
So Bermuda Triangle 
Here we come! 

Lying with my woman on The island sand 
I look up and see her with 
A stranger, hand in hand 
I see her sitting on his blanket 
I see them going for a swim 
And when I run to find my woman 
I find her running after him! 

Bermuda Triangle 
Makes my woman disappear 
Bermuda TriangleDon't go too near 
Looking At it from my angle 
Do you see why I'm so sad 
Bermuda Triangle Very bad! 

Lying lost and lonely on 
The island sand, 
When a lovely stranger says 
Hello and takes my hand 
And soon she's sitting on my blanket 
And then we're going for a swim 
When I say, ""what about your boyfriend?"" 
She turns and waves goodbye to him! 

Bermuda Triangle It makes people disappear 
Bermuda Triangle Don't go to near 
But look At it from my angle 
And you'll see what I'm so glad 
Now Bermuda Triangle Not so bad!",Bermuda Triangle,1980

Barry Manilow,"Goodbye there's a word I've hated all my life.
Unanticipated tears can hurt so much
My friend, it's so sad to see you at love's end
I've been through the pain myself it's really wrong
To play it strong.

Go on and cry till you run dry it's alright.
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when its done
Life will go on.

In time thoughts of ""might have been"" will leave your mind
And sweet forgetfulness will come
Don't worry now just when or how

Go and cry till you run dry it's alright
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day to cry out is no crime
In no time life will go on.

Go on and cry till you run day it's alright.
Go on and scream at broken dreams it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when it's done
Life will go on and on.

It's alright oh it's alright.
Let sorrow have its day and when it's done
Life will go on and on",Life Will Go On,1980
Barry Manilow,"New York winter Traffic squeals
The city feels...so old
Late December taxi ride
Then run inside it's cold

Got your letters Monday
I think or Tuesday
I lose track
Since then I've been thinking of you
And I've been looking back to

London
Can you believe it's so many years since
London
Hitching a ride and carrying knapsacks
London
In the park by the Thames Drinking tea
London
Sitting in pubs and living in walk-ups
London
Learnin' the accent learnin' to love you
London
We were young we were sure
We were... free

Was it really ages
Ago the memories Never fade
Can you hear Big Ben where you are
And are you glad you stayed in

London
Dodging the rain with broken umbrellas
London
Readind the Times on Saturday picnics
London
Counting stars 'till the stars
All were gone

London
So many plans and nothing but time in
London
Nothing to fear 'cause nothing could last in
London
We grew close we grew scared
I moved on

Oh London
What were we scared of
Why did I run from London
Part of me still has
Never come back from London
Is it fair that I miss
You so much

Take good care all my love
Keep in touch
New York winter taxi ride
Then run inside it's cold



",London,1980
Barry Manilow,"Your eyes are sad eyes
Mine are too
It doesn't take to much to see
What we've been through

You lost your baby
And me the same
Ain't it true how love's a hurtin' game

Could I have this dance
May I be so bold
It's just my arms are empty
And the night is so cold

[Chorus]
Wouldn't it be fine bein' lonely together
Wouldn't it be fine havin' a shoulder to share
You could tell me how he broke your heart
And I'll tell you how she broke mine
And maybe later on I could take you home
Now wouldn't it be sad bein' lonely all alone

A heart that's hurtin's
Not to hard to see
I guess he promised you the world
Like she did me

But dry your eyes now
You'll be just fine
We can drown our achin' hearts in this glass of wine

Well I hate to say
What's done is done
It's just two could ease the pain
Much better than one

[Chorus]

Love
It's such a crazy thing
All you gotta give and no regrets
But love

It can live again
Stay with me tonight
I'll make it work out right

[Chorus: x2]",Lonely Together,1980
Barry Manilow,"I went back
Yes I went back to find out
What we did wrong
And I went back
Yes I went back to see just
How we could feel so good
In Chicago we seemed to have it all
It was real, it was real

I went back
And I sat by the lake
And looked at the stars
And oh I swear
I remember how much we laughed
And I loved you so
In Chicago I know we had it all
It was real, it was love

Only in Chicago
Love is in the air in Chicago
There's a magic there in Chicago
Our Chicago
Baby, you and I, we tried to take it with us

But you can't go back
‘Cause I went back to find out
What we did wrong and now I see
That it wasn't just you
It wasn't just you it was in Chicago
But I'm still in love with you
Only you, only you, but only in Chicago",Only in Chicago,1980
Barry Manilow,"I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom, I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say I hope you're feeling better
And close with love the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

I'm gonna write words oh so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet
A lot of kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

And make believe it came from you
",I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter,1981
Barry Manilow,"I'm not the man I used to be, fell down a time or two
When luck was lookin' out for me
I missed the knock and never knew I let you go
But you can't get away from me again

Do you want me to plead? Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need, any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break down the door?
Do you want me to break down the door?
Break down the door

You say you saw me lose control, look now I'm in the lead
And you can have my heart and soul
I'm overhauled and guaranteed, what do you say?
Why don't you take a chance on me again?

Do you want me to plead? Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need, any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break down the door?
Do you want me to break down the door?
Break down the door

Can't say for sure what's comin'
It ain't what's gone before
Except we had some damn good times
And I know we both want more

Do you want me to plead? Do you want me to cry?
Any proof that you need, any promise you'll buy
Do you want me to break, do you want me to break down?
Do you want me to break down the?
Do you want me to break down the door?
",Break Down the Door,1981
Barry Manilow,"She was just a girl who knew the way
I was so naive
Everything she ever said to me
I wanted to believe
I was close to too far gone
When she sat down and
Told me tenderly

Don't fall in love with me
I'll only break your heart
For us forever is just tomorrow
Don't fall in love with me
Don't let the fire start
If you should fall
I'm afraid I'll follow you

Now I'm on the other side of love
Lookin' right at you
There you are so young and sure
Your life has room enough for two
So it's up to me to try and say
Words that didn't stop me yesterday

Don't fall in love with me
I'll only break your heart
For us forever is just tomorrow
Don't fall in love with me
Don't let the fire start
If you should fall
I'm afraid I'll follow you",Don't Fall in Love With Me,1981
Barry Manilow,"When I see you lying there
Like a living answered prayer
There are no words
For what I feel for you
My life was once a high trapeze
You pulled me down
And gave me peace
That's something no one else
Could ever do
And on nights like tonight
It scares me recalling
How close I came to falling

[Chorus]
But fools get lucky
Fortune must like me
When people ask where you came from
I tell them that
Fools get lucky
Destiny likes me

It must be one of nature's rules
Love like yours
Should save the fools like me
When I see the good times shine
On this wayward life of mine
I tell the world
It's all because of you

[Chorus]

Like me
Like me",Fools Get Lucky,1981
Barry Manilow,"Here is the room that we shared 
The room that you cared for 
So I haven't changed the room 
How did the years slip away 
I could swear you're still there 
For I haven't changed the room 

Now that you're gone 
What am I to do 
So many fantasies 
Plans that we made 
That will never come true 

And I haven't changed all that much 
And I'm sure you'd be proud of 
The way that I came through 
So if you happen to be passin' by 
To make sure that you recognize it 
I haven't changed the room",I Haven't Changed the Room,1981

You were the only one 
Now you're gone and I'm alone 
All my friends 
They say what's done is done 
I pretend 
But deep inside I know 

If I should love again 
If I find someone new 
It would be make-believe 
For in my heart 
It would be you 
And though I hold her close 
And want her now and then 
I'll still be loving you 
If I should love again 

All day long 
I keep remembering 
All the night 
I think of you 
All my life 
You'll be the song I sing 
I'll get by 
But this I swear is true 

If I should love again 
If I find someone new 
It would be make-believe

You know I want to stay
How I want to stay

Barry Manilow,"There were no violins
There were no soft guitars
Hot summer love under the city stars

And you were my only girl

Caught in a whirl

In all of the world
In all of my life

There was no fireside
No Beaujolais for two

So unafraid

They had to lift they spirits high (High)

When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?

Barry Manilow,"When nights are long I think of you 
Could you be blue as blue as I am 

When lovers pass do you feel blue 
And wish you knew where went wrong 

I'd like to call but I'm afraid to find 
That I'm not on your mind all night long 

When Sundays come what gets you through 
Are you still glad you're free 
or are you blue like me 

When nights are long (it seems so long, so very long)
I think of you (my heart is aching, and I'm oh so blue)
Could you be blue (as blue as those eyes of yours)
As blue as I am (my sweet, sweet baby)
When lovers pass (and now that spring is here)
Do you feel blue (what'll I do)
And wish you knew (without you)
Where we went wrong (without you to walk with and talk with)
I'd like to call (I'm starin' at the phone)
But I'm afraid I'll find (with the radio for company)
That I'm not on your mind (you'd never guess)
All night long (the song they're playin')
When Sundays come (sometimes I wonder)
What gets you through (what gets me through)

Are you still glad you're free 
Or are you blue like me Blue like me",Blue,1984

And I know I'll never be the same 
I know you meant to stay 
So if I drove you away 
Oh I know that I'm the only one to blame 
They say that every day 
should make me stranger 
and one day I won't think of you at all 
but every day you're gone the days get longer 
and all I do is wait for you to call 
We'll I've never been so low on love 
And I know that as the years go by 
I'll still be lovin' you

Barry Manilow,"Listen 
The city is singin' its night song 
A city of shadows and fading starlight 
Mixed with bar light 

Listen 
The empty streets echo the night song 
A melody I used to think was only for the lonely 

Night song I hear you 
Now as the night disappears 
But this time your blues 
Is music to my ears 

The rumble of a train 
The rustle of the wind 
The rhythm of the footsteps 
The blarin' of a horn 
The murmur of a voice 
The echo of a siren 
Night song! 

You used to find me cryin' in my beer 
Now you remind me tomorrow she'll be here 
She'll be here! 
Oh, night song 

You sing of a train from New Orleans 
And deep in the music I hear her hummin' 
Now she's comin' home!

The faces are friendly 
So have a few 
And let me play

May make its own madness 
But here we hide 
The world away 
No headlines, no deadlines 
We'll make them disappear 
While you're here at the Paradise Cafe

The room is kinda smokey 
The phone ain't workin' 
The same old broken keys don't play 
But no one seems to mind it 
'cause someone's buyin' 
And we'll all get through one more day 

Just me and you Around the piano 
Not much to do But dream away 
So stay on I'll play on 
I'm all yours for a song 
All night long at the Paradise Cafe 

Forget the one who loved you 
Then lied and left you

The way it left you

Alone in this lonely house 
This house that we dreamed about 
This house we shared till you walked out 

What am I doin' here 
This place ain't no good for me 
It just brings back memories 
And the last things I need is memories 

I should be movin' on 
Wath am I doin' here 
Now that you've really gone 
Why can't I dry these tears 
But oh, the years we had 
Here is this house that we both loved so madly 

I've never been like this 
Just livin' in yesterdays 
But there's so much I miss 
And so much that I still can't face

And all I see is no way out",What Am I Doin' Here,1984
Barry Manilow,"When love is gone 
What good is candlelight 
Each lonely day 
Becomes a sleepless night 
No one is there to share the rising dawn 
And so it fades away when love is gone 

When love is gone 
Life's just a hollow shell 
The stars don't shine 
The moon has lost its spell 
That old familiar ache 
that makes the night so long 
just seems to linger on when love is gone 

When love is gone 
There's just the memories 
An empty heart where love once used to be 
Those lonely blues refuse to let you carry on 
It's just that way each day when love is gone",When Love Is Gone,1984
Barry Manilow,"And when October goes
The snow begins to fly
Above the smoky roofs
I watch the planes go by

The children running home beneath
A twilight sky
Oh, for the fun of them
When I was one of them

And when October goes
The same old dream appears
And you are in my arms
To share the happy years
I turn my head away to hide 
The helpless tears
Oh, how I hate to see October go

And when October goes
The same old dream appears
And you are in my arms
To share the happy years

It's been so long 
Winter's turned into spring 
And you're still not with me 
So far away sweet yesterday 
Love came' round but couldn't stay 

Where have you gone 
Do you still care 
Rainy April regrets 
All this pain and sorrow 
Let me find some other kind 
Some sweet love that's right this time 

Friends, dear hearts all around me 
But deep in my soul I'm cold as stone 
Once true love found me 
Now I'm so alone

Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I've got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can't see or come to me
When I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice
Whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play my game of fantasy
And I pretend that I'm not in reality
I need the shelter
Of your arms to comfort me

No other sound
Is quite the same as your name
No touch can do quite as much
To make me feel better
So let's stay together

I've got the memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware
But nothing can take the place of your being there

So glad we've got the real thing, baby
So glad we've got the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing",Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing,1985

And stand there crying

I'm here for you

To see your sorrow

Knew all along

Barry Manilow,"Sometimes late at night
When the shadows made by street lamps
Cast a darkened silver light
You'll drift into my mind
Reminding me of all I've lost
And all I've yet to find

So many things I know I should have told you
Now what I wouldn't give if I could hold you

If you were here with me tonight
This time I'd never let it end
We'd find those feelings we once had
And feel them all again
We'd make love stronger than before
And give each other even more
And finally find a way to make it right
If you were here with me tonight
Here with me tonight

Somehow now I see
How time can soften
Even the most painful memory
Now what we had is gone
And the sooner I believe in that
The sooner I'll go on

But love like ours comes just once in a lifetime
So I tell myself it just wasn't the right time

If you were here with me tonight
This time I'd never let it end
We'd find those feelings we once had
And feel them all again
We'd make love stronger than before
And give each other even more
And finally find a way to make it right

Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
Soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and
I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale court smell of morning
A street lamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning

Of my days in the sun

I thought I leave you with a letter or a fiery speech
Like when an actor makes an exit at the end of a play

I like to know why you gave up and threw it away
I like to give you all the reasons and what everything meant

And read 'em and weep

[Chorus]

I've been whispering softly
Trying to build a cry up to a scream
We let the past slip away
And put the future on hold
Now the present is nothing but a hollowed out dream
And I've been dreaming forever
Hoping something would eventually come
I saw your eyes in the dark
I felt your kiss on my lips
I traced your body in the air

Oh why

There will be peace, and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope is shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't that sun appear

We're caught in a cloud, with too much rain
We're lost in a world, with too much pain
But as long as a man, has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly, and fly

But I am sure that the answer's gonna come somehow

Just the other day
Yes, I flew in from the West Coast
And we circled J.F.K.

The movie ended and I pulled up the shade
Looked out the window while the Muzak played

But in my head I'm singin'
Singin' the Brooklyn Blues, oh, yeah

When you're growin' up in Brooklyn
The Bridge is like a friend
Said when you're growin' up in Brooklyn
That Bridge is sure your friend

Because that river looks a hundred miles wide
When all your dreams are on the other side

And that can start you singin'
Singin' the Brooklyn Blues, oh, yeah

Now I've got myself some money
A mansion in Bel-aire
Yes, I've spent a lot of money
And I've been most everywhere

But still there's somethin' missin' I've got to find
A part of me I must have left behind

That makes a guy start feelin'
Feelin' those Brooklyn Blues, my my

I've sung love songs to a princess
More than once or twice
I've sung rock 'n' roll in Paris
Jazz in paradise

But there's a song of mine I couldn't have sung
A tune I started back when I was young

Now I've come home to finish
Finish my Brooklyn Blues, my Brooklyn Blues

Night becomes the dawn

Words tear us up just like a storm
Now love is gone, leaving us strangers

The morning sky fills with rain
Nothing feels the same

Time leaves me remembering dreams
And places we've been
And how it all changes

I'm afraid you'll be gone
With no reason or rhyme
So if I borrow
A bit of tomorrow
Is that such a crime?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wandered down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright you are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew

Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

In my heart it will remain

I belong with you, you belong with me?

Merry Christmas to you

Too see if reindeer even know how to fly

In April weather
When the meadow was bloomin'
We walk together
To the top of the hill
Upon the clover
When the meadow was bloomin'
We dreamed together
Just us true lovers will
But summer flies on
Far across the horizon
And winter lies on
Over the valley and hills
Do you remember
When the meadow was bloomin'
In bleak December
Do you think of me still
But summer flies on
Far across the horizon
And winter lies on
Over the valley and hills
Do you remember
When the meadow was bloomin'
In bleak December
Do you think of me still
Do you remember
Just as I always will

I got evenings to spare
That nobody will share
I guess there ain't no Santa Clause
I don't flirt, I don't dance
Cause I don't get a chance
I guess there ain't no Santa Clause

Wedding Bells
Ring so merely
But Jingle Bells
And Wedding Bells
Never ring for me
Like the clock on the shelf
I hold hands with myself
I guess there ain't no Santa Claus
I got wine, I got cheer
I got nobody here
I guess there ain't no Santa Claus
Well they sure got it right
When they sing Silent Night
I guess there ain't no Santa Claus
Lovers walk, holding hands
Everywhere I go
Ready, set, here I stand
'neath the mistle toe
Sugarplums in my head
Only me in my bed
I guess there ain't no Santa Claus
My dad and mother
Told one another
They saw a future for me
But since I've grown up
I got to own up
It's not like they said it would be
Lovers walk, holding hands
Everywhere I go
Ready, set, here I stand

And I have him with me always. 
There's a kid inside, 
Walking down old high school hallways. 
Where's a kid inside, 
At a desk, at a dance, in the halls,in the showers. 

There's a kid inside to this very day. 
And he makes a try for that high pop fly, 
That I fumbled one September. 
And he makes a fuss over some A plus, 
That I shouldn't still remember. 

And he goes along, 
Getting hurt, getting mad, fighting fights that are over. 
And unless I'm strong, 
All my senses are carried away. 

I can feel my hand, my trembling hand, 
On Michelle's angora sweater. 
I can hear my band, that awful band,
Only now it sounds much better. 

I can see the kid, the kid I use to be, 
On the stage, on the field, on the lunch line. 
I can feel him tugging at me, 
Every time I think I don't care I blink, 
And he's there, he's there again. 

Fighting ancient wrongs, 
Humming old hit songs in my head. 
Singing come along, come along, 
Come along for the ride. 

To a time and place, 
I could not forget if I tried. 
And I never know, when the breeze'll blow, 
With a rush of old sensation. 

Why the kid should wake, 
And my heart should ache, 
Every time I smell carnations.
Something rings the bell, 
Any thing at all, 
All it takes is a slam of a locker. 

Or the switch from summer or fall, 
A change of season seems barely reason, 
But there he goes, he's there again.

Humming old hit songs in my head. 
Singing come along, come along, 
Come along for the ride.

And I scanned all the sky

And blow on some other guys dice

Barry Manilow,"We walked to the sea, just my father and me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air, hangin' still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say, ""Hold my hand""
I said, ""Love's easier when it's far away""
We sat and watched a distant light

We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say, ""It's alright""
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said, ""It's harder now we're far away""
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We're just ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight",Ships [Live],1992

Raining down as cold as ice
A shadow of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night

Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on a breeze

raining down as cold as ice. 
Shadows of a man, 
a face through a window cryin' in the night, 
the night goes into 

Morning just another day; 
happy people pass my way. 
Looking in their eyes, 
I see a memory I never realized 
how happy you made me. 

Oh Mandy well, 
you came and you gave without taking, 
but I sent you away. 
Oh, Mandy well, 
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking, 
and I need you today. Oh, Mandy! 

I'm standing on the edge of time; 
I walked away when love was mine. 
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing, 
the tears are on my mind 
and nothin' is rhyming. 

Oh Mandy well, 
you came and you gave without taking, 
but I sent you away. 
Oh, Mandy well, 
you kissed me and stopped me from shaking, 
and I need you today. Oh, Mandy!

cryin' on the breeze, the pain is callin'

And maybe the old songs will bring back the old times 
Maybe the old lines will sound new

Maybe old feelings will come through 

Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why we ever walked away 
Maybe the old songs will bring back the old times

'Til she feels the words hanging between them

Depressed for a while
When the youngest was born
Oh but that happens now and again

She might take a drink with the housework
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop
A Martini or two before dinner

When a glass fell and broke on the tile
And she cut her wrist (quite by mistake)

The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
We speak and the angels sing
Or am I reading music into every word

I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore
Then suddenly I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all, your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave there music ringing in my heart

Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'

Your eyes that promise sweet nights,
Bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love devine.
In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you,
Our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so sublime

Those cool and limpid green eyes -
A pool wherein my love lies.

So deep that in my searching for happiness
I fear that they will ever haunt me,
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me?
Green eyes, make my dreams come true.

And nights were always filled with stars

I gotta find who's now the number one

Come dance with me, what an evening for some terpsichore. 
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place, come on dance with me, 
Romance with me on a crowded floor. 
And while the rhythm swings, what lovely things I'll be sayin', 
For what is dancing but making love set to music, playin'. 
When the band begin to leave the stand and folks start to roam, 
As we wing home, cheek to cheek we'll be, 
Come on, come on, come on, come on now 
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away 
If you can use, some exotic booze 
There's a bar in far Bombay 
Come fly with me, come fly, lets fly away 
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru 
In lama land, there's a one man band 
And he'll toot his flute for you 
Come fly with me, lets take of in the blue 
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied 
We'll just glide, starry eyed 
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near 
You may here, angels cheer - cause were together 
Weather wise it's such a lovely day 
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds

Like painted kites, the days and nights went flyin' by 
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky

And I lost you, to the summer wind

Fine a world for me out there

A face, a place so right for me

Neon flutters out of sight

America unraveling
And swallowed in the hungry night

With no goodbyes
When I'll simply grab

And break the freeze
And win her heart with harmony

Barry Manilow,"Salin' can save me
Or I drown evermore
But I'm on the waves
With you on the shore

Never mind
One find day
In some bar
By the harbor
I'll find you
There you'll be
As you where
Corner stool
By the jukebox
Watin' for me

I can remember

Sweet child
Gone a mile
Swayin' your head
To the crazy ragtime
Sayin' ""hey you got a quater?
Hey you look familiar
Hey you got a quater?
Let's dance to the ragtime""

Slow down
Don't time fly
Chased your smile
To some cold dingy attic
Now memories of
A room we shared
Heaven and home to me longer
And longer ago

I can remember

Time's up
Callin' ships all of the sounds
Of a restless harbor

You said ""hey you look familiar
Come on you remember
Hey you got a quater?
Let's dance to the ragtime
Sailin' has saved me
From drownin' evermore
But I'm on the waves
And you on the shore

Never mind
One find day
In some bar by the harbor
I'll find you
Boozy, scared
Breakin' down
Tellin' the bouncer be cool
'Cause you're waitin' for me

Like I been dreamin'

That's you
Swingin' 'round
Pushin' your way like
A star to the jukebox

Sayin' hey ya' got a quater?
Hey don't you remember?
Let's dance to the ragtime!
Hey ya' got a quater?

Hey don't you remember?""
Why must I remember?

Never mind
One find day
In some bar by the harbor
I'll find you
I'll find you

Yes will dance to the ragtime
Will we dance and to the ragtime
Yes will dance to the ragtime",Some Bar by the Harbor,2001
Barry Manilow,"After it was over,
After the crying and
All the angry shouting
When we've both just given up
And you turned and closed the door
I didn't know what was wrong anymore
Than I did before

Maybe it was over
When you stopped trying
Or when I started doubting
Maybe you don't care enough
Maybe I'm just scared you'll go
But maybe what's really wrong is that
I still don't really know

Talk to me quietly, peacefully
Tell me what to do
Talk to me honestly, don't you see I need to talk to you

I need to hear that we're okay
And say the things I meant to say

So, talk to me before
Before it's really over

When it all was starting
When I first met you
We couldn't keep from talking

I knew everything you felt
And I felt you knew me too
Now I'm talking to myself
Or I'm just yelling back at you

How this could have happened
How I could loose you
Or you could think to leave me
After where we started from
I'm too dumb I guess to see
But you can't go till I do
Any you know you owe that to me

Talk to me quietly, peacefully
I don't want to fight
Talk to me nice and slow
So I'll know how to make it right

I'm not afraid to take the blame
I'm just afraid we'll stay the same
And we won't talk until
Until it's really over

I don't understand why you're always mad
What could I have done?
What could be so bad?
Don't you want to know why I never sleep?
Look what we've become from all these secrets
That we keep

When it's really over
'Cause I can't take it
Or you've walked out for the last time
When these years are just a dream
And those tears somehow have dried
I can't wake up in my bed
And regret what we never tried

So, please don't say it's over
Don't even think it
Just think about the good times
Think of all we've got to loose
And not who's done what to who
And when it comes time to choose
Think of who would still die for you

Talk to me quietly, peacefully
Make me understand
Say what you need to say
By the way-take me by the hand

The only thing I ask of you
Is please for once just listen to
And talk to me before
Before it's really over

Talk to me
Before it's really over",Talk to Me,2001
Barry Manilow,"In my life
I have seen
Far away places
Wild and serene
But nothing I saw
Prepared me for
The mat on the floor
Saying ""welcome home""

Time flies
See the moon rise
As I'm makin' my way
Through another long day
But I'll go
To a place I know
In my heart I know
There's just no place
Like home

Welcome home
Welcome home
To that place
That's safe and warm
Always a shelter
From the storm
I'm going home
Welcome home
Roll out the welcome mat
For me!
I'm goin' home

Sometimes
I remember
All the days I never knew
If I would ever make it through
But just when
I'd give up again
I'd remember when the days
Were stormy
Home was always
Waitin' for me
Sayin'

Welcome home
Welcome home
Where there will always be
A welcoming light on
Just for me
When I go home
Welcome home
No place
That I would rather be
Than goin' home

In my heart I know
That someday when my time
Is drawing near
I'm gonna hear

Welcome home
Where there will always be
Somebody waiting
There for me
When I go home
Home sweet home
Everyone's smilin' just for me

There for me

Barry Manilow,"Every single day
We'll remember what we do today
Words we didn't say
We'll remember every single day
Then years go by
To wonder why and wonder what we learned
Was that the bridge we should've crossed?
The one we burned

Every empty night
To regret a life that could'a been
Maybe you were right
Just forget that emptiness within
So if you go
Before that moment's gone
Look at me the way
I'll remember every single day
From now on

You deserve
I don't knowâ?¦
Whatâ?¦
The man I'd love to be
That's not the way it turned out
No you fell in love with me

Everything you doubt
I will fight for
Every single day
Help me work it out
Make it right for
Every single day
But this I swear
And stake my life upon
If you go or stay
I will love you
As I do today
And I'll love you
Every single day
From now on

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready

They said we'd never last
A week, a month, a year
They shook their head
Dream on, they said, 'cause dreamers disappear
But here we are, no matter what they say
It's you and me forever and a day

We knew we had it right
We knew we broke the mold
They said have fun, it's kiss and run
Then back out in the cold
I could have told them
We were here to stay
To you and me forever and a day

Didn't we show them
Aren't they blown away
'Cause what ever time may do
Our love is through, forever

And once our hearts were full
And once we felt the flame
Such hunger then, much younger then
But really we're the same

And once the music played
And once they lit the light
And years ago, we felt a glow
So very like tonight

And now I know
It will always be that way
For you, for me,
Forever and a day

Unforgettable harmony
Harmony
First there was harmony
And there was rhyme
This was our time

Harmony
Did we have harmony
And that's just about all we had!
Suddenly
A little harmony
And the poverty's not so bad
Thin, we were
Poor as sin in berlin, we were!
Patches on our pants
Mercif'lly, when you're in harmony
You're in a trance
Others went marching
Not us, we'd dance

No one in grodnogubernia
Ever learned to dance like this!

Spoken:
(Believe it or not I was a rabbi before all this started!
In grodnogubernia yet!)

If you're in grodnogubernia
Tell em', this you shouldn't miss!

Harmony
All arm in arm were we
Well, except when the punches flew
Squabbles, sure
But squabbles don't endure
When there's harmony in the brew
Then did we
Oh, so splendidly blend, did we
Like a spell had come
It was clear
My pals and I could hear
A different drum
Outside they hollered!
But we hadâ?¦harmony!

In this joint
All encounters with counterpoint
End in harmony
And it's clear
No man's a solo here
Not even me
No solo mio!

No we've got harmony!
When we've got harmony
Then just maybe we've got a chance
Harmony, the best is harmony!
And the rest is a song and dance!

Where you find
You're in harmony
There you find
Shelter in a storm
Every note
A button on the coat
That keeps you warm
Stars have the heavens
But we've got harmony!
Harmony!
Harmony!
Harmony!
Troubles disappear
And what you feel is what you hear
Not what you see!
Yes, first there was
Harmony!

Barry Manilow,"There goes the girl in the arms of someone new
Night after night I can see the life
She's stumbing through
And I know that she'll never notice me
But I still look for a sign

'cause she should'a been mine
She could'a been mine
We would'a been sharing love until the end of
Time
I should'a known how
We would'a been close to paradise by now
If it could'a been
It would'a been
Still she should'a been mine

sometimes she smiles when I see her passing by
Sometime she waves
When she turns and whispers ""hi"", again
And I see the pain of the life she lives
Yet I'm hoping for a sign

'cause she should'a been mine
She could'a been mine
We would'a been sharing love until the end of
Time
I should'a known how
We would'a been close to paradise by now
If it could'a been

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Barry Manilow,"Every day
As I sit and stare through my window
I look out
At a world that's tearing apart
This is what I see
And what do you see?

Time goes by
And the times get worse
Through my window
Still I watch
As the madness darkens the heart
This is what I see.
And what do you see?

Tell me how do we live in a world
That is crumbling away--
And be happy
As we are today?

Still I watch
As I pin my hopes on the future
Still I wait
Wond'ring what in heaven will be--
Is this an ending
Or a beginning
That I see?
And what do you see?

And at times it appears that our happiness
Hangs by a thread
Can we hold on
Through what lies ahead?

People say
I should turn away
From the window
All the worry
In all the world doesn't pay
And still I wonder
What kind of future
Starts this way?
For you...
And me....
And what do you see?



",And What Do You See?,2004
Barry Manilow,"There are times
You live as if in a dream
Drawn by your heart to a distant door
One that opens
For a moment
To a world that you've never known before
Were you real
Or were you part of a dream
Calling to me from across the floor?
In your sweet voice
There was music
And we danced the Bolero de Amor
Let the drums carry us away!
They say all there is to say
And all too soon the night becomes the day
And magical, miracle
You are real
And we are living a dream
Sharing a love we have hungered for
Let your passion soar like music
In the spell of Bolero de Amor
The drums carried us away
They said all there was to say
And all too soon the night became day
And magical-miracle

Drawn by your heart to a distant door

How in the world?
Now that I've found you
You are my world
In these times that keep us guessing
You're my answer and my blessing
Pretty damn amazing, given
This peculiar world we live in

In this world
That's lost all its reason
At last there's a reason
For hope in my heart
In this world
Unsure of its future
So sure of you
I say, let the future start!
In this world
That's yearning for someone
To answer the call
From out of the blue
In this world
I prayed there would come one
Magnificent someone

Look at the stars
How brilliant they are
How can they be shining now
When hope seems so far?

Look
Look how they shine
These cruelest of stars
What promise inspires them?
What faith is it fires them?

Darkness grows
The world turns cold
And still there glows the light
Heaven knows
What hope they hold tonight

Look
Look how they tease
These stars in the night
The darker the night becomes
The brighter their light becomes

Chill winds wail
The tempest brews
And clouds assail the sky
Through the veil
The stars refuse to die!

In this world
Of darkest night
Where hope is hurled away
There they are
And still there's light
Oh so far
But will they...?
Dare they lift our hearts
As we lift our eyes
Are we fools to see
The hope that's gleaming in the skies?
Look!
There's the light!

Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry

No cabs to be had out there

To break this spell 
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

You got me goofy and gay.

Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tears

Calling a name that's lighter than air
Who's bending down to give me a rainbow

Who's tripping down the streets of the city
Smilin' at everybody she sees
Who's reachin' out to capture a moment
Everyone knows it's Windy

And Windy has wings to fly
Above the clouds (Above the clouds)

That I want you just like a thousand other guys

Barry Manilow,"If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show
The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you

You come and pour yourself on me

I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

Spinning slowly down to die

Then you and I would simply fly away",If,2007

That's when my song began

How can I thank you for the love
You've given me
With all my heart I hope
You'll see what I see
I've got the best seat in the house
I've got the most beautiful view
You can't imagine how it feels
Just sitting here looking at you
I've got the best seat in the house

Night after night
I look at you
And try to be the best I can be
Knowing you'll see me through
I swear I'll never take your love for granted
I'd never trade the dreams that you made come true
It's sweet to know
We're growing closer
Every year
With all my heart I hope
You'll keep this place here

I've got the best seat in the house
I've got the most beautiful view
You can't imagine how it feels
Just sitting here looking at you
That's what I love to do
I've got the best seat in the house
I'll tell you I got the most beautiful view
You can't imagine how it feels
Just sitting here looking at you
I've got the best seat in the house

Barry Manilow,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation

We can ride it together, 
Making love with each other 

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever

We can ride it together,
Making love with each other,

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, 
From one lover to another",Islands in the Stream,2010

Gotta make you understand

We've know each other for so long
Your heart's been aching
But you're too shy to say it

And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

I'm waiting to tell you

They promised I'd lose

But I want you to know I was there last night
I was there, I was there, I was there,

I'd rather hurt you honestly, than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you on what you say or do

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance and all it's strategies, leaves me battling with my pride
But through all the insecurity some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you and drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through and hold you endlessly

At times I understand you, I know how hard you try
I've watched while love commands you and I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters, still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister but then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

[Chorus:]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

[Chorus]

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love,2006

You know where? Underground. You should see it down there, hundreds of miles of drains, sweet and clean now after the rain, dark, quiet, safe. We can build houses and everything, start again from scratch. And what's so bad about living underground, eh? S'not been so great living up here, if you want my opinion.

      Maybe from the madness, something beautiful will grow
      In a brave new world, with just a handful of men,

      All over again! All over again! All over again!

We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP!

      Artilleryman: It's doing the working and the thinking that wears a fellow out. I'm ready for a bit of a rest. How about a drink, eh? Nothing but champagne now I'm the boss.

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Barry Morgan,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, the homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. All that was of value to me was in London. By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper. Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. At that very moment, it was raised, and I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

When you've been out somewhere instead
I wonder if you care and cannot bear the proof

Would sift the evidence, then move
It's the only thing to do
So why then can't I face the facts?
Sift this evidence that backs
I am so in love with you
But all the nights when you have said
You must be somewhere else instead
I wonder where you go, but daren't expose the proof

Like the grapes of the vine

In my arms there's
A safety zone

How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seein' her with him tends to enlarge it

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

That's where the two will go,

Before you can count up
One, two, three.

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

Barry White,"She's a yellow pair of running shoes
A holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses
She looks great in anything

She's 'I want a piece of chocolate'
'Take me to a movie'
She's 'I can't find a thing to wear'
Now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof
With her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land
And a good feeling knowing

She's a warm conversation
That I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad
And she's a lover when she's loving

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town
And a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck
And a cuss word 'cause it's Monday

She's a bubble bath and candles
Baby, come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine
And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
Of my unborn children's mother

She's the hand that I'm holding
When I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her, I go on and on and on
'Cause she's everything to me

She's the voice I love to hear
Someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair
I want rocking right beside me

Every day that passes
I only love her more
Yeah, she's the one
That I'd lay down my own life for

And she's everything I ever wanted
And everything I need

And everything I need

Take back a wasted life?
Or do we only get one?

I saw the woman I love colored in blood
War is hell, I cut shells, was then covered in mud
As four ships hovered above, my heart griefs
But at least she didn't take the mark of the beast
Rest in peace boo
If I blessed then I'ma meet you on the other side
But for now I gotta slide
Through physical mindfields
Miserable is how my mind feels knowin it's long time to heal
Shit is real
Another black mold in a hole
God rest your soul as you travel back home
I'll carry your essence in the thoughts I'm manifestin
As pleasent memories outshine my depression
My physical stress says it's time to rest
Bein chased by the devil tryin to take my breath
Ain't a place on the Earth that you can't get touched
If I get bucked let my melanin rust hit the dust

Livin jet set, everything connect
Fitted like a seam double stitched
If I had a scratch she knew where to find the itch
Many warm hugs and soapy back rubs
Candlelight's held tight at the hips every night
My soul is cold boo, I can't abandon ship
Cause of false reactions, I miss you with a passion
Your new being represents a universal mean
So rise like cream black queen
Unfortunately you died in my arms
From a stray bullet from afar
That ripped through the car
My dreams are intense with very little sense
My pretense cracked to find an honor like a track boo
I want to follow in pursuit
What I got to do, what I got to do

The radio a blasting,
The good times a coming.

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,
Barry Wood,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2002

[Bars & Hooks]
We ain't goin platinum (nope) we ain't goin gold
We goin diamond - ten million sold
We break records (records) and move units, that's how we do it
(Do it do it) Makin millions and billions from movies and music
World tourin, shows, performin
The deals, the budgets, accounts, enormous
We got it (got it) you frontin, you need it, you want it
The Mobb, and Bars, and Hooks, we comin
Delorean, and Mr. Bars, how about that?
We some Queensbridge niggaz that ain't all about rap
We own streets, run websites, log on
To the one and only, InfamousStores.com
We load up the tour buses, to get these checks
We independent, we don't need your respect
We +Infamous Minded+, you've been blinded
It's Bars & Hooks nigga, we.. goin.. diamond!

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Yeah, what more do y'all want from us?
We spill our hearts out and it still ain't enough
Years we got crumbs, doin the supplyin
We independent now - we.. goin.. diamond!
Yeah, what more could you ask for?
We the team, we deserve everything and more
All the blood and sweat for our dead we stopped cryin
Swallowed it, survived it - we.. goin.. diamond!

[Prodigy]
You might catch me steppin out the Lamborghini
With ashy legs, my chain swingin
I grab my piece, so that shit won't damage the paint
Chest naked holdin a drink
We got these hoes by the brain, we black rap moguls
We the most poppin, we the illest niggaz rhymin
Let's go team for team, you don't want that
We make niggaz quit rap, we so violent
The only thing that calm us down is more dollars
We need NBA cash, the yachts, the labs
The Porsche, Ferrari, the Hummer, you mad?
AK-90, the sigs, the macs
Grenades, silencers, sterlings that blast
To Linden, the sweeper to murder yo' ass
You doubted my niggaz (WORD) now we up
Yeah, you musta been wildin - we.. goin.. diamond!

[Chorus: 2nd half + 1st half reversed]

[Bars & Hooks]
We gon' kill 'em with this here, and ship ten million
This year, look on the charts it's there
At the number one spot, locked of course
By these ghetto street pharmacist entrepreneurs
Who woulda thought? The car I always wanted get bought
Sittin on ten times twos, rollin by you
It gets bigger, I remember bein broke
So the plan now is to get richer
Ain't gon' be no scufflin my nigga, I ain't gon' fight ya
I'ma pay the piper to snipe ya, it's real like that
Goin diamond make you feel like that
Cause I done been through the bullshit, dealt with the bullshit
Now I'm lampin, mansion, and a few whips
Ain't nothin but a thug thing, this the club theme
Bars & Hooks to H.N.I.C. we climbin
Finally we shinin - we.. goin.. diamond!

[Chorus]

Fuck y'all niggaz man
We goin diamond.. we goin diamond..
Knahmsayin? Move these units.. do these shows..
And hold this money.. hold the cash
We goin diamond.. goin diamond..
We goin diamond.. diamond diamond diamond
We goin diamond.. we goin diamond..
We goin diamond, we goin diamoind..

Bart Millard,"A lot of us grew up believing
At any moment we could lose it all
And at the drop of a hat
God might turn His back and move on
A lot of us feel like we blew it
Thinking that we're just too far gone
But I want you to know
There's still a hope for you now

No matter what you've done
You can't erase His love
Nothing can change it
You're not separated

There's never been a better time to get honest
There's never been a better time to get clean
So come as you are
Run to the cross and be free

Bart Simpson,"I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

There I go, here I go, where I go, I don't know
I just can't help myself, so
Why do I do, what I do, when I do
Well, I can say so or I just don't know

Boys will be boys and what they usually say
That's the how and the why, that I act this way
That's the end of the line, I run out of rhyme
That ain't no crime so it's milk it out time

Let's see, I know it's some cosmic force
Causing my mind, you go,
Just wait out of course to another dimension
Not only of site and sound but of being a clown

Or an alley cat, or a dirty rat or a loud mouth brat
Well, I am all that, so if you ask me, why
I'm always in such a mess
Well, ha, I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

A very great lady, once said it right
A woman needs a man, like a fish needs a bike
There I go again sister know it all
No friends at all, 'cause I make them crawl

I can help showing off, all that I know
The whats can do, well is the wheres I could go
I know, it's makes the family very uptight
I know, it isn't right, but I do it every night

I'm probably don't belong here, I'm certainly were wrong here
Every night I have a dream, more like a nightmare
I see myself being born, Mum and dad are there
But it's not Marge and it's not Homer

Switched in a cradle, no wonder I'm a goner
I feel like a book, that's on the wrong shelve
I know, I shouldn't think it, but
I just can't help myself

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself
I just can't help myself, I just can't help myself

Hey, you know, I kinda like this thing
It's sort of like music, but you don't have to sing
You got none of the work and all of the fun
Like a low cal donut or a fat free bun

By the way, that's reminds me, how about a snack
Just a small sandwich or a cold six-pack
A big pack of pork rinds that couldn't hurt
A cake for dessert will keep my mind alert

Oh, it takes a lot of energy to do this rap
I feel kinda sleepy, better take a nap
Not too long a nap, two hours, that's a winner
I wouldn't wanna sleep to a roast beef dinner

Roast beef with gravy and potatoes
Hot rolls and butter, lettuce and tomatoes
I know, I shouldn't eat it, I got to keep my health
What's the hey, I can't help me

Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself
Can't help me, I just can't help myself

Bart Varsalona,"He would spend it on the ponies,
He would spend it on the girls,
Buy his mother gin and roses
For her poor old henna'd curls.
And when his wife said, ""Hey now!
What did you get for me?""
He socked her in the chopper,
Such a sweet sweet guy was he!

And her tears flowed like wine,
Yes her tears flowed like wine,
She's a real sad tomato,
She's a busted valentine.
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind.

How he loved the old race horses,
He would bet them every day.
One day he caught a winner
And the cabbage wasn't hay!
He indulged in fancy spending,
Ordered rings, cars and furs,
But alas, alack,
Like a stab in the back,
She found out they were not hers!

And her tears flowed like wine,
Yes her tears flowed like wine,
She's a real sad tomato,
She's a busted valentine.
Knows her mama done told her
That her man is darned unkind.

He got mixed up with a Maisie,
He got mixed up with a Flo,
So Flo shoved him in the river,
He'll not get mixed up no more!
His wife then draped herself in black
That showed her figure fine,
Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy,
No insurance could she find.

Barthelemy Rosso,"Je vivais à l'écart de la place publique,
Serein, contemplatif, ténébreux, bucolique...
Refusant d'acquitter la rançon de la gloir',
Sur mon brin de laurier je dormais comme un loir.
Les gens de bon conseil ont su me fair' comprendre
Qu'à l'homme de la ru' j'avais des compt's à rendre
Et que, sous peine de choir dans un oubli complet,
J' devais mettre au grand jour tous mes petits secrets.

{Refrain:}
Trompettes
De la Renommée,
Vous êtes
Bien mal embouchées !

Manquant à la pudeur la plus élémentaire,
Dois-je, pour les besoins d' la caus' publicitaire,
Divulguer avec qui, et dans quell' position
Je plonge dans le stupre et la fornication ?
Si je publi' des noms, combien de Pénélopes
Passeront illico pour de fieffé's salopes,
Combien de bons amis me r'gard'ront de travers,
Combien je recevrai de coups de revolver !

A toute exhibition, ma nature est rétive,
Souffrant d'un' modesti' quasiment maladive,
Je ne fais voir mes organes procréateurs
A personne, excepté mes femm's et mes docteurs.
Dois-je, pour défrayer la chroniqu' des scandales,
Battre l' tambour avec mes parti's génitales,
Dois-je les arborer plus ostensiblement,
Comme un enfant de ch?ur porte un saint sacrement ?

Une femme du monde, et qui souvent me laisse
Fair' mes quat' voluptés dans ses quartiers d' noblesse,
M'a sournois'ment passé, sur son divan de soi',
Des parasit's du plus bas étage qui soit...
Sous prétexte de bruit, sous couleur de réclame,
Ai-j' le droit de ternir l'honneur de cette dame
En criant sur les toits, et sur l'air des lampions :
"" Madame la marquis' m'a foutu des morpions ! "" ?

Le ciel en soit loué, je vis en bonne entente
Avec le Pèr' Duval, la calotte chantante,
Lui, le catéchumène, et moi, l'énergumèn',
Il me laisse dire merd', je lui laiss' dire amen,
En accord avec lui, dois-je écrir' dans la presse
Qu'un soir je l'ai surpris aux genoux d' ma maîtresse,
Chantant la mélopé' d'une voix qui susurre,
Tandis qu'ell' lui cherchait des poux dans la tonsure ?

Avec qui, ventrebleu ! faut-il que je couche
Pour fair' parler un peu la déesse aux cent bouches ?
Faut-il qu'un' femme célèbre, une étoile, une star,
Vienn' prendre entre mes bras la plac' de ma guitar' ?
Pour exciter le peuple et les folliculaires,
Qui'est-c' qui veut me prêter sa croupe populaire,
Qui'est-c' qui veut m' laisser faire, in naturalibus,
Un p'tit peu d'alpinism' sur son mont de Vénus ?

Sonneraient-ell's plus fort, ces divines trompettes,
Si, comm' tout un chacun, j'étais un peu tapette,
Si je me déhanchais comme une demoiselle
Et prenais tout à coup des allur's de gazelle ?
Mais je ne sache pas qu'ça profite à ces drôles
De jouer le jeu d' l'amour en inversant les rôles,
Qu'ça confère à ma gloire un' onc' de plus-valu',
Le crim' pédérastique, aujourd'hui, ne pai' plus.

Après c'tour d'horizon des mille et un' recettes
Qui vous val'nt à coup sûr les honneurs des gazettes,
J'aime mieux m'en tenir à ma premièr' façon
Et me gratter le ventre en chantant des chansons.
Si le public en veut, je les sors dare-dare,
S'il n'en veut pas je les remets dans ma guitare.

A southern nigga with a New York mind
In the concrete jungle of Queens trying to be Kings
Getting to the money of sins by any means

Shot a brother in the head, thank the lord he ain't dead
Was in a coma for months, eyes ain't opened them once

Blood money spills, had a real revelation

Sometimes I wanna save the world and I be thinking bout how

So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through
Yea, let's do that

You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin'
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin' online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, uhm world don't you forget that

Long as a ho still give up for me

Scared of the days you'll be seeing me

Shine black man melanin gold
I hope you never get old
Keep your youthful spirit
I know the world do fear it
You're the tip of the spear
And with our dyin' breaths, I bet the world gon' hear it, look
I been saving money for my taxes
Bassy keep on jumpin' through these brackets
I got 20 bitches coming back to the crib
I make sure my niggas got some racks, what you need?
They gon' shoot through niggas like it's practice
I just make the money, run some laps
Every time I pass go see the cash grow
We don't even act cordial, we assholes
Bitches in my lasso, is that so?
That's word to my last hoe, I'm that cold
Runnin' through the town a black soul
My past froze twenty-nine times over
Look I have seen more than my time
Lived 9 lives for about twenty cats over, I told ya
Everything you've done I done overdid, I'm over it
Nigga, Dreamville the whole coast how we shouldered it?
Them boys stale like toast when it's overdid
I hope they quit for real
But if they don't I got a million joints
I got the flow in pocket, the emoji rocket how I'm outta here
A lot of em' sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Keeping both eyes open wide rain man
Crew high on that fuck your life drank man
We slide in the bucket like paint
Never gave a fuck, fuck what you might think
Ran up in the club 'till they sent the lights in
Had to tell the owner please let the lights dim
Five more minutes see me a nice slim
Thick bitch with the you, me and my grin
Tell her bring the crew you me and my friends
See where the night end with the right guys
Trust me and my kin, speak with the right pen
Creep like the lightning in the night sky
Go deep Janet Jackson, we back to back in
Black SUV's, black tints would you look at that?
I'm booby-trapped in your fluid black skin
No groupie action, your bougie accent
You're truly classic, girl we outta here

Bas, it's Bassy
Queens nigga with the Fiends nigga
Got the bean waitin' in the pocket ooh

I asked P, what's poppin'?
He said we are nigga, trips to DR nigga
Got the borough jumpin' like it's J.R. Smith
Know a couple niggas' let the A-R spit
Got no interest what you say y'all did
Only where y'all live
Smokin' blunts 'cause that's the way I live
And where I live?
Niggas dyin' front of their shorty, wives
And their brother's ride on the other side
Every death is like a 100 lives
Flatlined from the black nine
I could feel the pressure multiplying
Make you feel like ain't no hope in trying
But we always trying
All this blood I bet it float to sea and wash out
'Cause they don't want you to see but watch out
Nigga watch out

See I want you to see
I've been through so many things
Things ain't always what they seem
Hope you get the message
I hope you figure it out (you figure it out)
Now I'm right where I belong
Had to let it go
All the pain I was holding on
Now I get the message
I had to figure it out

I couldn't go on without you

You tried to knock me down
I would go on without you

Now you're feeling my pain

You'll end up old and lonely
If you don't get a bullet in your head

Good luck good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares honey
When your're resting your head 

You sold me sold me
Sold me down the river now
Hope you're feeling happy now
Now you'll always have a sneer in your smile

But wake up baby
You're so totally deluded
You'll end up old and lonely
If you don't get a bullet in your head

Good luck good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares honey
When you're resting your head 

And I'm glad so glad that I'm done with you
No more crying crying leaving me so black and blue
You backed me up against the wall but I stand tall
Don't give a damn no more

Oh baby bye bye
No more lies
No more lies 
No more lies
Without you

Good good luck 
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares when your resting your head
Good good luck 
In your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares

Good luck good luck
Good luck in your new bed
Enjoy your nightmares honey
