Vanessa da Mata,"Fé que você pode, você tem, você consegue
De onde é seu congá?
Quem é seu orixá?
O que importa é ser feliz
Um dia novo sempre vem, e isso vai passar
O que existe é o sol 
O resto é invenção
Fé que você pode, você tem

Não deixe de sorrir
Não deixe de dançar
Essa é uma boa reza
Dê esperança a quem precisa 
E o tempo vai cuidar de você e de todos nós
Essa é uma boa reza

Foi o que precisou
Pra mudar como eu estava
Eu já não queria amar mais

Vanessa Daou,"If I could, I'd climb inside of you
I'd look out from your eyes
To see the world you do

If I could, I'd reach into your mind
I'd die a thousand times
Keep coming back to you

Now it's time for me to feel your pain
To understand your shame
To know you like I should, if I could

If I could, I'd dive into your dreams
And drown beneath your tears
Swim the deepest sea

If I could, I'd wrap my love around
Break your defenses down
To bring you near to me

Now it's time for me to feel your pain
To understand your shame
To know you like I should, if I could

If I could, what I would do for you
What I would do, if I could

Vanessa Daou,"Share your nights
And your dreams
Share your feelings
Deep as they may seem
Your words may disappear
If no one's there to hear

Two to tango
Two to move
And all we've got to do
Is see it through
As the day fades away

Two to tango
When the evening comes
And the rain goes
With the midnight sun
If you find your place
Leave behind the troubles that
You face

Two to tango
Two to move
And all we've got to do
Is see it through
As the day fades away

In a twist of fate
Time will rearrange
All your answers
Then the questions change
There beyond you or I can see
All that is and all that has to be

Two to move
And all we've got to do
Is see it through
As the day fades away",Two to Tango,1996
Vanessa Daou,"I am the Universe ((IÂ´m free as a bird))
A strange machine digging in the dirt ((But who does it hurt))
Thunder rolls but no one listens ((They donÂ´t want to hear))
Dust will blow but red blood glistens
I am alive I am alive I am alive but IÂ´m cold inside

Now they reach beneath my skin ((Pleasure and sin))
Still I canÂ´t feel a thing ((TheyÂ´re drinking me in))
Now they put red lips on mine ((TheyÂ´re taking whatÂ´s mine))

Vanessa Daou,"ThereÂ´s fire on the mountain but itÂ´s just another sun. 
The Earth is next to nothing on
The horizon. Here the nights are crimson, the color of my heart. 
Closer to oblivion, light
Years apart. IÂ´m much too far from where you are. 

Life on a distant star. 
Time is always leaving everyone behind. 
Distance can shrink a mountain you though you
CouldnÂ´t climb. 

IÂ´m much too far from where you are. 
Life on a distant star. 
Do you if IÂ´m lonely? 
I wonder if you care. 

You canÂ´t run from isolation even though
You may be scared. 
IÂ´m much too far from where you are.

Vanessa Daou,"Now IÂ´m traveling with the shadows
At the speed of light
Back along the arrow of time
Trembling at the rising of the red dawn

High over winding roads
And empty streets
And lonely houses filled with
Soldiers and debutantes

Lovers and losers Teachers and hoarders
Players and cheaters Healers and doubters
Heroes and hustlers
And in everything I see chaos

And in everything order
I can decipher the waste and the shame
The giving the dying
And my place in the scheme
Is clear and pure as the cold midnight",Red Dawn,1997

DidnÂ´t know we could bend so far
But it donÂ´t bother me no, no
No it donÂ´t bother me

Sometimes we can break like glass
Hold on before we crash
But it donÂ´t bother me no, no

Swimming in your eyes of baby blue

IÂ´m swallowing the morning of your flower
Petal by petal IÂ´m laying you bare, red as any rose is

Let me turn your tears into wine
Let me turn your darkest hour into light
Let me turn your crow into a dove
Let me be the one to make you love
ItÂ´s four A.M. November ten, a vague and hazy time
You lie asleep, youÂ´re breathing like a child

Let me turn your tears into wine
Let me turn your darkest hour into light
Let me turn your crow into a dove
Let me be the one to make you love

In those words I create you
Into someone who will
Always come back
Once you've closed the door.
Into someone who will never refuse
When I ask for more.
But if I think I can own you
With some lavender prose
Or a violet song, I am wrong.
And if I think I can have you
With a salty kiss or a sultry dance,
Well, I canLisa Stansfield - Never Gonna Fall (junior Vasquez Mix)

Cause we've got nowhere left to go
Show me the freest kind of love tonight

The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?

Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement

Wonderin' if things would ever go right and if there was a spot up there for me

I reached for the star and it kissed me with its light
It made me cast a shadow that was silver and bright

And you see the look in my eyes 

[Chorus] 
I'd rather be with you, baby 
You know what you're doing to me 
You're the one, the only one 
That sets it all on fire 
Yeah you, baby 
(and I can see you want to be with me) 
Yeah you know what I'm saying is true 
I'd rather be with you 

It's you and me 
But then you call him over 
And your buddy makes three 
I know you're just trying to do right 
A glance, a touch 
Try not to stare just a little too much 
Baby, it's impossible to fight 
Best of intentions 
Do you really wanna give me away 
I'll take this moment to say 

[Chorus] 

It's only time 
I'll make you mine 
You know you can't deny me 
Come a little closer baby 
And tell your friend 
That I'm not really interested 
There is nothing more that you can do

Vanessa Hudgens,"Sometimes I feel like I'm a bird with broken wings
At times I dread my now and envy where I've been
But that's when quiet wisdom takes control
At least I've got a story no one's told
I finally learned to say
Whatever will be will be
I've learned to take
The good, the bad and breathe
'Cause although we like
To know what life's got planned
No one knows if shooting stars will land
These days it feels naive to put your faith in hope
To imitate a child, fall backwards on the snow
'Cause that's when fears will usually lead you blind
But now I try to under-analyze
Is the rope I walk wearing thin?
Is the life I love caving in?
Is the weight on your mind
A heavy black bird caged inside?
Say
Whatever will be will be
Take
The good, the bad
Just breathe
'Cause although we like
To know what life's got planned
No one knows if shooting stars will land

Are the people all who look and think like you

You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew

Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? Yeah

Come, run the hidden pine trails of the forest
And come, taste the sun, sweet berries of the earth
Come, roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth, no

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned

You see, my words can only hurt you
Till his shadow fades away

Don't ask why
Before we get too close
Just let me say goodbye
It's easier this way
Don't ask why
Before you ask the question
And I die inside
Just let me walk away

Just let me walk away

Vanessa Hudgens,"I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
All the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you

I've been gone so long,
I'm used to feeling alone
I estimated our love, my estimation was wrong
See I never knew what you were going through
But I just got back and now let's see where your at
How could you and tell that I ever be distracted by
Any other guy no matter if he ever caught my eyes
We just need time, some time to connect
What I'm tellin' you now hope you never forget

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
All the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me
To be the one the only one you wanna run to
Baby boy you know I just be gone too
Realize what's important to me
So Don't leave, Don't leave

Maybe I should try to put your need first
But my priorities were messed up and I know you got hurt
See I never knew what you were going through
But I just got back and now let's see where your at
Think about it take a moment just to rewind
Everything that you believe and everything that was right
Do you really want to stand there and tell me goodbye
When I'm sayin' I Still love you

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
All the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me
To be the one the only one you wanna run to
Baby boy you know I just be gone too
Realize what's important to me
So Don't leave, Don't leave

Lonely days and lonely night
That where you be without me by your side
Better think twice baby, oh, this could grow up crazy you know
I can't keep sayin' my secret cause it's out of control
I gave you everything by my heart and soul
But you keep breaking me taking me to another low
Don't do it baby don't do it don't let me go
I Don't know, I Don't know

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you
All the loneliness I would go through
But if you wanna leave I won't stop you
'Cause I don't want you if you don't want me

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on 
You do something to me that I can't explain 
Hold me closer and I feel no pain

How can we be wrong 
Sail away with me 
To another world 
And we rely on each other,  ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one 
And you walk in the night 
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry 
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together,  ah ha
Making love with each other,  ah ha

Vanessa Kafka,"What if I told you
You made me believe
That you were an angel
But I was deceived
You're only human
Flesh & bones
Another misfortune
Another sharp stone
That's stuck in my shoe
And now I am wondering
Why I wrote this song for you

What if I told you
That you weren't perfect
For me
That I was just playing
And you were my flavor of the week
Would you believe me
Or would you know
That I loved you
Yeah would you know
That I loved you

What if I told you
That you were an angel
And I am only human
Wondering why I wrote this song for you

Summer loving happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy, cute as can be

Summer days drifting away

Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?
Tell me more, tell me more

He ran by me, got my suit damp
I saved her life, she nearly drowned

But, uh, oh, the summer nights

Oh, Well-a, well-a well-a, huh
Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?

Took her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling, drank lemonade
We made out under the dock
We stayed up 'till ten o'clock

Summer fling, don't mean a thing
But, uh, oh, the summer nights

Well-a, well-a, well-a,
Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
'Cause he sounds like a drag

He got friendly, holding my hand
Well, she got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet just turned eighteen
Well, she was good you know what I mean

But, uh, oh, the summer nights
Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?

It turned colder, that's where it ends
So I told him we'd still be friends

You held me close (you held me close)
Said we could rewrite history
So how could you blow it
Now this song has no notes (no notes)
So what will the angels sing (I guess nothing)

Thought I was over my life's biggest hurdle
But oh no, no, no
It seems destiny's arrangement's circles
But that's how it goes

Everybody (everybody)
Would come to me (come to me)
Tellin me (tellin me)
The things they seen (things they seen)
Your girlfriend
Who lives for the limelight (limelight)
Well that's alright
If that's what you like

You just left a good girl (good girl, good girl)
A good girl you lost today (you lost today)
From such a good thing (good girl, good girl)
From such a good thing you walked away (you walked away)

You just left a good girl (good girl, good girl)
(not really a jealous girl)
A good girl you lost today
(my heart opened doors to a place you could walk through)
From such a good thing (good girl, good girl)
(more pictures than any girl)
From such a good thing you walked away
(truly your best friend someone that you could talk to)

Vanessa Martin,"Hay un reflejo de mujer mirÃ¡ndose,
En el espejo de los deseos,
Se acuerda tanto de un querer,
Que sin querer, al descubierto
Deja sus sentimientos
Volaran los dÃ­as de pasiÃ³n robada,
los silencios nunca cuentan la verdad
Caricias que no has de perder,
Destino y piel, morir, nacer,
Distancia y abismo
CADA V EZ QUE ESTOY SIN TI,
El atardecer mÃ¡s bello duele,
Cada lÃ¡grima por ti, apaga el sol
CADA VEZ QUE ESTOY SIN TI
La razÃ³n de mi universo muere
Cada instante que te di,
Fue en mi corazÃ³n, fue mi perdiciÃ³n
Mil y una noches pasarÃ¡n, en el desvÃ¡n
Donde duermen los sueÃ±os
Que paran el tiempo
Promesas de un amor sin fin,
Grabado en mi, lluvia en mis manos,
Agridulce mis besos
VolverÃ¡n los dÃ­as de pasiÃ³n robada,
Los silencios nunca cuentan la verdad

Esta herida me ha vestido
Desnudando mi fragilidad,
Este amor no tiene olvido,
Ni fecha de caducidad

Ich check die Straßenlage
Frauen schaukeln elegant vorbei genieß die Arschparade
Hab gute Karten grade weil ich nen Chromfahrrad fahre
Lade alle Babes ein auf ne Spritztour durch die Parkanlage
Hast du heute schon was vor?
Bräute stehn auf mein Humor
Bin Ingenieur für Baggertechnik, Bagger an verleg nen Rohr
Dann kommt sie ich bin verloren
Bin verliebt über beide Ohren
Ich winke, sie winkt nich
Ich wünschte ich wär nie geboren

Mach ma nich auf Drama hier
Ich knack dich wie ein Schalentier
Du wirkst irgendwie verspannt
Komm ich wird dich mal massieren
Hab dich analysiert
Bist hübsch aber blasiert
Gehst reiten, spielst Tennis
Und weinst wenn du mal verlierst
Bist attraktiv Babe 
Komm wir dreh ne Liebesszene
Schenk mir ma nen Lächeln ahh oder hast du schiefe Zähne?
Was gibt's zu überlegen? 
Ich bin was du suchst im Leben
Bitte bleib ma stehn ich versuch mit dir zu reden

Gestrandet mit deinem Floß an meinem Sandstrand
Junge schreib mir ne Ballade
Bin ne Perle mit Stil
Ich will nich alles von dir haben
Aber ich will viel

Geht gleich los, ich nehm nen Kurs
Häkel dir nen roten Teppich

Vor mir is ne Pfütze
Mach ne Brücke mach dich für mich dreckig

Ich kann singen, Bass entwickel

Da könnte sich was entwickeln

Kriegen Kinder wie Karnickel

Baby du bist Zucker mir wird heiß
Ich werd weich wie Butter
Schmilz wie Eis
Ohh ich wär so gern mit dir allein
Der Weg is weit
Es is egal wir haben Zeit 2,3
Sag mir was ich für dich kochen soll

Sahne Baby ich find deine Locken toll

Nur für dich hab ich die Haare schön

Dreh dich Zucker lass mich deine Ware sehn

L'effet uppercut.
Les filles, sans en avoir l'air,
Ça électrocute.

Tout au long de la vie qui pique,
On veut s'évader
En touchant, pour le physique,
Les filles dénudées.
On se retrouve alors par terre,
Triste et tout nu.
En amour, de toute manière,
On prend du jus.

Tout au long de la vie, c'est sûr,
On s'abîme le cœur
À vouloir mettre la main sur
Les filles conducteur.
La mélancolie des passions
Nous chloroforme.
Faut refaire toute l'installation :
Rien n'est conforme.

Tout au long de la vie qui serre,
On s'égratigne
Au mystère des filles de fer,
Sur toute la ligne.

Vanessa Paradis,"I Know you've got some pain to share
Like anybody else around 
Each one of us a cross to bare
And then some day you may drown
Will run away do all you've got to do 
Within you sacrifices
For your soul is in chains how could you fly 
Don't give up and do not cry 
When those demons get you
I'll be yours till the end of time 
Please believe me when I say you'll be fine
The circonstances are so unfair

Some days you walk on shaky ground 
The trouble man is always there 
For every moment you go down
You can no longer hide
Or run away do all you've got to do 
Your sorrow's over now
Arround your wounds begin your peace of mind
Don't give up and do not cry 
When those demons get you
I'll be yours till the end of time 
Please believe me when I say you'll be fine",When I Say,2000

Porter dans le lit du torrent

Partons à la dérive

De quoi as-tu peur allons n'aie nulle crainte

Et je m'endors en baignant dans ton sang

Vanessa Paradis,"Tant qu’on ne sait pas qu’on ne sait rien
Tant qu’on est de gentils petits chiens
Tant que la petite santé va bien
On n’est pas la queue d’un être humain
Tant qu’on ne sait pas le coup de frein
Qui vous brûle à vif un jour de juin
Tant qu’on ne sait pas que tout s’éteint
On ne donne quasi jamais rien
Tant qu’on ne sait pas que tout éreinte
Tant qu’on ne sait pas ce qu’est la vraie crainte
Tant qu’on n’a jamais subi la feinte
Ou regarder pousser le lierre qui grimpe
Tant qu’on n’a pas vu le ciel déteint
Flotter le cadavre d’un humain
Sur un fleuve nu comme un dessin
Juste un ou deux traits au fusain

C’est une chanson, une chanson pour les vieux cons
Comme moi petite conne d’autrefois
C’est une chanson une chanson qui vient du fond de moi
Comme un puit sombre et froid

Tant qu’on ne sait pas qu’on est heureux
Que là-haut ça n’est pas toujours si bleu
Tant qu’on est dans son nuage de beuh
Qu’on ne se dit pas je valais mieux
Tant qu’on n’a pas brûlé le décor
Tant qu’on n’a pas toisé un jour la mort
Tant qu’on a quelqu’un qui vous serre fort
On tombe toujours un peu d’accord

C’est une chanson, une chanson pour les vieux cons
Comme toi, petit con d’autrefois
C’est une chanson, une chanson qui vient du fond de moi
Comme un puit sombre et froid

Tant qu’on ne sait pas ce qu’est la fuite
Et la honte que l’on sait qu’on mérite
Tant qu’on danse au bal des hypocrites
Qu’on n’a jamais plongé par la vitre
Tant qu’on n’a pas vu brûler son nid
En quelques minutes à peine, fini
Tant qu’on croit en toutes ces conneries
Qui finissent toutes par pour la vie",La Chanson des vieux cons,2013

Sung forever more
Creeping through the vines of hell

Innocent with silken unmarked skin
Only for a moment then it flies
And the sound of the tattoo begins

Indelible on the body of your soul

Everything is relative in time

Reconnus dès le lendemain pour aller boire un café ensemble

Depuis le premier verre de vin au dernier baiser sans la langue
On a connu les arrières cours, les frimas de décembre
Les ingénues qui portent court, qui font du pied aux pieds-tendres
Les nuits moites allongé sur le coco et la cendre
Le vin chenu, la misère nue mais quel bonheur ensemble

Même au siècle prochain j'en pleurerai encore
Même au siècle prochain j'en pleurerai encore

Éperdus, ivres de ce vin qui vous fait les yeux en amandes

Adieu nuits tendres, adieu caresses, adieu lait à l'amande
Adieu relative allégresse de prendre un café ensemble

Vanessa Redgrave,"What do the simple folk do
To help them escape when they're blue?
The shepherd who is ailing, the milkmaid who is glum
The cobbler who is wailing from nailing his thumb

When they're beset and besieged
The folk not noblessly obliged
However do they manage to shed their weary lot?
Oh, what do simple folk do, we do not?

I have been informed by those who know them well
They find relief in quite a clever way
When they're sorely pressed, they whistle for a spell
And whistling seems to brighten up their day

And that's what simple folk do, so they say
They just whistle?
So they say

What else do the simple folk do
To pluck up the heart and get through?
The wee folk and the grown folk
Who wander to and fro

Have ways known to their own folk
We throne folk don't know
When all the doldrums begin
What keeps each of them in his skin?

What ancient native custom
Provides the needed glow?
Oh, what do simple folk do?, Do you know?

Once, upon the road, I came upon a lad
Singing in a voice three times his size
When I asked him why, he told me he was sad
And singing always made his spirits rise

So that's what simple folk do, I surmise

Arise my love, arise my love
Apollo's lighting the skies, my love
The meadows shine with columbine
And daffodils blossom away

Hear Venus call to one and all
Come taste delight while you may
The world is bright and all is right
And life is merry and gay

What else do the simple folk do?
They must have a system or two
They obviously outshine us at turning tears to mirth
Have tricks a royal highness is minus from birth

What, then, I wonder, do they
To chase all the goblins away?
They have some tribal sorcery you haven't mentioned yet
Oh, what do simple folk do to forget?

Often, I am told, they dance a fiery dance
And whirl 'till they're completely uncontrolled
Soon the mind is blank and all are in a trance
A violent trance astounding to behold

And that's what simple folk do, so I'm told
Really?
I have it on the best authority

",What Do the Simple Folk Do?,1967
Vanessa Renée,"When I get to heaven in my turn
I roll down the windows and I ride
And for a moment now the world is alone standing still
And I am the hands of time
Passing through cars and trucks on the high way
Making my way past fields of gray
I know that no words can touch me when I'm here on my own
And I'm breaking through the speed of you
Something about those mountains, something about that sky
I can see everything clearly
When I'm all the way up here
I feel the wind on my skin
And I'm free
All of the leaves have begun to fall
I watch them in silence through the crowd
Without you here I'm half way alive
I get my keys and drive

Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me",In a Sentimental Mood,1993
Vanessa Rubin,"What's it all about, alfie? 
Is it just for the moment we live? 
What's it all about when you sort it out, alfie? 
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind? 
And if only fools are kind, alfie,
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel.
And if life belongs only to the strong, alfie,
What will you lend on an old golden rule? 
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, alfie,
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in.
I believe in love, alfie.
Without true love we just exist, alfie.
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, alfie.
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, alfie, alfie.

I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Vanessa Rubin,"You and I, an unmatched pair
Took the time to touch, to share
Worlds apart the night we met
We braved the odds and won the bet

Not perfect yet
But close enough for love

How old-fashioned, pure romance
We shared a kiss, we shared the dance
We shared the body and bouquet
And we'll taste the wine another day

When you and I
Are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts and one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and in books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told

Not perfect yet
But close enough for love

Vanessa Rubin,"If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat

No one would you see
You ask yourself, who'd watch for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it

I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend

No one would you see
You ask yourself, who could it be
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free

I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way

You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die

It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
The jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die

Vanessa Rubin,"What of a morning
That brings a day so gently
And bathes the leaves
Of memories
That fell so long ago

I still recall you
In all these early hours
Though I were there
Once more to share
A love lost long ago

Crassness of youth
Concluding only half of the truth
Exuding only one small percent
Of what I surely felt for you

And then one morning
That brought a day so gently
We set apart
Things of the heart
And lost love long ago",Morning,1995
Vanessa Rubin,"""Seven days"" was all she wrote
A kind of ultimatum note
She gave to me, she gave to me
When I thought the field had cleared
It seems another suit appeared
To challenge me, woe is me
Though I hate to make a choice
My options are decreasing mostly rapidly
Well we'll see
I don't think she'd bluff this time
I really have to make her mine
It's plain to see
It's him or me
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time, Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
The fact he's over six feet ten
Might instill fear in other men
But not in me, The Mighty Flea (flee?)
Ask if I am mouse or man
The mirror squeaked, away I ran
He'll murder me in time for his tea
Does it bother me at all
My rival is Neanderthal it makes me think
Perhaps I need a drink
IQ is no problem here
We won't be playing scrabble for her hand I fear
I need that beer
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time, Saturday could wait

Friday'd give me time, Saturday could wait

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Turned my world upside down
When I first laid my eyes on you

This feeling's really frightening
'cause it seems to me I've found
The perfect man of all for me to choose
Used to a dream of such a man like you
Never thought it would come true
Boy you are the answer to my prayers

I never felt like this before and
You have opened up the door 
Into a space that I would never dare

'cause you give my a meaning
And this love we hare together
Is lifting my heart to a higher ground
I was searching, seeking, finding
Love came out from its hiding
And baby, I' so pleased at what I found

The way you seem to be, the only one for me
This love is truly special, we're 2 of a kind
I've got you on my mind, we're 2 of a kind

This heart is beating inside my chest
And baby, it's you that I adore
The nights we spend together are by far the best
That any woman could be wishing for
We're lucky baby it's like that
This ain't no opposites attract
You make up for all the bad in me

So when days of trouble come around
You know I never let you down
Right by your side is where I want to be

Where could the dream have gone to
Now I know there's no way that I can make you stay
No matter how I want to

We made some memories that my heart will always treasure
Before you close the door let's make one more

Baby, just for tonight let me give myself to you
And all I ask is just for tonight love me like you used to do
And I promise that I won't cry, I won't ask you why
I won't even try to change your feelings
If you just hold me tight, just once more, just for tonight

I thought the love we'd found
Was built on solid ground
And it would just grow stronger
Crazy as it may seem
I need to dream that dream
For just, just a little longer

So for the sake of all that magic we made together

Vanessa Williams,"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place

No one around but I fell someone watching me
I look around, the street is bare nobody there
I wonder what it could be
As I turned to walk away 
Suddenly I saw his face
Never minding that we were alone
Didn't care about the time, at the moment I was felling fine

I was looking into stranger's eyes

They looked right through me

Never knew
Never, ever thought that love could be

He came and captured me

Like a scene out of a dream, I can't believe it
Kind of strange and familiar
But in his eyes I get a sign, I get a feeling
I get the feeling he knows me
Maybe I could stay a while, maybe I could make you smile
I don't have much to do
Maybe we could walk awhile
Maybe, maybe we could talk awhile

Can't help looking into stranger's eyes

But why tell a lie to your heart
When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring
I could say you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what can I tell my heart
When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone

Vanessa Williams,"What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap asleeping
Whom angels
Breed with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch our keeping

This, this
Is Christ the king
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing

Haste
Haste'll bring him lord
The babe the son of Mary

So bring him
Incense, bring him gold
Come pleasant king to hold him
The king of kings
Salvation's brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him

Raise, raise the son
On high
The virgin sings a lullaby

Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the son of Mary

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap sleeping
Whom angels breed with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch
Our keeping

Raise, raise the son on high
The virgin sings a Lullaby

Joy, joy for Christ is born
The babe, the son of Mary

Merry Christmas to you, and you, and you, and you, ooh",What Child Is This?,1992
Vanessa Williams,"They say it's a river, that circles the earth
A beam of light shining to the edge of the universe
It conquers all, it changes everything

They say it's a blessing, they say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle
And I believe that it is
It conquers all, but it's a mystery

Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And it fades away so easily

In this world we've created
Where this place that we lived
In a blink of an eye the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the love that's for eternity

Love brakes the chain
Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears of pain, and it turns it in
To the beauty that remains

Look at this place
It was paradise, but now it's dying
I'll brave the love
I'll take, my chances that it's not too late

Love brakes your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily

Oh oh oh

Love aches for everyone of us
Love takes the tears and the pain, and turns it in
To the beauty that remains",Love Is [Album Version],1993

If I have a secret resepy
You would be my baby
If I have the perfect fantasy

You would be my baby
If the world was mine to redesign
Then suddenly you would find
That you'd be my baby

If I wrote you poems that made you cry
Would you be my baby?
If I say the sweetest lullaby
Would you be my baby?

If I promise you the moon and stars
With heaven waiting in my heart
Would you be my baby?
But if I only have

True love to offer you
Would that be enough
To make you want me to?
I would kiss and talk you then each night

You would be my baby
Then had watch you're sleep and hold you tight
You would be my baby
I would make you mine for rich upon

And never need to ask for more

Vanessa Williams,"You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
We are all connected to each other in a circle, in a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

How high does the sycamore grow
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We just sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind

All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all colors of the wind",Colors of the Wind (End Title),1995

And you're expecting me to believe
That you're not out with she

Deep down inside
Tearing me apart
I feel it in my heart

Constantly, you're on my mind
Thinking about you all the time
I can't sleep no matter what I do
I just keep on thinking 'bout you

Why do I feel this way
When I know you have someone
That you're seeing each and every day
Should I play this game
Of just being your friend
When I know that's not where I want it to end

Vanessa Williams,"Way back, take a look, she would cook
When they were stompin' at the Savoy
She would blow, and they would dance, don't you know ?
It was an uptown kind a show

Cool notes and melodies, harmonies
She sang the song of the universe
She can make a joyful noise up to heaven
And call the angels down to the earth

From jazz, to swing, to be-bop
She kept the spirit alive
For Bo, Duke, Dizzy, and Miles
She spoke her mind
She's Ellamental to the art
She spoke her mind
She's Ellamental to the art

Too hot, until the dawn she sang on
When joints were jumpin' and jive was in
Bodies movin' back and forth to the rhythm
Ever since Ella first did her thing

From jazz, to swing to be-bop
She brought emotions and moves
She kept the spirit alive.
She spoke her mind

Act like ya know, Oh!
Was it the smooth tones that was so much like butter
Oh Ella was singin' just like no other singer
Cause you know I be the funky bringer of the new style
because I be the wild child.
Listenin' to hip-hop, listening to be-bop and jazz
Ella made you move that ass
Sensation for the people, insperation for the sisters and brothers
Smooth jazz for the midnight lovers
Savoy was the spot for shakin' on your rump and
Ella made it hoppin'
Got the joint jumpin', remembering you 'til the dawn
Because Ella your memory goes on

She spoke her mind (yeah...and it just don't stop)
She's Ellamental to the art (the memory goes on and on...'cause it just don't stop)

Vanessa Williams,"Walk me over this situation
Let the sun's light warm my face
Once again the times are changing
Once again I've lost my way

While the words of acient poets
Fall like dust upon my shoes
Greed has grabbed me of my vision
Turned my heart from higher truths

So take my hand and lift me higher
Be my love and my desire
Hold me safe, in honor bound
Take my heart to higher ground

I have walked too long in darkness
I have walked too long alone
Blindy clutching fist of diamonds
That I found were only stones

I would trade the wealth of ages
For a warmer hand to hold
Though the path of life is narrow
But it leads the streets of gold

So take my hand and lift me higher
Be my love and my desire
Hold me safe, in honor bound
Take my heart to higher ground

In this world we move through shadows
Never sure of what we see
While the truth abides between us
Come and share the truth with me

It's a long way home
It's a long way home
Trying to retrace your steps
All too easy to forget
Just which way to go
It's a long way home

Outside the sky is threatening
You slowly gather up your things
And wonder how you ever will explain
Walking out so self-assured
Yeah, you were gonna change the world
Walking back, a child in the rain

It's a long way home
It's a long way home
It's a long way home
How can you retrace the steps
You've been trying to forget
Still it's time to go
And it's a long way home

And if you lose your way
Just keep your eye upon that endless broken line

Throw bag beneath the bus
Sit among the curious
It happens to the best of us, you know

It's a long way home
It's a long way home
It's a long way home

I say over where
You say just a holiday

After the sun goes down
If the London Bridge is falling
Will anybody hear a sound
If you follow the sunset will it ever end
Does the moonlight shine on Paris

Oh and how can you just walk away
Is it something that I said
I see only black and white
You see green and red
You believe in the miracles
Water into wine
I'll believe it when it makes the New York Times

in your blue blue shadows I would hide.
All good people asleep tonight
I'm all by myself in your silverlight
I would gaze at your face the whole night.
Though I'd go out of mind but for you
I'd go out of my mind but you

Lying in a mother's arms
the primal root of a woman's charms.
I'm a stranger to the sun my eyes are too weak
How cold is a heart when it's warmth that it seeks?
You watch every night, you don't care what I do
I'd go out of my mind, but for you
I'd go out of my mind, but for you

To howl at the moon the whole night through.

Holding the night so close,
Hanging on, still unbroken 
while outside the thunder rolls.

warm against life's bitter cold.
 
These are the days. 
the sweetest days we'll know.
 
There are times that scare me.
We'll rattle the house like the wind,
both of us so unbending.
We battle the fear within.
All the while life is rushing by us.
Hold it now and don't let go.
 
These are the days. 
the sweetest days we'll know.
 
So, we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness.
Watching the stars till their gone.
And when even the mem'ries have all faded away,
these days go on and on.
 
Listen now, you can hear my heartbeat.

Counting every minute, every hour till you're with me.

Baby turn the lights down, and we don't have to say a word

I like to savor every second, you thrill me with your charm.
Now I'm lost in the passion (moment, feelings, magic) we share
And when I look into your eyes, I know how much you care.

Don't want to rush the feeling, couse loving you's so real and
I like the way you set the mood with, a little wine and candlelight
It's more than emotion, let's keep this fire going
Now we're lost inside our love (now we're drifting into love)
Sweet surrender is so tender.

With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all
And high from Gods heaven a starlight did fall
And the promise of ages, it then did recall

A star in the sky or a bird on the wing
Or all of Gods angels in heaven to sing
He surely could've had it, 'cause he was the king

Who can't see all the danger around us?
If we're just April fools I don't care

April dream doesn't last

Where could the dream have gone to
Now I know there's no way that I can make you stay
No matter how I want to

We made some memories that my heart will always treasure
Before you close the door let's make one more

Baby, just for tonight let me give myself to you
And all I ask is just for tonight love me like you used to do
And I promise that I won't cry, I won't ask you why
I won't even try to change your feelings
If you just hold me tight, just once more, just for tonight

I thought the love we'd found
Was built on solid ground
And it would just grow stronger
Crazy as it may seem
I need to dream that dream
For just, just a little longer

So for sake of all that magic we made together
Open your heart to mine just one more time

Would the heavens come crushing down to this barren ground?

It's the same old story
You and I, me and you
Playin' we're just friends
When are we gonna learn that we don't
have a choice we both know how it ends
So we just choose to pretend

In a way it's all sad and very
For the way that things have been
We fall out of love and back in love again uuuh
We'll go round and round and still say
we're just friends.

Gotta stop gotta chill
Makes no sense to be falling
You got her, I got him
Should not even be calling
We can try if we want
but we don't have a choice
About the way we feel
It's hard to stop when something's real

In a way it's all sad and very
For the way that things have been
We fall out of love and back in love again
In a way it's all kinda scary
The things that we can't admit
We fall out of love and back in love again
oh yeah
We'll go round and round and still say
we're just friends.

Still got the charm and
I miss that burn in my heart and
I must stay away from your arms
So I don't fall (Don't fall)

And to make sure there's no lipstick on my shirt

They often start to look and act alike
And it never really mattered just how much of this was truth
Till I caught her acting just like me tonight
From a booth back in the corner came a laughter so familiar

I want to go back this (week)
I want to go back this (minute)

Better get a job

In my bed the other night

Now wasn't she right

Just like coming out of the womb

There's only so much room
People kick and tear your brain

As though he did have a reason to know
Did he really know?
His eyes were open they expected someone
In his heart he felt the compass was turned on

Is master with every plan

She came, as in the book, Mickey Spillane
That Saturday night dark masquerade
Had filled his friend with lead, the same, sweetheart

But then, as nothing happens quite the same
Investigation is the game
He had to check her story right away-he dead
Sam Spade his buddy Archer first to go he got it
She spelt it out, how could they know the 'Fatman' got it -he dead
Her sister didn't really live at all-confusion-he dead

The chase to find the Maltese Falcon-you bet-

Set to spellbind population

And so, I must confess
Whatever I see
I'm meant to be there with you
With you with you

Silent golden movies, talkies, technicolour, long ago
My younger ways stand clearer, clearer than my footprints
Stardom greats I've followed closely Closer than the nearest heartbeat
Longer that expected-ther were great-
Oh love oh love just to see them
Acting on the silver screen, oh my
Clark Gable, Fairbanks, Maureen O'Sullivan
Fantasy would fill my life and I
Love fantasy so much

I really talked, yes I did, to Gods early dawning light
And I was privileged to be as I am to this day
To be with you. To be with you

We sailing pass the moment of time
We sailing 'round the point
The kindly light, the kindly light

We go sailing through the waters
Of the summers end
Long ago, search for land
Looking to and fro

We searching in the day
We searching in the night
We looking everywhere
For land a helping hand

For there is hope if truth be there
How much more will we share

How we forever simply feel the way the wayward-winds
That hide the storms at night

Our love, get used to being this way
Our love, once again a story really true creates a sound

So I'm trying to pass it through
Trying for you

The mere emotion of getting 'round
Crazy understandings of the way we tilt the light
But it shines when we make the sound

Don't live by mistakes
We can dance to your tune
But there's this whole understanding
And it's coming I guess, I know
I hope that you can get into this

Among those dark satanic mills?

Silencing the thought powers one by one

Our own ability to confuse, to sacrifice
To enlighten like a Shakespearian play
We foolish and happily hold on to sanity
While all around the pushing
And prodding of our feelings
The twisting and turning of our hearts
Displaying an almost indefinable strength
Of purpose, a reason, a reason, a reason
Where no reasons seems to exist

Yet, as in a vision, a voice transcending
All our imagination, jewel of life
Guiding light heralding a joyous new dawn
Clear and gifted time

Young and old, the wisest and the lowly
Each indeed is 'Holy' in the 'Light of Love'
When the 'Word' comes
I will be waiting
Like a dove that shines he prays for peace
Some have waited what seems a lifetime
Some are waiting now to be released
For the moment we have this freedom
We will choose the way our hearts will move
All the people lost will find their way
Give that chance today
Hear and I will pray
No not for nothing hearts will not be broken
As long as we are open
Our hearts will make us free
Free for the Earth man
Free for the millions
In the 'Glory' all will come to 'Truth'
No aggression, that we leave behind us
To be replaced
By 'You'

For tomorrow another day

We'll return dear, to the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow

Vangelis,"Once we did run
How we chased a million stars
And touched as only one can

Once we did play
How the past delivered you
Amidst our youth we'd dream away, away

As if I knew the words I'm sure you'll hear
Of how we met as you recall so clear

Once we did love
Long ago how did I forget
Holding you so closely

Look, how I move
Chance would have me glance at you
To know how you move me, me

All barriers fall around us as we hear
Of memories known and matters long ago, so clear

Once we did run
How we chased a million stars
And touched as only one can

Sei que não vai dar em nada
Seus segredos sei de cór
Já conheço as pedras do caminho
E sei também que ali sozinho
Eu vou ficar, tanto pior
O que é que eu posso contra o encanto
Desse amor que eu nego tanto
Evito tanto
E que no entanto
Volta sempre a enfeitiçar
Com seus mesmos tristes velhos fatos
Que num álbum de retrato
Eu teimo em colecionar

Lá vou eu de novo como um tolo
Procurar o desconsolo
Que cansei de conhecer
Novos dias tristes, noites claras
Versos, cartas, minha cara
Ainda volto a lhe escrever
Pra lhe dizer que isso é pecado
Eu trago o peito tão marcado
De lembranças do passado
E você sabe a razão

Donde andaba, quien soy yo
Que me aguarda adónde voy

Donde anda, quien soy yo

Cuando estuve junto
A el mi canción dejo de ser
Le recuerdo junto al mar
Solo queda recordar
Algo extraño me hizo amar

Solo queda recordar
Por siempre
No sé como llego a mí

Fue un temblor, un éxtasis
Una noche se alejo
Fue un misterio del amor
Nadie puede explicar

Como le puedo olvidar
Por siempre me pregunto qué pasó
Yo no sé por dónde voy

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions.
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding.

Come on, sugar, let me know.
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me.

He's acting shy, looking for an answer.
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together.
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further.
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother.

Never mind, sugar. We can watch the early movie.

Get on up...i walk the beat and walk it with clarity
I want to' make sure all's hearin' me
Ducks who's bummin', I found your hide away
I'm livin' large y'all so by the way
Who rocked the crowd and rocks it loud
On the strengths, y'all, I'm takin' bows now
Kickin' up lyrics that others want to' rock to
Rock like me, y'all this you can't do
The v, the a, the n, the i, the lla y'all
It's vanilla

[Chorus]
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up

[Verse 2]
Hold on girl, let your feet move free
cause you move to the groove of vanilla i-see-e
You come here to rock and let the white boy rap
If you a ho, get off my lap
cause ice stands for bein' so cold
That's a nickname I got for bein' so bold
Jerome stands for m.p.a
My personal assistant, every day
I'm not an mc who come here to play
Yo, boy, I'm serious, I'm goin' all the way
Rhymes are clean, there's no need to be ill
And when I'm on the mic, I let 'em all spill

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I rock the mic like I'm a fanatic
When I see one, I got to have it
I'll whip up a sound that'll burst your eardrum
What you gonna' do? don't you play dumb
Busy like kizzy, groovin' like rubin
Don't care what you do, just keep movin'
Shakin' your limbs until they wear thin
I make your butt shake just watch the boy grin
Simple like simon, with ice rhymin'
Some mc's fakin' it, but I'm the diamond
I'm the rhyme doctor, always on call
You watch your fries, boy, or I'm gonna' take yours

Start skeezin' and move that hip girl
Get in the mood and don't you quit
Smooth as slime, king rhyme
Rock it boy, cause it's a craime
I'll make you scream like you're in between
When I'm on the mic, yes I'm the king
cause I'm hungry as a dog, i'll eat up
My rhymes are runnin', don't interrupt
cause I'm a throne overtaker, not an mc faker
I like my coffee, but I can't stand sanka

[Verse 1]
Yeah, here's a story bout my homeboy randy
He was hooked on a girl named candy
Started off as sex for fun
Now the girl's got him on the run
Made love to her just one time
Now she runs his body and mind
He calls everyday on the phone
But baby's playin' games
Leave a message at the tone
Soft and gentle is not her style
This girl is so damn wild
All my partners want to get next to her
But she ain't down with that, She moves right through 'em
Yeah, like paper plates, Tears 'em up and she throws 'em away
If you had any guts today, You'd get your butt up and you'd walk away
But you're hooked

Hooked
Know what I'm sayin', you're hooked, hooked

[Verse 2]
Yo, Get tough was your new campaign
Cryin' over a girl, boy, you're insane
She treats you like a dirty diaper
Use you one time and then she wipes you out
You understand what I'm sayin'?
If you're a man, you'll stop delaying and betraying
Try to act like you were mack
You can't go an hour without that sex attack
What's wrong, boy, is it that good?
There's a lot of girls that would and could
Take you, But you're so damn weak
I think you need to seek
Professional help, For your problems
Lay on the couch and let the doctor solve 'em
Talkin' to you and now he took your money
You're took on that honey, You're hooked

Hooked, hooked
Fellas, you know what I'm sayin', he's hooked
Ain't got an ounce of mack in him, he's hooked

[Verse 3]
Yeah, baby, run you, she takes your money
While you'll kick back cryin' over honey
Now, I must admit she's fly
But i'll be damned if oh me oh my
If I ever let a girl run my thing
I'm poppin' it the most, you know what I'm sayin'?
So understand, you gotta be real hard
Don't treat her like a dog, but let her know
You'll pull her card if she ever gets outta hand
What is you a boy or a man?
Stand up and tell baby you ain't gonna be shook
Yo punk, you're hooked on that sssy
I don't know why
I don't stand by
And just let a girl run over me
Fool, I'm a man. can't you see
Boy, you're hooked

Yeah -- you're hooked, might as well give her to me man
Let me do the wild thing, you're hooked
Shoot, I'm poppin' it man, you're hooked

[Interlude]
Let me talk to you for second.
So, what's up, vanilla?
Yo, man. come here man. what?
You know, man, you ain't doin' it right. you're off man.
See, you know what the problem is?
That ring I bought her. the diamonds weren't big enough.
I'm tellin' ya' -- the diamonds weren't...i'm goin'...you know
What she wants...i'm goin' tell ya'...no man, when I first
Met her she said she wanted a 'vette. I'm gonna' get her a vette
no man, no...a 'vette...i'm gonna get her the
'vette. no man, hey, wait up

[Verse 4]
Now it's saturday, the day you hate most
Why, because from coast to coast
You see girls everday in the club, cold kickin' it
Reminds you of baby when you used to be with it
But now she took you one time for sex and you're so sprung
That the next time she seen you
We knew, She had to leave you

We've been goin' out now for about two years and I still feel the same
I know I haven't said it much before, well, it's because
See, I get all choked up inside. it just doesn't wanna

Get down, straight to the floor

Pay attention to my style
Dirty but hot, ya' know what I mean?
Get loose girl like a sex fiend, let's do it
cause you know what I want
Me and you babe go one on one
Get freaky and I do the same
Get hot and I ride like a sex machine

Ice cool and you're colder than ever, I like it
Ice cool and you're colder than ever

[Verse 2]
Ice cold, cooler than ever
Never say never cause I'm so damn clever
Lickin' your lips, I'm ridin' your hips
V.i.p. posse and we're pimps
Be on the lookout in your vicinity
I'm robbin' virgins of their virginity
Like robin hood gave to the poor
I rock kashla and now she wants more
She calls everday, it's gettin' kinda' silly
But she rides my saddle like bronco billy
In a rodeo somewhere out west
She screams out ""vanilla ice, you're the best!""
Echoing out, can you hear?
She screams out everywhere
Just a pimp and you know
Snatchin' women, so, yo!
You can beg, plead and tell me you love me
But there's no way i'd put a girl above me
Unless it's sex and you want to' ride
Jump on my saddle, baby, and get live

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Move your body all around
This is the dope jam, so get down
Now that you like what I'm sayin' admit it
This is the jam and vanilla just did it
I made you work 'til your butt got sore
In other words, I'm about to get raw
On stage, it's a v.i.p., doin' dances from a to zpumpin' it, pushin' it, stick it hard
I freaked your girl in the back of your car
I wore a jimmy that I slapped on
Popped a rubber duckie, so bought me a trojan
Get ready, hyped into the groove
As I practiced to make your body move
You're fienin' for a meanin', oh yes, I'm comin'
Vanilla ice is here so you suckers start runnin'
This is the jam I know you're gonna like
Deshay he cuts like a knife
He won't smirk and he won't smile
Deshay get funky for a while

Pump up the volume

Vanilla Ice,"Yo! here comes the intro
It's time to let it go
I live the life of my rhyme, I think I'll let it show
So, keep it goin' so the mic can stay warm
Then I know I've been doin' my job 'cause there'll be sweat pourin'

So pick and choose your weapon but don't slip
I'm here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip
So pump your fist like this, but don't miss
The hook and the break when you decide to dance to this
Lyrical concept that's meant for the dance floor
I know you adore 'cause that's what you came for
The ice rhymer is back and livin' large
And when I'm at a show you better wear camouflage
'cause there was plenty who thought I couldn't swing this
But now all I get from the crowd is just a pumped fist
So sing along with the chorus 'cause it's a hit
Or stay at home alone 'cause ice will be workin' it

Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work
It, work it. work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work
It, work it. work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby

Go white boy, go white boy, go!
Check out the hook. vanilla ice, yep, yep

I'm makin' a killin' and chillin' because I'm cool as an ice
Pack
You're lovin' everything when I think of a new track
I keep my rhyme flowin', notice it's right on time
And separate the wax and keep my mic in line
So put your body in motion and let me know that you're there
And those playin' the wall don't be scared
'cause it's a foundation of breaks put to a beat
Strong as concrete 'cause I'm rockin' the beat
I'm in rock mode now' cause I'm steppin' like a soldier
Move to the groove and try to hold your composure
Never the less I'm back to attack
I came to manifest, and express to this dope track
Blow off the lid for the kid I get nice
That's why the ladies scraem...oh! vanilla ice!
Forthcomin' I'm risin' to the top
The real definition of funk is put to hip hop
That's what I though, you're cause by the friction
Pens to the pad when I'm shakin' the mixin'
What I like to hear is a drummer get wicked
The tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it
Don't be surprised if your eyeballs swell
I know it's hard to regard 'cause I'm loved by the females
Masses of many, which is plenty, comes to a halt
No one's in the runnin', so I guess that is my fault
So pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to
My dj's at his max to enhance what I bring you
The concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook
Acknowledge the pros from all the titles I took, yea
The crowd's at ease when I breat through the mic end
As I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands
I go to work on the floor like a wet mop
If you've ever been moved, check it out when I rock

[Chorus]

Throw your hands in the air and let's get hyper
Flip this thing and sting like a viper
Rollin' with the rhythm, I did it for my opponent
If there was a crown to be taken, yea, I would own it
Believe that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be
With slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe
Sheer to the point, to the point it's like lethal
The dope that I'm sellin' is not even illegal
But, still knowck you out with clout to make you shout
To rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about
Money, yea, is the key to all problems
If you believe that, then you should surely solve 'em
'cause I got the key, the key to attack
The knowledge from my dome, from the top of my track
To my foes, I can show I can flow 'cause I'm legit
Thinkin' of a new dance, ice will be workin' it

[Chorus]",Ice Is Workin' It,1990

Vanilla 'll knock 'em down on their rear, yea!
Vanilla 'll make 'em all stand up and cheer, yea!
He's the vanilla! break, break, break down

[Verse 1]
Sparklin' like a towerin' inferno
You want to' learn my songs, this ain't no journal
It blemished my rhyme, because I'm drawin' the line
Don't celebrate too soon, 'cause I'm goin' for mine
Just a character in a made up cartoon
Like witchel and hazel, boy, you're pushin' a broom
So get a new life or come equipped with the best
Mark another one for ice, let the microphone rest
Just listen to my groove, the beat is strong
And i'll rock it now, I need a microphone
I'm in the mood to dance, I'm in the mood to prance
You tried me once but now you're takin' a chance
Because I rock with flavor, hard as lifesaver
You asked for dope, ha...that's what I gave ya'
A chance to go but now you move too slow
My juice is pumped and I'm ready to go

[Chorus]
Go...it's a party...come on...let's do this...come on..

[Verse 2]
Real good...into a new phase, jumpin' up the airwaves
And now you're amazed 'cause it's hip hop that you crave
because I'm hyped like an addict, there's no drug involved
The only thing I need is my record revolved
Def comin' strong, hard like a matador
I saw my style, my soul, up on the dance floor
I want to' see ya' shake, shake and shiver
You're a charity case, and ice is the giver
I'm givin' you what you want but you're dumb and naive
You can't cope with the dop ice has concieved
Which is a dope jam, hotter than the third degree
You tried my style but I burn you see
I'm ice and I'm cold, I'm buildin' igloos of gold
You want to' bite my style, you gotta' have soul
'cause a dope like this is not easy to come by
You don't buy it on, it comes out your hi-fi

[Chorus]
It's a party...come on...'let's do this..

[Verse 3]
You think it's funy to lack but I'm a brother to mack
The 808 kickin' base from a dope drum track
I'm the coolest of cool, kickin' cools silly fools
You are posse's takin' a dip and vanilla's the pool
Get ready for my ritual, it's at its' peak
Silly punks bow down 1st the lyricist speak
Intruders get slayed, my pockets get paid
The girlie is jockin' it and just got laid
See I'm the press you elect, keep the record erect
In effect, damn, ain't that what you expect?
Earthquake is on the funk, my homie's not a punk
Take you antique rhymes and self 'em as junk
You see, we won't come front' and sellin' drugs and all that shit
Fake caddies, mack daddies, ain't even legit
So, get a beeper, you're a sleeper and you need to wake up
So make the record transform so carwin vegas

[Chorus]
It's a party...come on...let's do this..

[Outro]
Do it! we don't need no music
Cause all we want to' do, is sing and dance and party down
I'm the best, he's the vanilla

[Chorus]
It's a party...come on...let's do this..",It's a Party,1990
Vanilla Ice,"Oh yea...In my dreams I envision myself at the ocean
Beautiful girls rubbin' me down with some lotion
Even though you know I flow as cold as an ice cube
Let me tell you how it is to make love on an inner tube
Floatin' on water while splashin' waves on your body
Flowni' and goin', now pump it, pump it, Hottie
See, I want to get loose with you, is that all right?
Girl, I want to' do it outside, under the moonlight
And get on down so we can make that love
You be the hand and Iceman'll be the glove
This is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures the utmost extreme

Yea...Life is just a fantasy...Yea..

Now, let me take you out so we can wine and dine
As I pull you close you pull your lips next to mine
Oh yeah, you like it like that
You like it like I do and that's where it's at
So later on that night as we got in my car
It started up again we didn't get very far
You made it very clear that you were not in fear
Leaned over to me and started kissin' my ear
Oh girl, you feel so good
You couldn't wait to get home and I understood
As we got busy, then I pulled up in the driveway
You said follow me 'cause we're gonna do it my way
Walked in the front door you startin' strippin' clothes
Turned off the lights and assumed the pose
Closer and closer, hot anticipation
You walked into the closet, came out in some lace and
I almost lost my mind, but I kept it in tact
The lace you was wearin' ohhh, I got an attack
'Cause this is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme

Yea...Life is just a fantasy
Yea...Life is just a fantasy

Come on baby and let me be your toy
I'll let you do as you wish just to give you joy
And get down, I know you want to' get loose
Let's do it like a train and I'll be the caboose
Or better yet, I'll take you higher, I think that it's time
To make love to you baby on cloud number nine
As we start pumpin', sweat pour down my chest
And that's when you know Vanilla Ice is the best
You say ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah
I don't know what it means but I like it a lot
This is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme
Yea...Life is just a fantasy
O yea...Life is just a fantasy...Oh girl...",Life Is a Fantasy,1990
Vanilla Ice,"[Intro]
Strictly from the islands, vanilla ice
The man jam down reggae music
Mash it up ice, mash it

[Verse 1]
I got the rhyme to keep the body pumpin'
Turn the party out while the people are jumpin'
Reggae style at the top of my list
Is hitting real hard like mike tyson's fist
It is so good that the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mic and you know I'm not lazy
I'm pumpin' up the lyrics in a smooth way
I drop 'em like a bum rush much as what we say
The other mc's try to duplicate
But with the rosta man they just mediate

[Chorus]
Rosta man you be jammin' so smooth
You rockin' on the mic and you can only improve
Rosta man you know you sound so sweet
I like the way you put the lyrics to the funky beat
Ah rae rue, re rae rah
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away
Ah rae rue, re rae rah
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away

[Verse 2]
Me and i, myself and you
The rosta man, deshay and the rest of my crew
Reggae music's been around for a while
Vanilla ice is doin' it the hip hop style
Because this is the one that we call the rae rue
Everybody out there you know just what to do
Just clap your hands and stomp your feet
Move around to the sound of the reggae beat
No push, no fall, no shove, no trip
The rosta man wants you to get with it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well the people out there let me hear you scream
If you want to get down and you want to be seen
Then jump up my man, do the rosta man
Move your head up and down to the reggae jam
Just shake your arms and move your hips
All you females out there let me shake your
And just get down like you're makin' love
All you people who believe in god above

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
From the ah rae rue, the re rae rah
The jack tar village in jamaica
Ocho rios or the way to kingston
If we go back to the homeland again
Back on tour from city to city
Rollin' with the girls with the big, big ahhh..
Pity the fool who step it to me
I drop 'em like a fly, I better get the flea

[Chorus]",Rosta Man,1990
Vanilla Ice,"1,2,3,4
It was an average night backstage at a show
I seen this girlie that I knew, she was a cutie and Yo!
She had it goin' on from her head to her feet
Her shape was so petite, and so unique
Her eyes flamed with passion like she was possessed
As I shivered and quivered while she rubbed on my chest
'Slaved and engraved I couldn't scream
Moaning and groaning like she could take on the A-Team
I was one of many that she'd choose
Do me, pursue me, twice as nice but don't refuse
Leaving her breathless as the sweat poured on
The spot that I was in was so soft and warm
This was far from a story you will find in a book
Hot off the platter, and boy, could she cook
Roastin' my body it left a stain in my brain
And all I kept sayin' to myself was

Stop that train, I want to' get off
Stop that train, I want to' get off

Oh my God, what have I got into?
Sooner or later I thought she'd get the clue
'Cause my body was tired and full of sweat and perspire
The situation I was in could've started a campfire
No more skeezin' and teasin' for the Ice right now
I found me a corner, play it cool for a while
Just mackin' and schemin' on a woman I thought was cool
But now I realize that the Ice was the fool
'Cause a woman will play you, lay you and obey you
You better watch your back 'cause a woman will slay you
Not to mention the one who got me
Yea, she got me, the I-see-E
But, back to the story of a one night stand
I thought I was strong but she was He-man
Lovin' every second tryin' to make me blush
And all 'n all it was for the lust
I though, she was an angel and soft as a cream puff
Until I seen her come out with the whip and handcuffs
Breathin' down my neck I was scared to death
The sweat from my body as it rolls down my neck
And out of all nights, where was my crew?
'Cause this was somethin' I didn't know what to do
D already told me that the girlie was strange
But I didn't know until she pulled out the chains
Walkin' and stalkin' towards me with a plan
And now I regret all the things I was sayin'
Now the moment is critical, so what should I do?
Leave while I can, or just take the abuse
Now I'm drippin' with sweat, Why? 'Cause I'm afraid
Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play
No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss
Stop this train 'cause I want to get off

Stop that train, I want to' get off
Stop that train, I want to' get off

Later on that night as it got worse
My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst
She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame
And my admission was free for me to ride on this train
Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun
But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run
So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come
'Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb

So, now what have I done to get myself into this?
It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist
I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor
My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore
The room was destroyed, not to mention my body
Why did I ever tell her to ""Pump it, Hottie?""
What could I do to just ease the pain?
I think I'll let the hook just try to explain

Stop that train, I want to' get off
Stop that train, I want to' get off",Stop That Train,1990
Vanilla Ice,"Yo, Vanilla, kick it one time, boy
",Yo Vanilla,1990
Vanilla Ice,"Coolin' in the shade
Sippin' on lemonade.
I hear a knowck on the door who is it? 
Kim, comin' to pay me another visit.
She tells me that I'm on her mind,
And a player like me is very hard to find.
I like the way she licks her lips starin' in my eyes,
I must admit she's got some juicy thighs.
I like the way she wears her hair and the tight skirts fit,
That's why I got her in my mix.
All she wants to do is hit the sheets and keep it goin',
That's why I'm mind blowin'.

Mind blowin', blowin' my mind

Ten minutes past, I got my eyes on her ugh
She's shaped like an hour glass.
I like the red lipstick, she took a Popsicle out,
And put it in her mouth quick.
She whispered in my ear, saying those things that only
A mac would like to hear.
You see, I like a girl that really turns me on
Twist with her walk, and sexy on the telephone.
She tells me she dreams of me, she wants to be with me
And not another memory,
But for now we can hit the sheets baby,
And keep it goin' now I'm mind blowin'.

Now the heat is on my fingers still in her hair,
Now she's reaching for my underwear.
I'm thinking I should make her wait
For another day, oh I forget, sherri's on the way.
Off came the top, she's looking in my eyes
Here we go with the big surprise.
I guess I can't resist it, hands all over my body
As she puckered up and kissed.
Uh, off came the pumps, I'm checkin' out the rump
She's got a lotta junk in her trunk.
And finally we hit the sheets, and kept it goin'
Now I'm mind blowin'.",Blowin' My Mind,1994
Vanilla Ice,"[Verse 1]
Now everybody wants to have fame
But you'll pay the price if you're not playin' it by the game
'cause this game is made up of a bunch of crazy rules
And fools get took if they're not playing by the rules
Now, the Ice is kickin' it, kickin' it kickin' it like a champ
But don't try to play me like some wet food stamp
They say that it was a fluke
'cause I used a fat loop
But here's the sccop, troop
The Ice is back to make it hoop
An' since it's 94, and now I'm back on the scene
Escapin from the hell of takin' it to the extreme
It's kind of strange, 'cause people say you've changed..
But I never changed
Even though I got Fame
Yo, I'm still the same... Ugh!

[Verse 2]
Fame, I'm still the same person
I never ever switch, an' even if I'm rich
But now it's like an itch
'cause I love the music
They say I do it for the money
And it's funny, clockin' all the honeys:
The ones that used to dis
Now they want to kiss
Lookin' at what my troops got
Now they're getting their boots knocked
Damn it's a shame - do I love 'em
No I don't ""G""
A couple of years ago, they didn't want me
Now I got these so called friends
It's down with the Ice, 'cause they know I'm makin' ends
But my real friends have been friends through the fame
An' since I have fame ain't a damn thing changed
Yo I'm still the same... Ugh!

[Verse 3]
And let me tell you about the pros and the cons
Fame only lasts if you keep droppin' them bombs
Now in the public eye - you know I'm havin' to admit it
You become a target for a whole lot of critics
Reporters stickin' to ya like white on rice
Now everywhere I go they want to interview the Ice
Before every show it's like I'm steadily surrounded
By all of my fans and the media's houndin'
This is not a dis 'cause I love all my fans
But the media doesn't really understand
They take what ya say, twist it around into lies
And the next thing ya know
A bunch of rumors start to fly
Then they try to make you out to be a straight liar
And next you'll be the front page of the National Enquirer
Oh what a price to pay to play this crazy game
You betta' be prepared if you ever reach fame
Yo, I'm still the same... Ugh!",Fame,1994

Get Loose
Vanilla Ice is here with the juice
No use for steppin' so give the bass a boost
Produced by the 3 man crew
Not a deuce just a hit man
Keepin' rappers necks in a noose
I'm gettin' juiced up
But Vanilla's not souped up
Check out the read dope track that I looped up
All you pool but sucka's plain' the back in fact black
If you run up I'll flip you like a flapjack
An' roll you up like a knap pack
Crack that skull with bat
You should've known you're rap's wacked
You lack the style and skill to even get paid
Grab the mic and you will verbally get slayed
I raid the track like a terrorist
And with my napalm bomb lyrics
I got 'em scared of this
So be prepared to be taken to the Twilight Zone
And the VIP is bad to the bone
Ain't no way against me you can get juice
Ain't no way against me you can get juice
Ain't no way against me you can get juice
Back off the stage
An' watch Vanilla Ice get loose

[Chorus]
Get Loose...all the Ladies, Get Loose...all the Fellas, Get
Loose...all the brothers, Get Loose...all the Mothers, Get
Loose...all the Sisters, Get Loose...now the Dogs, Get
Loose...Everybody, here we go, here we go

[Verse 2]
Get loose as I boost the juice
Once more for the people who wanted it
And didn't know what's in store, I've got another big hit
Of course a Vanilla rides the groove like a Gemballa Porsche
I got Zero on the cut like a lumberjack better yet a Butcher
Guaranteed to put cha in the right mood
We make ya dance in a frenzy
Sucka's gettin' mad 'cause I'm getting all the Skins, G
Plus I'm makin' all the ends, G
And the women want to ride my pickle like it was a bicycle
Or just lick it like a Popsicle
I got a little time to waste so baby put it in my face
I want to taste you netcha and I bet-cha
I get-cha, right where I wan-cha
And I'm about to let-cha have it
I'm talking about my carrot, you're the bunny rabbit
Here it is baby doll, honey, grab it
Open up so I can have it
Ooh...wee do like BBD and do me baby
You're the lady who makes me looney Screamin' Ice ice Baby
Straight knockin' the boots just Cause I'm a super star
And she knows this that's why I do her far
Or should I say long, If you know what I mean
I'm talking about my Ice cream  yea
I make the girls scream, as I give up the juice

Here comes the lyrical breakdown
Move out the way punk, and take a seat clown
It's the Ice Man slicin', Dicin'
Hittin' like Tyson
So listen to the rhythm I givin' 'em
My lyrics got the impact of a Mac truck when I'm sendin' 'em
Yo, My funky rhymes flow
Kickin it like psycho
And I'm exploding like nitro-glis
Coming like a hurricane bliss
Straight sacking the track like a quarterback
My man Zero is back with a killer slice
I'm blowin' up the mic
Ya damn right, Vanilla Ice
With twice the punch
I put the crunch on Marky
And take the funky out of his bunch
I hit the home run
You got to third base, son
I'm in first place
Take a seat clown for the beatdown

[Verse 2]
Uh, tonight's the night of the big fight
With the mic in my hand I got the grip tights
Ready to swing it like a Louisville slugger
Right at the head of a sucka
Crack home run
How did it feel to have the mic hit ya dome, Son? Uh!
I tried to make your head ring like a church bell
I put it on ya hard
I'll make ya hurt well
'cause you fell into my booby traps
No more good vibrations
I'm tired of your boots raps
So I eat ya like scooby snacks
An maybe roll you like a zig zag
Or smoke you like a hootie mac
You did what I did
So you're gonna lose kid
Cause to me you're still a new kid on the block
Get off my jock, Get off my diznok
Before you get dropped for the beatdown

[Verse 3]
Yeah, this is the last verse
Should I say the last round
And its time I knock out another class clown
Sit down and take notes
As Vanilla kicks ballistics with dope lyrics
Oh what a pity, though
Cause ya had to spend three million dollars on your video
It was video and I can admit that
All that money's wasted cause your song's wack
I make stuff to make the people gather
An' let 'em see us in a pit
I want to slam dance with ya, Hammer
Now can I kick it, of course I can
yo, you will get burned out, then turned out
I'm gonna keep comin strong, song after song
Ya thought I'd fade, well ya did wrong
I'm the imperial threat for this sound fools
Ha Ha, here comes the lyrical beatdown",Hit 'Em Hard,1994
Vanilla Ice,"[Verse 1]
I Remember way back when
Lookin' for the right girl to be my friend
I searched and searched but still never came up
On the right one who would be mine and the only one
Luck never came my way
And all I ever came up with is a broken heart ya see
I couldn't stand to be alone why my boys
Straight kick it with the betties while I sat by the telephone
Everytime I hear it rang it wasn't who I want it to be
It was just the same ol' thing, Another day another heartache
No pain, no gain, just Lookin' for a good thing
Momma use to say don't look for love
Just let it come around and surely one day it'll be found
Ya see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around
But the ICE goes down

I go down, I go down, I go down baby, I go down
I go down, I go down baby doll, I go down

[Verse 2]
Step up if ya think ya out there
I know it's gotta be a tender
Who'll remember Ice somewhere
That's only if you're ready for a real one
I need a tender and yeah I gotta feel one
I want to tease and please
And do it all with ease
But ya gotta be right and all that
There when I need ya perfect like Kodak
Picture perfect body like an hour glass figure
Cool in tha head and I gotta dig her
The type that never says no
Cause she's down to the fullest, Cool like the wind blows
And I ain't trying' to search and find
I guess it's true when they say that love is blind
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around
But the ICE goes down

[Verse 3]
Now I'm on tour and got the past behind me
But I need something to remind me
Of the days when I played the kissing game
But now things changed and no I ain't the same
I made a come up, and now they run up
They all scream I'm the one, That wants to give the love up
But ICE ain't got no time for games
I need a real love, Like Mary J. Blige know what I'm sayin
But the odds are still against me, I'm making paper
And still need that one, That wants to be with me
And not for the money, Nor the fame, But for me
One who can give me that security
So if you're out there this one's for you
You'll be down with me, then maybe I'll be true
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around

It's like lookin' down a shotgun barrel
Pump up the sounds to the max
As if ya dare yo, My groove is dope
An' I hope that you're prepared so
Give it up Smooth 'cause the ICE is got it sewed up
The bum rush is on, an' Vanilla's gonna blow up
Dead in your grill - Loc
I'm kickin' it real fly - Hops
this is how it's done homies
An' ya know I got funky rhymes

[Verse 2]
I got the rhymes that's pumpin'
Keeps the jeeps bumpin'
Sounds that's thumpin'
Women want to jump in
I ride down many streets
Rockin' all the big beats
My album's on the top
With a bullet for many weeks
This is how it's done - see
Doin' it for my fans G
Doin' it for Dallas an' everybody in Miami
Thought I was down with Luke
No but here's the scoop
You make all your loot
But ya can't even pay your group
Well man that's straight wacked!
In fact, I hate that
Watch yourself 'cause ya might get paid back
All this funky dope stuff
I'm kickin' it real fly - Hops
This is how it's done homies
An' ya know I got funky rhymes",Phunky Rhymes,1994

Roll 'em up, roll up the hooty mac, rollem up
Roll 'em up, roll 'em up, roll 'em up..

I need some herbs and spices
So I can feel nices

Cause it's the I-see-E and you know I got the feel it
I score it, and I ain't gotta steal it
So bring on the sack that's phat
And ya know I love my is izm and the 1.5

Everytime I get a little hit of the ummm
The skunk, And the funk feels good to my lungs
Fire, Fire, The izm is my desire
And I need to get it quick cause it's callin me
Come and roll me up please I-see-E
Light the hooty mac, So we can start the par-ty
You know I smoke good stuff, So go and get the bong
Bong - Biggedy bong, Once again you know it's on - huh
You feel it, You feel it, You want it, You want it
Roll it, Roll it, Lick it - Now hit it

[Chorus] - 8X

[Verse 2]
You see everytime I wake up, I got to clear my head
But I clear it with cess, Cause it goes with my dreds
And I can't stand to run out, Cause if you do I get illy
Never get silly, So pass me the philly
Blunt, and no I don't front like Zero
Who wears a chronic hat but always says no
But I say yes, and I get it off my chest
Bring the bo, bring the skunk, and I hit the phunky cess
Check it, You ain't gotta test it
It's the mad bomb and I've already blessed it
Checka 1-2, Tell me how ya do
When you hear the dirty budda when the buzz comes through
I ain't tryin to front, Cause I'm gettin' what I want
Take a chunk of the funk, leave the sack in my trunk
Yeah, You feel it, You feel it, You want it, You want it
Roll it, Roll it, Lick it - Now hit it

[Chorus] - 8X

Roll 'em up the hooty mac, That what I said
Now tell me how you feelin'
Don't it feel good enought to jump and touch the ceiling
It's on, It's on, I feel it comin on
It's good to the bone, Cause the buzz is real strong
Even though I can not stand it, But I recommend it
Especially when ya sick with a cold, so spend it
You know that twenty dollars that you've saved Throughout the week?
If you're a non smoker, Then please don't try to speak
The plan, The plan, Ya know I've got a plan
Squirrels got the goods, Now tell me who's the man
But not really the man that you call when you want it
Ya know I stay legit, and I've got to stay up on it
On and On Yo, Give me a ho [Ho!]
And ask me what I want to do, then I'll let you know
You feel it, you feel it, you want it, you want it
Roll it, roll it, lick it - now hit it

Vanilla Ice,"Here it is A dope hit. 
Iceman comin' with the dope hit. 
'cause a few suckers need their throats slit, 
Jealous cause I went multi-platinum. 
Now I'm gonna blast them in the head, 
Till they're dead with my magnum lyrics. 
Might be simplistic, but I'm no gimp, 
On the strength 'cause I know how to pimp it. 
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinkin in my quicksand, 
Vanilla Ice vocal hit man. 
Got the number 3 in my crosses sittin' on the rooftoop, 
Pop-pop-pop, 
Pop goes the weasel was a bag fa-flop-flop. 
The brothers didn't like your record, 
'cause it wasn't hip-hop=hop, 
But this ain't a dis, 'cause you sold gold. 
Still a made a killin' 
'cause it ain't even a tenth of eleven million. 
Givin' my rhyme spice, while my DJ's on the slice, 
Vanilla Ice is back on the map, with the wrath of 
The Iceman. 

Ice, Ice, Man
The wrath of the Ice Man 

I'm the Ice, the Iceman but I'm no superhero, 
So baby just cut that zero. 
I'm gettin tired of those punks gettin jealous, 
Trying to say that I might be another Elvis. 
Forget that I'm Vanilla, the funky rhyme killa, 
The dope song deala, ready to pilla cap of a wack MC 
There's no wack in me, and big dollars is all I'm stackin' G 
So give a boost to the volume. 
I got the funky-funky sounds to make the cars boom, 
So step back and give me room, as I consume the others 
The Iceman is bringin' doom to the suckers 
Yes, for the lovers of hip-hop. 
And for my foes they get popped, you shouldn't step to the man 
When I'm swingin like Tyson. 
Yo, punk this is the wrath of the Iceman. 

Now I'm on everybody's hit list, so there gonna get dissed, 
Now there on my hit list. 
It's like that cause I'm the mizzak I carry my striszap, 
To bust a kizap, don't try to jizak me, 'cause my life is 
Like hectic, when I made a record, now I'm gettin' 
Hounded every second, see I'm like the one. 
They love to hate, so I made this album much harder 
To set the stupid critics straight, 
And I'm still droppin bombs, you know the rap world, 
A battle field in Vietnam, and I'm creepin' like a sniper. 
Takin' out the suckers with an album that is 
Funkier and hyper, the type of street stuff 
I like listenin to, funky bass and breaks to make your 
Speakers shake, earthquake breaks the Richter scale 
Check out the aftermath. 
Yo, this the wrath of the Iceman.

Vanilla Ice,"Yo, VIP, let's kick it!

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby
All right stop
Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Then I flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop?
Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle

Dance
Bum rush the speaker that booms
I'm killin' your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less that the best is a felony
Love it or leave it
You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye 
The kid don't play
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla  
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby
Waving just to say hi
Did you stop?
No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo so I continued to a1a Beachfront Ave
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine
All I heard were shells
Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin' to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem 
Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice it like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby Vanilla 
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother

Gotta let you body move 
Gotta keep the music jumpin'

Face the music, then I'm right behind 
With a posse, a mic and a funky rhyme 
It doesn't take a lot of time for me to climb 
And whem I'm going for mine, I'm like a monkey on a vine 
Goin' up the scale and I will prevail 
Sharper than the point on the tip of a nail 
Movin' with the speed of a thief on the run 
My mic is my gun and my posse's the one 
Ready for fun, but also for static 
Anything breaks and they're ready automatic 
I've had it with suckers who try to get paid - 
Sayin' they're teaching, but not makin' 
The grade - they're played. 
I'm the teacher, man, you're the student 
Close your ears if you feel you're prudent 
And can't deal with the lyrics I'm steppin' with 
But they're the lines the people are gettin' with 
A lesson well taught, here's some more advice 
I don't sweat it on the mic 
'Cause I'm cool as Ice 

CHORUS REPEAT 2x's 

Roll into town with no windows down 
I'm on my bike and I'm headed for a mic 
Battles defuse with the news of my arrival 
Instincts are primal, I'm all about survival 
Proceed with caution, I'm like a blaze 
That's roared for days 
All that gaze are amazed 
Dazed by the force that they just witnessed 
Master, is the title to fit this 
Man before ya, lyrical lawyer 
Suin' all the suckers on the mic that bore ya 
Slick, I'll trick like a magician 
On the microphone, I'm like a rap technician 
Turn the party out in my opinion 
Witty words make the world my dominion 
Figure out a riddle in rhyme, You can't stump me 
I get off if a beat is funky 
I'm not Sleepy, Dopey or Grumpy 
But you'll be fallin', just like Humpty did 
And that's all she wrote 
Then I disappear in a puff of smoke 
I'm like a surgeon and I'm urgin' 
Stay away or I'll slice 
I don't sweat it under pressure 
'Cause I'm cool as Ice 

CHORUS REAPEAT 2x's 

Rise and shine, girls up & at 'em 
See a microphone on the stage and I'm grabbin' 
You act like Eve and I'll act like Adam 
Tangle with a snake, make sure that you pat him 
Keep him calm for sure or he'll strike back 
Shake your booty girl, Yeah I like that 
Keep your moves silky smooth, hot and sexy 
It won't vex me, I won't get testy. 
And when you rush the stage 
Bein' all kinds of frantic, you know 
I won't panic, I'll just get romantic 
Ten and twenty, you come by the droves 
Don't be scared to take off your clothes 
If you're really short, get on your tippy toes 
And remember, anything goes 
'Cause I'm all about fun on the run 
I'll just take each girl one by one 
I'n not the type to be tied up or tied down 
There's enough of me to go around 
Girlies on my tip like white on rice 
I don't sweat it on the mic

People are jumpin' and the fly girls are staren'
People under 40...Yo! Let's get down
Because they need more break and now it's sliced by Shay
The records out so don't wait

The style that I'm doin', it'll ruin

Get your dead ass up and back on the floor
Jump in the groove and let Vanilla go
Insane, with my gold chain

And everybody on the right, do the same thing

Come on everybody, let me see you dance
In motion, with the potion
Get up everybody and locomotion
All swing and do your thing
Unless of course, you can't hang. Chillin' is o.k
But not when I play this song, move along, be gone
Yea! The beat'll make you move when the records on
Get with this style and update it

I wanna peel my skin hang it on the shelf
Die from no pain
A minimal brain
Damn I'm like an idiot when I go insane
Too impulsive too impatient
Anxiety's got me screamin' this hatred
Still I strive to stay alive
Gotta get mine cause I just can't be myself

Cause I just can't fuckin' be myself
And I just can't hide from myself
Every time it's just myself

Is there some future? contemplate 
I need gratification before it's too late
The cravings are dry, drive me through
Self destruction can always be true
Islands of fire keep me alive
No drugs around can fill me inside

I can't hide
And I can't hide
I know I can't hide
And I can't hide
I just can't be myself
And I just can't fuckin' be my self
I just can't hide from myself
Every time it's just my self",A.D.D.,1998
Vanilla Ice,"[Chorus:]
Freestylin' on the mic get in the go
Freestylin' on the mic so let if flow
Freestylin' on the mic get in the go
First on the microphone

Taking rappers like hot dice, like hot nights in Vegas
Got says they hate us 'cause they are fucking with the greatest
niggas that pull gats and steal gats just like potatoes
Knowing they couldn't break us or take us now fake us take us out, no doubt
Make us serve your ass with a teck
Making rappers bow down like the Westside Connect
I want the Ice like cube, so I blast with the Mac 10
But trust me, I'm throwing up the dub just like Dub see
Plus we fucks it up on both coasts
Don't show clouts when I rip shot, putt niggas in zip lock
Fucking with this hip hop fanatics still automatic
Yes I smoke Kryptonite, get it right, my shit is tight
Got wicked ways like Mr. Mike
Get the gauge in the night these niggas running loose, get the bodies
These niggas in khakis and not Versace
Somebody should have told you, son it's on like that
With the ICE man bitch and I am gone like that

[Chorus]

I got some business that I gotta handle
Shit is kinda risky but I'm gonna have to take the gamble
niggas they trying to plot a scheme on me
Double and triple teams on me
I'll make them bleed for me
And that's how it is going down
I won't be satisfied until I see that ass six feet underground
'Cause you fucked around and pissed the wrong brother off 
You lied to yourself when you said I was soft
Now that's a no no, with manhole I'll formulate a plan yo
That will make your children bastards and your wife a widow
Trying to battle me that's a sin
And be like Toni Braxton and you'll never breath again
'Cause I hit hard like thunder, straight from the under
Ground with the sound that will make Stevie Wonder
Hard, but let me continue
Serving MC's like lettuce on the menu
Pound for pound up in this game to be the best
Back the fuck up off me motherfucker cause I'm stressed
You'll wind up in a casket fucking with me
You get your ass kicked, hit you harder than an accident
Lets get down to pleasure
And beat the kid out the treasure
Let me measure this here joint cause it'll be nothing lesser
I'll bet'cha that I'll get it wide open like Hostetler
Vanilla kobe surround all of you like Kobe
And leave you in suspense like who done that
You checked with Grandma
I'll be the last man standing off lyrical stamina
I round up 100 MC's in one city
Knock off 99 and a half 
And that leaves a half that want to face me
I'll leave him face down in the dirt
Call the paramedics check the body for surgery with anesthetic
Total mass in a mass stocker, hit the creator
Set it off like Michael Meyers in a double feature
Feature funky rhymes that are hard to swallow
Send your ass until tomorrow, you'll be hoping to escape the horror
Now pay attention to today's lesson
And in for your possession
Recognize these freestyle confession
I'll step aside a case like Kojak giving up the evidence but I leave no 
Fingerprints
Yo put the scrip off in a case like Matlock
Come bumpin on your block
And clean your ass up like Dr. Spock

Freestylin' on the mic get in the go
Freestylin' on the mic so let it flow
Freestylin' on the mic get in the go
And next on the mic it's the Ice, so let it flow!

It's the incredible party rocker, the heart stopper, hit dropper
Hypnotize you all like Big Poppa
Getting everybody blazed with the funky don't stop
As I detonate the spot like Oklahoma on your block
Like it will be the day that I don't blow up any buildings
When you hear me boy gonna beat the microphone I'm killing
Registering 10 on the Richter when I shake it
With the earthquake based my taste blowing out your woofers
Put you in a state of shock like Mick and Mike so get it right
Making is the night
Just to let you know my click is tight, right
We got women up front shaking ass
Just about stripping want to put on the glass
Pass the phat Philly as I heat it up like chili
Put down the gun son, there is no need for the 9 milli
Got the meat for the barbecue so spark a few hops
Watch as I raid your spot like Spartan infatuate your whole block",Freestyle,1998
Vanilla Ice,"[Verse 1]
As I continue the journey to get your eardrums straight
Now pay attention to this flow, there's no reason to hate
Now watch me show your state, and let me state how I do it
Sit back and just listen to the music
You get sucked up in this melody
Hell'll be the ones that lay down and get caught up in their jealousy
(Huh) They're telling white lies, Now realize, I caught it from the top
And I can see it in your eyes

[Chorus]
You're the fool in the suit
You're the fool in the suit
You're the fool, you're the fool, You're the fool
Fuck you - there ain't nothing you can do
You wack bastard - and there ain't nothing you can do
Fuck you - there ain't nothing you can do
You wack bastard - nothing you can do

[Verse 2]
Like a phony acting like that you was my homie
Like genuine you tried to ride me like a pony
I'm the only that's gonna shine, so forget it
You critics who wasn't with it
Mad cause I flipped it back on ya'
Blowin up the spot like kazinsky on safety
Blaze another track cause I'm simply hot to trot
Gotta make a knot, get the people into it
When I do it, grab the cash, and shake the spot
Now tell me if you know how I'm coming, nose running
To get a glimpse at the most stunning and cunning
And never will I change a format and now you know
I can't go for that

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Fuck that bullshit...you fucking...that shit sucks... you weak bastard..
Fuck vanilla ice...he sucks...he eats shit...fuck vanilla ice
(Yelling) I hope you got more shit than that you weak motherfucker!

And there ain't nothing you can do
And there ain't nothing you can do

[Verse 3]
One short life and I can't die
Some got more pricks than a motherfuckin porcupine
Still I'm waiting, waiting to die
Cause I burn like your mother says, boil like your father's pride

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Fuck you...you white ass...bullshit...corn-fed trailer park...bitch..
Fucking...fuck you...cheap, worn out...yuppie...bastard...wack ass..

Vanilla Ice,"[Verse 1]
Now that ya feelin it I see you're getting weak
You're gettin real close
You're reachin that peak
Uh
You're like high altitude in a lear jet
Work them hips like a pistons in a corvette
Slow down or I'll have to pull ya over
Search ya, handcuff ya, and do a move on ya
You get a gwb stands for girl with a body pump it like a hottie
Seems like you got switches and you're hittin em
Two wheel motion keep bumpin em
Now throw it east to west and put a hump in it
Back stroke, and boogie with a bump in it
Tell me how ya do it like that, how ya got stacked
How you scrambled like a quarter back
I want you weak in the knees and shaking in your pants
And all I want to do is make you dance
Come on!

[Chorus]
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come

[Verse 2]
See the sweat that you're lettin off
Now, keep it comin girl
Ya know I love it when you take it off
You got me sittin in the hot seat
Drippin from the body heat
From my head to my feet
We can do it by candle light all night
Keep it goin till the sunlight, that's right
Whatcha tryin to do, make the ice melt?
Don't you know my cream is good for your health?
You know you want to shake what your mamma gave ya
You're getting real hot, now I'm gonna spray ya
Rub it in like lotion
Juices flowin everywhere
Like water in the ocean
You got that hourglass figure
Uh, All the right moves
And ya know I want to dig ya
Got 31 flavors, know what I mean?
And I want to take a dip in your ice cream

[Chorus]
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come here I come, here I come
Here I come, here I come here I come, here I come

[Verse 3]
Know I'll be the one to kick this shit off
And crank it up like a 250
Engine in a motorcross
And make ya feel it girl
Till ya get sick with it
And all that junk in your trunk
Don't be stingy with it
And I'm gonna make it all good like the weekend
You got enough for yourself and for all my friends
And it's enough of me to go round like the globe
Set it up like a tent, watch it unfold
I see your eyes glistening for the benji's
But you ain't gotta fake it
I just want you to shake it
Break me off a piece of that action like jackson
I ain't trying to hit it
And I ain't trying to wax it
Picture you and me on the beach and you be
Climbing up this tall coconut tree
All I want to do is hump with it and make you scream
And eat you up
As I floss with your g-string

[Chorus]

Cause a few suckers need their throats slit
Jealous cause I went multi platinum
Now I'm gonna blast you in the head
Till you're dead with my magnum
Lyrics might be simplistic, but I'm no simp
On the strip, cause I know how to pimp it
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinking
In my quicksand, Vanilla Ice, vocal hitman

Got the number three in my crosses, sittin' on the rooftop
Bop bop bop
And you fools drop, Was a big fl-fl-flop flop
Brother's didn't like your record 'cause it wasn't hip hop hop
But this ain't a dis 'cause you sold gold
Still, I made a killin' and it ain't even a ten eleven million
Given my rhyming spice while my DJ's on the slice
Vanilla Ice is back on the map, with the wrath of the Ice king

No one will stop me
No one will stop me
No one will stop me

Why is that I disperse?
Why does God shun?
Why does my man try to run my actions?
Why is that I disperse?
Why does God shun?
Now why does my man try to run my actions?
My living condition
[Incomprehensible] my living condition
My living condition
[Incomprehensible] it's my living condition

Etch on a sketch on a rhyme like an architect
Now watch your back son, cause you might lose your neck
Pound for pound, I rock the ground I stand on
I rock records, every record at random
Flyin' heads, as the heads get full
[Incomprehensible] speakers get ripped and torn
To my tomb
I'm wicked as a witch on a broom stick
I smash bricks with one lick

Why is that I disperse?
Why does God shun?
Why does my man try to run my actions?
Why is that I disperse?
Why does God shun?
Now why does my man try to run my actions?

No one will stop me

You don't get a second chance
(No one will stop me)
Cause and tremors bring the scales in hand
Call the cops, the paramedics, the man's down
(No one will stop me)
You wanna rock my bell so I broke them down
My tongue snapped and cracked like a bull whip
(No one will stop me)
And you ain't nothing but my itty bitty target
And as I walk through the valley of sin
(No one will stop me)
I walk with all you my friends
",Living,1998
Vanilla Ice,"[Verse 1]
Stop as I drop this bomb
Blow up this place like another vietnam
I'm heavy like a holyfield blow to the dome
Back up son, now give me room, give me room
I set it off like this, don't give it up (uh)
I'm all up in you till you just can't get enough
I'm real hard to the bone you want more
I sneak up on you like a sniper at your back door
Phat flavor for your brain you know the time
So check the wrath it's for real cause I'm gonna get mine
I roll up on you like eastwood
I'm blowing up fifteens as I'm riding through your neighborhood
I spreads butter like parkay
Real smooth with the flow and even when I parlay
Do what you feel and check the skill
I'm in your grill, peep this - I got the raw deal
And in your jeep cherokee or land cruiser
When you're rolling through the hood I know you're gonna use a
Track like this all up in your eardrum
So pump the e.q. and let the speakers hum

Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack
We gets crazy like prozac
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack
We gets crazy like prozac
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack
We gets crazy like prozac
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack

Go and check it I think it's time to wreck it
Here I come again with my stuff, so let's test it
I'm cool like the ice, or vanilla, hear my flavor
Freezin up the mic, I hit you with somethin you can savor
No slippin, no stonin, I am gettin to the point
So hit the mad ism and light another joint
The easy like stylist with a kick when I'm kicking
No tripping, I'm hitting, so get a good grip in
Get with a style I be using, and there's no dissin
And here's a quick lesson - I carry a smith and wesson
Listen up close and there'll be no confusion
Now you're addicted to mentally abusing
Word to the mother I'm hear to tear it up
And if you can't get with it, I don't give a fuck
So run to your crew and tell them I am hear
This here is for the people

It's the funky rhyme killer
The dope song thriller
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya
It's the funky rhyme killer
The dope song thriller
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya

The dope song thriller
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya

[Chorus]",Prozac,1998
Vanilla Ice,"[Verse 1]
Reality sucks, too much pain
I can't explain why I want to bash brains
Still I can see it on the other side
Got a new baby, want to stay alive
Give what I give, give what I got
Make it worth while, cause I got another shot
Broken families that always got pain
I break the chain, refuse to be the same
Mother did as good as you could
After all the abuse I still understood
Three times divorced, and three times a kid
Gave us more love than our father ever did
Now we've all grown and moved along
Tried to forget, but my brother did me wrong
But it's real hard to put it all behind me
It's like a tattoo frozen in a memory
I can't seem to erase the stain
In my brain, things will never be the same
I remember all the lies, fucked up, now I realize
Never had a chance as a kid, I was a man
Fight after fight wasn't really what I planned
Father!
Whoever you are
Beat my mother down, all I see is scars
And memories - what about me?
Throw me through a window for watching tv
Where did I get this anger?
Where did I get this hate?
And where did I get my temper?
Now I'm gonna show my faith
(huh) never will I be like you, be like you
Fucked up, that shit, I'm staying true

My family, true to my family
I'm true to my family
True to my family
Stay true
True to my family
Stay true, stay true
True to my family
Stay true
True to my family
Stay true, stay true

I had a zig zag story just the other day
I rolled a fat blunt and yo, it ripped this way
I took a puff (uh-huh) and what did I see?
Those motherfuckers still want to I-see-E
To blaze up a sac of that green bombay
And when I reach my peak, I explode like dante
Tha ganjay has got my mind wide open, I'm soakin'
In the music, I use it, And don't abuse it
And true, It gets me high like the sky
I will buy till the day that I die
You ain't gotta ask me why
I take tokes from the smoke, I can't deny
Got a lifetime supply

Get you high all night

This is a zig zag story that I had last night
A six-pack, a joint, And I was feeling all right
Lit up tha chronic, And what did I see?
This bad-ass bitch creeping up on me
She had the look that could get the ice cooked up in a second
I pictured her undressing and gettin' butt-naked
She walked up to me and said her name was mary jane
Ain't no shame in my game, Down to do anything
Took me by the hand, Ask me if i'd like to fly
You know I like to fly

Now here's a zig zag story that I'm havin' right now
Gotta get myself together, Cause some shit is goin' down
Hit you people off with my new cd
Hard to swallow, Like saying ""fuck the industry!""

With the bass kicked in, the fingers are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
I'm cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning them if they're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow

Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine

Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine

Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed

Roll that window
We have to turn around because I want to shoot you
Park the limousine, in front of the swamp
Then I want to shoot you dauncing on the limousine
With the swamp in the background
It looks like you're in the jungle, okay?

Let's all sing, Pop Goes the Weasel!

Pop goes the, pop goes the windin' of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill

I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started RAPE:
Rappers Against Phony Entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change

Gettin' paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop (pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop (drop drop dop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Fix the music and make senseless rhymes fit

I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read

So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel (the weasel)

Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel 
Pop pop goes the weasel, the weasel

Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that gotta in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band
Lookin like the same old Klan
Same old thieves that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure

Why score all my points in one peroid
Appearin' in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin' on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel

[Chorus]

Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it
Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it
Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it
But now you're getting sued kinda stoopid

Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas.. to those who speak Spanish
Doin' crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the Minister Prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours

Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the Prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the Serch, in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape, at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?
Ropin' off the scenes of the crime smokin' 
I got pub and I'ma nut like a SCUD see
Blowin' up, like I'm throwin' up a beef patty

Vanilla Ice,"Disaster, systems break when I quake 
Make no mistake, the crowd stays awake when I'm 
Shakin' and bakin' and I'm takin' all M-C's 
Smilin' on the mic 'cause I'm gonna make big gees 
Pow! Holy cow! It's like a bang or a boom 
MC's see me comin' and they're clearin' the room 
Ouuta my path 'cause they're scared of the result 
Don't wanna battle 'cause to me that's an insult 
Man, I wouldn't even lower myself 
I got your record and put it on the shelf 
I didn't play it, I used it as a frisbee 
Your girl saw me doin' it and she kissed me 
A good sport 'cause the ball's in my court 
And in the long run I'm takin' no shorts 
Slayin' competition till the parties done 
You want a Non Stop Jam 
Here's the right one 

[Chorus]
Gotta get it going' on 
Get wit' it 
Bust that beat 

Yes, I'm blessed and I must confess 
Put me to the test and you'll say I'm the best 
I don't joke, I don't even jest 
Every line in my rhyme makes me better than the rest 
I'll live high on the hog, on the fat of the land 
Goddamn, I'll be so hot I'll have to walk with a fan 
On the brink of success, champagne & caviar 
In limo's, just like a superstar 
Business. Leave your number at my office. 
Not for sale, but the fans all bought this 
Money pourin' in. Just like a faucet left on 
Cause my rhymes are that strong-last long 
Just like the coppertop battery 
You think I'm dope, come on, don't flatter me 
'Cause I been hearin' that stuff for years 
Respect from my peers and I'm changin' the gears 
Of that hip-hop engine, not to mention 
Retire at 21 and get a pension 
Gonna bust it out and your welcome to come 
You wanna Non Stop Jam here's the right one 

[Chorus]

Here's another rhyme to break the Ice 
You couldn't purchase my talent at any price 
Don't chase a roni cause I know that I can get 'em 
I'm not the type so I don't even sweat 'em 
I'll love a girl and then dis the same one 
Cause you know that there's more 
Where that came from 
Yo, the one I want just walked through the threshold 
So all you other girls are out in the cold for now 
She's the only one for me 
Who knows if we were meant to be 
Together forever and that's a real long time 
And you can tell I'm in the house by my dope rhyme 
Man, I'm glad she came to her senses 
And that she put down all her defenses 
And finally gave her heart and soul 
To the man behind the mic control 
I'm here with her now I'm ready for fun 
You want a Non Stop Jam, here's the right one

Saturday night, The club was packed, But I can't get no action
The girl I want is frontin hard, I can't get no satisfaction
Thousand people up in the club and the music's thumpin hard
I must admit that I was slightly anxious to have my card
Pooled by a girl in a nice tight dress
The kind that makes ya body wet, Hmm, I must confess
I tryed and she said no, But fellas yo, I can't get no

[Chorus]
I can't get no [Yeah]
I can't get no [Ya know what I'm sayin?]
I can't get no [Yep, Yep]
Satisfaction, Ah hey hey hey
You know what I say
That's what I say
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Girlie at the bar, Lookin mighty fly
She look so fly at the time
I had to make up, You know, My mind
So I walked up to her gently, Just so I can speak
Man, she turned around and scoped me down and started doin the freak
I tryed all I could, I even said please
She moved my hands off her booty, Cause she was a skeeze
Man, I had to escape, So I could get away
I told her what was up, She said come back another day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The party's almost over, The club's about to close
I saw this girl who rocked my world, So I suppose
I'll take another chance, A try at romance
I couldn't take my eyes off the back of her pants
I moved very smoothly, A nice conversation
The perfume she was wearing, Ooh, Sensation!
She seemed kinda worried, Like something was wrong
Tyson at my back, I had to move along

Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine

Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps are acting ill because they're so full of eight balls
Gunshots ranged out like a bell

And How many songs did I write for you

Rihanna, where you at?

You had my heart and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there, with you I'll always share

Because when the sun shines we?ll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part, when the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

You can run into my arms, it's okay don't be alarmed
Come into me, there's no distance in between our love
So go on let the rain pour I'll be all you need and more

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay

Vanishing Point,"Am I in a dream?
This looks a perfect scene
My will remains but I am falling
Tell me where I am
Will I understand?
The mystery that is surrounding

Uncertainty remains, views left unchanged
A pure heart is now stained

Could it be so real
Seek the truth beyond perception
Life left unanswered
Will I find what I am looking for?

Take this mystery
Turn and set it free
Endure the pain when it's bursting
Images surreal
A hate you cannot feel
It's all revealed as the days are unfolding

Rise above don't wait
Decide your own fate
Look far beyond the truth that is lying
I've come to understand
As an optimistic man
That one day I'll find all the answers",Surreal,2000
Vanishing Point,"Look beyond the mirrors reflections
Journey past walls,
that encage the right to be free
There's always someone watching
Transcend high
Obtain a better view from above

Through the looking glass I see
Traces of lost centuries
Still remains of what life used to be

We've paved the way,
nothing can be changed
Forever chasing lies
Chapters left without a name
We've turned the page of history
And closed the door behind
There lies a fear within, I'll carry on

Through the looking glass I see
Climpses of prosperity
A chance to restore of
what's been missing

Flashes of sacred visions
I've never seen with my own eyes
Writings revealing reason
Define the truth amongst the lies
Flashes of sacred visions
I've never seen with my own eyes
Throughout the change in season
I've never heard the children cry",Blind,2001
Vanishing Point,"A mind lapse succumbed by fear
The framework fades then disappears
Unto my world this loneliness surrounds me

Trust foresees it's final wake
I close my eyes, it's breath I take
Denied and drained are years befallen from me

In these hours seized by memories
Reflective paths of light appear
I walk alone, I disappear

Now I watch you burn inside me
The truth is damned and empty
I breathe the ashes of your soul

That gives me silence, gives me peace
Gives me space, gives me release
In sullen thoughts, you make me feel so hollow

In these hours seized by memories
Reflective paths of light appear
I walk alone, I disappear

[Chorus]
Tangled in this lifetime, tangled in it's sorrow
Moments of clarity, fade into tomorrow
Tangled in this madness, What was deep now shallow
If I believe in miracles, why do I feel so hollow

Change forced from disarray
Yesteryear wasted away
Sheltered from this shattered life within me

In these hours seized by memories
Reflective paths of light appear
I walk alone, I disappear

[Chorus]

Now I see, truth in memories
Reflective paths have disappeared
I walk alone, I reappear

[Chorus]

In darkest days, I'm on my own
Why do I feel so hollow
An open view, a fading soul

I'm lost in truth from what was told
Why do I feel so hollow",Hollow,2005

Is one that plays with himself 
None of my friends could stand the sight of you 
Much less the smell 
And if I weren't a lady, I'd take my money 
And buy you a brand new face 
Then I'd take my underwear and stick it in your mouth 
And you'd love it 'cause you got no taste 
And if that don't work, call back your dead daddy 
And show him what you look like now 
Honey, I'd bet he never come back 
'cause you one ugly cow (Ooh-wee) 
Girl, you tell your boyfriend Jimmy he can go and get hit by a car 
'cause as far as I see it, he can't afford 2 bite the beat of this star

Che fino a sera non ti lascia più

In giornate come queste
Che ricordare la felicità
Sapendo già che è inutile
Ripetere chissà?

Rivedo tutta la mia vita

Che ho fatto a modo mio

E non mi son servite a niente

E se ho promesso non lo faccio più

Tu non hai conosciuto mai

Spesa a dare dare dare
Non ho salvato niente neanche te

Io non rinuncio a credere
Che tu potresti ritornare qui
E come tanto tempo fa
Ripeto chi lo sa?
Domani è un altro giorno si vedrà

E oggi non m'importa
Della stagione morta
Per cui rimpianti adesso non ho più

Ma ci sarà chi me le tiene
Oggi e domani e poi domani ancora
Finché il mio cuore ce la fa

Sei tu quella ragione di più
Mi hai chiesto talmente tanto
Io, non ho più niente per te
E ti amo , tu non sai quanto

Amo da morire anche il tuo silenzio
Che non mi lascia andare via

Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

You see the world through your window
You don't even go outside anymore
Only feel safe feeling hollow
You think your scars are way too deep to be cured

You hide your heart in the shadows
So afraid to open up to anyone
But I can see your faded halo
And I can make it burn again, like the sun

If you stay for a while
Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light

But stay for a while
Let me hold you tonight
Just open your eyes you will see the light shine
You don't have to be frozen
You don't have to be broken tonight

moneys been around but its never been enough
most ain't givin no choice but to hussle
some break down when the going gets tough
deep in the manners all kinds of different people
mines over east still struggle to be equal
so many characters, 4 main types
the good, the bad, the ugly, and the evil
deep in the manner where the povertys visible
there's not a lot sweet so most look misarable

shotters keep the money going round
kids goin stray most never get found
iv noticed there a ghetto in every town
the skies are empty because the stars are on the ground

we grew up in the ghetto saw real life pain
real life struggle with real life strain
real life kiddies with real life guns
and real life mothers lose real life sons

beef after beef just to be the top geezer

ghetto high murders gotta maintain reps
what's it all about i ask myself before i swing
more time I'm beefin over any little thing
beefin any area,region or vincity

Donde andaba, quien soy yo
Que me aguarda adónde voy

Donde anda, quien soy yo
Donde anda, quien soy yo

Cuando estuve junto
A el mi canción dejo de ser
Le recuerdo junto al mar
Solo queda recordar
Algo extraño me hizo amar

Solo queda recordar
Por siempre
No sé como llego a mí

Fue un temblor, un éxtasis
Una noche se alejo
Fue un misterio del amor
Nadie puede explicar

Como le puedo olvidar
Por siempre me pregunto qué pasó
Yo no sé por dónde voy
Mi camino se tendió

Donde anda, quien soy yo
Donde anda, quien soy yo
Donde anda, quien soy yo

Que se encuentra mi vida marchita

Porque Dios me mando este camino

bitter and twisted young maid -
her heart is darkness,
a memory of old evil.

One of them she set fire to.
He became a bright-glowing coal.
It was fire that lulled him to sleep,
flames that made moan for him.

The second she threw in the water,
held him under the waves.
It was the sea-swell that rocked him,
dark ocean that took him.

She dug a pit in the woods for the third,
laid him to sleep in a grove.
His cradle is birch-trees, swaying,
they watch over his everlasting sleep.

And it is headed straight for our shore
Hold on to your heart, I've seen the signs before
How wicked these, how wicked these hours

These times we've seen
How we built these odes to our God
Wasting our tears and chasing our fears
I look at these, I look at these and wish this was gone

Don't say another word
Some things are better kept silent
Don't say another word
Leave in silence, let me live in silence

There is nothing left in this beggar's hand
I gave like I give to my God
Nothing is sacred within these walls

That I built and you built in our shame, in our fear
In this room full of yesterday's ghosts
Who am I? I ask as I shatter and fall

Some things are better kept silent

E non andrò via 
Passerò tutta l'estate qui
Compresi I lunedì
Quelli li odio di più
Non lo so, ma è così
Odio I lunedì 
I lunedì 
La mia ragazza mi ha lasciato una valigia 
Piena di 
Di auguri perché mi si spezzi il collo 
Entro mercoledì! 
Perché quel giorno lì
Lei forse torna qui
A prendere le cose che ha dice
Dimenticato lì
Ma brava fai così
Vieni di lunedì

E adesso basta vado fuori 
Sempre se trovo I pantaloni 
E vado ad affogare
Tutti I miei dolori 
Perché restare, restare soli 
Fa male anche ai duri
Loro non lo dicono ma
Parlano con I muri 
(Forti però quei duri)

La ragazza mi ha lasciato 
È colpa mia! 
Sono stato anche beccato
Dalla polizia! 
Mi han detto prego, si accomodi lì
Passerà qualche giorno qui
Ma vedrà che probabilmente uscirà certo
Prima di lunedì
Voglio restare qui
Odio quel giorno lì

E adesso basta, vado fuori 
Sempre se trovo I pantaloni 
E vado ad affogare
Tutti I miei dolori 
Perché restare, restare soli, 
Fa male anche ai duri 
Loro non lo dicono ma 
Piangono contro I muri

Vasco Rossi,"La combriccola del blasco 
Si è fermata dentro a un bosco 
Che nessuno aveva voglia di abitare 
Fu così che per dispetto 
Che qualcuno da su un...tetto 
Tutto a un tratto! da sul tetto...si mise a urlare! 
Guardate l'animale!... 
Guardate l'animaaaleeeeeeee

La combriccola del blasco 
Era poco più di un pugno 
Ma se si stringeva colpiva molto duro 
Fu così che per non fare 
Per non fare troppo male 
Lasciò il bosco per un posto, più sicuro

Magari un po' più buio 
Ma molto più sicuro 
Magari un po' più buio 
Ma molto più sicuuuurohohohohoh

La combriccola del blasco 
Era tutta gente a posto 
Ma qualcuno continuava a dirne male 
Si diceva che quel blasco 
Fosse stato prima un rospo 
Tramutato non so come e anche male 
In uno strano animale!... 
Con delle voglie strane 
Uno strano animale 
Con delle voglie straaaneeeeee

La combriccola del blasco 
Arrivati a questo punto 
Sparì dentro un buco profondo come il mare 
A vedere se quel tale 
Arrivava fin là in fondo 
Arrischiando, per lui stesso? d'affogare
Magari in mezzo al mare 
Per prender l'animale

Vieni già in fondo al mare 
A prender l'animale 
Vieni già in fondo al mare 
Che ti do l'animale","""Blasco"" Rossi",1987

In un sabato di merda
O che ne so, cosa c'è, cosa te
Non ci credo che, stasera te
Piangi più di me

Sei un ipocrita schifoso
E sei pericoloso
Altro che, altro che

Anche se, non rischi mai
Anche se di te non si sa niente mai
Anche se, non ce l'hai
Un'amante, un vizio strano
Qualcosa dài

Neanche un piccolo difetto
Praticamente perfetto
E allora di'
Che cosa vuoi e da chi

Canto per non impazzire
Per il piacere di dire
Tutte le cose che
Vedo intorno a me

E non mi resta che
E non mi resta che dire
Questa è una nuova canzone
Che aiuterà me a capire
E in qualche modo a sfogare

Tanto la musica e' dolce
Sentila qui che piacere
Ti gira intorno e non muore
Per me vuol farti godere
Senti che brividi nel cuore

Tanto la musica e' dolce
Sentila qui che piacere
Ti gira intorno, ti gira intorno
Ti gira intorno, ti gira intorno
Ti gira intorno

La gravità del problema della disoccupazione: suo figlio ha un 
Impiego statale e il tuo non trova da lavorare

Vasco Rossi,"C'era una volta una favola antica
Quasi da tutti ormai dimenticata
Che continuava a volare nell'aria
Aspettando colui
Che l'avrebbe di nuovo narrata
Era una favola vecchia
Un poco svanita
Come un barattolo
Di aranciata aperta
Ma non voleva rassegnarsi
E cercava di non dimenticarsi
Parlava di una bambina bionda
Che non voleva dormire da sola
E la sua mamma poverina
Doveva starle sempre vicina
Un giorno venne una bella signora
Tutta vestita di luce viola
Prese la mamma per la mano
E la portò lontano, lontano
La bimba pianse 100 sere
Poi si stancò
E si addormentò

Quando il mattino
La venne a svegliare
Con un bellissimo raggio di sole
Vide la mamma poverina
Che sotto un albero dormiva
E la signora vestita di viola
Disse ""non devi più avere paura
Di restare sola

Quasi da tutti ormai dimenticata
Che continuava a volare nell'aria
Aspettando colui che l'avrebbe

E sono ancora qui 
E voi vi siete abituati si! 
Ormai son qui 
E nessuno più può togliermi! 
Da quando sono qui 
Assomiglio già un Po' a te! 

Mi ricordo che sì, si escludeva 
Per motivi che 
Oggi fanno solo ridere 
Mi ricordo che sì, si escludeva 
Per primi quelli che 
Facevano paura: chissà perché? 
Mi ricordo che sì, si escludeva 
Sempre il più debole 
Mi ricordo che ""non si voleva"" 
Però neanche I più brutti come me 

E avanti così 
Facciamo due comunità diverse 

C'è chi dice non è un problema 
Stiano pure qui 
Poi li sfrutta come cani 
C'è chi dice non è un problema 
Li blocchiamo lì 
Non facciamo entrare più nessuno ""qui""? 
Cinquant'anni fa il ""problema"" 
Lo risolvevano bruciandoli! 
Che chi dice che ""il problema"" 
È che non ci sono più fiammiferi 

Speriamo che sì 
A noi ci lascino restare qui 
Se non ci credi 
Vieni a vivere con me 
Tocca I miei giochi 
E tutto quanto andrà

Vasco Rossi,"Sally cammina per la strada senza nemmeno 
Guardare per terra 
Sally è una donna che non ha più voglia 
Di fare la guerra 
Sally ha patito troppo 
Sally ha già visto che cosa 
Ti può crollare addosso 
Sally è già stata punita 
Per ogni sua distrazione o debolezza 
Per ogni candida carezza 
Data per non sentire l'amarezza 

Senti che fuori piove 
Senti che bel rumore 

Sally cammina per la strada sicura 
Senza pensare a niente 
Ormai guarda la gente 
Con aria indifferente 
Sono lontani quei momenti 
Quando uno sguardo provocava turbamenti 
Quando la vita era più facile 
E si potevano mangiare anche le fragole 
Perché la vita è un brivido che vola via 
È tutto un equilibrio sopra la follia 
Sopra follia 

Senti che fuori piove 
Senti che bel rumore 

Ma forse Sally è proprio questo il senso, il senso, il senso
Del tuo vagare 
Forse davvero ci si deve sentire 
Alla fine un po' male 
Forse alla fine di questa triste storia 
Qualcuno troverà il coraggio 
Per affrontare i sensi di colpa 
E cancellarli da questo viaggio 
Per vivere davvero ogni momento 
Con ogni suo turbamento 
E come se fosse l'ultimo 

Sally cammina per la strada leggera 
Ormai è sera 
Si accendono le luci dei lampioni 
Tutta la gente corre a casa davanti alle televisioni 
Ed un pensiero le passa per la testa 
Forse la vita non è stata tutta persa 
Forse qualcosa s'è salvato 
Forse davvero non è stato poi tutto sbagliato 
Forse era giusto così  
Forse ma, forse ma sì 

Cosa vuoi che ti dica io 
Senti che bel rumore",Sally,
Vasco Rossi,"E centomila occhi si voltarono 
A guardare il cielo 
Con un sospiro leggero, 
Da quella parte sì, e da quella parte che 
Sarebbero venuti, loro 
L'aveva detto il vecchio pazzo 
Che abitava il monte 
Nessuno aveva dubitato 
Delle sue parole 
Avevano bisogno di loro 
Sarebbero venuti in volo. 
E centomila cuori cominciarono 
A sondare il cielo 
Con un sospiro leggero 
Da quella parte sì, e da quella parte 
Che, sarebbero venuti loro 
Non c'era che aspettare fino all'alba 
Con pazienza e rassegnazione 
Avrebbero risolto tutto quanto loro 
Senza fare il minimo rumore 
Avevano bisogno di loro 
Sarebbero venuti in volo. 

E centomila mani cominciarono 
Ad alzarsi verso il cielo 
Si stava già facendo giorno 
E non era arrivato nessuno.

Faccio male volte

So solo che son pochi

Riposa dentro la stanza 
Con una mano sotto il cuscino 
Mentre di fuori spunta il mattino

E sulle labbra un po' di rossetto 
Andiamoci piano pero' con il trucco 
Se no la mamma brontolerà

Fai presto che sono le 8 
Se non ti muovi fai tardi lo stesso 
E poi la smetti con tutto quel trucco 
Che non sta bene te l'ho già detto

Guarda lo specchio poco convinta 
Mentre una mano si ferma sul seno 
È ancora piccolo ma crescerà

Dai non andare via
Non inventare adesso un'altra scusa
Un'altra, un'altra bugia
Cosa ne pensi di dimenticare

Di lasciarci andare
Ma dimmi la verità
Forse stasera è una sera
Che ti sentivi sola
E sei venuta qua
Non eri tu che dovevi partire

E non tornare più
Non eri tu che in fondo è come salire

Vasco Rossi,"Comunque non è questo 
Il modo di fare
Disse il commerciante 
All'uomo del pane
Domani sarà festa 
In questo stupido paese
Ma non per noi che stiamo a lavorare.
L'uomo del pane 
Fece finta di niente
Se ne andò tranquillamente
Aveva tante tante, tante cose da fare
Che lui non ci poteva fare niente.

A questo punto la signora disse
Per favore, son qui da un quarto d'ora 
E lei mi deve ancora servire
La prego signora mi scusi
Che cosa vuole
Vorrei uncinetto e mezzo di prosciutto
E un po' di cipolline, ancora cipolline
Va bene gliele incarto
Così fanno 60.000 tonde
Mi scusi non ho il resto
Le do anche 400 caramelle 
In cartone?
No sciolte

Fu proprio in quell'istante
Che la porta si aprì
Entrò un uomo col vestito nero e disse:
Tutti a terra faccia contro il muro
Questa è una rapina per davvero
La donna fece un urlo acuto
E dopo svenne in mezzo a tutte le sue caramelle
E poi le cadde addosso lo scaffale
Dei regali di Natale
Alé male alé male
Nessuno fuori si accorse di niente
La polizia arrivò dopo la gente
E fece un sacco di domande
E prese anche le impronte
Poi disse al commerciante
Lei deve sporgere denuncia
Per adesso contro ignoti
Ma vedrà che saran pochi
Non si deve preoccupare
Lei ci faccia lavorare
Noi sappiamo come fare
Deve solo collaborare.

Lo portarono in questura
E lo fecero sedere
Uscirà tra qualche mese

Perché non vuoi più piangere

E la vita continua
Anche senza di noi 
Che siamo lontani ormai

Da tutte quelle situazioni che ci univano
Da tutte quelle piccole emozioni che bastavano

È andata a casa con il negro, la troia
Mi son distratto un'attimo
Colpa di Alfredo 
Che con suoi discorsi seri e inopportuni 
Mi fa sciupare tutte le occasioni 
E prima o poi lo uccido, lo uccido
E lei invece non ha perso tempo 
Ha preso subito la palla al balzo 
L'ho vista uscire, mano nella mano, con quell'africano 
Che non parla neanche bene l'italiano, ma si vede che 
Si fa capire bene quando vuole
Tutte le sere ne accompagna a casa una diversa 
Chissà che cosa gli racconta 
Per me è la macchina che c'ha che conta

E quella stronza non si è neanche preoccupata 
Di dirmi almeno qualche cosa, che so, una scusa
E si era già dimenticata 
Di quello che mi aveva detto prima
""Mi puoi portare a casa questa sera? 
Abito fuori Modena, Modena park""
Ti porterei anche in America 
Ho comperato la macchina apposta
E mi ero già montato la testa
Avevo fatto tutti i miei progetti
Non la portavo mica a casa

Sono convinto che se non ci fosse stato lui mi avrebbe detto sì",Colpa d'Alfredo,2001

A sperare in qualche cosa di migliore

Questo, per non farti neanche sentire

Dimmi che posto mi dai

Che quando va a ballare sembra un'aranciata 
E guarda già I maschietti 
Con aria misteriosa 
Ma quando torna a casa la sera 
È tutta un'altra cosa 
Susanna balla sempre tutto il pomeriggio 
Ma non fa molto caso a chi le sta vicino 
E quando guarda intorno 
Muove appena appena gli occhi 
Con aria fatale 
Tenuto conto degli anni 

Non si mette le scarpette negli occhi 
Perché le hanno tutti 
E non si lascia affascinare da nessuno 
Ma sorride a tutti 

Susanna ha la maglietta numero 28 
Coi ricciolini in testa sembra proprio un confetto 
E non sta mai ferma un attimo 
Gira dappertutto 
E quando pensi di fermarla 
È già passato da un anno 
Quando sorride ha un'espressione maliziosa 
Che ti fa coraggio 
Ma poi scompare e non la vedi più 
Per tutto il pomeriggio 

Susanna è una bambina colorata 
Susanna è un'aranciata

quasi per caso 
quasi per caso hai deciso poi 
di commettere un piccolo peccato

ti sei voluta divertire 
ed hai voluto vedere 
fino a che punto potevi arrivare 
fino a che punto mi potevi umiliare 
fino a che punto mi avresti potuto anche cambiare 
e sei riuscita a farmi credere che 
tu fossi pulita 
mentre in realtà giocavi solamente 
spero che ti sia divertita 
Certo è un peccato però sai 
allora ero puro 
allora forse avrei potuto anche amarti 
davvero

non credo più a niente

La primavera insiste la mattina 
Dalla mia cucina vedo il mondo tondo
Sempre diverso, sempre ogni mattina
Sin dal giorno prima, dal giorno prima 
Con in bocca un gusto amaro che fa schifo
Chissà cosa è stato, quello che ho bevuto 
M'alzo dal letto e penso al povero
Al mio fegato, fegato spappolato
Fegato, fegato, fegato spappolato 

Dice mia madre devi andare dal dottore 
A farti guardare, a farti visitare 
Hai una faccia che fa schifo, guarda come sei ridotto
Mi sa tanto che finisci male 
La guardo negli occhi, con un sorriso strano 
Eppure la vedo, forse ha ragione davvero 

Ma fuori c'è la festa del paese 
Vado a fare un giro
Non l'ho neanche detto
Che già mia madre che mi corre dietro con il vestito nuovo
La fuga è veloce mi metto le scarpe che sono già in strada
Che bella giornata, non bado alla gente che guarda sconvolta
Ormai ci sono abituato, sono vaccinato
Sono controllato
Si pensa ormai addirittura in giro
È chiaro che sono drogato

La festa ha sempre il solito sapore
Il gusto di campane, non è neanche male 
C'è chi va a messa e c'è chi pensa di fumare 
Come aperitivo prima di mangiare
Fini s'è alzato da poco, e non è ancora sveglio
Non è ancora sveglio, ed è talmente scazzato
Che non riesce a parlare nemmeno

La sera che arriva non è mai diversa dalla sera prima
La gente che affoga nell'unica sala, la discoteca
Ci vuol qualcosa per tenersi a galla sopra questa merda 
Sopra questa merda 
E non m'importa se domani 
Mi dovrò svegliare con quel gusto in bocca, gusto in bocca

La lascio continuare
Lo so benissimo ma voglio vedere
Dove vuole arrivare.
Lei s'avvicina ancora un pò 
Mi sfiora con le labbra
O cosa non lo so.
 
Io non so più cosa fare
A questo punto mi dovrei svegliare
Forse dovrei saltargli addosso
Come fossi un animale
E dovrei essere molto virile
E continuare, magari per più di due ore
Eeh troppo.
 
Naturalmente lei insiste
Mi vuole propio fare
Magari è femminista
E non vuole certo farsi violentare
Ma vuole gestire

Dove la bacio, come la devo toccare,eh..
 
Però,però, però
Che strano come è dolce

Sembra quasi una bambina

Non ci capisse niente

Mi ricordava qualcun'altra 
Credevo d'averti già visto 
Magari su un fotoromanzo 
E quando te l'ho detto tu ridesti molto 
Poi tutto venne da se

Facile come pensare 
Quando ci si vuole capire 
E ci si lascia andare 
Ad un certo punto si comincia a vibrare 
Finché si rimane intontiti ad ascoltare

Credevo di essere arrivato già 
A delle conclusioni 
A delle spiegazioni 
Per tutto quello che facevo 
Per tutto quello che pensavo

Dicevi che maturare 
Significa cambiare 
E che fermarsi infondo è 
Come morire 
E lo volevi dire 
E lo volevi urlare 
Ed io urlavo con te
