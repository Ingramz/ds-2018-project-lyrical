Sandy Brown,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1960
Sandy Brown,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good),1966
Sandy Brown,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart",That Old Feeling,2012

Wish I was back in Texas,
The ocean's no place for a squirrel,
Wish I was in Texas,
Prettiest place in the world, oh no.
I guess deep in my heart I'll always be a Texas girl
I wanna go hommmme hooommmmmme hommme oh oh
Yoldle ay e oh, yodle ay e oh, yodle ay e oh, a lay-ee, a lay-ee.

I wanna wake up in Texas
I miss those wide open skies.
I miss my 20 acres, bar-b-ques,
And pecan pies, oh why?

When I'm so far from you, Texas, all I can do-o is cry.
I wanna go ho-oome,
Ho-oome, (a guy)I wanna go ho-ome!",Texas Song,2016
Sandy Coast,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby,2004
Sandy Dennison,"Ain't got the change of a nickel
Ain't got no bounce in my shoes
Ain't got no fancy to tickle

I ain't got nothing but the blues
Ain't got no coffee that's perking
Ain't got no winnings to lose

Ain't got a dream that is working
I ain't got nothing but the blues
When trumpets flare up

I keep my hair up
I just can't make it come down
Believe me, peppie
I can't get happy

Since my ever-loving baby left town
Ain't got no rest in my slumbers
Ain't got no feelings to bruise
Ain't got no telephone numbers
I ain't got nothing but the blues",Ain't Got Nothin' But the Blues,2003
Sandy Dennison,"I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day

I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me, darlin', when I say
I won't know sweet music until you return some day",I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart,2003
Sandy Dennison,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,2003
Sandy Dennison,"It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It makes no diff'rence 
If it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm 
Ev'rything you got

Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)",It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),2003
Sandy Dennison,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2007
Sandy Denny,"Do I ever wonder? You don't know.
You'll never follow, and I'll never show.
D'you see the water and watch it flow
And float an empty shell,
And you think that I'm hiding from the island.
You've a fault in your senses. Can you feel it now?

Time? What is that? I've no time to care.
I've lived for a long while nearly everywhere.
You will be taken, everyone, you ladies and you gentlemen.
Fall and listen with your ears upon the paving stone.
Is that what you hear? The coming of the sea?

Sea flows under your doors in London town.
And all your defences are all broken down.
You laugh at me on funny days, but mine's the slight of hand.
Don't you know I am a joker, a deceiver?
And I'm waiting for the land.",Sea,
Sandy Denny,"The wine it was drunk, the ship it was sunk,
The shot it was dead, all the sorrows were drowned.
The birds they were clouds, the brides and the shrouds
And as we drew south the mist it came down.

The wooded ravine to the wandering stream,
The serpent he moved, but no-one would say.
The depths of the waters, the bridge which distraught us
And brought to me thoughts of the ill-fated day.

The temples were filled with the strangest of creatures
One played it by ear on the banks of the sea.
That one was found but the others they went under.
Oh the tears which are shed, they won't come from me.

The methods of madness, the pathos and the sadness,
God help you all, the insane and wise.
The black and the white, the darkness of the night,
I see only smoke from the chimneys arise.

The pilot he flew all across the sky and woke me.
He flew solo on the mercury sea.
The dream it came back, all about the tall brown people,
The sacred young herd on the phosphorus sand.",Late November,
Sandy Denny,"Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go,
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all.
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,
Rest not to lock your homes.
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all.
I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley blow,
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon,
Waiting for the eastern glow.
The apples of the valley hold,
The seas of happiness,
The ground is rich from tender care,
Repay, do not forget, no, no.
Oh, dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the morning light.
The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red.
Oh the war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly.
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know.
Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow,
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath,
The drums will shake the castle wall,
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on.
Sing as you raise your bow,
Shoot straighter than before.
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold.
Oh dance in the dark of night,
Sing to the mornin' light.
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back, bring it back.
At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by,
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes.",The Battle of Evermore,1971
Sandy Denny,"The wine it was drunk, the ship it was sunk,
The shot it was dead, all the sorrows were drowned.
The birds they were clouds, the brides and the shrouds
And as we drew south the mist it came down.

Sandy Denny,"One evening fair I took the air
Down by Blackwaterside
'Twas gazing all around me
When the Irish lad I spied

All through the first part of that night
We did lie in sport and play,
When this young man arose and he gathered his clothes,
Saying, ""Fare thee well today"".

That's not the promise that you gave to me
When the first you lay on my breast,
You could make me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west.

Go home, go home, to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill,
And think upon your own misfortune
Which you bought with your wanton will.

There's not one girl in this whole town
As easily led as I,
And when the sky does fall and the seas will run dry,
Why, it's then you'll marry I.",Blackwaterside,1971
Sandy Denny,"Missed the morning too, didn't rise before noon.
She's a lazy lady today.
Always yawning, you with your eyes on the moon.
You're a crazy lady I'd say, da da da.

Now should I say more, for I know so well
And you're no hazy maiden in grey.
How can I be sure, it's not easy to tell.
But you're a crazy lady, I'd say.
Crazy lady.",Crazy Lady Blues,1971
Sandy Denny,"Crash on the levee, mama,
Water's gonna overflow,
Swamp's gonna rise,
No boat's gonna row.
Now, you can train on down
To Williams Point,
You can bust your feet,
You can rock this joint.
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow.

Now, don't you try an' move me,
You're just gonna lose.
There's a crash on the levee
And, mama, you've been refused.
Well, it's sugar for sugar
And salt for salt,
If you go down in the flood,
It's gonna be your own fault.
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow.

Well, that high tide's risin',
Mama, don't you let me down.
Pack up your suitcase,
Mama, don't you make a sound.
Now, it's king for king,
Queen for queen,
It's gonna be the meanest flood
That anybody's seen.
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow.",Down in the Flood,1971
Sandy Denny,"""My shadow follows me
Wherever I should chance to go"",
John the Gun did say.
""If you should chance to meet me
As I wander to and fro,
Sad would be your day.

My life is mine and the light did shine
Till the guns they did go through me,
So now I shall never fall.
Ideals of peace are gold which fools have found
Upon the plains of war.
I shall destroy them all.""

[Chorus]
Put away your guns of steel,
Death comes too soon for all.
Your Master He may need you soon,
And you must heed His call.

""I am the master of the games
That you will hardly ever play,
So I will teach your sons.
And if they should die
Before the evening of their span of days,
Why, then they will die young.""

[Chorus]

""Condemn me not,
For always will I play the game of war,
In moonshine or in sun.
And if any cross the path I choose to tread,
Their chances they are poor.
My name is John the Gun.""

[Chorus]",John the Gun,1971
Sandy Denny,"Then came the question and it was about time.
The answer came back and it was long.
The house it was built by some man in a rhyme,
But whatever came of his talented son?
Who wrote me a dialogue set to a tune?
Always you told me of being alone,
Except for the stories about God and you,
And do you still live there in Buffalo?

They put up the walls with no more to say,
Nobody stopped to ask why it was done.
The stream was too far and the rain was too high,
So into the city the river did run.
Because of the architect the buildings fell down,
Smothered or drowned all the seeds which were sown.
I wish I were somewhere, but not in this town.
Maybe the ocean next time around.

I seem to remember the face and the name,
But if it's not you I won't care.
I know of changes, but nothing would change you
To Theo the sailor who sings in his lair.
And then I'll turn and he won't be there,
Dusky black windows to light the dark stair,
Candles all gnarled in the musty air
All without flames for many's the year.",Next Time Around,1971
Sandy Denny,"The steps he took were nice and easy.
He never knew he could stumble and go down.
As he saw the buildings and the mountains crumble,
Over the road he would take to the town.
He said, ""Next year I'm coming back, I'll see you later.""
It takes longer when you're far away.

There's a tale which says he was pursued by an assassin.
What he knows of that, no-one can tell.
How close he came to the trapper,
But he stopped by a wishing well.
He said, ""Next year there will be many flowers,
Each one much brighter than the one before.""

As he turned he caught the feeling,
And he smiled as he walked down the road.
All my days they are filled with meaning,
But I have yet to fathom the code.
But next year I'll call the tune and it won't be easy,
The timing's all out of place with how you feel.

Next year I'm coming back, I'll see you later.
It takes longer when you are far away.
Next year there will be many flowers,
Each one much brighter than the one before.
Next year I'll call the tune and it won't be easy,
The timing's all out of place with how you feel.",The Optimist,1971
Sandy Denny,"To cross the wide sea I deserted,
From the shore I did fly.
I thought it time that I travelled,
So I took to the roads of the sky.

It was late and the wind it did gently blow,
Oh the night it was calm.
I saw the flower of the ocean
And the universe did me noo harm,
It said to fly on.

The sea captain he loved the ocean,
But his ship was on fire.
His hands they did stretch out before him,
For to take one of many desires,
But there was no time.

Across the wide sea he departed,
From the ship he did fly.
He thought it time that he travelled
And I saw him as he passed by,
And I saw him as he passed by.",The Sea Captain,1971
Sandy Denny,"The summer was the reason
Why it took so long to see
That even if I do possess
Some seeds of honesty,
There is no garden,
So how come I have no land?
I shall be waiting here awhile
To see what comes to hand.

Misers mise and compromise;
I know what I have seen.
The wanderers are in the east;
That's where I should have been.
But I did not go there;
I couldn't find the way.
I do believe I made a try,
But I really couldn't say.

Oh, that wretched Wilbur,
He keeps ploughing up the land.
He fights the battle thoughtfully
With roses in his hands.
But where is the fight now?
So play us your merry song.
The autumn, it has blown away,
And the winter, it is long.",Wretched Wilbur,1971
Sandy Denny,"You left me and you went away,
You said that you'd be back in just a day,
You've broken your promise and you left me all alone,
I don't know why you did dear, but I do know that you're gone.

[Chorus]
I'm walking the floor over you,
I can't sleep a wink that is true.
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two,
Walking the floor over you.

Now darling you know I love you well,
I love you more than I can ever tell,
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine,
But you went and left me here with troubled mind.

[Chorus]

Now someday you may be lonesome too,
Walking the floor is good for you.
Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to cry,
Remember that I love you and I will until I die.

[Chorus]",Walking the Floor Over You [*],1971
Sandy Denny,"I know you're the wayward kind
The way you always drag behind
Show me a horse and I'll feed it hay
Show me the cart and I'll throw it away
Prettiest face I've ever seen
It looked like something in a magazine
To a blind man it's plain to see
That I need you and you need me

I've got cold feet, it's a-crazy chasin'
When things get serious, time is a-wastin'
I'd cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

Took me home to tell your dad
That you were the best girl I've ever had
I stayed for dinner, I couldn't refuse
I spilt the tea and I ate the news
Ah, you must think you're really neat
Got me tied down to my seat
I can't move, it's hard to think
With cramp in my eyelids and I can't blink

Well, I've got cold feet, it's a-crazy chasin'
Things get serious, time is a-wastin'
I cross my fingers but they don't seem to meet
There's no need to tell me that I've got cold feet, a-ha-ha

",Cold Feet,1972
Sandy Denny,"Everybody came to nobody's wedding
Everybody knew it was bound to be a hoot
What can you do when nothing else is cooking
Make your own amusement, bring a pile of loot

There was Alice the butcher, Tidy and Gunn
Who couldn't see where they were heading
It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,
And it weren't even nobody's wedding

What a great reception, all the people cried
Who stole the groom and who stole the bride
How did the countess slide underneath the door
Why is the wild boy chopping up the floor?

There was Alice the butcher, Tidy and Gunn
Who couldn't see where they were heading
It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,
And it weren't even nobody's wedding

I didn't hear the sound of the tin cans rattle
I didn't hear a teardrop, I didn't hear a prattle
Didn't hear the words of the bible being read
When it's nobody's wedding, nobody's wed

Who couldn't see where they were heading
It was sixteen days and sixteen nights,
And it weren't even nobody's wedding",Nobody's Wedding,1972
Sandy Denny,"I'm Darby the tinker and my brother is Tam
We go where the work is, my boys, and we work where we can
With the mending and fixing, it's together we stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
We come to your cities and we call on your wives
We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay
Intending our fortunes to try on the old changing way
At times they grew scanty and the money grew thin
We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way
We never agreed to divide our tin
And when you're out of love with your brother, your hard times begin
For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see
But don't you travel alone, boys, this warning you take from me
You must share with your nearest till the end of your days
Or else it's forever you're on the old changing way
",The Old Changing Way,1972
Sandy Denny,"It's a grey, grey morning, the rain it do fall
I'm feeling hungry and low
My bed's so empty, how I wish I could call
On the painted ladies I know
When you've got no credit, don't hold no sway
With the painted ladies I know
It's a ''thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday''
The painted ladies I know

Leave at home what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love
The painted ladies all say
Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game
The end of the game is goodbye

They pass through your vision like thoughts in a dream
Your good times are slipping away
It's time to move on or go down with the ship
The painted ladies all say
",Painted Ladies,1972
Sandy Denny,"Was there ever a winter so cold and so sad
The river too weary to flood
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I was looking for trouble to tangle my line
But trouble came looking for me
I knew I was standing on treacherous ground
I was sinking too fast to run free

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I would not be asking, I would not be seen
A-beggin' on mountain or hill
But I'm ready and blind with my hands tied behind
I've neither a mind nor a will

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

It's bitter the need of the poor ditching boy
He'll always believe what they say
They tell him it's hard to be honest and true
Does he mind if he doesn't get paid?

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough

But she cut through to my blood",The Poor Ditching Boy,1972
Sandy Denny,"It's been raining for a long time and I can't seem to stand
She left about an hour ago and so did the band
I'm sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted
Wo ho sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted

People are looking hazy and people are looking dim
I'd go for help if I could find the way I came in
I feel in clover, it's time to keel over
Something tells me I'm twisted
Wo ho sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted

Here's the one to lay you out with Charlie in the trough
This one's got your name on it written in the froth
Draining the dregs, I'm running out of legs
Something tells me I'm twisted

And something tells me I'm twisted
Wo ho sitting at the bar with my face in the jar
And something tells me I'm twisted",Twisted,1972
Sandy Denny,"There is a lonely train called the 3.10 to Yuma
And it's the only train left for me to ride on
I'll catch that lonely train called the 3.10 to Yuma

Been tired and broke, so long

The ruins and the scars, so long

Seen the dying of all that was good, so long.

Seen the world in the shadow, so long
Is its mushrooming cloud, so long
And the lies and the greed of the leaders of men
Those cheats who would take us to war again, so long.

Yet hope is in me, so long
For it's love that I see, so long
The courage and strength of the young men's smile
The faith that's in a little child, so long

Have been tired and broke, so long
I've been to the south where the winds they were warm

Sandy Denny,"I once loved a lass and I loved her so well
And I hated all others who spoke of her ill.
And now she's rewarded me well for my love,
For she's gone and she's wed another.

And I saw my love up to the church go
With bride and bridesmaidens she made a fine show.
And I followed on with my heart full of woe
For she's gone and she's wed another.

Oh, when that I saw my love in the church stand,
With the ring on her finger and the glove in her hand,
I jumped in betwixt them and kissed the false bride,
Saying: ""Adieu to false loves for ever.""

Oh, when that I saw my love out the church go,
With the bridesmen and bridesmaids they made a fine show,
Then I followed after with my heart full of woe,
For I was the man that ought to had her.
Oh, when that I saw my love sat down to meat,
I sat myself by her but nothing could eat.
I thought her sweet company better than wine,
Although she was wed to some other.

I saw my love as she sat doon to dine.
I sat doon beside her and poured the wine.
And I thought of the lassie that should have been mine,
Now she's gone and she's wed another.
All men in yon forest they asked of me,
""How many strawberries grow in the salt sea?""
And I answered them with a tear in my e'e,
""How many ships sail in the forest?""

Oh dig me a grave and dig it sae deep,
And cover it over with wee flowers sae sweet.
And I lay me doon for to tak' a long sleep
And maybe in time I'll forget her.

Go dig me a grave both long, wide, and deep,
And strew it all over with flowers so sweet,
That I may lay down there and take my long sleep,
And that's the best way to forget her.

So they dug him a grave and they dug it sae deep
And they covered it over with wee flowers sae sweet
And he lay him doon for to tak' a long sleep
And maybe in time he'll forget her.",The False Bride,1972
Sandy Denny,"It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the winking of an eye my soul is turning
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
But you know that was the last thing on my mind

You had reasons plenty for going
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growing
Please don't go, please don't go

Are you going away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
But you know that was the last thing on my mind

As we walk, my thoughts are a-tumbling
Round and round, round and round
And the subway beneath my feet is a-rumbling
Underground, underground

Are you going away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
But you know that was the last thing on my mind

As I lie in my bed in the morning
Without you, without you
Every song in my breast dies a-borning
Without you, without you

Are you going away with no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?

Oh yes it was the last thing on my mind

Half a bitter for the vicar
He's here to save your soul
He's looking fat and jovial

To jump into his bed.

Dr. Watson drinks large whiskies

And she cooks the books for less.

Sammy Cohen is the bookie
Sitting over there
Drinking three star brandy
He doesn't seem to care
No-one wants to know him
They say he's been inside
They say his dear old mother
Committed suicide.

Dr. Watson charged Anne Riley
A fifty guinea fee
For Mr. Thompson's peace of mind
As far as I can see
Mrs. Thompson envies Annie
Cooking for the preacher
And everyone thinks Sam 
Is a quite disgusting creature
But if the truth was known
It would shake all their foundations
It seems the preacher lives
On Sam's anonymous donations.

When a cruel hunger came upon her

Take me back to old remembered days
Remind me of the times we spent together
Times before we went our separate ways

I wish I was a fool for you
I wish I was a fool for you again

I'm sorry for the things I've said, the things I've done
I'm sorry for the restless thief I've been
Please don't make me pay for my deceiving heart
Just turn up your lamp and let me in

She gathered flowers and she sang
All about her wedding day.

Oh when I was a lass at school
I looked out at the sky,
And now among the woodlands cool,
Gathering sweet primroses I.

I wish I was a little bird,
With wings that I could fly,
Then I would find my own true love,
And when he'd speak then I'd be by.

My heart would flutter like the wings,
Oh to see my own dear one.
And pretty words I'd like to sing
All beneath the morning sun.

That someday you'll be going
At the same time I realize
I must not be afraid
You are the one I love
You are the one I touch
And it's you who must not go
But it's I who must try not
To send you away.

Out of my door and along the path
Where I have never travelled
Could it be that you would help me
Out along that road?
I only want your hand
I only want your smile
From you that is everything
From you that is all I need
To take away the load.",Take Away the Load (Sandy's Song),1986
Sandy Denny,"""I forbid you maidens all that wear gold in your hair
To travel to Carterhaugh, for young Tam Lin is there

None that go by Carterhaugh but they leave him a pledge
Either their mantles of green or else their maidenhead""

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two
When up then came young Tam Lin, says,""Lady, pull no more""

""And why come you to Carterhaugh without command from me?""
""I'll come and go,"" young Janet said, ""and ask no leave of thee""

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to her father as fast as go can she

Well, up then spoke her father dear and he spoke meek and mild
""Oh, and alas, Janet,"" he said, ""I think you go with child""

""Well, if that be so,"" Janet said, ""myself shall bear the blame
There's not a knight in all your hall shall get the baby's name

For if my love were an earthly knight, as he is an elfin grey
I'd not change my own true love for any knight you have""

So Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

""Oh, tell to me, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""why came you here to dwell?""
""The Queen of Fairies caught me when from my horse I fell

And at the end of seven years she pays a tithe to hell
I so fair and full of flesh and fear it be myself

But tonight is Halloween and the fairy folk ride
Those that would let true love win at Mile's Cross they must bide

So first let pass the horses black and then let pass the brown
Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down

For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town
For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown

Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake
But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father

And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold
But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child

And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight
But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight""

In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win

Then up spoke the Fairy Queen, an angry queen was she
Woe betide her ill-far'd face, an ill death may she die

""Oh, had I known, Tam Lin,"" she said, ""what this night I did see
I'd have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree""",Tam Lin,1986

If tonight was not a crooked trail,

And if I could hear his heart softly pounding,
Only if he was lying by me.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

I can't speak the sounds that show no pain,
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps,

And if I could hear his heart softly pounding,
Only if he was lying by me.

I'm walking the floor over you,
I can't sleep a wink that is true.
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two,
Walking the floor over you.

Now darling you know I love you well,
I love you more than I can ever tell,
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine,
But you went and left me here with troubled mind.

I must be myself and I'll do alright.
Oh please my darling do not make me sad,
Late at night nobody really wants to feel that bad.

The rain it beats impatiently upon the window pane,
I must close my ears or I'll go insane.
Can't you be a gentle breeze or silent as a snowfall,
Won't you try and listen for the voice behind the wall.

It cries to you.

Even though it only ever whispers part of what it knows,
And it's never ventured through the locks,
Where the brazen river flows.
It's the fingerprint which is never made.
It's the perfume of a rose.

And it is there if you are searching,
But the moment must be right,
As the night is black, as the day is white.
Please my friend help to make me glad,
Help me find the one and only thing I've never had.

What is true?

Even though it only ever whispers part of what it knows,
And it's never ventured through the locks,
Where the brazen river flows.
It's the fingerprint which is never made.
It's the perfume of a rose.

The Summer fair she has grown old.
The Summer fair she has grown old.
And away in the blue of the skies and over the trees
How the carnival flies on the wings of a breeze.
You've had your time and now it's mine for me to go,
These colder days they move too slow.
These older days they move too slow.
So the Summertime is leaving, and the carnival's away,
So the sunshine is relieving us of all our sunny days.
But I'll be waiting for to greet your fleeting calls,
So come back soon the carnival.
So come back soon the carnival.
Come back soon.",Carnival [Home Demo],2012
Sandy Denny,"The Lady Lyrics
The lady she had a silver tongue
For to sing she said
And maybe that's all
Wait for the dawn and we will have that song
When it ends it will seem
That we hear silence fall
The lady she had a golden heart
For to love, she said

And she did not lie
Wait for the dawn and we'll watch for the sun
As we turn it will seem
To arise in the sky
We heard that song while watching the skies
Oh the sound it rang
So clear through the cold
Then silence fell and the sun did arise
On a beautiful morning of silver and gold",The Lady [Demo],2012
Sandy Denny,"Come walk the streets of crime
And colour bright the corners
Of love with the earth

See the dazzling nightlife grow
Beyond the dawn and burning
In the heart of Soho

Hear the market cries
And see their wares displayed
Through the window of your soul

Come watch the naked dance
That spins before your very eyes
Naked like the sun

Step inside where men before
Have drunk to fill to senseless
Till the dreams fade and die

And free and easy
Does the blood red wine come flowing
From the glass to your veins

And the midday dream is silent
Thou gardens where you're resting
From the troubles of your mind

And though the sun is burning brightly
All within the gardens
Are the sleeping oris dead

And through the afternoon
The buzzing bees do harmonise
Through the rushing sale daylight",Soho,2012

And what have you got to say?
Well, I'm waiting and I can't stay long
It's such a lovely day

There's a time to be talking
And a time when it's no use
Right now I think the things you say
Are liable to confuse

I've just gone solo
Do you play solo?
Ain't life a solo?

What a wonderful way to live
Traveling all over the world
Why the fame and all the golden
Opportunities unfurled

No time for the gent with the Mulliner Bentley
And Heaven knows what else
Why, he wouldn't even stand a chance
With all his oil wells

She just went solo
Do you play solo?
Ain't life a solo?

I've always lived in a mansion
On the other side of the moon
I've always kept a unicorn
And I never sing out of tune

I could tell you that the grass is really greener
On the other side of the hill
But I can't communicate with you
And I guess I never will

We've all, all gone solo
We all play solo
Ain't life, life a solo?

I lit your cigarette and then you wrote your number down
On the inside of a matchbook that was laying on the bar
And a fire started burning somewhere in my heart

I didn't see it coming, guess I didn't read the signs
I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time
But today when I came home my key was hollow in the door
And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor

You took the bed
You took the dishes and the car
You broke my trust
You took advantage of my heart
You left me here
With empty rooms and walls with holes and scars and scratches
If I find the strength to burn you memories down
At least you left the matches

But i can still make out the numbers and the heart beside your name
Until tonight they'd only lit a single cigarette
Now one by one I'm striking them to help me to forget

And everybody at the broken spoke
All thought my crazy story was a joke
Now they're out there in the parking lot
Staring at the smoke

You took the dishes and the car

You told me of your concerns, too

To make love last night
Baby, please tell me

Where do we go from here my love
What are we doing baby
Boy you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together
Is what we choose
Oh my love
I think that we should talk
About us

Could this be a crazy dream
And if so then you're dreaming too
'Cause I know for sure that
You feel the same as I do
Could it be that we could be wrong
Even though we're feeling so right
I don't care because I know
That I want you tonight
And I know you want me too

Where do we go from here my love
What are we doing baby
Boy you gotta let me know

I want the world to know

Waited all my life
Just to be with someone like you

Where do we go from here my love
Where are we going baby

I close my eyes and picture
The emerald of the sea
From the fishing boats at Dingle
To the shores of Donaghadee

I miss the river Shannon
And the folks at Skibbereen
The moorlands and the meddle
With their forty shades of green

But most of all I miss a girl
In Tipperary town
And most of all I miss her lips
As soft as eiderdown

Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
And there's forty shades of green

At Dublin's churching surf

Drain the bogs and spade the turf

To see again the thatching
Of the straw the women glean
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see
The forty shades of green

Sandy Nelson,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life,1997

Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.

I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

He can beat the best.

He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!
While God is marching on.",Battle Hymn of the Republic,2003

Through and through
Cause I was born to be with you

So I knew that I was born to be with you

Peace of mind
Yes I do
Cause I was born to be with you

Sandy Posey,"The single girl all alone in a great big town
The single girl gets so tired of love letting her down
The life's unreal and the people are homely
And the nights can get so lonely
The single girl needs a sweet loving man to lean on
I'm a single girl wondering if love could be passing her by
I'm a single girl and I know all about men and their lies
Nobody loves me cause nobody knows me
Nobody takes the time to go slowly

The single girl needs a sweet loving man to lean on
I gotta make my own way
There's rent I gotta pay
I need a night-time love to get me through the day
I'm a single girl all alone in a great big town
I'm a single girl and I get so tired of love letting me down
But there's a man I've yet to know
Waiting somewhere I've yet to go
Someday I'll have a sweet loving man to lean on",Single Girl,2004

What he wouldn't do for love
He's a fool, a fool for love
She was six and he was seven
Used to send him off to heaven
When she said, you are my sunshine
The part he always liked the best
When she teased him with a kiss
And she said you make me happy
You're a fool for love

Born a fool, you got to
Follow the rule, always a fool

Tattooed underneath his sweater
L.o.v.e in blue
Seems he was never satisfied
Chasing girls like butterflies
Believin' every word they said was true
He's a fool for love
What he wouldn't do for love
He's a fool, a fool for love
Once a fool, you got to
Follow the rule, always a fool
A fool for love
Last time I saw him alive
He was standin' up on the bride's side
Yelling his objections at the groom
The blushing bride was my best friend
She turned around and to him said
Yes you were my only sunshine then
You're a fool for love
What he wouldn't do for love
He's a fool, a fool for love
Born a fool, you got to

Sandy Ross,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string

But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.

Sandy Siegelstein,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1999

My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

When I heard my child in prayer
And for me some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair

All the stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
In our town, no scarlet ribbons
Not one ribbon for her hair

Through the night my heart was aching
And just before the dawn was breaking
I peeked in and on her bed
In gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair

I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons

Sandy Wilson,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,1998

Vengo da una zona dove l'aria non è buona
Fumo la mia porra, non mi pungo con la spada
Caccio la mia rima per i cani sciolti della strada
E intanto il numero dei cani sciolti sta salendo
Se ancora non li vedi è una questione di tempo
Cani sciolti nelle città
Alzano il volume con il bum-bum-cha
Ci credi o no CHICO non lo so
So di FI doppia S O che ci sarò, però
Quel giorno quando viene sarà come tanti
Con le iene di dietro e i cani sciolti davanti

Pam pam, chico, musi di pantere
Ci annusano il sedere e non c'è molto da sapere
Se la vita è mia lascio che sia
Cane contro cane quando è il cane della polizia
Preso per il culo dalla mia TV
Meglio non vedere come Mr Magoo
Resta un'opinione personale
Io non sono carne da campagna elettorale
E parli bene, ti conviene chico, non ti affronto più
Mi dici che sei nuovo ma sei sempre tu
E allora levami le mani dagli occhi, sant'iddio
Sono sempre io anche se schivo e sto nel mio

C'è una cosa che so, è che non ce n'è
Stare nel tracciato non funziona più per me
E una soluzione deve esserci anche qui
Cerco la Parola Chiave insieme a Deda MD
Cani sciolti sotto il sole quando fuori piove
Quando tutto è fermo c'è qualcuno che si muove
Sono il cane sciolto, lo straniero nella mia nazione
E fuori dal recinto resta la mia posizione

E tutto sembra uguale, ma qualcosa non va
C'è sempre un buon motivo per tirarli giù
Ma i cani nelle strade sono sempre di più

E tutto sembra uguale, ma qualcosa non va
C'è sempre un buon motivo per tirarli giù

E i cani sciolti escono fuori dal gregge
Escono fuori come schegge
E chico puoi giurarci, quando occorre esco fuori legge
Perché devo svoltare in tempi duri
Seguo la mia idea visto che ancora oggi come ieri
Vivo un clima di tensione negativo
Perciò non venirmi a dire che sono ostile e che non c'è un motivo
Le radiazioni han fatto danni
Su chi è cresciuto negli ultimi vent'anni

Abbiamo avuto il piombo, il fango ed ogni giorno
La dose quotidiana di merda che ci cade attorno
E i bambini sono stati contagiati
Nati patinati, figli ingrati
Ora dai un'occhiata al mio libro di storia
Un paio di episodi che ho imparato a memoria
Ti resta un buon motivo e non puoi più tirarci giù
Tocca che chiami le divise blu
Per darci addosso non serve che un pretesto
Hanno la divisa, il manganello e tutto il resto
E oh, E non importa la domanda che un Barabba mi fa
Perché se gli rispondi in ogni caso non gli va
Comincia a dare in testa e quando picchia picchia duro
Vuole far cantare ""Forza Italia"" allo straniero
Hanno la faccia come il culo e il loro è un trucco vecchio
All'occhio quando sparano nel mucchio

Chico non ce n'è, non puoi beccare i cani sciolti
Noi parliamo piano mentre ci muoviamo svelti
C'è una nazione in fiamme tutto intorno a me
E chico, indovina cosa, sulla traccia qui chi c'è?

Non si tiene, ho Sangue Misto nelle vene
Di nuovo sulla traccia ed è una storia pesa

Per i cani della strada, razza bastarda
Alla sbarra, sotto accusa ed ogni giorno c'è un buon motivo
E la giuria ha già detto il mio verdetto è negativo

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'

Well say it again

Reborn into the neverwhere
All alone in this space
There's no love nor disgrace
My body aches, I tremble with fear
The sky, the last I saw is no longer clear
Water and ice cover the ground
I can face reality, the world has drowned
I try to move but I am caged in ice
Floating bodies looking for their paradise
But the truth is no longer fantasy
In this world I am the only man to be

I am lost, I was never created
I am lost, life is devastated

We melt away and I feel the mud
That once was land for all
The sea of ice that used to be
The home of humanity
My soul is frozen, longing for fire
I barely believe I see this sight
All I can face is eternal night.
The sun awakes and shine on all the remains
The ice that encaged my body now flows in strains
Soon I can move, and walk away

Sanjay Mishra,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Ne siffle pas sur les quais endormis
Quand je tiendrai la main de mon chéri

Un Chinois est sorti de l´ombre
Un Chinois a regardé Londres
Sa casquette était de marine
Ornée d´une ancre coraline
Devant la porte de Charly
A Penny Fields, j´lui ai souri,
Dans le silence de la nuit
En chuchotant je lui ai dit

Je voudrais je voudrais je n´sais trop quoi
Je voudrais ne plus entendre ma voix
J´ai peur j´ai peur de toi j´ai peur de moi

Sur son maillot de laine bleue
On pouvait lire en lettres rondes
Le nom d´une vieille ""Compagnie""
Qui, paraît-il, fait l´tour du monde
Nous sommes entrés chez Charly
A Penny Fields, loin des soucis,
Et j´ai dansé toute la nuit
Avec mon Chinetoque ébloui

Et chez Charly, il faisait jour et chaud
Tess jouait ""Daisy Bell"" sur son vieux piano
Un piano avec des dents de chameau

Alors, j´ai conduit l´Chinois dans ma chambre
Il a mis le rat à la porte
Il a arrêté la pendule
Et renversé le pot à bière
Je l´ai pris dans mes bras tremblants
Pour le bercer comme un enfant
Il s´est endormi sur le dos
Alors j´lui ai pris son couteau.

C´était un couteau perfide et glacé
Un sale couteau rouge de vérité
Un sale couteau rouge sans spécialité.

Sansévérino,"C´était un gamin, un gosse de Paris,
Pour famille il n´avait qu´ sa mère
Une pauvre fille aux grands yeux rougis,
Par les chagrins et la misère
Elle aimait les fleurs, les roses surtout,
Et le cher bambin tous les dimanches
Lui apportait de belles roses blanches,
Au lieu de s'acheter des joujoux
La câlinant bien tendrement,
Il disait en les lui donnant

""C´est aujourd´hui dimanche, tiens ma jolie maman
Voici des roses blanches, toi qui les aimais tant
Va quand je serai grand, j´achèterai au marchand
Toutes ses roses blanches, pour toi jolie maman""

Au printemps dernier, le destin brutal,
Vint frapper la blonde ouvrière
Elle tomba malade et pour l´hôpital,
Le gamin vit partir sa mère
Un matin d´avril parmi les promeneurs
N´ayant plus un sous dans sa poche
Sur un marché tout tremblant le pauvre mioche,
Furtivement vola quelques fleurs
La marchande l´ayant surpris,
En baissant la tête, il lui dit

""C´est aujourd´hui dimanche et j´allais voir maman
J´ai pris ces roses blanches elle les aime tant
Sur son petit lit blanc, là-bas elle m´attend
J´ai pris ces roses blanches, pour ma jolie maman""

La marchande émue, doucement lui dit,
""Emporte-les je te les donne""
Elle l´embrassa et l´enfant partit,
Tout rayonnant qu´on le pardonne
Puis à l´hôpital il vint en courant,
Pour offrir les fleurs à sa mère
Mais en le voyant, une infirmière,
Tout bas lui dit ""Tu n´as plus de maman""
Et le gamin s´agenouillant dit,
Devant le petit lit blanc

""C´est aujourd´hui dimanche, tiens ma jolie maman
Voici des roses blanches, toi qui les aimais tant
Et quand tu t´en iras, au grand jardin là-bas
Toutes ces roses blanches, tu les emporteras""",Les roses blanches,2014

Vers des contrées fleuries

Pour le paradis
Le vent du large bon apôtre
Les a poussés l´un contre l´autre
La mer était trop petite pour
Contenir leur amour

Comme un feu de Saint-Jean

Bons baisers et bon vent

En lavant les verres par force
Sans adieu elle quitta Cupidon dans la soute à charbon

Non je ne me souviens plus
Du nom du bal perdu.
Ce dont je me souviens
C´est qu´ils étaient heureux
Les yeux au fond des yeux.
Et c´était bien
Et c´était bien.

Ils buvaient dans le même verre,
Toujours sans se quitter des yeux.
Ils faisaient la même prière,
D´être toujours, toujours heureux.

Les bras tout chargés de fleurs
Je suis entré dans notre chambre le cœur las
Car je savais déjà que tu ne viendrais pas
Et j'ai chanté des mots d´amour et de douleur
Je suis resté toute seule
Et j´ai pleuré tout bas
En écoutant hurler la plainte des frimas
Sombre dimanche

Je mourrais un dimanche où j´aurai trop souffert
Alors tu reviendras, mais je serai parti
Des cierges brûleront comme un ardent espoir
Et pour toi, sans effort, mes yeux seront ouverts

D´avoir semé des fleurs dans les trous de son nez
Me poursuit d'un zèle imbécile
Alors cerné de près par les enterrements
J´ai cru bon de remettre à jour mon testament
De me payer un codicille

Trempe dans l'encre bleue du Golfe du Lion
Trempe, trempe ta plume, à mon vieux tabellion
Et de ta plus belle écriture
Note ce qu'il faudra qu'il advint de mon corps

Que sur un seul point, la rupture

Quand mon âme aura pris son vol à l'horizon
Vers celle de Gavroche et de Mimi Pinson
Celles des titis, des grisettes
Que vers le sol natal mon corps soit ramené

Terminus en gare de Sète

Mon caveau de famille, hélas! n'est pas tout neuf

Et d'ici que quelqu'un n'en sorte

Dire à ces braves gens, poussez-vous donc un peu
Place aux jeunes en quelque sorte

Juste au bord de la mer à deux pas des flots bleus
Creusez si c'est possible un petit trou moelleux
Une bonne petite niche
Auprès de mes amis d'enfance, les dauphins
Le long de cette grève où le sable est si fin
Sur la plage de la corniche

C'est une plage où même à ses moments furieux
Neptune ne se prend jamais trop au sérieux
Où quand un bateau fait naufrage
Le capitaine crie ""Je suis le maître à bord!
Sauve qui peut, le vin et le pastis d'abord
Chacun sa bonbonne et courage""

Oh, et c'est là que jadis à quinze ans révolus
A l'âge où s'amuser tout seul ne suffit plus
Je connu la prime amourette
Auprès d'une sirène, une femme-poisson
J'ai reçu de l'amour la première leçon
Avalait la première arête

Déférence gardée envers Paul Valéry
Moi l'humble troubadour sur lui je renchéris
Le bon maître me le pardonne
Et qu'au moins si ses vers valent mieux que les miens
Mon cimetière soit plus marin que le sien
N'en déplaise aux autochtones

Cette tombe en sandwich entre le ciel et l'eau
Ne donnera pas une ombre triste au tableau
Mais un charme indéfinissable
Les baigneuses s'en serviront de paravent
Pour changer de tenue et les petits enfants
Diront, chouette, un château de sable!

Est-ce trop demander, sur mon petit lopin
Planter, je vous en prie une espèce de pin
Pin parasol de préférence
Qui saura prémunir contre l´insolation
Les bons amis venus faire sur ma concession
D'affectueuses révérences

Tantôt venant d'Espagne, tantôt d'Italie
Tous chargés de parfums, de musiques jolies
Le Mistral, la Tramontane
Sur mon dernier sommeil verseront les échos
De villanelle, un jour, un jour de fandango
De tarentelle, de sardane

Et quand prenant ma butte en guise d'oreiller
Une ondine viendra gentiment sommeiller
Avec moins que rien de costume
J'en demande pardon par avance à Jésus
Si l'ombre de sa croix s'y couche un peu dessus
Pour un petit bonheur posthume

Pauvres rois pharaons, pauvre Napoléon
Pauvres grands disparus gisant au Panthéon
Pauvres cendres de conséquence

'Cause it is my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just 'cause it's 'tis the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from last year
Ski shop encounter most interesting
Had his number but never the time
Most of '81 passed along those lines
So deck those halls Trim those trees
Raise up cups of Christmas cheer

Christmas by myself this year

Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens Sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summertime
Out to the beach to his boat
Could I join him?
No This time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited
Tonight's the night I've set my mind

Because it's RSVP
No, thanks No party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot
So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
'Spending this one alone,' he said
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy'
I said 'Me too, but why are you
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending

Santa Cecilia,"Si el corazón me acompaña
Quiero invitar al tiempo
Para que me abran las puertas
Me arrulle en los recuerdos
Esos que abrazan el alma
Y abren el sentimiento
Oh oh

Cuando toco ese pañuelo
Las penas se despiden
Puedo abrazar a mi abuelo
Pa que jamás se olvide
Que hasta las nubes lo quiero
Aunque en el cielo vive
Oh

Para el altar tengo flores
Naranjas pa mi mezcal
Todititas tus pasiones
Quiero celebrar

Porque ella es parte mía
Nació conmigo y conmigo
Se irá algún día
Por ella estamos de fiesta
Toda la vida

Que salga a mover la pata
Esa huesuda
Con la tía buena y la mala
Bajo la luna
Los vivos y los difuntos
Celebran juntos

Con el corazón en mano
Por que ya no es justo nada
En la tierra que habitamos
En medio de la comparsa
Nos arrastra un viento humano
Pa' ver si se nos quitaba
Las ganas de andar soñando
Unos de tanta culpa se quedan mudos
Otros tienen memoria para olvidar

Si la violencia es un espejo que se rompe
Y nuestras lagrimas caidas gritaran
Solo recuerda que mi cara tiene un nombre
Y nunca mas se callara

Y nunca mas se callara

Te pido me des la mano
Y en el camino me sigas
Vamos demostrarle a los de arriba
La ira de los de abajo
Del miedo sepultado
Es hora de ser valiente
En honor a los ausentes
Ya no me cruzo de brazos

Siento algo que me mueve
Un ritmo que me hace bailar
Tomen todos su parejas
Todos vamos a gozar

Mueve, mueve la cintura

Que humadera que nos viente ahogando
la gente se pregunta nadie sabe qué es
Un carra viejo que viene pitando
con llantas de triciclo y el motor al revés

En la esquina yo esperando
Como siempre su novia fiel
Mis amigas se están burlando
Murmuran cosas de él

Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar
Carcacha, paso a pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito
No nos vayas a dejar

Miren muchachas que no me arrepiento
Y tampoco me a me avergüenzo yo de mi galán
Aunque sea pobre y tenga un carra viejo
Me saca como reina
Un hombre de verdad

Y aunque tenga una carcacha
Lo que importa es que voy con él
Tampoco será el más guapo
Pero sí es mi novio fiel

Carcacha, paso pasito
No dejes de tambalear
Carcacha, poco a poquito

I'm not asking for your sympathy
I just want you here with me

Do what they feel even if it's wrong
And if you're thinking that you know best

Then we'll need some company

He wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there
And when she finished,he called her over
But Rico went a bit to far
Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?

Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony

While angry piddles with glee

All around there's a feeling in the air 
That with the grace of time we'll be getting closer there 
But day by day I can see they walk away

Realize that the secret is to share",Stone Flower,1972

Comes a lovely woman in motion with hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotize me with love

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow, how she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan she was dancing all night
Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go knowing she'll never know
I love her, that I love her

Gypsy woman, gypsy woman

I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan she was dancing all night
Waiting for the rising sun, everyone was having fun
I hate to see the lady go knowing she'll never know
I love her, that I love her

Makes a note of what's a float
And spinning 'round, he'll cut your throat

When he plays, he plays for keeps
And sweeps the spinning roulette wheel

Dealer, Dealer

Like the mighty ocean's roar, he gets his share and more
Evil to the core and proud
If you cross him off for sure he'll get even with the score
Leave your wife a weeping widow on the shore

Between the desert and the dark
Money is his only love
Feeling nothing deep inside
His mind is governed by his pride

In a smoky little room
Shadows moving in the gloom
Someone turns a running flush
And breaks the deathly quiet hush

Filling mysteries of emptiness
That yesterday left behind.

Is uncovered again.

The price is too high, no need

We'll understand

You look my way and the waves 
Wash over me 
Your body shivers with the 
Fading light 
You say, 
""Baby, let's just make it last tonight""

And when the morning comes 
You take me by the hand 
And say our love is written in sand 
Written in sand 

We hear the ocean roar 
We're swept away on to some
Distant shore 
You whisper secrets of the heart 
They keep us close when the
World keeps us apart 

Until tomorrow comes 
Time is on our hands 
Because this love is written in 
Sand 
Written in sand 

Nothing lies between 
A woman and a man 
When their love is written in sand 
When their love is written in sand 
When their love is written in sand",Written in Sand,1985
Santana,"Come on, baby, don't you wanna go
Way down south, talkin' 'bout Mexico

Straight through the jungle, out to the sea

Like some old movie in black and white
We'll fall in love in the middle of the night

[Chorus]
Me and you, down in Veracruz
Do what you wanna do, down in Veracruz

Come on, baby, don't you wanna come
In the town, people movin' to the drums

Drinkin' cerveza, people party 'til they drop
Forget the laundry, forget the rain
We'll get to heaven on the seven-thirty plane

Staring from the bottom of his soul.
Watching the night come in from the window.

It'll all collapse tonight, the full moon is here again,
In sickness and in health, understanding so demanding,
It has no name, there's one for every season,
Makes him insane to know.

Running away from it all,
I'll be safe in the cornfields, he thinks, hunted by his own
Santana Full Moon Lyrics
Again he feels the moon rising on the sky

Find a barn to sleep in, but can he hide anymore
Someone's at the door, understanding, too demanding
Can this be wrong, it's love that is not ending
Makes him insane again

She should not lock the open door
Full moon is on the sky and he's not a man anymore
She sees the change in him, but can't
See what became out of her man.

Swimming across the bay,
The night is gray, so calm today.
She doesn't want to wait.
We've got to make the love complete tonight

In the mist of the morning he can't fight anymore
Thousands moon or more, he's been howling
Knock on the door, and scream that is soon ending
Mess on the floor again

We should not lock the open door
Full moon is on the sky and he's not man anymore
We see the change in him but can't
See what became out of her darling man

See what became out of that man",Full Moon,1990

Let there be joy

Why a mis brazos
Jamas volvio

Se que tu vas a volver

No hay fronteras en nuestro querer

Ya ha pasado un nuevo invierno
Desde que te vi marchar
No hay mundo mejor que el nuestro

For these thoughts here to leave me
There are no words to describe it
In french or english
Cause diamonds they fade
And flowers they bloom
And I'm telling you

That these feelings won't go away
They've been knockin me sideways
They've been knockin me out litely
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin me sideways

Reflections
Think about the present and the past times
Reflect on your life and the bad times
Think about the crazy and the strange shit
Then dig within inside and try to change shit
Reflections
Reflect your mind
Reflect through time

(PSC):
My relation to these words spoken over beats leaps to and fro
All around, bound the energy in miles
Piles up towards the sky
High quantity of thoughts
Reflect the truth, sold another brother on the watch
On the clock of life, the mirror view
The clearest of reflection
Inspection of the lie that lies deep behind the stressin'
And it's pressing me like time
Rhymes is just illusions
A world in confusion
A dream of revolution
These reflections like mine in the puddle of life
Skip rocks, waves making ripple effects
Situations etched, lessons in stone tablets
For the reference to the habit
Forming addictions to the memories of past shit
I let go, it comes back
Boomerang behavior runs common in the obstacles
I want to shake my coat tails
They follow on the missions of my failure
Bring me down, crush me
Reflections can be beautiful, but most the time they rush me

(Aceyalone):
And in an instance you see the mirror image looking at you
Looks just like you, got you eyes, and you whole disguise
Reflections, he seen his image in the lake
Reflected on the grass roots which harbors all the snakes
Otherwise known as a snake pit
Remember the python on you ankle and all that fake shit?
Remember when the cake was lit, and the wind blew it out?
Before you could taste the cream, they sliced it up and threw it out
I recollect, I think back in retrospect
I reflect and connect my memories
Remember these good times and these hard times
But it's like that, and that's the way it is
And that's the way it was, but that ain't how it gotta be
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if I knew then what I knew now, I'd be doin' fine
Reflect your mind, it works every time
'cause if you knew then what you know now, you'd be doin' fine

(BFAP):
Reflect though time....
I peep when I meet people, evil or positive
We live in the middle, lost within the riddle
On God's reflection I stand, within an intersection of life lost
Double crossed by man, we stand ignorant
False prophet, gothic, prehistoric logic mixed our minds
Reflectin' signs of anger, reflection banger, reflection slanger
Reflection bombing hangars of 747's
Strangers want to blow this shit to heaven
Reflection war, reflectin' poor, reflectin' Cold War
Reflectin' old multiple metal jacket tactics
You might see Murs reflectin' curse
Reflectin' hurts, you's a bitch in a male skirt
If you don't work to change your world, reflectin' hurls
In life with wisdom, beyond ""blaow! blaow!""
Fake headwrapped female visions
We used to be in love with Duran Duran in '95
I got a condo in the white part of town
Change your name to Shanunu Brown, used to be Mary Tibbles
Reflect your mind before you get lost in the riddle
Reflect though time, this is time, reflect though time

I want to make this moment last
Slow down the pace, there's no hurry
I can't let another pass me by again
Let me be the one to say when I've had enough

Just let me close my eyes, memorize
The way things are this minute
So when you're gone I can go on
If memory can hold on within it what I'm feeling
Should time try fading or stealing something away

Hold on, nothing's the same
Tell me why I feel this way
Life wouldn't be worth living without you
All along I've been the pretender
But now that's gone forever
Nobody's ever loved me like you do
Nobody's broken through

Got to concentrate, file away
Every last detail
Don't want to lose what's going down
I want to remember everything I'm feeling

A devil and a savior, all in one
Her eyes can heal me or they can make me bleed
Her lips have me addicted to the poetry

But never really knowing just who I am
And I confess that I don't mind at all
'Cause I would trade the world away to stay inside this dream
I'll never find a better place to fall, no, no

I got a lover, a brown skin girl
She's got a magic of another world
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire
She knows a way, a spiritual flow
Making me dizzy like a vertigo
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire, yeah

I get a strong vibration
When she just says my name
And it drives me crazy
'Cause I don't know if she feels the same

But she likes to breathe some mystery in all she does
She laughs and says that I'm under her spell
Now I won't lie, I enjoy the ride and pray it never ends
I feel her deeper than anything I've felt

I got a lover, a brown skin girl
She's got a magic of another world
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire
She knows a way, a spiritual flow
Making me dizzy like a vertigo

Oh, I can't help but crave another taste of her
Like a drowning man that's praying for the rain
And how she worked her way inside, I'll never understand
She's too beautiful to ever take the blame
But she'll always fan the flame

Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen what my heart says

Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So girl don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain,
Girl I never meant to treat you lame.
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again.
Don't let this love die.

Just cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)

And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come

Never want disrespect you girl don't let this come break us apart.

Baby (Don't call me baby)
You know I need you in my life daily (You know you played me)
I was a player but now your love changed me (Dead wrong)
I'm going crazy (I'm gone)
Never thought losing you would be so hard

It's your turn to cry baby cry (Don't cry no more)

And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines

So let go
And move on
What we were
Is now undone
My tears have all dried
It's your turn now to cry

You're losing your love and your trust for me girl
And you know, I would go to the ends of the world.
If you wanted, just like we started.
Girl 'cause I don't want to fight no more.
Make it like it was before.

I tell you the truth and you cried and I cried
Let's get back to the place and that look in your eyes
Can you feel it inside, no clouds in your skies
The sun is gonna shine

God I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better

Long to hold you in my arms
To all things I ought to leave behind yeah
It's really getting nowhere
I think I need a little help this time

Yeah

I'm gonna try anything that just feel better
Tell me what to do
You know I can't see through the haze around me
And I do anything that just feel better

And I can't find my way
Girl I need a change
And I do anything that just feel better
Any little thing that just feel better",Just Feel Better,2005

[Chorus: x2]
I got a man and he's so good to me
I give love and he gives it back to me
Say it for me once if you know what I mean
I said my man's what a man's supposed to be

[Mary]
He opens his arms and holds on to me
He tells me he loves me and oh I feel it
And all that I am and all that I'll be
Is there in his eyes when I hear him sayin' please

Who loves you baby?

I do, I do trust you
See see this ain't just bout having sex
I don't even have to touch you
But you lustful I'm buggin'
You feel me bulgin' while we huggin'
We all over one another (scattered, covered, smothered)
You're my choosey lover
Never loving others only rubbing me (me)
Satisfy Big to the utmost mentally and physically (ly)
Every king must crown a queen to make his kingdom mean anything
Through thick and slim we gon' win we a team by any means y'all

[Chorus: x2]

The touch of his hand the sound of his voice
The way that he loves me till he knows I feel it
And all through the night forever rejoice
The angel above me starts to sweetly sing to me

Who loves you baby?

I do, I do adore you
I'm the best man for the job
Another man couldn't do nothing for you
Cause you're spicy just like me
We come together like thunder and lightning
With all of that scratching and biting
So exciting it's frightening
I'm your do-right man and you're my do right not my just for tonight woman
Making me feel just like a baker quick to put something in your oven
Not no dumplin's or no stuffin' but our own lil' flesh and blood'n
A bouncin' lil' baby something pretty girl or handsome son child

Gente del mundo oigan mi voz
Traigo palabras de aliento y paz

Never felt that they would go and now leave you in the dark
You told me that you needed me and I showed you I'd be there
But Now you've got me wrapped up in this crazy love affair

See lately Ive been thinking about he things you do to me
How we been through all this ups and downs and I was to blind to see
But now my visions better and I'm writing you this letter
By the time you get home Ill be gone and my life will be much better

It's hard enough those days these are games that we play

There's one thing I want you to know now before I pack my bags and go
Girl you got it all wrong got it all wrong got it all twisted baby

I gave you everything even gave you my ring
For better or for worse baby gave you my name
Get through every season summer winter spring and fall
And one thing you can say is I was with you through it all
Ill miss your touch, ill miss your ways these games with love that we can't play
I've gotta walk away I've gotta leave so I can find my way to still believe

Cause I love you to much and there's no love with no trust
Theres one thing I want you to know now before I pack my bags and go
Girl you got it all wrong got it all wrong got it all twisted baby
One thing I want you to know now before I pack my bags and go down
Girl you got it all wrong got it all wrong got it all twisted baby

Lethal injection, bitter sweet affection 
All in the wrong direction but we had our connection
Try not to be affected oh but I guess I was
Now I know what my momma meant when she told me bout love
Take your time don't rush in get to close and you'll get burned
Now Ive got a heart ache, you live you learn
Thought that I was cheated but baby not this time
But baby not this time it s just your insecurities your messing with your mind

[Repeat: x2]
Your driving me away & there's nothing left to say

When they'd seen the gates of glory and the fire down below
The many great decisions of the people in this place 
You could tell the strength within them, you could see it their face

Well it's been 9 or 10 years since I started my ramblin' round
And from hand to mouth I was livin' playing every bar in town
Though a dollar a day didn't go too far I could never deny my pride
I couldn't lay back and be taken care of while the world went by outside 

So I went to school to learn but I didn't like what they'd teach
And I went to church to pray but I didn't like what they'd preach 
I was hard-headed, young and angry, and I felt I could take the heat 
And I had to find out my own way how to live out on the street 

So I packed my bags and I left here to peruse the streets alone 
And I saw that side of midnight where the beggars howl and groan 
Places filled with desperation where the future ain't so bright 
But I remember back in Kansas when we sang a song at night 

We sang every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you

Goin'  around and round from town to town I tried to make my way 
I believed that all my searching and struggling would payoff bug some day 
As a teenager I was rowdy and I played for good and bad
Though I knew my songs had meaning at times it made me mad

And I'd fight the wars of nations if it brought somebody peace
Yes I'd fight the wars of madmen if I knew the fight would cease
But this ol' world never stopped turning when my mind was full of doubt
So I went on and played for a dollar a day and I sang  this song straight out 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah , for you
When they call out your name say it loud and clear 
Come on, come on 

You must have seen me traveling' around you must have seen me there
Tryin' to find out where I was heading you could have tossed to care 
Well, I had all the questions, I wanted the answers 
I knew in my heart it was all part of the game 
But every step was so much harder,  every step of the way 
I knew that time would beat me someday 

Hey hey, every step of the way 
Though your dreams can be real, don't let them slip slide away 
Doesn't matter at all, let them do as they will 
Someday you'll hear them call for you
Oh yeah, for you",Every Step of the Way,2007

It was love from above, like it saved me from hell
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see how the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands and we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay

You could tell how we felt from the look on her face
She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes

We forgot where we were, and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night, and we sang

Burned the place to the ground

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
And funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground

But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside

No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Cien libras de piel y hueso, cuarenta kilos de Salsa

Cuando cae la noche baja a bailar a la Tasca
Y bailar y bailar, y tomar y tomar
Una cerveza tras otra pero ella nunca engorda
Pero ella nunca engorda

Por un beso de la Flaca daria lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera
Por un beso de la Flaca daria lo que fuera
Por un beso de ella, aunque solo uno fuera

Mojé mis sabanas blancas, como dice la canción
Recordando las caricias que me brindó el primer día
Y enloquezco de ganas de dormir a su ladito
Porque Dios que esta flaca a mi me tiene loquito
O-oh, a mi me tiene loquito

Soy la rubia y la morena

La que te tiñe las venas 

La buena muerte, el gusano verde 
El amuleto de tu mala suerte 
El látigo de seda, el palo en la rueda 
La soga que te oprime donde tú quieras 

Si superas este invierno, si te quedas junto a mí
Entre el cielo y el infierno, ya no podrás distinguir 
Si las noches son tan largas y me quieres despertar 
Uhh da igual

Riega tu huerto con polvo de aspirina 
El fondo del túnel es solo tu mirar 
No te disculpes, fuego sin nombre 
No te enamores, litio de azufre

Lubrica con tu sangre el tiempo que te queda 
Los miedos, la vergüenza de la buena 
Dame todo eso que tenías para mí
Puede que pueda pasar la prueba 

Si supieras lo que siento, ya no querrías venir 
Yo te ofrezco lo que tengo y es muy fácil elegir 
Si los días son tan cortos y no quieres descansar 
Uhh, da igual

Y en esta cama de hotel, mirando pasar 
Las luces que bañan toda esta ciudad 
Voy a empezar a llorar, dejarme llevar 
Esta situación tan química 

Horas, minutos, segundos 
Me hago un cigarro

Plus the wack shit in the game might tempt me 
Quickly drop non-stop rec shot 
What I took on the road on the lap and desktop 

A mixture from up-tempo to slow grooves 
8-Track figure that's mixed wit Pro Tool 
I rhyme wit sense the paragraph was intense 
Area's dense with the flow from the sentence 

Engine powered by five hundred horses 
Press by a threat of joint forces 
For emcee's who spit rap to cause beef 
'Cause they depend on wild kill for fresh meat 

On the board, you're just a piece that's captured 
Weak is the land that's laying in the pasture 
The plug that gave ya juice, I might pull it 
Can't escape these endless waves of rap bullets 

[Chorus] 
They got no place for me 
In my life can't you see? 
I must not push or bite it tell me 
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line) 
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line son) 
Stay in line, Stay in line (Stay in line kid) 
Stay in line 

I'm not insane in fact I'm kinda rational 
Chrome-plated serrated swords slashing you 
I shine light to the mic 
That's filled with the unspoiled water that sprits with light 

But um, you get high of the wealth and livin' large 
We rely of the stealth of camouflage 
Cut supply lines, flood ya mans market 
From high altitude cover the land target 

Lost in the desert, the journey is stressful 
Where the rescues are unsuccessful 
They perish while they search for it, intriguing treasures 
Should of taken precautionary measures 

The rhyme with the shank in the yard that kept stabbing ya 
A shakedown from Alcatraz to Attica 
Because we rock the jails 
Wit it and mase write the verse on the walls of cells 

[Chorus] 

Ya out cold, ya styles old 
Allah just rolled, attack his skull wit a plan less bone 
Hit ya king with a Check that caused directly damage ya disco tech 
Shoulda' Protect ya Neck 

And do they think they got me? I don't know 
They seen ya picture baby? Don't think so 
Now do your mission and while you were thinking 
Ain't no collision that'll stop me from screaming 

Involving movements, controlling the squares that's closed in 
Wit impact, in fact ya zone is frozen 
Submerged in deep blocks of ice 
Sceaming a wise by the high-tech devise 

The slightest fame can bring pain and torture 
The author, who came with a burning offer 
Published by whoever made it must own it 
Is just symatomic for one chaotic moment

Que tienes vida y trabaja 

De que te sirve la voz 
Para que quieres palabras 
Si te espantas al menor 
Movimiento de aguas bravas 

Hombre si te dices hombre

No sabras de la alegría 

No es mas hombre el que parece 
Ni el que grita mas y espanta 
Sino el que tiene en su voz 
La verdad de su palabra 

Ni el que tiene mas mujeres 
Ni el que bebe mas y aguanta 
Sino el que tiene una sola 
Y una sed para calmarla

Santiago Gonzalez Bernardino,"Maquillaje a granel usaba a diario 
Y vendía la piel a precio caro 
De las ocho a las diez en una esquina 
Era joven y fiel, era rosa y espina
Y se llamaba, no sé, nunca lo supe 
Nunca le pregunté, nunca dispuse 
De su tiempo y su piel, era un mocoso 
Y tan solo le miré de pozo en pozo

Y era un pajarillo de blancas alas 
De balcón en balcón, de plaza en plaza
Vendedora de amor, ofrecedora 
Para el mejor postor de su tonada

Cinco inviernos pasaron y ahí seguía 
La misma hora de ayer, la misma esquina
Era joven y fiel, y aún tenía 
La rosa de su piel y más grande la espina
Y sonreía al pasar de los mirones 
Bajo de aquel farol, noche tras noche 
Veinte veces se la llevaron presa 
Y cantó su canción tras de las rejas

Y era un pajarillo de blancas alas 
De balcón en balcón, de plaza en plaza
Vendedora de amor, ofrecedora 
Para el mejor postor de su tonada

Se le arrugó la piel y el maquillaje 
Suficiente no fue para taparle 
La huella que dejó el sexto invierno 
Se le acabo el color y hasta el aliento
Y de las ocho a las diez sólo en la esquina 
Se quedó aquel farol y aquella espina 
La rosa no sé yo donde se iría 
Se llamaba no sé y sonreía

Y era un pajarillo de blancas alas 
De balcón en balcón, de plaza en plaza
Vendedora de amor, ofrecedora

Un Mehl all ward, denn ist bald sowiet

Dat de Dag kötter ward un de Nach de duert lang
Un de Kinner vun Nober, de warn in Düstern bang
Wenn de Regen vun't Reetdack dröppt
Mien Söhn buten gauer löppt
Sonst ward he natt, denn snurrt bin'n de Kat

Wenn de Wind dreiht, vun Nord weiht
Un Reg'n geg'n de Finster neiht
De Schieb'n daal rennt, denn föhl ik mi wohl
Wenn dat Füer in Kamin brennt
Un jeder di bi'n Vörnam nennt
Weil he di kennt, denn is uns Hus vull

Denn de Nobers sünd disse Tied ok nich geern alleen
Un bi Teepunsch an't Füer ward de Wedder weder schön
Wenn de Bläder sik brun farvt
Un Water steiht inne Groof
Denn ward dat Harvst op uns Fresenhof",Fresenhof,2015
Santiano,"Deine Zeit ist da, mach dich auf, mein Jung
Denn die Segel sind gehisst

Dann komm, aber schnell, wir laufen aus
Junge, eile dich
Denn am Himmel zieh'n dunkle Wolken auf

Johnny boy, Johnny boy
We're bound for stormy weather
Johnny boy, Johnny boy
Better wish your lads farewell
Somewhere out, far away
We're sailing on togehter
Oh Johnny my, we are leaving tonight
Johnny, say goodbye

Holt die Segel ein, macht die Ladung fest
Denn da braut sich was zusamm'
Halt dich fest, mein Jung, so der Himmel will
Macht die See dich heut zum Mann

Und vergiss das Beten nicht
Es gibt kein Zurück, wenn der Herrgott will
So verschont er dich

Better wish your lads farewell
And back home, far away
Our loves will grief together
Oh Johnny my, it is live and let die
Johnny say goodbye

In der Höllennacht unter Todesangst spielt
Das Meer sein Spiel mit ihm
Und mit einem Mal taucht ein Felsen auf
Und kein Weg ihm zu entfliehen
Als der Sturm sich legt, ist ein Schiff zu sehen
Neigt sich langsam Richtung Heck
Nur ein Junge sitzt an den Mast getaut
Keiner sonst an Deck

Mit dem ersten Strahl, der die Nacht durchbricht
Weiße Segel, volle Fahrt
Kommt ein Schiff heran, halte durch mein Jung
Halte durch, die Rettung naht
Nur ein Mast ragt auf, aus dem Felsenriff
Johnny regt sich nimmermehr
Er wird heimgebracht
Für den Rest der Crew sind die Särge leer

You were boud for stormy weather

May the angels guide you home

You lost your lives togehter
You had to die, only heaven knows why

Santiano,"In der Hafenstadt auf dem Henkersplatz standen dreiundsiebzig Mann
Und der Henker schrie: „Alle auf die Knie! Mit dem Captain fang ich an“

Des Herren Freunde, aller Welten Feinde

Als sein Hals schon grad auf dem Richtblock lag
Hob das Haupt dann nochmal an
Sah sich um sprach, wenn ich gleich danach, mir noch eines Wünschen kann
Alle Männer hier, die ich noch passier'
Werden vor dem Tod bewahrt
Und dann fiel sein Kopf, doch er trug ihn noch
Bis zum elften Kamerad

Von den Koggen hoch zur See
Suchten hundert Mann seinen stolzen Kahn
Doch er wurd nie mehr gesehen

Auf seinem Tod versprochen war
Waren Lügen nur, denn man Köpfte stur

Santiano,"Ich weiß noch wie es damals war
Die Bilder sind noch immer da
Jung und frei und wild, so waren wir
Nur du und ich, nichts hielt uns auf
Vogelfrei und stolz darauf
Viel zu früh gingst du dann fort von hier

Doch unsere Lieder werden bleiben
Sie ziehen weiter mit dem Wind
Unsere Lieder werden bleiben
Wenn wir einmal nicht mehr sind
Auch in noch so dunklen Zeiten
Werden sie niemals verklingen
Unsere Lieder werden bleiben
Sie ziehen weiter mit dem Wind

Du hast gekämpft, du warst so stark
Doch viel zu viel blieb dir versagt
Ich war bei dir und werde es immer sein
Dein Schicksal ist ein Teil von mir
Und eines Tages folg ich dir
Wir beide sind für alle Zeit verliebt

Denn unsere Lieder werden bleiben
Sie ziehen weiter mit dem Wind
Unsere Lieder werden bleiben
Wenn wir einmal nicht mehr sind
Auch in noch so dunklen Zeiten
Werden sie niemals verklingen
Unsere Lieder werden bleiben
Sie ziehen weiter mit dem Wind

Santiano,"Wir waren nahezu
Schon in Haithabu
An 'nem Frühlingtag im Mai
Wir waren voll besetzt
Und wir saßen fest
Und wir hatten kein' Rum dabei
 
Am Wegesrand
Vorn am Ufer stand
Eine Schönheit im schlichten Kleid
Sie war elfengleich
„Ich begrüße euch
Kommt mit mir, wenn ihr durstig seid“
 
Von Nord nach Süd
Und von Ost nach West
Gleich wie weit und wie lang ich fuhr
Fand ich keinen Mann
Der so feiern kann
Wie die Mädchen von Haithabu
 
Von Nord nach Süd
Und von Ost nach West
Gleich wie weit und wie lang ich fuhr
Fand ich keinen Mann
Der so feiern kann
Wie die Mädchen von Haithabu
 
Und wir brachen auf
In ihr kleines Dorf
Und sie sagte: „Ich heiß' Eileen“
Auf dem Marktplatz dann
Wo das Fest begann
Alle Frauen waren so jung und schön
 
Packte mich Eileen
Zog mich zu sich hin
„Lass uns tanzen, ich und du“
Es gibt keinen im Land
Der die Nacht entflammt
Wie die Mädchen von Haithabu
 
Von Nord nach Süd
Und von Ost nach West
Gleich wie weit und wie lang ich fuhr
Fand ich keinen Mann

Fand ich keinen Mann
Der so feiern kann

(Hey ho)
(Hey ho)
(Hey ho)
 
Und wir schenkten ein
Tranken Rum und Wein
In mein' Armen da lag Eileen
Und wir sangen laut
Bis der Morgen graut
Und die Sonne am Himmel schien
 
Mittags stand ich auf
Sah zum Fenster raus
Beine, Kopf, alles tat mir weh
Wir haben durchgemacht
Mehr als eine Nacht
Denn es fiel schon der erste Schnee

Santigold,"Brooklyn we go hard
We on the look for the advantage, we work hard
And if we seem to rough it up a bit
We broke but we rich at heart
Pull ourselves up now we won't choke
It's our time, put the lights on us

War tactics they make me sick
Reel your heart in run away with it
Smile in your face, undermine your back
Got guns for the strength they lack
So if you know another way
You can't look the other way
If you know another way,
Tell them so right to their face

We think you're a joke
Shove your hope where it don't shine (4x)

I pay for what's called
Eccentricity and my will to evolve
I hear them all say
That I got heart
But not everything that it takes

Taint my mind but not my soul
Tell you I got fire
I wont sell it for no payroll
Let 'em hold me down
I know if I know another way
I can't look the other way
I know another way
I'll tell them so right to their face

To tell it straight, I'm trying to build a wall
Walking by myself
Down avenues that reek of time to kill
If you see me keep going
Be a pass by waver
Build me up, bring me down
Just leave me out you name dropper
Stop trying to catch my eye
I see you good you forced faker
Just make it easy
You're my enemy you fast talker

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe

What am I here for
I left my home to disappear is all
I'm here for myself
Not to know you
I don't need no one else
Fit in so good the hope is that you cannot see me later
You don't know me
I am an introvert an excavator
I'm duckin' out for now
A face in dodgy elevators
Creep up and suddenly
I found myself
An innovator

I can say I hope it will be worth what I give up
If I could stand up mean for the things that I believe
