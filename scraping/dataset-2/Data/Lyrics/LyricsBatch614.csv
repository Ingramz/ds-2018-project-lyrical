London Symphony Orchestra,"In Europe and America there's a growing feeling of hysteria.
Conditioned to respond to all the threats
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets.
MIster Krushchev said, ""We will bury you.""
I don't subscribe to this point of view.
It'd be such an ignorant thing to do
If the Russians love their children too.
How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?
There is no monopoly on common sense
On either side of the political fence.
We share the same biology, regardless of ideology.
Believe me when I say to you,
I hope the Russians love their children too

There is no historical precedent
To put the words in the mouth of the president?
There's no such thing as a winnable war,
It's a lie we don't believe anymore.
Mister Reagan says, ""We will protect you.""
I don't subscribe to this point of view.
Believe me when I say to you,
I hope the Russians love their children too
We share the same biology, regardless of ideology.
But what might save us, me and you,
Is if the Russians love their children too",Russians,1994
London Symphony Orchestra,"Growin' up you don't see the writing on the wall.
Passin' by, movin' straight ahead you knew it all.
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain,
you'll find you're all alone; everything has changed.

Play the game; you know you can't quit until it's won.
Soldier of only you can do what must be done.
You know, in some ways you're a lot like me.
You're just a prisoner, and you're tryin' to break free.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

Burning up; don't know just how far that I can go.
Soon be home; only just a few miles down the road.
And I can make it, I know I can.
You broke the boy in me, but you won't break the man.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

I can climb the highest mountain, cross the widest sea.
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burning in me, burning in me.
Just once in his life a man has his time.
And my time is now; I'm comin' alive.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

Feel like a vet again.  I hope I ain't high!

London Symphony Orchestra,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

(Repeat x2)
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

London Symphony Orchestra,"Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with that fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

Unsatisfied, I skip my pride

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

Is something she can buy
All the pictures on the wall
Are hanging high so they won't fall
Until her tear stained floor is dry

But today's his lucky day
He bets it all on a final game
But then he chokes ain't that a shame
The 8 ball had one last thing to say

Just stop the sky from falling
Falling down on me
Stray cats are creepy calling
Hound dog harmony
Just stop the sky from falling
Dodge the buck shot rain
This tree house free for all
The sky is falling
Who's got a crane

Jazz singer padlocks all his memories
Long nights have left their mark
His lava lamp condition
His black light intuition
How come tomorrow seams so dark?

London Symphony Orchestra,"It's empty now, no friendly face
And nothing lives within
I look around and I find no trace
To tell me what has been

So far I've come to find there's no one here
No life & fear
I came for nothing, they have gone
And nobody's home

I came to learn, perhaps to teach
But I can tell somehow
The world that I was sent to reach
Has got no future now

Across the galaxy to spread the word
And no one heard
I came for nothing, I'm alone
And nobody's home

A requiem was never sung, no elegy was read
No monument was carved in stone in memory of the dead

They feel no pain

",Nobody's Home,1998
London Symphony Orchestra,"I'm woven in a fantasy, I can't believe the things I see
The path that I have chosen now has led me to a wall
And with each passing day I feel a little more like something dear was lost
It rises now before me, a dark and silent barrier between
All I am and all that I would ever want to be
It's just a travesty, towering, marking off the boundaries 
My spirit would erase

To pass beyond is what I seek, I fear that I may be too weak
And those are few who've seen it through to glimplse the other side
The promised land is waiting like a maiden that is soon to be a bride
The moment is a masterpiece, the weight of indecision's in the air
It's standing there, the symbol and the sum of all that's me
It's just a travesty, towering, blocking out the light and blinding me
I want to see

Gold and diamonds cast a spell, it's not for me to know it well
The treasures that I seek are waiting on the other side
There's more that I can measure in the treasure of the love that I can find
And though it's always been with me
I must tear down the wall let it be
All I am, and all that I was ever meant to be, in harmony
Shining true and smiling back at all who wait to cross
There is no loss",The Wall,1998

For when love's gone, they'll lustre on

Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for

What child is this, who laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come peasant king to own Him,
The King of Kings, salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
Raise, raise the song on high,
The Virgin sings her lullaby:
Joy, joy, for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary

Joy, joy, for Christ is born,
The Babe, the Son of Mary

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around

Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat

Sunlit valley, mountain fields, unseen in the rain, here all life abounds
No man rules this land, no human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently, so much to see, so rich in earth's delights

Painted desert, sequined sky, stars that fill the night, here all life abounds
Rivers flowing to the sea, sunshine pure and bright, here all life abounds
No man rules this land, no human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently, so much to see, so rich in earth's delights

So the maiden lies in waiting for the sails to reach the shore
Land of beauty and abundance, innocent, you opened wide your door
Wanderers found the waiting treasure, full of gifts beyond their measure
Milk and honey for our pleasure

Across the sea there came a multitude, sailing ships upon the wave
Filled with visions of Utopia and the freedom that they crave
Ravage, plunder, see no wonder, rape and kill and tear asunder
Chop the forest, plow it under

Highways scar the mountainsides, buildings to the sky, people all around
Houses stand in endless rows, sea to shining sea, people all around
So we rule this land, and here we stand upon our paradise
Dreaming of a place, our weary race is ready to rise",Song For America,2005

Men are not a new sensation

He can laugh, but I love it

Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him

Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank god, I can be oversexed again

Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot

They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night

Touch it, stroke it and undress it

I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for

Your sweet and weary head
The night is falling
You have come to journey's end
Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore

Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping

What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All Souls pass

Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say
We have come now to the end

And you'll be here in my arms

You ain't seen nothing yet

There's a leisure centre now

A doctor in Manhattan
Saved a dying man for free

Another Miracle
By the grace of God Almighty

We've got oceans of wine
We've got famine when we need it

Got designer crime
We've got Mercedes
We've got Porsche

We've got choice

Finally reaped what he had sown
A farmer in Ohio has just repaid a loan

The human race has civilized itself

With our hands over our ears

But the operetta lingers
Then the piano lid comes down

How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Never on the bandwagon at any time

For y'all niggas that be strictly braggin'
Up at the spot so eager to grab the mic with the breath of dragon
Niggas be walkin around waggin' there tail taggin'
Along trying to get their mail laggin'
Make me want to disrespect and check
Grab that nigga's neck and start gaggin'
I drop a pound of discussion and drop a rhyme to leave you with a concusion
And have your whole crew commence to hushin'
Down with the Master race of emcees
Who terrorize, whoever flies up in the face talkin' lies
I give a shout to the unseen at the lost gates
While you're makin' mistakes, we make them hot plates

Expand my lung with the chronic smoke then proceed with the plan

Thought you were my rapture, watch your mental fracture
You're just an actor, playin' the rap game, total shame
Nothing really gained when you shell framed is all in vain
I hitcha with that shit that make ya neck snap
While goin through my SP1200 with memory that's stacks
The beat conductor keep your speaker shakin'
I got your amp'll quakin like a vacation on Haiti
Relaxin', I'll take you on a mental trip, grip

Yo, I'm just a solo MC, it's like this
Rawls makes the beats that make you shake your hips
Lone to the Cata, Cata to the -lysts
Yo, Lone to the Cata, Cata to the -lysts
Experimentin with styles like scientists
No matter what your name is, you can still get dissed
Cause it's the Lone to the Cata, Cata to the -lysts

[ VERSE 1: J. Sands ]
Yo, it all began around '84, snatchin candy out the bus store
Now&Laters, Lemonheads, then we fled through backyards
Duckin police, shorties were trackstars
Hoppin fences, dividin candy on the benches
Is what we did, ???? jocks and color tube socks
Huffies were the shit, I pop a Willie and go two blocks
Easy, without fallin, Stevie took his ball when
We did pick him for hoopin, 21 Chicago
I rocked 33, I was Kareem without the goggles
Ridin skateboards downhills made wheels wobble
The fast life, niggas get stuck with broken bottles
My cousin Pablo got bagged for coke and wrote a novel
Saturday, put the tape in the radio
So I could dub the latest from Flash and Kurtis Blow
From 'The Breaks' to 'The Message' I learned every word
Yo check it, I'm in the shower rockin rhymes butt-naked
The birth of a MC at the age of 13
Right before crack turned dimes to burnt fiends
Hip-hop was like the beatuy in the Jet magazine
Had me open, addicted to rap like chain smokin
Writin rhymes everywhere I went, havin older cats bent
Sayin shortie 13 will represent
So realize this wasn't just a one-night stand
Cause I seduce ears infinitely once rhymes land
Nowadays LP's just might have one nice jam, and a remix
But 85 is just too blind to see this
I didn't plan to be this, I was mathematically implanted in time
With a ???? wind
Yo, is you with me? Cause Babylon be always out to get we
The black cops about 50-50

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: J. Sands ]
Aiyo, a lotta cats can only see the bad in rap
Matter of fact, they only focus on what it lacks
Yeah, I know about the frontin MC's, and yeah, they wack
Plus the jokers who be makin the tracks, but check it, black
Politickin ain't gon' take nothin back, so keep it movin
Be a contribution to hip hop, that's what we're losin
Let the seeds know about Soulsonic, Mantronix
Rock Steady, Fab Five Freddy, Busy Bee, Moe Dee
And how BDP taught 'Poetry'
Plus we can't forget the DJ's and graffiti
If you agree, then please proceed to follow me
I take you through dimensions, just lend me your attention
So you can make your own comprehension of what I mention
See, knowledge is power, wisdom's used as the extension
To make the understanding more clearer is my intention
So head's gon' be left out hangin in suspension like a lynchin
A lotta cats rhymes' are full of tension
Can't even walk the block without the bodyguards and henchmen
Paranoid and always flinchin, even your crew talkin dissentient
They see the 'masquerade' like George Benson
Lone Catalysts, strategists of the new world
I used to love H.E.R. too, but now I'm focused in on you
Cause you will be the one who takes us to the next millennium
The Most High controls the universe like a pendulum
Swingin back and forth, forth and back and forth
Balancin nine planets on a circular course
There's no remorse, MC's need to carry the weight
And bury the hate, and realize these are serious stakes
No time to waste, cause we're livin in a high-tech state
So listen close, so there won't be no debate

[ VERSE 1: J. Sands ]
Yo, it was June 2nd, wisdom, you know the math
In the lab with J. Rawls all night ready to craft
See, I'm drivin down Penn. Ave. early morning
Turned on the wipers cause it just started storming
Without warning, my destination was the rest
But first make a stop and get some sliced turkey breast
From the deli, my stomach went 'errr' like Akinyele
Parked the ride, went inside, rain pourin on my Pelle
Dashin for the door, made it, soaken wet
Drippin puddles on the floor as I walk into the door mad vexed
I guess that was the reason why I slept
Cause to my left I saw a sight that I'll never forget
It was the illest silhouette, I could hardly see the flesh
One quarter exposed, the other three fourths clothed
In linen, now I seen women but this was like a goddess
The oddest of situations, so much anticipation
For real, I could feel as our eyes soon met
Don't get me wrong, son, cause with shorties I'm like a vet
But it wasn't the same, a introduction sparked the flame
Poetically, without hesitation she said her name
I was Ayanna Monet, just came to town yesterday from Atlanta, GA
Wasn't plannin to stay no more than a week or two, maybe a month
I couldn't front, aiyo, yo queen, I don't mean to sound blunt
But if you have the time, I love to spend it, no harm intended
She recommended for me to have my phone number extended
On a piece of paper, so maybe she could call me later
Actin all shy, blushin, adrenaline rushin as I'm walkin to the door
Thinkin of the feelings that I never felt before, I adore mi amor
A perfect combination, sparkle like a diamond
And to top it off the sun started shinin

[ CHORUS: J. Sands ]
Ayanna Monet
A girl I met around the way
Ayanna Monet
I think about her everyday
Ayanna Monet
The name I just can't help to say
Ayanna Monet
Ayanna Monet
Ayanna Monet

[ VERSE 2: J. Sands ]
Later on I'm at the rest listenin to Quest
Dig it, wide awake, can't sleep, shortie got me ????
I got so used to all these Daisy Duke freaks
That when earth took position
I stopped, looked and listened
I'm on a mission, somethin like an expedition
To catch the next edition of Miss Monet's wishings
A movie, a dinner, I don't know, I'm waitin
By the phone, just turned on a Sony PlayStation
Anticipatin the next time I'll speak
To the miss elegant, unique beauty, petite
It's deep, her mystique was magnifique, in fact
It sent me back, reminiscin over jazz tracks
At that second the phone rang, now I'm checkin
The caller identification for information
The number I didn't recognize off top
So I answered the telly cool like Arthur Fonzarelli
Yo, whaddaya know, it was the lady named Ayanna
Paused like a coma - far from drama
For the words that were spoken, I knew I had her open
And she felt the same, so it was peace, no game
I had to spark the flame, so I cordially invited, her
On a late night tour through Pittsburgh
We drove up the [Name] Shore wile she told me more
And how around me she felt secure
What was in store? I didn't know and really didn't care
Cause this here was a power move, soon the hour grew
Late, wait, she's tellin me that she's gonna be back
In a month if we want we can relax and see if feelings remain
Sustain through the distance, time, it blew my mind
When she said she want my kinds and help me make my next dime
Tell me Ayanna Monet isn't mine
Come on

[ CHORUS ]",Ayanna Monet,2000
Lone Catalysts,"Hip hop, a way of life
Chosen by the ghetto youth out of necessity
It involves graffiti, deejaying, breakdancing and emceeing
Which all rely on raw, artistic skill
You know, they used to tell me that this music would never last
Now look at it now, it influences all music here today
So either you respect it we gon' take it back

Hip hop, the voice of the street, the voice of the youth
The voice that you hear, the voice that only we produce
The way that we salute that makes the wildest niggas start to shoot
The voice that recoupes only 12% of the loot
The voice of the groups, like OutKast, LOX and The Roots
The voice of the truth, that no society can ever mute
The voice of the men and women who gave their lives defendin
The God-given rights, they had no choice but to fight
The voice of the black, latino and the white
The voice of the club that makes the freaks come out at night
The voice of the thugs who pop champagne and rock ice
The voice of the shorties who wear tight shirts and talk sheist
The voice of the shook who look one time but not twice
The voice of the crooks at gambling spot with hot dice
The voice of the church, mosque, synagogue and temple
The voice of your soul, your body and your mental
The voice that says ""rap!"" when I hear a instrumental
The voice that don't stop and it's just that simple
The voice that don't stop and it's just that simple
The voice that don't, d-d-don't, d-don't...

Yo, we live that life that you call hip hop
From the bottom straight to the tip top
Hey Rawls, we got em while them others did not
So if you with the LC, nigga, lick shot
If you live that life they call hip hop
Worldwide everyday tic-toc
This life is like nothin to play with, ock
That's why when I say ""shit"" you say ""shit hot""
That's why when I say ""shit"" you say ""shit hot""
That's why when I say ""shit"" you say ""shit hot""
That's why when I say ""shit"" you say ""shit hot""
That's why when I say ""shit"" -

[ Double Trouble ]
Cause here's a little story that must be told
About two cool brothers that were put on hold
Tried to hold us back from fortune and fame
They destroyed the crew and they killed our name
They tried to step on the ego and walk on the pride
But true blue brothers stand side by side
Through thick and thin, from beginning to end
This battle we lost, but the war we'll win",Hip Hop,2000
Lone Catalysts,"[ VERSE 1: J. Sands ]
If hip hop was a crime, I'd be a felon, sellin
To all the conscious dope addicts, tragic, gotta have it
Get no static, rhymes get ripped automatic
Spray you from your feet to your cabbage
Lyrically hit you with the spiritual, infrared won't miss
Police lookin for the Catalyst
Hah, usually on the blocks in your neighborhood
When the flavor's good clientele's humunguous
Pittsburgh, Columbus
And all the other cities in the USA
Networkin, soon to be worldwide for certain
I know it's hurtin, competition creatin envy
Sure they want to end me when they see me in a Benzi
Throw salt in my game, in my face act friendly
That's why I play em close till they ass get ghost
Ain't no love lost here, crampin my poster'
This game is cutthroat, so I'ma aim at the utmost
Spot, not knowing if I'm gonna get caught
Be up in heaven, openin for Big and Tupac
But that's the nature of it, some live, some kick the bucket
I'd be a damn fool not to love it
Right?

[ CHORUS (2X) ]
Imagine that, if hip hop was a crime
Would you stick and move, would you sell dimes?
Or would you switch sides and play the role of po nine
Blockin me from the go line
Preventin me from gettin mine

[ J. Sands ]
Everything is kosher, slayin punk MC's with my toaster
Itchy finger on trigger got my rep bigger
You should see em shiver knowin down deep I deliver
Bulls eye, direct hit with hollow tip lyric
Like the bully of the block all the kids fear it
J. Sands is untouchable, how you hear it
Echo wind through the hallways where I be all days
Hustlin, ain't no small plate cause niggas always
want to plot against the local cat with props
Makin it harder to set up my shop upon the block
Like a martyr I be in this war until I drop
But if it ain't the haters it's the goddamn cops
Stressin me, just so they can get some cream off the top
Testin me, so now I gotta scheme, call the team
Dante, [Name], J. Rawls and Raheem
The ill syndicate, quick to light up the scene
No prints, squeaky clean, toss the heat in the stream
Rendez-vous somewhere serene around 12:15
See, if you don't hold it down, no one will hold it for ya
So be sure to have a alibi plus a good lawyer

See, niggas know my status, ghetto celeb' kingpin
A hip hop's fiend friend who always seen in
The fly be	-boy attire receivin
Praises from the holiest to the heathens
It's all good cause what I provide is pleasin
Comfortable, something your mind can ease in
One try, then you find out the reason
Why I got addicts for every season
Summer, spring, winter, fall and even
Leap years, you want that shit, then peep here
You need $10 and some change for the exchange
Then you'll have the ill sounds pumpin in your range
Or your walkman, head bouncin type strange
That's when you start to realize that your life is rearranged
Don't go to work no more cause all you want is the pure
Hip hop from the MC connoisseur
So now you on missions headed to the record store
Cop the product and beam up like never before
Now you're hooked for life and there's no escapin us
Cause one hit was too many, a million not enough

Yo, stepped out my door into the world, now it's on
The sun gave birth, so now the nighttime is born
Nothin different than the norm as the plot takes form
Inner feelings remain warm to shelter me from the storm
Cause the city could swallow you whole, so be warned
The streets are filled with scorn from dusk to morn
I gotta be alerted for all times or be torn
From my earthly existence, I measure the distance
And calculate a path straight so my time is efficient
Can't waste not a second or breath
So when I step, man, I trek
Mind focused, hollow point is noticed
At the fly Latin hostess, workin ????
But never hesitate my motion
My body floatin like the wind over the ocean
I saw the brothers toastin, the Thunderbird wine
Givin praise to the stars as they shine
Exchanged pounds, started to rhyme
Once the cipher hit its peak, I continued down the street
Cause my mission was incomplete, this was no time to sleep
Gotta get back to the lab and freak something that y'all can peep
From Lone Catalysts, very unique
The way we organize it all with the ill technique
The way we organize it all with the ill technique
The way we organize it all with the ill technique

[ VERSE 2: J. Sands ]
Only a block left to go before I reach the studio
The story goes: Rawls in the lab eatin Oreos
Waitin on me to show, he got a track and need a pro
Usually have some tree to blow, but nowadays I leave or go
When it's time to breathe a flow, even though
You might see me in your section
Eyes red complexion
With my man [Name] and LG flex on
You know that, so finally the destination
I'm at the lab with Rawls and without no hesitation
""My mic sounds nice, check one
My mic sounds nice, check two""
And with no further ado, you know the are-e-s-you-me
We be in the lab like all day
Rawls makes the track and I spit not the wack
Mix all the levels, then record it all on the DAT
Then take it to the Sugar Shack where Rashaad is at
Let him peep the joint cause 'cause got a knack
To spot the sure shots and the or-not's
So we be up in the lab till about 4 o'clock
In the AM, the next day, yo, it's no delayin
Time to put it to wax, CDs and tapes
To generate the papes, to generate the papes
Cause once it circulates everyone will state

Got a roof over my head
But I take it serious
No joke

Comin' straight out the box, first edition, nutrition
From musicians, food for thought when you listen
I been around the atlas, countries and states
Everybody knows the Catalysts bumps, beats and breaks
The most true to life rap tactics for practise
The fact is, I tilt a nigga off his axis
The way that Sands taxes, doin' his mic matches
Somethin' massive, let me explain what the wrath is
Four hundred years of oppression, anger, aggression
And the anxiety of a blackman stressin'
The devil keep on testin, always gotta offer his suggestions
Make it seem greater when it's less than
That's just tricknowledge
They teach you it from high school through college
So you can go out and get them dollars
It's just a game they play to see who has the fattest wallet
That's why most blacks smoke crack and most white alcoholics

I grab these microphones to live, son, rest in peace Big Pun
Because you know another day you're not promised to live one
Yo, the streets are hot, most blocks are like a prison
So if you're lookin' for love, kid, you gots to give some
Man, these days are cold-blooded, everyone's butted
Rock jewels that stay flooded, the weak, they never cut it
Sometime I be like 'what if' but ain't a damn thing gonna change
Cause it's just part of the game

Aiyo, I slap-box lyrics through mics, the smooth type
That move right into a state of mind to fight
Cause it's all ground zero, my street level bureau
We'll play this game until we master it like Ken Duro
So what's your role? My part is the aural
Sub-moral, Lone Catalysts remain plural
I'm like ? headin out to ?
Maryland, in a caravan to a rural
Spot to make a drop-off, that's how I hustle my raps to prosper
Cause MC's disappear like Jimmy Hoffa
The hungriest cats are at the crib writin' this very minute
They see the pennant and want to win it
That's how styles get invented
y'all new jack timid frontin-ass niggas rhymes be rented
I got no respect for y'all, y'all probably be the next to fall
You want to bang, kid, should be waitin' for the ref to call

Okay now let me get back to the session at hand

Do some dates out west so I can work on my tan
I guess it's just the rap life
y'all know who y'all niggas act like?
Quick to blaze the bag pipe and talk about the last night
Some are real grimey muthafuckas up in the fast life
Don't give a damn about rap cause they're stresin the crack price
(And grip the Mack tight) Some niggas frail like a glass pipe
With more bodyguards than Bill Clinton around they ass, type
To walk the streets at night carryin a flashlight
Some are players grabbin all the mamis on they ass tight
Bust it, some smoke weed, get skeed, hashis
Dust and ecstacy, shrooms and drink ??booze??

You need to take time out
To properly learn how to spit your rhyme out
I mean seriously, do
Can't you see that this industry is all about loot?
So if you're comin' with the wack you'll never recoup
And that doesn't make sense, to not make sense
When you're supplyin' the demand with the rhymes you invent
It's simplistic, but don't get it twisted

Is laced tight with the trump that makes you bump-bump
Don't front, cause suckers look chump right from the jump
When they act like they want to battle against the monk
Usually they probably drunk or feelin' it from the skunk
It's a sobering effect once we snap that neck like Erick and Parrish
Even your peeps will be embarrassed
So why you wan test against a strong guest
Who you know gon' bless the East Columbus
Style, we originated strictly from this
Way I lay my vocals to his drum kicks
With one swift paragraph I enlist
You and yours to explore with the Catalysts

[Chorus]

Lone Catalysts
J. Sands and Rawls is how we do

No amateurs allowed on the session tonight",The Pro's,2000
Lone Catalysts,"[ J. Sands ]
Yo
You know what, man?
A lot of people think they can rap, man
You know?
Think they be rhymers and all this and this
Just because of what they got
Youknowmsayin?
Just cause of what they drive
But they don't understand, man
This is poetry
This is a artform
This is what we do
And..
If you can't do it, it don't matter +what+ you got
Check it out

[ J. Sands ]
Let me talk for a moment and discuss all the perimeters
The real reason why MC's remain amateur
Just examine the delivery and stamina
Focus in like a camera, see what I'm handin ya
Is the recipe, the basics and neccessities
For those who's blessin thee, mic, but too aggressively
Relax, man, let it come natural, feel the ecstacy
When you're holdin the mic, you should expect to be
In a mindframe that 'no one can stand next to me'
Blowin spots is the destinies of the best MC's
And the rest? Well, they settle for less
Here's a 'classic example' like A Tribe Called Quest
We got jokers in the industry who never paid dues
Cause their cousin brother mother knew somebody who knew
And you know how that goes, political, and it's critical
The charts are full of MC's who lyrically are pitiful
That's like sayin analog would sound better than digital
Rap is outta control, this why this time is pivotal
For us to make a change from the youngest to the oldest
Humblin these cats who swear up and down they the coldest
Frontin like they're boldest when they know they cannot hold this
If you can't protect your neck then you just be head and shoulders
I swear, cause these lyrics comin sharp like shear
So put my name up in your mouth, I double-dare you, yeah

[ CHORUS: J. Sands ]
Yeah, some MC's are rich, yeah, some MC's are poor
But none of that will be a factor once we settle the score
So we can do it like this or do it like that
Cause it don't matter where you're are because I bring it where you're at

[ VERSE 2: J. Sands ]
I heard some MC's want to get down
Put your shit down and have a sit-down
Forget the studio and the mixdown
It's time to set it, you talkin loud without the credit
You clean like a radio edit
You couldn't tell that the styles that I use are embedded like Dyanetics
Rhymes on time like FedEx
Alert the medics, it's about to get messy
Dirty like an SP-1200, backdoor like alley hoops
It's the way I enter ciphers, spark it like a lighter
Freestyles off the top for herbs and rhyme biters
J. Sands, focusin 360 degrees
With my plans for revolution, for land and currency
But for now I'm in the Pittsburgh streets
In all the sections cause in my section
I make moves like I was destined
To be a visualser with deep thoughts perplexin
Detection negative force in all directions
Usin microphones to broadcast suggestions
Of devil wizardry and black folk mysery
MC's fallin captive because their skills are not adaptive
I rock the East Coast and every city on the atlas
You paranoid, actin all sheist around your boys
Didn't use your own style, so you use the decoy
Now you're shadowed by a character you cannot destroy
Check your reflection, your whole concept needs an inspection

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: J. Sands ]
You can take it personal or consider this strictly business
Allah's my witness, I got the knack for lyric fitness
Have you duckin me like I was a Jehova Witness on your front porch
You know the repertoire, kid, you don't want more
Okay then what you run for, your ego's crushed, now you at the gun store?
Countin your chances hopin for one more
Sayin to yourself, 'I'm gonna get Sands', a slick plan
You never shoulda thought up, now you gettin nada
God don't like ugly so as you proceeded to plug me
????? Goretex boots and rugbies
A 'frantic situation' like the Zulu Nation
You shoulda used ???? they help you balancin your p.h.'in
Snake type tactics, curse all those who practice
If it comes around, then it goes around on the axis
A powerful impact make your ??ass back??
After no one will ever want to touch you like a cactus
The law of the shady, be it and then you'll see it
Reflected by three-fold from the way which you directed
It, to put it simple, you just need to quit
You just a mediocre rhymer but you still talk shit
You just a mediocre rapper and you still talk shit
It don't matter what your name is, you can still get dissed

The pressure on pedals accelerates, racing the currents of winds
Making the intangible bend with aerodynamics and panoramic visioning
I see the world we livin in, five gallons of knowledge
A tank full filled with lessons

Yo
I grab these microphones to live, son
Pay the rent, put food on the table
Got a roof over my head
But I take it serious
No joke

Comin' straight out the box, first edition, nutrition
From musicians, food for thought when you listen
I been around the atlas, countries and states
Everybody knows the Catalysts bumps, beats and breaks
The most true to life rap tactics for practise
The fact is, I tilt a nigga off his axis
The way that Sands taxes, doin' his mic matches
Somethin' massive, let me explain what the wrath is
Four hundred years of oppression, anger, aggression
And the anxiety of a blackman stressin'
The devil keep on testin, always gotta offer his suggestions
Make it seem greater when it's less than
That's just tricknowledge
They teach you it from high school through college
So you can go out and get them dollars
It's just a game they play to see who has the fattest wallet
That's why most blacks smoke crack and most white alcoholics

I grab these microphones to live, son, rest in peace Big Pun
Because you know another day you're not promised to live one
Yo, the streets are hot, most blocks are like a prison
So if you're lookin' for love, kid, you gots to give some
Man, these days are cold-blooded, everyone's butted
Rock jewels that stay flooded, the weak, they never cut it
Sometime I be like 'what if' but ain't a damn thing gonna change
Cause it's just part of the game

Aiyo, I slap-box lyrics through mics, the smooth type
That move right into a state of mind to fight
Cause it's all ground zero, my street level bureau
We'll play this game until we master it like Ken Duro
So what's your role? My part is the aural
Sub-moral, Lone Catalysts remain plural
I'm like ? headin out to ?
Maryland, in a caravan to a rural
Spot to make a drop-off, that's how I hustle my raps to prosper
Cause MC's disappear like Jimmy Hoffa
The hungriest cats are at the crib writin' this very minute
They see the pennant and want to win it
That's how styles get invented
y'all new jack timid frontin-ass niggas rhymes be rented
I got no respect for y'all, y'all probably be the next to fall
You want to bang, kid, should be waitin' for the ref to call
A time-out, so you can find out
Any possible way to exit this rhyme bout

[ CHORUS ]

Okay now let me get back to the session at hand
My DJ's name is Jason Rawls, I don't need no band
Yo, I travel across the land, microphone in hand
Do some dates out west so I can work on my tan
I guess it's just the rap life
y'all know who y'all niggas act like?
Quick to blaze the bag pipe and talk about the last night
Some are real grimey muthafuckas up in the fast life
Don't give a damn about rap cause they're stresin the crack price
(And grip the Mack tight) Some niggas frail like a glass pipe
With more bodyguards than Bill Clinton around they ass, type
To walk the streets at night carryin a flashlight
Some are players grabbin all the mamis on they ass tight
Bust it, some smoke weed, get skeed, hashis
Dust and ecstacy, shrooms and drink ??booze??
For all my rappin niggas, I hope we link soon
Get yours, I'm gettin mine, cause it's about time

Lone Justice,"My folks own the land round here
And our big old house now for some fifty odd years
We'd all seen a few rough days
But I never dreamed I'd watch it all get swept away

No one knows what causes angry rain
The water rushed right through this town just like a great big train
Years of hard work and memories
Are floatin? down big river on their way out to sea

After the flood
After the flood
The land it washed away
Felt like my flesh and blood

I'd rather be shovelin'
Through the slush and mud
Than to leave my home where I grew up
Life goes on after the flood

The Clover Inn Bar was hit pretty hard
The piano's lyin? in the street broken apart
My favorite old oak tree's rooted up
But I'll plant myself a new one after the flood

After the flood
After the flood
The land it washed away
Felt like my flesh and blood

I'd rather be shovelin'
Through the slush and mud
Than to leave my home where I grew up
Life goes on after the flood

A place to call your very own means so much
Though it's a little soggy
After all the water's gone
I'll scrub it clean and make it home again

A natural disaster can't hold nothin' on me
Their quakin' out west and freezin' back east
So I think I'll stick around
And show a little faith in a weary town

After the flood
After the flood
The land it washed away
Felt like my flesh and blood

I'd rather be shovelin'
Through the slush and mud
Than to leave my home where I grew up
Life goes on after the flood

Lone Justice,"Sweet sweet baby mine
I want you 'round me all the time
Cause you know you make my soul sing
And the bells in my heart go chime chime chime

Sweet sweet baby mine
I'm short of breath and full of sighs
Yeah you set my sprit soaring
And you make my lovelight shine shine shine

I'm gracin' the edge
I'm losing my head
I'm fallin'
But I don't mind

You set the fire
Inside my soul
And the heat
Makes it hard to say no
I didn't wanna lose control
But I'm fallin'

Sweet sweet baby mine
I want you round me all the time
Cause you know you make my soul sing
And the bells in my heart go chime chime chime

Sweet sweet baby mine
If the way I'm feelin' is a crime
Oh honey, then I'm guilty
Cause you got my heart beatin' double time time time

I'm gracin' the edge
I'm losing my head
I'm fallin'
But I don't mind

Lone Justice,"Is there the space for our words?
Is there a place here for us?
Where can a faithful heart turn
When generous grace gathers dust?

Where can a faithful heart turn?
Have we not labored enough?
Little babies learn that it's a blind
Blind world and a generous grace gathers dust

Beacon shining ever-bright
The light at the end of the tunnel is in your eyes
You're a lamp to my feet
You're the arms at my side

And I will not be afraid to
Victory hides in darkest places
Shine, victory hides in darkest places

Is there a space here for our words?
Is there a place here for us?
Where can a faithful heart turn
When generous grace gathers dust?

Where can a faithful heart turn
When we have strayed from our trust?
Keep the beacon burnin'
'Cause it's a blind blind world

Lone Justice,"Look at all the happy people
See their faces change
As you walk into the room
Hundreds of years
In the eyes of strangers
Make the back of your neck burn
Free to pass, to conform
Free to wonder what belongs
To the bleeding man inside
Freedom bears no credence
When the lack of it's still being justified
(in small minds)
Some things never stir the hearts of men
Some mistakes take more than mere regrets to mend
In spite of all the twisting of truth
I still see myself reflected in you
But a mountain of distorted vision
Has me straining for a view
Is it fair to say that it's...
Reflected (on my, my, my side)
Reflected (a wall exists and if I had a fist I'd bust it down)
Reflected (on my, my, my side)
Reflected (in this I take no pride)
If I had a wish then there would be no sides
There should be no difference here
No mistrust, no suspicion here
What we are, what we see
To fabricate redemptive boasts
Confusing all, condemning most
Is feigning fidelity
Toss a glance into the pool
Open my eyes and listen
Wish the rippling surface pure,
Free of dissension
Nothing can change the way of friends
Nothing else can bring this chilling season to an end
In spite of all the twisting of truth
I still see myself reflected in you
But lingering traces of deception
Blinding vision burn like poison fumes
I don't want to know if it's 
Reflected (on my, my, my side)
Reflected (a wall exists and if I had a fist I'd bust it down)
Reflected (on my, my, my side)

If I had a wish then there would be no sides
Oh, this trend of change
See's nothing changing
Keep dreaming!
Oh, I want to walk like you
I want to cry with you
I want to feel the way you 
Feel the way you do

Lone Justice,"You can trip smug smiling in your worn-out shoes
Cast away the rhythm of eternity's fugue
Grapple with the tongue of hope till it abandons you
But you can't deny a gift

Falter at the well, making heroes out of ghosts
Stuffing yourself on thankless boasts
But I have faith in your withering soul
'Cause you can't deny a gift
Oh, no, you can't deny a gift

A gift of one and a gift to all
The wings to soar and not to fall
A gift of light in the abyss
Higher ground above the pit
The choice to live that is a gift
That is a gift, that is a gift, that is a gift

Though this gift lacks frivolous flair
It doesn't sparkle in the sun and requires little care
It's one of volume enough to spare
Throw down defense and we will share
Throw down defense and we will share

A gift of one and a gift to all
The wings to soar and not to fall
A gift of light in the abyss
Higher ground above the pit
The choice to live that is a gift
That is a gift, that is a gift, that is a gift

A gift of one and a gift to all
The wings to soar and not to fall
A gift of light in the abyss
Higher ground above the pit
The choice to live that is a gift
That is a gift, that is a gift, that is a gift
That is a gift, that is a gift, that is a gift

Lone Justice,"I was minding my business like a good girl should
Maybe a little too cautious for my own good
It was just like living life in the dark
Til something jumped up and it grabbed my heart

[Chorus]
I found love
I found real love

The beginning and end of every wish
Is balanced in the center of a vision like this
Maybe my emotions are inclined
To surrender to the notion of a glorious end

One touch souls speak
The power's got me and it won't let me be
It's too much this heat
I want to laugh cry jump for joy scream and shout
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

At the end of every tunnel there's a shining light

Lone Justice,"Nobody knows about inspiration
Where it may hide or it's destination
Forever seeking the fire of its presence
And when it finally hits in its struggles and fits
It's as precious as silence

What was bound in my soul
Has now burst beyond control
I can't contain it anymore
Your love drowns lonely cold
With the satisfying warmth of inspiration

I was spent, I lacked inspiration
Too many false attempts had only left me vacant
Potential trials, trapped in a crowded prison
But your love is bold enough to bring a mighty flow
To the driest river

What was bound in my soul
Has now burst beyond control
I can't contain it anymore
Your love drowns lonely cold
With the satisfying warmth of inspiration

All is alive, there is no distance
How my spirit longs for your inspiration
So fill me up, fill me up, fill me up
Oh, fill me, oh

Makes me wonder why I stay away

What made the sweet Georgia rain
Make me feel so warm

And he could lift me with one arm way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts with a quick turn of his wrench
And he pulled splinters from his hand and never even flinched

But the day that Grandpa died I realized

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think'll never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year, Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch they brought the helicopter in
Billy couldn't feel his legs, they said he'd never walk again
But Billy said he would and his Mom and Daddy prayed
And the day we graduated he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink, unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that

They were too broke to move to a greener location
Bills you can't pay put a strain on devotion

Was the salt and the lime

Said ""Daddy when you coming home""

Touched down in the land of the delta blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy, won't you look down over me?
'Cause I got a first class ticket and I'm as blue as a boy can be

I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Saw the ghost of Elvis down on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing waiting for the king
Down in the jungle room

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And reverend green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
You've got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays piano every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her and they asked me if I would
Do a little number and I sang with all my might
She said, ""Tell me are you a Christian child?""
And I said, ""Ma'am I am tonight""

Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale

On a pony she named Wildfire

And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down his stall
In a blizzard she was lost

I watch it go
The memory
Of how it feels

I can hear it now
It's so beautiful, it's hard
This [unverified]
Inside of me

I stumble, stumble down
From what was mine
I choke, I drown
With all fading out

The hills beneath
Can't fear them now
I watch it go
But it's out of reach

Is what we did
When all is told
What we do
When all is told

'Cause I can hear
And I have caused
I can feel
What's been lost

It turned so dark
On the way down
No, I can't do that
Can't do that

Never gonna let you down,
And I got it wrong like I knew I would, and I told you,

From the life I've lived and what I've seen
Nothing from nothing means nothing

And to my advantage I will stand ground 
Shake your hand like the ????? man around 
And your town kickin' you down for a minute

Beginning only to end it

But you still have to take to the streets and represent it
For each one to step off a street and represent it 
So you can sleep for each consecutive second 
That's independent from each hour

Nah your better off wishin' a lotto

Yes I go there everyday.
I try to be on point.
I live my own life.
I make my own rules, I open my own doors.
I hear the people think I am strange.
I'll do it my own way.
You see me on the streets, I go by many names.
My actions and my words make my momma say,
When your caught there's nothing you can do.""
""boy you better watch out cause I got my eyes on you.
This might be hard to understand, my friend.
When I got caught I didn't care.
Let the humble be ground and beneath thee feet, as they kill over colors
Love is not as simple as love on the streets, so don't cry for my brothers.

Better watch your back, try not to stay.
When the shit goes down you better be away.
So I got caught, I didn't care.
When the night falls it's time to say your prayers.
This one might be your lonely end, my friend.

This might be hard to understand.

This one might be your lonely end, my friend..my friend
This might be hard to understand my friend, my friend
This one might be your lonely end.

Luke was a poor boy
Work Very hard
He had to work very hard
He never had no money
Drew that card
Some say he drew that card
Then when day he woke up

In the morning and said to himself
Up off the ground
Cause I keep falling down

Is this the only way to pick myself
Luke was a struggler
Struggling all of the time
You know he never had no rhymes
All of the time
He never had no reason
Never no rhymes
In the morning and looked @ the sky
Then one day when he woke up
Is this the only way to pick myself
Cause I keep falling down
Up off the ground

That's when he realized
That everyone needs a piece of the pie
That's when Luke realized
Then when day he woke up
That everyone needs a piece of the pie
In the morning and said to himself
Is this the only way to pick myself
Up off the ground
Cause I keep falling down

Luke had anger, yes
Deep down inside
Deep down inside
Some say he walked that line
Walked that line
Then when day he woke up
In the morning and looked at the sky
Is this the only way to pick myself
Up off the ground

Cause I keep falling down
In the morning and said to himself
Then one day he woke up
Cause I keep falling downIs this the only way to pick myself

And if you drift away
I'll be there with bells on friend

Lacking all the journey flow

So climb to the top, see where you end

It's positions, where I am
The further demand, the fact of expanding
Your body's in my hands

The catch of the day, try running away
Where are you?

It's hard to let you know
To leave regret and make a road
And if you walk away
There's another road to take
Your path is being sold, coincidence is here again

Feelings rush back and unfold
Speeding, crashing, burning through
Memories in my mind of you

Gone so fast too fast to catch
Years have gone and can't come back
So now I've closed my eyes
Closing seconds of our time

See the shore light up night sky
See the beach swing summers high
August shower after heat
Smell of rain on dry concrete

Feel the air turn cold around
See leaves fall blur the ground
Wet road slide slither by
Catch reflections petrol sky

Will you wait here
It's coming around near

When I feel I can't move on
And my will is not so strong
Moments of uncertainty
Behind your smile I want to be

Down the front where we used to talk
Down the streets where we used to walk
These places I will be

Will you meet me?

Down by a cold frosty stream
Set down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses
Gentry I fell into a dream



I dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden
Such beauty I'd never saw before
Her dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses
So gree was the mantel she wore



He hair was of a dark brown color
Her teeth was as ivory so white
Her eyes they shined like sparking diamonds
Of stars than shine on a cold frosty night

With two empty arms and you on my mind
Heaven seemed so near while I was dreaming
It hurts to know you left me behind

I said, sir I'm not guilty of the crime you're accusing me

To tell the judge their verdict while I bowed to pray

    I heard my mother weepin' when the judge said, guilty son
    I'll have to give you life now for the crime that you have done
    She cried, don't take my darlin' he means the world to me
    He's all I have to live for, I pray you'll set him free


His father was a drunkard, went away left us alone
I washed to keep from starving and to raise our darling son
Now if you take him from me his face no more I'll see
Just put your son in his place his mother's here with me

The judge sat there with head bowed low, at first did not reply
And then I saw him wipin' a teardrop from his eyes

"Lonnie ""Pops"" Lynn","[Pops]
Hey, hey old bean
And you to baby sweetness
Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to wrestle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
He has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999
And kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
To love, to be able to give love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here
Talking about how nice is they ice
That they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
That was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture; beat that neighborhood
Which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or what kind of a man?
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
From when the world was starting brand new,
Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the underground railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree with The Roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination
And my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes
Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You will hear Big Will and Ms. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism
And you can't go right until you go left
And get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe
North to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I turn to the musical stylings of a Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky
That's when I turn to a Black Girl Named Betty
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't even exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children",Pops Rap III...All My Children,2000

Disorganized has the other file 
Bein flamboyant like ? herbal user, slash, barracuda 
with key maneuvers like silent troopers of styles 
?? to split your wig and nip your eyebrows 
Go to space and greet the stars, huh 
Started chewin on the Milky Way, thought it was the candy bar 
You get the gong cause we niggaz do wrong 
and if you're young, and in love, do the moves of Michael Evens 
singin songs, big up to my peoples Northside 
Show the brotherhood, how I recognize 



I've been, detonatin equivalyrical exposives 
Rambo soldiers deep like the black trials of Moses 
Madness and wisdom accelerates my pendulum 
No attackin my forces of life, cause I got ten of em 
Dangerous, disciple killin images 
My warfare dreads be just like Nemesis 
Infiltrates, holy massacres like ?tnakarid? 
My religion break down prisons for missionaries 
In it to survive, so enlist, in strategies 
My non-exist thinkin only lead, to casualties 
I'm battlin, invadin, interceptin 
Makin sure don't nuttin move in your section 
Don't misinterpret my threats as just talk 
and the raise of a hand can make, worlds start haltin 
The almighty, leavin Gods and nations lost 
Cause when my shit hits I leave holes like sawed-offs 



Yo, it's the Mad child layin verses like tile 
Niggaz go impotent, when I kick these potent ass freestyles 
Wack MC's get mad and look at me hard 
Cause they used to be the shit, like McDonald's on Broad 
It's odd, how niggaz try to bomb 
Then I be fadin more motherfuckers than AIDS story harvest 
Throwin niggaz away like apple cores - I don't want to see shit 
but some hits and Ed McMahon at my front door 
I'm rippin tapes, niggaz still makin SHIT cakes 
Slippin down to fall off dudes tryin to get they shit straight 
I'm tryin to get paid troop -- I want more G's 
than a girl named GiGi gaggin on some gin and garlic glue 
Niggaz think they hype, but they ain't touchin these 
Their styles plaid out like stripe cuffed Lee's 
Please! In ninety-five, I'ma be straight 
Stealin MC's like DJ's be stealin milk crates 
Ask Dre, can't nobody hack it, they ill Dre? 
You get beheaded with a motherfuckin hatchet 
Haste makes waste and taste the bass 
When you see me - you don't see me get the FUCK out my face

To them heads Raw Deal, rock the spot 
To Mike the Merciless, rock the spot 
To my brother Danja Mowf, rock the spot..",Unseen World,1995

Accidentally fell in love with you

I live a bachelors life
I never thought of getting a wife
Until I met this girl
That treat me so nice

I chose the one I need
I met the one who had the key
And unlocked my bachelors privacy

Accident, just an accident
Accidentally fell in love with you

I thought that I was smart
And showed everything I got
And finally discovered
Loving do not cover

Insurance on my car
Insurance on my home
When it comes to love
You're on your own

Accident, just an accident
Accidentally fell in love with you

Had a small collision
Because I didn't see the sign
You'd never know what happened
In this highway to love of mine

I met a lot of pretty women
I met a lot of pretty girl
And every one I met
Tried to change my world

Accident, just an accident
Accidentally fell in love with you

Accident, just an accident
Accidentally fell in love with you

You so doggone fine
I can't keep you off my mind
I should have known
That was a collision sign

Too many accidents

Just could not be prevent

And what you've been doing?
Who you've been seeing?
Why do you wanna hurt me again?

Only your love can set me free
Please forgive me if I did wrong
I can't take it any long

Swore to be true to each other
Yeah, true to the skies above
He was her man, wouldn't do her no wrong 
And Frankie and Johnny went walkin'

And Johnny had on a new suit
Yeah, Frankie spent one-hundred dollar notes
Just to make her man look cute
He was her man, he wouldn't do her no wrong 

Frankie went over to the barroom
Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
Has my lover Johnny man been here?

He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong. 
Yeah Frankie looked over the transom door
And then to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny

And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44

And through that hardwood (door) floor
Yeah she shot her man (yeah he was her man)
Well but he been doin' her wrong yeah

For killin' my lovin' son Johnny,

He's the only support that I've got,
'Cause you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong. 
Well the last time I seen Frankie
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell

She would be there moanin', herself
With no one there to care
She shot her man, a he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong 
Well bring out the overtime hearse all day long

You gotta bring out the pony and truck hey
They're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)
