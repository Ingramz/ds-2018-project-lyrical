Bing Crosby,"Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, 
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way.
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jing-jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, brruup
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way.

What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Bing Crosby,"Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way,
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side,
The horse was lean and lank,
Misfortune seemed his lot,
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upset.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell,
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song,
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.",Jingle Bells Swing,2001
Bing Crosby,"Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Tasty pheasants, Christmas presents
Countrysides covered with snow

Oh, by gosh, by jingle
It's time for carols and Kris Kringle
Overeating, merry greetings
From relatives you don't know

Then comes that big night
Giving the tree the trim
You'll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn

Oh, by gosh, by golly
It's time for mistletoe and holly
Fancy ties an' granny's pies
An' folks stealin' a kiss or two
As they whisper, ""Merry Christmas"" to you

Bing Crosby,"When I'm feeling blue and when I'm feeling low
Then I start to think about the happiest man I know
He doesn't mind the snow and he doesn't mind the rain
But all December you will hear him at your window pane
Singing again and again and again and again and again

Christmas is a coming and the bells begin to ring
The holly's in the window and the birds begin to sing
Now I don't take time to worry and don't take time to fret
And the more you give at Christmastime the more you get
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
The more you give at Christmastime the more you get

Christmas is a coming and the egg is in the nog
Please give a friendly man a friendly little dog
If you haven't got a friendly dog, a friendly cat'll do
If you haven't got a friendly cat, may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
If you haven't got a friendly, cat may God bless you

Christmas is a coming, the lights are on the tree
How about a turkey leg for poor old me
If you haven't got a turkey leg, a turkey wing will do
If you haven't got a turkey wing, may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
If you haven't got a turkey wing, may God bless you

Christmas is a coming and the cider's in the keg
If I had a mug of cider then I wouldn't have to beg
If you haven't got a mug of cider, half a mug will do
If you haven't got half a mug, may God bless you
God bless you, gentlemen, God bless you
If you haven't got half a mug, may God bless you
If you haven't got a thing for me, may God bless you",Christmas is a Comin',2001
Bing Crosby,"Small fry, strutting by the pool room
Small fry, should be in the school room
My, my put down that cigarette
You ain't grown up high and mighty yet

Small fry, dancing for a penny 
Small fry, counting up how many 
My, my just listen here to me
You ain't the biggest catfish in the sea
You practice pecking all day long to some old radio song

(Oh, yes, I peck, oh, yes)

Now you better listen to your pa
And someday practice upon the law
Then you'll be a real success
(Yes?)
Yes
(Well, yes)

Small fry, and now you kissed the neighbor's daughter
Small fry, get on back in the shallow water
Seems I should take you cross my knee
'Cause you ain't the biggest catfish in the sea
You've got your feet all soakin wet
Lord, you'll be the death of me yet
Oh, me, oh my, small fry

You call me small fry
(Oh, you is most infinitesimal, too small for your britches)
You call me small fry
(Now, now, now you look at here, you're shorter than me
I wonder where my smoke is)

My, my, my, my, my
I never heard such cannon
(Be still, boy)
You better look in the closet, Ma
I'll bet the chillies are gone

Oh, small fry I saw you out there betting on those ponies
(Tall fry, you know that you picked all the ponies)
My, my, my, my, now, you just listen here to me now
(I know, I know, I know, I know
I ain't the biggest catfish in the sea, you said that before)

You got a pina Kodak in your pocket
(What happened to Mars
Where in ring did you hock it? Oh, yes)
Oh, not so loud
(Oh yes)

You signed your own report card last night
Now didn't you?
(Well, why don't you learn how to write
And then you'll be a real success)
Yes, yes, well, yes

Small fry, now you kissed the neighbor's daughter
(Well, I gave her a small smack but quite happy
You the one who taught her)
Seems I should take you across my knee
Now you ain't the bigger cat fish in the sea

I know how to fix this boy
Is that casting all around here?
(I just slipped it in your beer)
Oh me, oh, my small fry",Small Fry,2001
Bing Crosby,"Far across the sea in Holland
In the land of wooden shoes
There's a story nearly everyone knows

You may never be in Holland
So I know you will excuse
If here and now I tell you how it goes

There's a little Dutch mill
On a little Dutch hill
Where the little Dutch stars shine bright

Now a little Dutch boy
And his little Dutch Girl
Fell in love by the mill one night

Up above, the Dutch moon made the scene complete
They both had so much moon, that it was a real Dutch treat

So the little Dutch boy and the little Dutch girl
Bought the little Dutch mill on the little Dutch hill
And they've added a touch of a little Dutch family

Up above, the Dutch moon made the scene complete
They both had so much moon, that it really was a real Dutch treat

So the little Dutch boy and the little Dutch girl
Bought the little Dutch mill on the little Dutch hill
And added a touch of a little Dutch family",Little Dutch Mill,2001
Bing Crosby,"Beautiful girl, you're a lovely picture
Beautiful girl, you're a gorgeous mixer
Of all that lives under those big blue skies

My heart cries, beautiful girl
You're a dazzling icon, beautiful girl
I could never travel if I have you
You'd be my dream come true

There may be blonds and brunettes that are hard to resist
You surpass them like a queen
You got those lips that were meant to be kissed
And you're over sweet sixteen

Oh, beautiful girl, what a gorgeous creature
Beautiful girl, let me call the preacher
What can I do but give my heart to you

If I could write like poets do
I sang my songs that's all to you
Beautiful girl, you're my desire

But when I search for words of praise
I'm like a schoolboy in a daze
When you come my way, this is all that I can say

Can't you see my heart just cry
Beautiful girl, you're a dazzling icon
Beautiful girl, I could never travel if I have you
You'd be my dream come true

There may be blonds and brunettes that are hard to resist
You surpass them like a queen
You got those lips that were meant to be kissed
And you're over sweet sixteen

Oh, beautiful girl, what a gorgeous creature
Beautiful girl, let me call the preacher
What can I do but give my heart to you

Bing Crosby,"Rosy cheeks and turned up nose and curly hair
I'm raving 'bout my baby now
Pretty little dimples here and dimples there
Don't want to live without her
I love her goodness knows
I wrote a song about her and here's the way it goes

Baby Face, you've got the cutest little baby face
There's not another one could take your place, Baby face
My poor heart is jumpin', you sure have started somethin'
Baby face, I'm up in heaven when I'm in your fond embrace
I didn't need a shove, 'cause I just fell in love
With your pretty baby face

When you were a baby not so long ago
You must have been the cutest thing
I can picture you at ev'ry baby show
Just winnin' ev'ry ribbon with your sweet baby way
Say, honest I ain't fibbin', you'd win 'em all today

Baby Face, you've got the cutest little baby face

Bing Crosby,"Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
I know it drives you crazy
When I pretend you don't exist
When I'd like to lean in close
And run my hands against your lips
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Don't worry I'm not looking at you 
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
Gorgeous and dressed in blue
Don't worry I'm not looking at you
I know you see me see you
As you see me walk on past
When there's nothing more I'd like to do
Then come in close and hear you laugh
Though we haven't even spoken
Still I sense there's a rapport
So whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Yea whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home
Hmm whisper me your number
I'll call you up at home",Whispering,2001
Bing Crosby,"I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems this is how the story ends
He's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long, I can see the way this ends
He's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?

Never again, through with love, through with men
They play the game without shame, and who's to blame?

I thought I'd found a man I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
He's gonna turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?

Why should I care?
Though he gave me the air
Why should I cry, heave a sigh and wonder why?

I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
I'll let him turn me down and say
Can't we be friends?",Can't We Be Friends?,2001
Bing Crosby,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind

Bing Crosby,"I'm so happy, happy-go-lucky me
I just go my way, living ev'ry day
I don't worry, worrying don't agree
Winter, Fall and Spring, I just smile and sing

Things that bother you, never bother me
I think ev'rything's fine
Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight
Having a glorious time

Haven't got a lot, I don't need a lot
Coffee's only a dime
Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight
Having a marvelous time

Just take it from me, I'm just as free as any dove
I do what I like, just when I like, and how I love it

I don't give a hoot, give my cares the boot
All the world is in rhyme
Living in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight
Having a wonderful time

I go swimming with pretty women
And I find life is divine
Swimming in the sunlight, swimming in the moonlight
Having a glorious time

When I'm stepping out with my runabout
How we step is a crime
Starting in the sunlight, ending in the moonlight
Having a marvelous time

I bet what I want, get what I want, once in a while
But if she says ""No!"", I let her go and keep on smiling

I'm right here to stay, when I'm old and gray
I'll be right in my prime
Chasing in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight
Having a wonderful time

I'm right here to stay, when I'm old and gray
I'll be right in my prime, ooh
Chasing in the sunlight, loving in the moonlight
Having a wonderful time","Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight",2001
Bing Crosby,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend
Without a song
That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no how
Without a song        
I got my trouble and woe but, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll        
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all
Without a song
I've-a got my trouble and woe and, sure as I know, the Jordan will roll
And I'll get along as long as a song, strong in my soul

Bing Crosby,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know

Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior 
Was born on Christmas Day 
To save us all from Satan's power 
When we were gone astray

(Oh tidings of comfort and joy)
(Comfort and joy)
(Oh tidings of comfort and joy)

And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn

Did nothing take in scorn

Bing Crosby,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things [Duet],2001
Bing Crosby,"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses 
One for every time you broke my heart 
And as the door of love between us closes 
Tears will fall like petals when we part 

I begged you to be different, but you'll always be untrue 
I'm tired of forgivin', now there's nothin' left to do 

So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses 
One for every time you broke my heart 

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through 
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you? 

So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses 
One for every time you broke my heart",Bouquet of Roses,2001
Bing Crosby,"Now, blue ain't the word for the way that I feel,
There's a storm brewin' in this heart of mine. 
This ain't no crazy dream, I know that it's real. 
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine!

[Chorus]
Crazy arms that seek to hold somebody new,
But my burnin' heart keeps sayin' you're not mine!
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed,
And that's why I'm lonely all the time.

Please take these treasured dreams I had for you and me,
And take all the love I thought was mine,
This ain't no crazy dream, I know that it's real,
And that's why I'm lonely all the time!

Bing Crosby,"Out where the bright lights are glowing

You laugh while the wine's overflowing
While I sit and whisper your name

Four walls to hear me
Four walls to see
Four walls too near me
Closing in on me

Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting
But my walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love not for hating
So here where you left me I'll stay

One night with you is like heaven
And so while I'm walking the floor
I listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on my door.

Hello window, (Hello, hello.)
Well, I see that you're still here.
Aren't you lonely,
Since our darlin disappeared? 
Well look here, is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that's it's rain. 

She went away and left us all alone the way she planned.
Guess we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can. 

Hello ceiling, (Hello, hello.) 
I'm gonna stare at you a while.
You know I can't sleep,
So won't you bear with me a while?

Bing Crosby,"Jealous heart, oh jealous heart stop beating
Can't you see the damage you have done
You have driven her away forever
Jealous heart, now I'm the lonely one

I was part of everything she planned for
And I know she loved me at the start
Now she hates the sight of all I stand for
All because of you, oh jealous heart

Jealous heart, why did I let you rule me
When I knew the end would bring me pain
Now she's gone, she's gone and found another
And I'll never see my love again

spoiled my act as a clown

That today was our last day
I said there'd be no sorrow, 
that I'd laugh when you walked away.

A little bitty tear let me down, 
spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, 
but a little bitty tear let me down.

I said I'd laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another waiting
And I'd wave goodbye as you go.

A little bitty tear let me down, 
spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, 
but a little bitty tear let me down.

Everything went like a planned it
And really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your *grip* through the door.

Flirting with the boys with all her charms

If you're looking for a wife.
'Cause Clifton Clowers has a pretty

And Wolverton Mountain protects her there.
The bears and birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there.

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain.
I want his daughter for my wife.
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clilfton Clowers, he may take my life

I'm gonna climb up on his mountain,

And birds are waiting to do their mating,
When eventide is nigh, moonbeams are descending,
The day is ending, a happy ending,
The sun is sinking below the western sky.

Every little breeze is sighing of love at sundown,
Every little bird is resting and feather nesting at sundown.
Each little rosebud is sleeping, while shadows are creeping,
In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown.
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven,
When night is falling and love is calling me home.

Daydreams through fields of clover, will soon be over,
And happy hours 'mid sunny flowers will wait another day,
Sweet dreams have just begun, dear, the day is done, dear,
When skies grow dimmer,
And stars will glimmer along the starlit way.

Charming and debonaire

In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""

What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand,
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land
Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation!

And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust""

Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes

Is it Eddy, is it Freddy? No, no no!
It is Heart, is it Shaptler, is it Mosteres

They day if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows).
Like a hot rasie.

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
(Rudolph is a red nose
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games).

Santa came to say,

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

And I've no doubt there's truth in what they say,
But sure a body's bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away.
And precious things are dreams unto an exile.
They take him o'er the land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Inisfree.
And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city, wondrous though it be,
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter.
I'm once again back home in Inisfree.

I wander o'er green hills through dreamy valleys
And find a peace no other land could know.
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow.
But dreams don't last
Though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back to stern reality.
But though they pave the footways here with gold dust,
I still would choose the Isle of Inisfree.",The Isle of Innifree,2002

Tell your troubles to and when you send a letter home your

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish
A new kind of jumped-up slippery fish

So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swing on a Star,2002

So no-one will suspect

While shiverin' in my shoes,

So no-one ever knows

The result of this deception
Is very strange to tell,
For when I fool the people I fear,
I fool myself as well!

I whistle a happy tune,
And every single time
The happiness in that tune
Convinces me that I'm
Not afraid.

Kicks up at anything he hears

Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo

And my stockin' sticks through

As a bird in a tree, life is a wonderful whim.
Look at the crank with his dough in the bank,
Don't you feel sorry for him?

Never gathering moss,
Ho Hum, ho ho ho ho Hum.

I often worry I guess

Whats a matter with me?

When there was earth to plow or guns to bear

With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread?

Made it race against time

Once I built a tower up to the sun

Dreaming of a song.

Is in the stardust of a song.

And when I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you
Weaving romances, making believe they're true

Oh, give me your lips for just a moment
And my imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give
A kiss to build a dream on

When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you
Weaving romances, making believe they're true

Bing Crosby,"[Chorus]
The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart! 

[Chorus]",My Foolish Heart,2004
Bing Crosby,"Don't whisper things to me you don't mean
For words deep down inside can be seen by the night
The night has a thousand eyes
And it knows the truth apart from one that lies

The romance may have cooled in the past
My love for you will be everlasting and bright
As bright as a starlit sky
And the wondrous night that has a thousand eyes

I've lived my life walking through a dream
For I knew that I would find this moment supreme
A night of bliss and tender sighs
And the smiling down of a thousand eyes

A night of bliss and tender sighs
And the smiling down of a thousand eyes

Bing Crosby,"It's somebody else's moon above, not mine
It's somebody else's night for love, not mine
A heart to someone else is a thing that melts
To me it's just a comic Valentine

Let somebody else's tear be shed, not mine
Let somebody else's nose get red, not mine

I like playing solitaire
But until I can draw a pair
It's somebody else's moon up there, not mine",Not Mine,2004

I love you, don't let us part

Your glances make my heart say ""How's chances?""
Come, be my own, come make your home in my heart

Let me sing a sunny song with crazy words that roll along
And if my song can start you laughing I'm happy, oh happy.
I want to sing a sad refrain of broken hearts who loved in vain,
And if my song can start you crying I'm happy.
Oh let me croon a low-down blues that lifts you out of your seat.
If my blues can reach your shoes and start you tapping your feet, I'm happy.

And if my song can make you homesick, I'm happy.",Let Me Sing and I'm Happy,2005

'You've got to get up, you've got to get up, 
You've got to get up this morning!'""

Someday I'm going to murder the bugler 
Someday they're going to find him dead 
I'll amputate his reveille and stomp upon it heavily 
And spend the rest of my life in bed!

He wakes the boys at five and then goes back to bed again 
He doesn't have to blow again until the afternoon

(Comet, and Cupid, and Donner and Blitzen)
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Is it Herman? (no)
Is it Shermon? (no)
Is it Eddy, is it Freddy? (no, no no!)
It is Heart, is it Shaptler, is it Mosteres?
(Oh, you'll never, never guess it, don't snap your cap)
Talkin' 'bout Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Oh, him
Had a very shiny nose
So I heard they say if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
Like a hot rasie

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
(Rudolph is a red nose)
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Hey Rudolph, I say Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer's loved him
And they shouted out with glee
(Rudolph, Rudolph, Rudolph)
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!

(Well, the stake glows bosset
His snarl snoot
His tuba that glow like a light-ta-root)
With his pink kazoo, he guided the sleigh
(He's a hero) 
Why, Rudolph saved the day

Rudolph has got his red nose
In the reign deer hall of fame
Rudolph the red nosed favorite
Of the little reign deer days
Rudolph the North Pole big shot
Rides around in Santa's sleigh
Wearin' a green Fedora
Smoking a cigar all day

(This story has a moral
Anyone can plainly see)
Just keep your red nose a gleemin'
You'll go down in history

Life's a four leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true

Long ago and far away

And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you",Long Ago and Far Away,2005

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?""
We'll say, ""No man""

Although we're few in numbers, we're the finest in the land
We play at wakes and weddings and at every fancy ball
And when we play the funerals, we play the March from Saul

Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band

Right now we are rehearsing for a very swell affair
The annual celebration, all the gentry will be there
When General Grant to Ireland came he took me by the hand
Says he, I never saw the likes of MacNamara's Band

Oh, the drums go bang and the cymbals clang and the horns they blaze away
McCarthy pumps the old bassoon while I the pipes do play
And Henessee Tennessee tootles the flute and the music is something grand
A credit to old Ireland is MacNamara's band

Oh, my name is Uncle Julius and from Sweden I did come
To play with MacNamara's Band and beat the big bass drum
And when I march along the street the ladies think I'm grand
They shout, there's Uncle Julius playing with an Irish band

Oh, I wear a bunch of shamrocks and a uniform of green
And I'm the funniest lookin' Swede that you have ever seen
There is O'Brians, O'Ryans, O'Sheehans and Meehans, they come from Ireland
But, by yimminy, I'm the only Swede in MacNamara's Band

Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my Bonnie bride.
The roses all have left your cheek.
I've watched them fade away and die
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes.

Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen
To where your heart will feel no pain
And when the fields are fresh and green
I'll take you to your home again!

I know you love me, Kathleen, dear
Your heart was ever fond and true.
I always feel when you are near
That life holds nothing dear, but you.
The smiles that once you gave to me
I scarcely ever see them now
Though many, many times I see
A dark'ning shadow on your brow.

Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen
To where your heart will feel no pain
And when the fields are fresh and green
I'll take you to your home again!

To that dear home beyond the sea
My Kathleen shall again return.
And when thy old friends welcome thee
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
Where laughs the little silver stream
Beside your mother's humble cot
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
There all your grief will be forgot.

And when the fields are fresh and green

The way your sip your tea

The way you haunt my dreams

Everything was plentiful, The Murphys, they're not slow.
They treated us like gentlemen, we tried to act the same,
If it weren't for what happened
Well, it was a doggone shame.

When Mrs. Murphy dished the chowder out, she fainted on the spot.
She found a pair of overalls at the bottom of the pot.
McGinty, he got roaring mad, his eyes were bulging out,
He jumped onto the piano and loudly he did shout

Nobody spoke, so he shouted all the louder,
""It's a rotten trick that's true, I can lick the drip that threw
The overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder.""

They dragged the pants from out the soup and laid them on the floor.
Each man swore upon his life, he'd ne'er seen them before.
They were plastered up with mortar and had patches on the knee,
They'd had their many ups and downs as we could plainly see.

And when Mrs. Murphy, she came to, she b'gan to cry and pout,
She'd put them in the wash that day and forgot to pull them out.

It was a most convenient door,
I found a million dollar baby
In a five and ten cent store.
The rain continued for an hour
I hung around for three or four
Around the million dollar baby
In the five and ten cent store.

She was selling china
And when she made those eyes,
I kept buying china
Until the crowd got wise.

Incidentally,
If you should run into a shower,
Well step inside my cottage door,
And meet the million dollar baby
From the five and ten cent store

Love comes along like a popular song
Anytime or anywhere at all,
Rain or sunshine,
Spring or fall.
Say, you'll never know when it may say hello
In a very unexpected place,
For example, take my case.

And it sure would be dandy
If we'd let him make a fee
So don't you linger
Here's the ring for your finger
Isn't it a humdinger?

Bring happy times
For Mandy and me

There will be some jubilation for the happy pair
Yes, the best in all creation, joy is in the air
There'll be music at the station
For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

Now we'll hear the wedding bells, soon we'll hear the baby yells

Down by the road on a green shady flat
Where Betsy got tired and lay down to repose
And Ike he just gazed on his Pike County rose

Well they soon reached the desert where Betsy gave out
Down in the sand she lay rollin' about
While Ike in great tears looked on in surprise
He said Betsy get up you'll get sand in your eyes
Well the Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died
The last piece of bacon that mornin' was fried
Ike he got discouraged and Betsy got mad

Upon a ridge he resred as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A-ploughin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw.

Yippy-I-Ay, yippy-I-oh!
A ghost herd in the sky!

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel,
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel.
O bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard , and he heard their mournful cry!

Yippy-I-Ay, yippy-I-oh!
Ghost riders in the sky!

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked with sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd, but they ain't caught them yet!
'Cause they've got to ride for ever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on hear them cry;

Yippy-I-Ay, yippy-I-oh!
Ghost riders in the sky!

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name,
""If you wanna save your soul from hell a-ridin' on this range,
Then cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride,
A-tryin' to catch the devil, sir, across these endless skies!"".

You will sit and watch the moonrise over Claddagh
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay

Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream
The women in the meadows making hay
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play

For the breezes blowing o'er the seas from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
And the women in the uplands digging praties
Speak a language that the strangers do not know

For the strangers came and tried to teach their way
They scorned us just for being what we are

But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams
Or light a penny candle from a star

And somehow I am sure there's going to be

That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear

But grant me
Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above

So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every homefire burning for

That's a magic sayin'

You'll find the boy who's meant for you.""

Doo, doo, doo doo, doo!) 

Would you like to hear the story, 
Of a girl that many soldiers know? 
It's a tale of love in all it's glory, 
They tell when the lights are soft an' low! 

Underneath the lamp post by the brigades 
Standing all alone every night you'll see her wait, 
She waits for a boy who marched away 
And though he's gone, she hears him say: 

""Oh promise you'll be true, 
Fare thee well Lili Marlene, 
'till I return to you, 
Fare thee well Lili Marlene!"" 

(This is the story of Lili Marlene!) 

With a kiss she gave her promise, 
To be constant as the stars above, 
Every soldier knows she's kept her promise, 
And she has been faithful to her love! 

(Underneath the lamp post by the brigade 
Standing all alone every night you'll see her wait, 
For this is the place a vow was made 
And breezes sing her serenade) 

""Oh promise you'll be true, 
Fare thee well Lili Marlene, 
'till I return to you, 
Fare thee well Lili Marlene"" 

(This is the story of Lili Marlene! 
Though wee stems have an ending, 
No one knows just what the end will be 
But tonight when twilight is descending, 
If you'll come along, here's what you'll see) 

Underneath the lamp post by the brigade 
Standing all alone every night you'll see her wait, 
And as they go marching to the fray 
The soldiers all salute and say: 

We'll tell him you've been true, 
Fare thee well Lili Marlene, 
'till he returns to you, 
Fare thee well

You won't believe me but I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intended to be independently blue

I want your love, but I don't wanna borrow
To have it today and to give back tomorrow

I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy Moon
What did you do

When they kissed, they tried to say
That it was just in fun

Look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know

That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed,

Bing Crosby,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And to you, your carol too you
And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
And God send you a Happy New Year",The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire),2006

Just the faithful and holy pair,
Lovely boy-child with curly hair,
Sleep in heavenly peace!

Love from your holy lips shines clear,
As the dawn of salvation draws near,
Jesus, Lord, with your birth!

Silent night! Holy night!
Brought the world peace tonight,
From the heavens' golden height
Shows the grace of His holy might
Jesus, as man on this earth!

Where today all the might
Of His fatherly love us graced
And then Jesus, as brother embraced.

As our Lord, free us of wrath,
Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

Bing Crosby,"Would you like to swing on a star?
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star?
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star?
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Swingin' on a Star,2006

The lights are turned way down low

Bing Crosby,"Well now, the barnyard is busy, in a regular tizzy
And the obvious reason is because of the season
Ma Nature's lyrical with her yearly miracle
Spring, Spring, Spring

All the henfolk are hatchin', while their menfolk are scratchin'
To ensure the survival of each brand new arrival
Each nest is twittering, they're all babysittering
Spring, Spring, Spring

Why, it's a beehive of budding son and daughter life
Every family has plans in view
Even down in the brook, the underwater life
Is forever blowin' bubbles too

Little skylarks are larking, see them all double-parking
Cuddled up, playin'possum, they're behind ev'ry blossom
Even the bubble-ink  
Is merrily wobble-ink
Spring, Spring, Spring

In his hole, though the gopher seems a bit of a loafer
The industrious beaver puts it down to Spring fever
While there's no antelope who feels that he can't elope
Spring, Spring, Spring

Each cocoon has a tenant, so they hung out a penant
Don't disturb please, keep waiting, we're evacuating
This home's my Mama's isle, soon have my own domicile
Spring, Spring, Spring

Even out in Australia, the kangaroos
Lay off butter fat and all French fries

If their offspring are large, it might be dan-ga-roos
Why, they've just got to keep them pocket-size

Even though, to detract, Spring is more like a habit
Not withstanding, the fact is they endulge in the practice
Why, each day is Mother's Day 
The next day some other's day
Spring, Spring, Spring

To itself, each amoeba softly glows ?
While the proud little termite fills his life as a worm might
Old papa dragonfly is makin' his wagon fly
It's Spring, Spring, Spring

And from his eerie, the eagle with his eagle eye
Gazes down across his eagle beak
And a-fixing his lady with a legal eye
Screams, ""Suppose we set the date this week""

Ah, yes siree, Spring discloses, if it's all one supposes
Wagging tails, rubbing noses, but it's no bed of roses
And if for the stork you pine, consider the porcupine
Who longs to cling
Keeping comp'ny is tricky, it can get pretty sticky
In the Spring, Spring, Spring",Spring Spring Spring,2006
Bing Crosby,"A police car and a screaming siren
A pneumatic drill and ripped up concrete
A baby wailing and stray dog howling
The screech of brakes and lamp lights blinking, I say that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

A smash of glass and the rumble of boots
An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth
Paint splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat
Lights going out and a kick in the balls, I say that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

Days of speed and slow time Mondays
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday
Watching the news and not eating your tea
A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls, I say that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays, that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway, that's entertainment.

That's entertainment

Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude
Getting a cab and traveling on buses
Reading the graffiti about slashed seat affairs,I say that's entertainment.

If you keep on believing

Bing Crosby,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

Bing Crosby,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.

If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues,2007

When a poor man came in sight
Gathering winter fuel

Hither, page, and stand by me,
If thou knowst it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I shall see him dine
When we bear them thither.
Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude winds wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps, good my page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shall find the winters rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his masters step he trod
Where the snow lay dinted

Which the Saint had printed

Shall yourselves find blessing.",Good King Wenceslas/We Three Kings/Angels We Have Heard on High,2007

To Eastern Pennsylvania or Japan

And scamper off to Trinidad

In the West the natives grow up 
And I guarantee you go nuts if you come

You can ride a bucking bronco or a pony 
You can cut a calf in half and make baloney 
Go West! Young Man 
Go right up there and give 'em the very best you can 
Don't go east, don't go south, don't go north, have a care 
Don't go up, don't go down, don't go here, don't go there 
If it's true what they say about Dixie 
Go West! Young Man 

Go out and till the soil there 
Dig for gold and you'll find oil there 
Where the crow flies, where the snow flies, go, there's no ""no""! 
If you are fond of hunting there's no place that can compare 
You may not bag a lion or a tiger or a bear 
But if you want a jack-ass there are plenty of them there

Who was the hippest chick in town.
They call her Big Noise from Winettka.
Miss Birdie's sure to get around.
Big Noise flew in from Winnetka,
Stole each fellow's heart and then
Big Noise flew in from Winnetka,
Big Noise flew right out again.
Stop! Look! Listen! Here comes the Big Noise!
Stop! Look! Listen! Here comes the Big Noise!

I am the one they call the Big Noise.
I'm looking fine and feeling sharp.
I just flew in from Winnetka, don't you know?
I'm gonna blow this joint apart!

I got my high heels! I don't need no wheels!
My footwork is an art!
You know the joint is jumpin',
My heart is pumpin',
And this is just the start!
Whoa! I was a big noise from Winnetka,
I'll be a big noise in your heart!
Whooooa!

Tempting when she's talkin'!

To turn chicken shit in to chicken salad. 
Make no mistake about it, eggs will be laid tonight! 
Ain't that right girls? Oh, my girls. 
My three favorite schochkies on the breakfront of life. 
I'll never forget the first time I found these girls, 
Selling their papayas on 42nd Street. So flushed, so filthy. 
The astonishing verbal abuse they heaped upon me made me certain 
We were destined to share the stage someday. 
Not only are my girls fine singers and dancers, 
Not only are they gorgeous and talented, 
But they also think I'm god! 
Ain't that right, girls? 
They function as a greek chorus. 
These girls don't know shit about Euripides, 
But they know plenty about Trojans. 
Ladies and gentlemen, a rousing hand for the semi-classical 
Harlettes! Laides! 
Alright girls, sing 'em your siren song, go ahead. 
Turn them men into pigs. Not the band, you idiots. 
Those, that bunch right over there in the front row. 
Not much of a challenge, huh? 
This group is already well on its way to oink oink land. 
Oops, so sorry. Once again behaving in a manner I had sworn to aschew. 
Thank you. Once again falling into the vat of vulgarity. 
Oh tut tut. I did so want to leave my sordid past behind and emerge 
Form this project beathed in a new and ennobling light. 
I wanted to come out and be the sweet, pure, honest, 
Unadorned person that I really really am. 
I wanted to show you the good beneath the gaudy, 
The saint beneath all this paint, the sweet, pure, 
Winsome little soul that lurks beneath this lurid exterior. 
But fortunately, just as I was about to rush down the path 
To repectability and righteousness, 
A wee small voice called out to me in the night 
And reminded me of the motto by which I've always tried to live my life: 
F$CK 'EM IF THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE!""

[From the soundtrack:] ""Hi! ""After many a summer dies the swan,""

Everyone loves a little sin.

Only cared for football
Never mind the knowledge
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
Never mind the sheepskin
They preferred the pigskin
Seemed to have it in their bones
Yeah, they knew all about it
Couldn't do without it
All except a certain Mr. Jamboree Jones
And he played the clarinet with all his might
He studied night and day, he practiced day and night
No runnin' up the field for Mr. Jones
He'd rather run up the scale and down the scale,
What tones.

Even though his buddies
Always cut their studies
To attend the rallies
(Rah, Rah, Rah)
While they all were rootin'
You could hear him tootin'
""What's become of Sally""
(Rah, Rah, Rah)

How they used to hate him
Co-eds wouldn't date him
Thought he was an awful bore
Oh, but he liked his rhythm
More than being with 'em
So he'd only turn in
For to practice some more

And meanwhile the team marched on to greater fame
Till they were asked to play that famous Rose Bowl game
And on that day of days the students beamed
What did they do when the team marched on the scene
I want to tell you ladies and you gentlemen, they screamed.

But they couldn't win it

Instead of goin' forwards
They were goin' backwards

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

They called intermission
And they heard the referee say
Hey, seventeen to nothin'
Ain't exactly nothin'

And you've only got about a minute to play
And then from the stand there came a distant wail
And it was Jamboree a-swingin' ""Hold 'em Yale""
(Bula, bula, bula)

The players marched up the field
And down the field, pell mell.

Bing Crosby,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada
For soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Habanera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday romantic and gay.",Granada,2008

I think about a night
When the earth smelled of summer

There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I
Are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom and me

Hello Young lovers whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down a street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone

That would bore me terrific'ly too

I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. 
What an infantile idea. 
What a heartless,
Wicked, brainless thing to do. 
But she'll regret it. It's
Doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely gray,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, ha!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to the trace,
Of something in the air,

Taking a chance on love

Now I prove again
That I can make life move again
I'm in a groove again
Taking a chance on love

I walk around with a horseshoe
In clover I lie
And brother rabbit of course you
Better kiss your foot good-bye

On that ball again
I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again

Bing Crosby,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

The folks are throwing shoes and rice

It's all about the Devil and I've learned to hate him so

Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

When you are unhappy, the Devil wears a grin
But oh, he starts a-running when the light comes pouring in
I know he'll be unhappy 'cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling he'll get tired of hangin' around

So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Smilers never lose and frowners never win
So, let the sun shine in, face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in

But he feels so awful, awful, when he sees me on my knees

Just open up your heart and let the sun shine in

Is the wish of Barney and Ben

Is the hope of Janice and Jen

Figured the way to get paid is to grab the mic rehearse ya know
Smooth as jermaine so honey don't take it personal
There's no need to try to diss the swinger
Baby all you get is two snaps up and the finger
 
The bob-a-loo bad boy a threat to the paranoid
You try to step to this? it's void
A new hit from the grand man with nights like the sandman
Gain for awake in case I gotta stomp a head out
 
Busted is a trick that's not up my sleeve
It's possessed with finesse and it works when I breathe
Paid in the shade with an a that's the grade

This is la vie en rose
When you kiss me heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Everyday words seem
To turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be

Bing Crosby,"It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from Heaven's all gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

And He beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours, come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing
And hear the angels sing

Who gives you that 'Hi baby'?

Something that used to be
Everyday, while I'm away

I could hear somebody singing a familiar tune
So I stopped a while to listen

There's a minister handy
And it sure would be dandy
If we'd let him make a fee
So don't you linger
Here's the ring for your finger
Isn't it a humdinger?
Come along and let the wedding chimes
Bring happy times
For Mandy and me

There will be some jubilation for the happy pair
Yes, the best in all creation, joy is in the air
There'll be music at the station
For to speed them on their way
There will be some celebration on their wedding day

Now we'll hear the wedding bells, soon we'll hear the baby yells

For the G.I. Josephs who were in the war
But for generals things were not so grand
And it's not so hard to understand

What can you do with a general
When he stops being a general?
Oh, what can you do with a general who retires?

Who's got a job for a general
When he stops being a general?
They all get a job but a general no one hires

They fill his chest with medals while he's across the foam
And they spread the crimson carpet when he comes marching home
The next day someone hollers when he comes into view
""Here comes the general"" and they all say ""General who?""
They're delighted that he came
But they can't recall his name

Nobody thinks of assigning him
When they stop wining and dining him
It seems this country never has enjoyed
So many one and two and three and four star generals

Bing Crosby,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,2013

And coyotes are makin' a wail

Along the Navajo Trail

When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star

Well whatta ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale
It's time to climb into my saddle

So I heard they say if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
Like a hot rasie

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
(Rudolph is a red nose)
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Hey Rudolph, I say Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer's loved him
And they shouted out with glee
(Rudolph, Rudolph, Rudolph)
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!

(Well, the stake glows bosset
His snarl snoot
His tuba that glow like a light-ta-root)
With his pink kazoo, he guided the sleigh
(He's a hero) 
Why, Rudolph saved the day

Rudolph has got his red nose
In the reign deer hall of fame
Rudolph the red nosed favorite
Of the little reign deer days
Rudolph the North Pole big shot
Rides around in Santa's sleigh
Wearin' a green Fedora
Smoking a cigar all day

(This story has a moral
Anyone can plainly see)
Just keep your red nose a gleemin'
You'll go down in history

(If you keep you nose a red, red rose)
If you keep your beak all pink and sleek
And if you keep your snooze maroon because
You'll go down in history",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,2015

And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay

For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
And the women in the uplands diggin' prates
Speak a language that the strangers do not know

For the strangers came and tried to teach us their way
They scorned us just for being what we are
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams
Or light a penny candle from a star

And faith I am sure there's going to be

Turn them men into pigs. Not the band, you idiots. 
Those, that bunch right over there in the front row. 
Not much of a challenge, huh? 
This group is already well on its way to oink oink land. 
Oops, so sorry. Once again behaving in a manner I had sworn to aschew. 
Thank you. Once again falling into the vat of vulgarity. 
Oh tut tut. I did so want to leave my sordid past behind and emerge 
Form this project beathed in a new and ennobling light. 
I wanted to come out and be the sweet, pure, honest, 
Unadorned person that I really really am. 
I wanted to show you the good beneath the gaudy, 
The saint beneath all this paint, the sweet, pure, 
Winsome little soul that lurks beneath this lurid exterior. 
But fortunately, just as I was about to rush down the path 
To repectability and righteousness, 
A wee small voice called out to me in the night 
And reminded me of the motto by which I've always tried to live my life:

I haven't got a great big yacht
To sail from shore to shore
Still I've got plenty to be thankful for

I've got plenty to be thankful for
No private car, no caviar
No carpet on my floor
Still I've got plenty to be thankful for

I've got eyes to see with
Ears to hear with
Arms to hug with
Lips to kiss with
Someone to adore

How could anybody ask for more?
My needs are small, I buy 'em all
At the five and ten cent store
Oh, I've got plenty to be thankful for

I've got eyes to see with
Ears to hear with
Arms to hug with
Lips to kiss with
Someone to adore

Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"One minute to midnight
One minute to go
One minute to say good-bye
Before we say hello

Let's start the new year right
Twelve o'clock tonight
When they dim the light
Let's begin

Kissing the old year out
Kissing the new year in

Let's watch the old year die
With a fond good-bye
And our hopes as high
As a kite

How can our love go wrong if
We start the new year right?

Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"Long time no see,
Baby, what's the reason I get the go by
Like to know why long time no see
Long time adore
If you're on the level why don't you tell me
Why me no see you any more
Let him go, let him go
Ev'ryone keeps tellin' me
But my heart can no agree
Guess my heart knows best
And the rest is up to you
Honestly, am I just a fool for stringin' along
Oh baby what's wrong
Long time no see

Long time no see
Baby, what's the reason I get the go by
Like to know why long time no see
Long time oh I adore
If you're on the level why don't you tell me
Why me no see you any more, more, more
Let him go, let him go, let him go, let him go
Ev'ryone keeps tellin' me
But my heart can no agree
Ra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You, me no see, what can it be
Maybe I'm crazy, but long time no see

Ra-ra-ra long time no see
What's the reason I get the go by
Like to know why long time no see
Me love you, you love who
Is it yes or is it noo
Do I stay or do I goo
I'd be in a stew if you ever said we're through
What to do
If you loved me the way that I love you
It wouldn't be, it wouldn't be
Long time no see
It could be true that I love you
I miss you so, long time no see",Long Time No See,2008
Bing Crosby & the Bob Crosby Orchestra,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
 
Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
