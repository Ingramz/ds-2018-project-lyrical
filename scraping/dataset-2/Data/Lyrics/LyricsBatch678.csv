Astrud Gilberto,"Who needs forever?
Love me today, let's forget tomorrow
It's too far away, so hold me, don't waste this moment
Let's live this moment like it's the last
Time goes so fast

Love shouldn't linger, love shouldn't wait
When fates allow a choice of now or never
Who needs forever?

Love shouldn't linger, love shouldn't wait
When fates allow a choice of now or never
Who needs forever?
Forever, forever

",Who Needs Forever?,1996
Astrud Gilberto,"Podem me chamar e me pedir e me rogar
E podem mesmo falar mal, ficar de mal que não faz mal

Podem preparar milhões de festas ao luar
Que eu não vou ir, melhor nem pedir, que eu não vou ir, não quero ir
E também podem me intrigar e até sorrir e até chorar
E podem mesmo imaginar o que melhor lhes parecer

Podem espalhar que estou cansado de viver
E que é uma pena para quem me conheceu
Eu sou mais você e eu

Podem espalhar que estou cansado de viver
E que é uma pena para quem me conheceu
Eu sou mais você e eu",Você E Eu,1998
Astrud Gilberto,"É o pau, é a pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um caco de vidro, é a vida, é o sol
É a noite, é a morte, é um laço, é o anzol
É peroba no campo, é o nó da madeira
Caingá candeia, é o matita-pereira

É madeira de vento, tombo da ribanceira
É o mistério profundo, é o queira ou não queira
É o vento vetando, é o fim da ladeira
É a viga, é o vão, festa da ciumeira
É a chuva chovendo, é conversa ribeira
Das águas de março, é o fim da canseira
É o pé, é o chão, é a marcha estradeira
Passarinho na mão, pedra de a tiradeira

É uma ave no céu, é uma ave no chão
É um regato, é uma fonte, é um pedaço de pão
É o fundo do poço, é o fim do caminho
No rosto um desgosto, é um pouco sozinho

É um estepe, é um prego, é uma conta, é um conto
É um pingo pingando, é uma conta, é um ponto
É um peixe, é um gesto, é uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manha, é o tijolo chegando
É a lenha, é o dia, é o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana, o estilhaço na estrada
É o projeto da casa, é o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado, é a lama, é a lama

É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato na luz da manhã
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração

É uma cobra, é um pau, é João, é José
É um espinho na mão, é um corte no pé
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração
É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte, é uma febre terça
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração",Aguas de Marco,1998
Astrud Gilberto,"Amor a primeira vista
Amor de primeira mão
É ele que chega cantando, sorrindo
Pedindo entrada no coração
O nosso amor já tem patente
Tem marca registrada, é amor que a gente sente
Eu gravo até em disco todo esse meu carinho
Todo mundo vai saber o que é amar certinho
Esse tal de amor não foi inventado

Foi negócio bem bolado 
Direitinho pra nós dois, foi ou não foi?

Astrud Gilberto,"Aos pés da Santa Cruz 
Você se ajoelhou 
E em nome de Jesus 
Um grande amor você jurou 

Jurou mas não cumpriu 
Fingiu e me enganou 
Pra mim você mentiu 
Pra Deus você pecou 

O coração tem razões 
Que a própria razão desconhece 
Faz promessas e juras depois esquece 

Seguindo esse princípio 
Você também prometeu 
Chegou até a jurar um grande amor 
Mas depois esqueceu",Aos Pés da (Santa) Cruz,1998

Astrud Gilberto,"Vai minha tristeza
E diz a ela
Que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece que ela regresse
Porque eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade, a realidade é que sem ela

Não há paz, não há beleza, é só tristeza
E a melancolia que não sai de mim
Não sai de mim, não sai
Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços os abraços hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio de viver longe de mim
Não quero mais esse negócio de você viver assim
Vamos deixar desse negócio de você viver sem mim
Não quero mais esse negócio de você viver assim",Chega de Saudade,1998
Astrud Gilberto,"Se você pretende sustentar opinião
E discutir por discutir
Só para ganhar a discussão
Eu lhe asseguro, pode crer
Que quando fala o coração
As vezes é melhor perder
Do que ganhar, você vai ver

Já percebi a confusão
Você quer ver prevalecer
A opinião sobre a razão
Não pode ser, não pode ser
Pra que trocar o sim por não
Se o resultado é solidão
Em vez de amor uma saudade
Vai dizer quem tem razão

Eu lhe asseguro, pode crer
Que quando fala o coração
As vezes é melhor perder
Do que ganhar, você vai ver

Já percebi a confusão
Você quer ver prevalecer

Não pode ser, não pode ser
Pra que trocar o sim por não

Vai dizer quem tem razão",Discussão,1998
Astrud Gilberto,"Doralice eu bem que te disse
Amar é tolice, é bobagem, ilusão

Agora amor, Doralice meu bem

Um belo dia você me surgiu
Eu quis fugir mas você insistiu
Alguma coisa bem que andava me avisando

Astrud Gilberto,"Olha, esta mulata quando dança
É luxo só

Quando todo o seu corpo se embalança

Que faz a confusão

O que ela não tem, meu Deus 
É compaixão, eita mulata bamba

Olha esta mulata quando dança
É luxo só

Quando todo o seu corpo se embalança
É luxo só

Porém seu coração quando se palpita
E agita se mais ligeiro
Nunca vi compasso tão Brasileiro

Cai pra cá, cai pra lá

Astrud Gilberto,"Este seu olhar
Quando encontra o meu
Fala de umas coisas
Que eu não posso
Acreditar

Doce é sonhar
É pensar que você
Gosta de mim
Como eu de você

Mas a ilusão
Quando se desfaz
Dói no coração
De quem sonhou
Sonhou demais
Ah! Se eu pudesse entender
O que dizem os seus olhos",Este Seu Olhar,1998

Há sempre um homem, para uma mulher

And having wept
Can weep no more
But still it cries for me

There was a time
When you were mine
An' not so long ago
I used to say
You'd never go away
You'd never leave me lonely 
Don't leave me baby!

Think about the happy times
The groovy times
Don't tell me they are gone
I just can't carry on an'
And know that you're not here

Astrud Gilberto,"Holiday Celebrate 
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice

Everybody spread the word
Were gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation
Its time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come togheter
To release the pressure
We need a holiday

Astrud Gilberto,"They say that I was born
Of slave Mogama and white man
My father slept in iron bed,
My mother on cold sand
When my father called
My mother would come
Never said a word
As if she were dumb
A woman who will talk too much
Is soon to lose her man

They say God made man first
And made a woman second choice
And so that's why woman should
Obey her master's voice
When the man is hungry
She bakes the bread
When man is cold
She warms up the bed
Standing up or laying down
The woman has to work
They say poor man wakes early
And he works until it's night
The rich man wakes up late
And tells the poor man what is right
So the poor prays to Shango up above
So the rich will lose the money they love
But rich or poor the woman has
To work for both of them",Maria Quiet,1998
Astrud Gilberto,"Stay, and we'll make such sweet music. 

Come hear the lovebird, he's just out the window.
We'll hear the night sing and bathe in a star glow,
and we'll feel the breeze blow slow warmth.

So, stay, and we'll make such sweet music.
 
Everything changes, there's light when the world's dark,
Moments have silence, but we hear a skylark.
We both hear a skylark in tune.

For time is running, take everything life can bring you.
You know it's true so take it, even fake it 'til it comes true.

Stay, and we'll make such sweet music.

You ask the reason, the night has the answer.
Bring me your free soul, and I'll make your heart sure.
We'll both feel so heart sure, so stay, so stay.....

",Stay,1998
Astrud Gilberto,"Listen to the wailing of the willows,
Listen to me crying on my pillow
Crying cause I know my love is gone from me

Living in a world of different places, 
Looking at a million different faces
Yet I see a face in every face I see      
Love must lack a sense of humor, 

It laughs when other people cry
Love, would love to hear the rumor, 
That you and I have finally said goodbye

I know that every heart was made for breaking
And my love was ready for the takin',
Still I won't complain for someday love will call again

Must I take a memory as a token,
To replace a heart that love has broken
Will the wailing willow always weep for me
Must I see a face in every place I see
Listen to the wailing of the willow tree",Wailing on the Willow,1998
Astrud Gilberto,"Look out the window when that rain storm
I let the wind blow up a brain storm
And now I'm wondering
Whether weather like this gets you too

It may go on like this for hours
Too late in fall for April showers
So what we got here, got a thought or two
I need to share with you, here goes

Darling, tell me now
Have I done wrong somehow
That you won't look at me
Need it pointed out
Can't keep my wits about
When you won't look at me

Is there something I oughta know?
You're finding hard to say
Well, there's just a trace
Hiding on your face
And I've learned it that way

Just another soul
That really knows my soul
And you won't look at me
Does that take the prize?
How much I love those eyes
And they won't look at me

Now the rain has gone
But something lingers on
There's certain sadness here
Now that the sky is clear
And it's so, so clear
Yes, it's all so clear to me now

And I can't help but fear
That certain sadness here to stay

",A Certain Sadness,1998
Astrud Gilberto,"Olha que coisa mais linda
Mais cheia de graça
É ela, menina
Que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço
A caminho do mar

Moça do corpo dourado
Do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ah, por que estou tão sozinho?
Ah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo inteirinho se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo
Por causa do amor

Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes ooh

(Ooh) But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Astrud Gilberto,"On the day I was born, 
said my father, said he,
I've an elegant legacy 
waiting for ye.
Tis a rhyme for your lips 
and a song for your heart,
To sing whenever the world falls apart.

Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow it over the hill and stream.
Look, look, look to the rainbow.
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.
Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,
Follow the fellow who follows a dream.

'Twas a sumptuous gift bequeathed to a child.
Oh, the lure of that song 
Kept her feet running wild.
For you never grow old and you never stand still
With a whippoorwill singing beyond the next hill.

So, I bundled me heart and I roamed the world free.
To the east with the lark
Tow the west with the sea.
And I searched all the world and I scanned all the skies.
But I found it at last in my own true love's eyes.",Look to the Rainbow,1998

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold

Ages ago last night?

On merely this, a look, a kiss

Could slip away in one little daybreak

The arms that clung

Porque quem dá mesmo não diz

No canto de Ossanha, traidor
Coitado do homem que vai

Se é canto de Ossanha, não vá
Que muito vai se arrepender

Pergunte pro seu Orixá
O amor só é bom se doer

Do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado é mais que um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar

Ah, porque estou tão sozinho
Ah, porque tudo é tão triste
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo inteirinho se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo
Por causa do amor",Garota de Ipanema,2005

Que fala tanto e não diz nada
Ou quase nada

Já me utilizei de toda a escala 
E no final não sobrou nada
Não deu em nada
E voltei pra minha nota como eu volto pra você

Anywhere you try to hide I’ll find
'Cause I know you and I need you
But all I really want just can't have

There's that feeling once again, yes I’m fine
But you don’t care

I just want to wake you and deflate you
But you wanna stay in your filthy sty
And I’m gonna wash you what’d I tell ya
Everybody else just wants to pry

Feeling numb in my dreams at night
Come and meet me there's till light

Right time and I found you
It’s not really hard to read your lies
I don’t wanna fight you but I try to
'Cause I don’t wanna leave you in my mind

Courage rooted deep inside
Can you make it every time?

I just wanna hate you, cause I blame you
If I only saw it in your eyes
But I just can’t fight it, cause I like it
I just wanna feel you in my arms

I’ll find my way tonight
All the sorrow of tomorrow
Only stain my life
The river turns to rain
Conversation, fragmentation of my days
I’ll make it I can see
Mass redemption and salvation
At what cost?

Feeling numb in my dreams at night

Woman, This isn’t just a bedtime story
Words of love in all its glory
Just for tonight , no no no
Woman, this isn’t just a chance occasion
Silken words of sweet persuasion
This feeling is real
Other men have hurt you
I can see it in your eyes
You’re inclined to think my words are lies
If I say I love you
Then it’s not to ease your mind 
Try to erase all the past 
And you will find

Woman, This isn’t just a bedtime story
Won’t you make an effort for me
And try to believe 
Can’t you trust me 
Woman
You still doubt my motivation
This is more than a conversation
I’ve fallen in love

Woman 
This isn’t just a bedtime story
Words of love in all its glory
Just for tonight,
Woman
If we spend this night together
We can make it last forever

Nothing is-a making sense for me and you
But maybe if we find a way, there is got to be the solution
How to make a brighter day? What do we do?

We've got to give a little love, have a little hope
Let's make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

Only we can make it better
Only if we try

Got the words on our minds, got the troubles on our shoulders
Sometimes it just seems so much what we go through
But maybe if we take the time, time to understand each other
We can learn to make it right, what do we do?

We've got to give a little love, have a little hope
Let's make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

Only we can make it better
Only if we try
Only we can make it better
Only if we try

If everybody took somebody by the hand
Then maybe everyone could learn to love and understand

You should of given more, more than you left for me. 
Your vices won't weight me down tonight. 

If you could have untied that weight from your leg,

Made him wake up from his dreams

Setting out for the land of disgrace
To kill the master and stop the raids

He left his town to a place unknown

The crown tumbling from his horse

Keep the flame forever in your heart

On his tireless horse

Never deviating from his course

Where the air was filled whit haze
And it made his flesh creep
Where the trees had no leaves

And tearing down these walls
In search for glory

Torn branches covering the floor

I surrender to your heart babe
Do anything that you want me to do

This is a feeling I never knew
You know I tried to make it on my own
That's not the way it was meant to be
Spend my time waiting by the phone
Oh, darling come back to me

I surrender, I surrender
I'm giving up the role of pretender
Oh be tender, girl be tender
Can't you feel the love that I send her
I surrender

I Remember, seems like a liftime
Can't believe it's a matter of days
Since you left me, oh, I'm near to heartbreak
I want you so bad don't turn away
What does it take to stay by my side
You know I'll do what you want me to
Don't take away this feeling inside
I'm still in love with you

Why is your fire burning so low
Did you lose all your faith
Did you forget 'bout the dreams that we had

Why don't you lend me helping hand

Only human, I am only human
Why must you be fooling
Cause I gave you my heart and my soul

Did you expect me to pay all your dues
Why did you gamble whit all we had to lose
Now that we're lost and the sky's closing in
We ruled a game that we couldn't win
Building a castle whit our sweat and our blood
Stone after stone and our clothes stained whit me

Noting to hard and our forces unite
But we've torn apart and we've killed our light
What about all the dreams that we had
Why did you trade in the good for the bad
Wasn't it worth to take hold of the flame

Atahualpa Yupanqui,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo

Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes

Hey, we could go anywhere but down.

I'm walking down your street
Again and past your door
But you don't live there any more

It's years since you've been there
But now you've disappeared
Somewhere like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you like the deserts miss the rain
Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead of everyone

We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
Back on the train, I ask why did I come again?

Can I confess I've been hanging around your old address?
The years have proved to offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone but I can't move on

And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you, like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you

I'm walking down your street

The doubts you harbor then you might 
Come to believe in me

That you can believe in me 

Those other loves that came before 
Mean nothing to me anymore

Failing to trust what they feel 
But trust isn't something that's spoken

Ay, ya no sé lo que siento en la garganta,
Ay, ya ni sé lo que rueda en mi cabeza.

Viéndose morir en mi regazo,
Ella se fué una tarde,
Puso su carita entre las alas,
No volará en la noche.
Ya no será más los ojos

Ay, yo no sé lo que siento
En las orejas,
Ay, ya no sé por qué me
Tiemblan las piernas.

Why yo desmembré su corazón,
Ella me entregó el mundo,
Why yo me quedé petrificado,
No volará en la noche.

Una jaula,
Ay, no llegó a quererme
Con el alma,

Athena Cage,"It's the chance of life, get ready, set, fly, high 
Above the fear of your mind 
Go for it, it's hit or miss
Too late for you to quit 
You gotta show 'em how bad you really want this 

Live your dreams, it's not as hard as it may seem 
You gotta work to get the cream 
On your hopes you must lean 
From your fears, you have to win yourself
It's all or nothing, Give your everything 

Are what you believe, you've got to bring the dreams 
Set the pace, let competitions take the lead 
This is it, all eyes on you
So stay on point and prove
That you deserve, what's long overdue 

Live your dreams, it's not as hard as it may seem 
You gotta work to get the cream
On your hopes you must lean
From your fears, you have to win yourself 
It's all or nothing,give your everything 

The hardest to recovery
From the heartbreak of another kind 
I'm still drying my tears 
Getting over my own fears 
In my life, so I want to make sure this time
That I'm strong enough 
To give it my all 

So you have got to live your dreams 
So don't you be afraid 
Just set the pace, and take the lead 
It's your time to shine",All or Nothing,2000

Athena Cage,"We were like two birds flying so high as the clouds
We were so silly in love
But things changed you became possessive
You're not the man I used to know

Why did you change on me
Think about your mama
Before you take me low
Treat me with respect 

That should be the way it goes
I know you're not my daddy
I refuse to be controlled
Treat me with respect

That should be the way it goes (chorus)
Think before you disrespect me
Think before you play your silly games
Think before you scream at me
Think before you call me out my name
You better think about every little thing

That you do to me
Cause a stone'll happen to you

[Chorus]
Think before you cheat on me
Think before you take her home tonight
Think before you say your sorry
Think before it's too late, stop wasting time
Better think about every little thing

That you do to me
'Cause a stone'll happen to you 

[Chorus: x 2]

Boy I won't be with you if you won't respect me
Will never happen so you better think
If you treat me right I'm gon make you happy

But you gave it a shot, and look what you got

More beauty then I've seen before no secret lover

The parallels of our disguise

Can understand my point of view
Color me blue
As you

As you
With you now I've come to find
That my love for you was blind
Was it the depths of your sea

That pulled me from you
Or you from me
I want to see you yesterday

[Rap:]
I'm the one you done heard all the rumors about
You vibrate like my cellie how you movin around
In that new gear fresh off the Lesiango runway
Lets go to St.Barts Sunday to Sunday
Your nails done and them braids all twisted
If you got a flaw, I guess I just missed it
I'm not easy to reach, my digits unlisted
Come closer but don't stain with your lipstick

[1st Verse:]
Been around the world
Seen so many girls
But none have moved me quite the way she does
And I've done some things
With some qhetto queens
It was just for fun but now I think I'm in love

I can't stop thinking 'bout her
She's everywhere that I go does she know I just can't live without her
Whoa she
She's taking over me
I can't control how she turns me on so much
Without a single touch

[Chorus:]
Shorty your the one
Your the only girl I need
Only one I want
Only girl that's meant for me
Got me open
Baby girl let me know
If you want to go

[2nd Verse:]
You're a winner so you gotta be choosy
'Cause you can't love everybody
I live my life like a movie
Act like you know somebody
Gonna give you what you need babe
Already told you you're the star of the t.v.
There's nothing else you need to know
So come on get on board

You're the one I'm diggin
And I guess I'm hoping that you're catching the same feelings
Let me know
'Cause you're my favorite girl
In the whole wide world
Yeah you're so fine
I gotta make you mine

[Chorus repeat]
Let me say it again
You're the one I'm diggin
And I guess I'm hoping that you're catching the same feelings
Let me know
'cause you're my favorite girl
In the whole wide world
Yeah you're so fine
I gotta make you mine

[Rap:]
Like rocky road my chain be all chunky
High School thought that I failed since they flunked me
Now I'm in XXL its so funny
High Schools double my sales, I'm gettin money (get your money money money)
Like my bunny's pretty with pierced tummy's
Call me pooh bear how I'm baggin all the honeys
They sick to the point that they noses gettin runny
Why'all freeze on the ave. 
I recline where it's sunny

Can't stop thinking 'bout her
She's everywhere that I go does she know I just can't live without her
Whoa she
She's taking over me
I can't control how she turns me on so much
Without a single touch

Bring that part back man
You're the one I'm diggin
And I guess I'm hoping that you're catching the same feelings
Let me know

One thing you always gotta remember is how we started
It's both of us
We'll be straight dogg

We met eachother through mutual friends

Is it your silky skin 
Ya' innocent grin
Or them curves and tha way that chu' been
Whatever it is, you got me glad that I took notice
When times hopeless
Your words helped me stay focused
I was once told, never trust a diva
I usually toss 'em like the crust of a pizza
But now my sixth sense tell me ta keep her
We livin' lavida
In our own world like cita
I'll let you sport mah chain, rock mah hat,
Wear mah jersey, watch mah back

That's why I'd rather pay more
And keep you in them wears, shortys slice ya' face for
They get tha knock off's, you get the real Louis
That's one of the benefits of gettin' close to me
Down for three years ain't nuttin come between
Expirienced things you never thought you woulda' seen
I took you off the scene
Sold you a dream
You bought that wit out no cream
We a match made, like george and weezie
Lucy and ricky, ike and tina, bobby and whitney
And if shit hit the fan, you comin' wit me
I won't take the stand, they gotta' come and get me

ATL,"She was standing in the crowd
All alone and lookin' pretty
Listening to the music that we played
She walked up and whispered
I leaned down and listened
To the request that she made

""Do you know, 'You Are My Sunshine'""?
She asked so sweet and tenderly
""Do you know, 'You Are My Sunshine' 
And would you do it one more time for me"".

Border to border
And ocean to ocean
I still look for her everplace
Chasing the sunshine
Each and every night I'm
Searching every crowd for her face

She was gone just as quick
As the song that she asked for
Taking my sunshine away
But someday when I finally
Look down and see her
I know just what I'm going to say

Do you know, you are my sunshine
Do you know what your smile did to me
Do you know, you are my sunshine

You vibrate like my cellie how you movin around
In that new gear fresh off the Lesiango runway
Lets go to St.Barts Sunday to Sunday
Your nails done and them braids all twisted

But none have moved me quite the way she does
And I've done some things
With some qhetto queens
It was just for fun but now I think I'm in love

She's taking over me
I can't control how she turns me on so much
Without a single touch

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

With a bible in his hand
And he'd talk about religion
And just how to work the land

It's crazy in the club when I'm in there man, get up!
Trust me homie I'm not playin', get up!
Now get on the dance floor off the chain
I say get up!

I came to bring you that California love
And a lil' New York hatin' it's all of the above
I'm not playin' I'm sayin' I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow the instructions
I said get up!

I ball till I fall
I stunt till I drop
I'm off the show room floor
Not the used car lot
You buy a bottle
I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras

When I get in to it
I get in to it
Everybody can't do it the way I do it
I make it rain, rain
Till the sun come out
A nigga playin', playin'
We make the guns come out

Now, my question is
Who they gonna blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again
Shit, shift now the game done change
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain

I guess I make the kids wanna slang
And NWA made the West Coast bang
Nah it's just music, man it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here
Your feet hurtin' I really care
I said get up!

I want to see you, I want to see you move
And get all into the groove
I said get up!
I'm getting money man I really don't care
Let me see you put your hands up in the air
I said get up!

Girl, you look good
I want to get to know you better
You look good in them jeans
And them red stilettos
You got a Bentley
Coupe booty baby
I want to drive
See I tell you what mileage is
When I'm inside

I'ma take you for a spin
You know round and round
Switch gears till your love come down
I take you to the point of no return
If you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn
I got money to burn

While the Gap Band play
She dropped the bomb on me
It's up and down
And up and down
Gracefully
Rick James would have said she a brick house
Or Fifty you should go home to see
What that bitch bout

I found out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up' get cha some
I know how to get you sprung
Tune you up' use your tongue
Under the hood it's so good
She said it's so good
Goddamn I'm so hood

I have the savoir faire
I'm the reason everybody here
I say get up!
I make it hot, I make it hot in here

I play the crowd's request
The songs they like the best in a style

I get my guitar down and play it from the heart
And I don't play no part, it's real, it's just what I feel

Yours is next but this song's mine
Oh, this song's mine
Yours is next but this song's mine

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Seems we've been knowing each other for a long time
And every time that we've seen each other
We've come up with some reason to stay apart

Baby, let's make the compromise

Atlantic Starr,"This song is just a simple little message
There's no heavy thing
It's just a mere reminder for those of us who
Sometimes forget just how good we are

Life is something we pretend to take for granted
We've gotta it so good that we're hard to satisfy
It would be so nice if we lead towards appreciation
It's not hard if just we try

You should tell the child that only has bread and butter
That some folks have no bread at all
And the man that has no fortune
That hasn't still found someone to love
He should stand just as tall

That's why I'm thankful for every morning that I rise
I'm thankful whether God sends rain or blue sky
I'm thankful 'cause I can clearly see
His love for you and me

Hey, looking back through the years when I was very young
I used to dream of becoming a star
Even though I was [Incomprehensible], I was patient because of you
In time I would grow fine

There were many obstacles that were in my way
I could have done bad things and been locked away
But with lot of attention from my family
Success is seen this day

I'm thankful for every morning that I rise
I'm thankful whether God sends rain or blue sky
I'm thankful 'cause I can clearly see
His love for you and me

If we only stop to count our blessings
We'll find that there will be no time to complain
Oh, what we don't have, that's not the best thing
'Cause the most important things in life we can always gain

That's why I'm thankful
Thankful, thankful

Everyone doing the dance
I even saw the freak of the week

Led me to the back

She took me to a dark space

And pulled her head to hers

Is this cruel, or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds

Not much room to rebel because of health
No drugs, no booze, just kiss and tell
Well known on the scene

Had the first baby barely eighteen
Father of the child was after one thing
When the daughter came the dad was unseen
It don't matter he ain't got a job
So she had to go to work and leave the baby with her mom
Second shift till the neck is stiff
But she worked it and built her own nest to live
Soon after that baby's daddy slash lazy bunk
With no cash he want to come over and crash
He want to play his part
So she let him move in to that garden level apartment
She knew better she did it anyways
Explain better when your trying to see some better days
The suns up catch those rays
Butterfly style who's got chase

But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it can seem so cold
Do what you got to do to cope

Same daddy same broke ass situation
This time the doc said that her heart might break
Praise god that the job got her health benefits straight
She believes in the right to choice
But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
Makes more now a days on the day-shift
Balance that with night class
Take some time and space and make it all fit

Raised her voice and made her point
Told that boy go get employed
He put on his best shirt
Said he wasnt coming back till he gets work

So she swept every piece out that apartment

Take the scenic route
Rather only have to feed three mouths
She adapts to everything know
And nobody asks what she dreams out

And the little man was the first man she believed in

But fear ain't enough to knock her off of that stone
Gonna make that home her home
With or without a man that she can call her own
Big boss at work is anxious
Continues to hand her the wrong advances
She passes the test
She knew the answers
Quit the job to go take a chance
With life
This is life we all scream
While we pray for dollars and we work for change
Its all the same, we all struggle
Sometimes you gotta say fuck you
When you smile and she doesn't return it
Give her room and don't disturb it
If it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
Go ahead and hate the world girl you've earned the right

anguish, anxiousness, and taking it for granted
but when I first landed I was so relieved I lost my focus
so we exceeded recommended dosages
now I hold the crib? that holds the soul that holds the poet skills
exlcusive it leaves illusions of unfocused flows
I don't suppose you're taking too much time
breaking too much mind trying to unravel the parable?
that dismantled and left the lines in need of some assembly
so I can find the secret key and free all the emcees
this planet spins on a thin axis
all axis passes won't help you to grasp the atmos'
I mean, what did you think
my agenda was to freestyle, smile, get paid to smoke weed,
and grab the mic and spoonfeed?
there's more to this than just paying the rent

what could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?
planets as small as balls of clay (x4)

some shells get broke
some keep their wigs closed
some get exposed as little man big pose
some make moves and some stay daydreamers
but everbody seems to want some loot, food amd a beemer
well make mine hunter green with camel insides,
10 percent tips, Mr. Pibb and some french fries
inch by inch I take it closer to the shoulder
but day by day it's getting harder to stay sober
once again on the edge, head's inebriated
movement needs motive, it's easier to be sedated
what makes me mighty and another tiny?
why does my psyche give a damn about whether or not you like me?
if this crime's right I might be wrong
I grip this mic tight because it's all I really have a grip on
so let the losers lose and let the players play
the difference is the day to the dust some clay, what

[Chorus - 4X]

who's world is that? it ain't mine, and I'm grateful
already got a plate full of clay on my table
I'm capable of handling fate, I know this
so do the people that get pissed when this microphonist spits
too many get caught up in the lines that emcees thought up
but it's clear to me the ones that fear me are the one's that outta
I spot a blemish on your planet's existence
I deliver subtle terror submerged in clever sentences
instantly pissin? away the misfits
the only residue that came of the hypothecially spew they sprayed
when they swayed I'd have em
half of 'em can't fathom
where the 'Mats? from
I may be on those
you can ask 'em
at last, when we get down to it
there's more than sand and fluid
in how I revolve and evolve
can we solve the secrets? No.
can we take trinkets? No.
so when the ink hits it's more than just a sequenced flow
I can't bring you with me so I'm a leave me here

carefully I steer, I'm aware life is fatal
when I go, I want to go like Ho, taken by the play-dough

Atmosphere,"I used to know this woman
Who had the most beautiful tattoos
On the top sides of both of her hands
She was forty-three years old and as far as I know
Had never yet been with a man

It's not that she wasn't attractive
She was beautiful but it was the way that she interacted
She was aggressively passive to the point
Where she would've intimidated any mitt
That ever tried to catch it

On the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
She claimed it is what God resembled
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
And this one she explained looked like the devil

I remember once watching her touch her own breasts
How the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
As if anticipating when they'd be allowed to caress
The sweet flower that they both seemed to hunger
(Sweet flower)

Now maybe I was high but it felt so right
Heaven and Hell both take to this woman's womb
It didn't make sense how she could commence
Touching herself with me wide awake in the same room

But if I've learned anything in my years
(My years)
I learned I no longer believe in surprise
(In surprise)
But what happened next damn near stoled my tears

The tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
They both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
And showed me why she never took some time with a man
They climbed deep inside of this woman's garden

She closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
I stepped I left and I don't regret leaving
And I'll never forget all the things I saw that evening
A glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
To understanding more about what intrigues me most

I didn't get turned on I just got turned
I wasn't as aroused as I was concerned
For each one of 'em I've hurt and every time I've been burned
I've got a lot to teach but even more to learn

So now I keep my eyes open hoping to take in all I can
About women taking in all she can
And for as long as I breathe I'll save receipt
In my memory for that woman with the tattooed hands

There's good and evil in each individual fire
Identifies needs and feeds our desire
As long as we keep our spirit inspired
She can bite her bottom lip all she wants

There's good and evil in each individual fire

Identifies needs and feeds our desire

Somebody please explain to them what it be about
""Take a deep breath relax, don't push it on out.""(x2)
Somebody please explain to them what it be about

They can't sleep yet, too many re-grets
Got em running round in circles for the re-spect
They need the gossip, but where's the logic?
Voices in the box guarantee a better product
So here I sit now, and watch em trip out
Trying to pick a finger to put upon what its about
But if there was a point, you would still avoid
You should've taught the boys and girls how to take apart their toys
I stay up-set,with all the pup-pets
submerged in the drama 'cause they love it
That if they can hold the pain, and then they complain

Why would you chase away the sun if you don't want the rain?
I never asked for the world, just a portion
Tryin to make a good soldier out of daddy's little orphan
But management called down, demanded that we turned the sound down
And with that, I suggest we start the count-down
Simplistic spiral and work your way backwards
'Til the bastards collapse and choke on their last words
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

[Chorus]
Breathe in, breathe out, the sign says ""keep out""
Breathe in, breathe out, somebody please explain to them what it be about
Breathe in, breathe out, the sign says ""keep out""
Somebody fill up my gut before I freak out

Low profile, no more smiles, til all of y'all quit acting so damn wild
Slow down child, you're gonna lose balance, too
overanxious, the goods will get damaged
Girl, how many stories can you fit into a tanktop?
How many wishes get spent on what you ain't got?
The youth want truth, well thank god
Tryin to keep it movin, while you're sittin in the same spot
Been in this cage for a long time (long time)
Been coverin this page with the wrong rhymes (wrong rhymes)
Got a strong mind, I got a weak will
I've got bad nerves and I can't keep still
But I stay humble, so when the meek take the planet
I can get a little piece with my name on it
The only problem is by then I won't want it
I'm in the backyard praying and hoping for the comet
Are you lookin to remember or searchin for adventure?
I guess it all depends on the agenda
Do you carry a grudge? Do you carry a gun?
I guess it all depends on where you come from
Surroundings are gonna dictate the needs
I'm out, I want to live around lakes and trees
And I'll be back when its happy hour
So just pour me another and ignore me my brother

[Chorus]

Breathe in...",Breathing,2002
Atmosphere,"Jimmy got shot in the parking lot...

I'm a slow typer, a so-so writer
Been the shit ever since I was an infant in diapers
And I'ma be dope, all the way to the end
From the cradle to the grave, the Pampers to the Depends
Get enough love, got enough friends
But on a regular basis it's safe to say I've got the benz
And I didn't mean to ignore that vibe you sent
I guess my mind was probably on my rent
Oh I got my mind on my tummy, and my tummy on my mind
Some assembly required, let me run it down the line
The factory is open, time card punched
Until lunch time it's crunch time, back to work
Fool, the first rule is to keep the verse true
Even if it hurts you, you gotta wear the pain like a stain
Respect the listener, respect the game
Because there's more to game than some dinner and fame

(Hook)
Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love
My name's Slug, give me a pound or a hug

And I'ma play this game, I just want to say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll

(Verse 2)
See I'm that cat that used to sit in the back and study
Looking for some proof, that God loves ugly
Flash forward a decade later in your time
Somehow, a good number of ya'll got down
And it's solid, fresh, dope, whatever you want to call it
(Not back) An aspiring sociopathic alcoholic
(Ahh shit) Look at Slug still rockin' the same outfit
Tryin to make the belly grow bigger than the wallet
Ay yo man, how you doing, (what?), how you been?
Just been makin it cool to rap about love again
Not that hippie stuff I'm talkin 'bout that bitch that gives you nuts
Did he say bitch? Yeah I'm sorry, don't tell my baby's mommy
Speakin of baby, when done, there'll be a crate full of albums
For my son to page through, thinking daddy was a gun
With a handful of heads that put me up
til they had some samples from Ant, and faith in What the Fuck?
I said, still goin, still maintainin, still standing in the land of snow and purple rain
And I'm still waitin for my date to kiss me or slap me
Cause there ain't no way that I can be happy, when I'm half me

(Hook)
Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life
I've seen things that used to be dreams
Give me the love

And I'ma play this game, I just want to say
All I really want is for you to remember my name
And I'ma run for as long as I'm allowed
And hope to God I inspire some of ya'll

(Verse 3)
I've had the pleasure of speaking with some of you
Yeah you, come on now, don't act like you don't know who I'm talking to
After that show, when you approached me like you know me
The cd I sold you, the secrets that you told me
On that world you vision, through the layers of tears
The ones you choke and keep hidden when the players are near
I watch you chase it with beer, some frustration and fear
Try to figure out why the hell I came here
Well I don't know either, and I'm not ready to take a breather, neither
All I know is I'm still a believer
So you can beat me up, or you can beat me off
Pick a side, any side, and let me do my job, come on
If you've got a lot of love to give, but you don't know who to give it to
I'ma turn out the lights of the cigarette, and write a song about you
This one's for you.

(Hook)
Give me the money
Don't you dare stop there
Give me the mic
That's the tool, and I play it cool
Give me the life

Girl: Could I throw, like, pennies on stage? So I
couldn't be a fuckin groupie and just fuck you 'cause
you're on stage and others of us want to fuck you?
Slug: See bands like us don't get groupies
Girl: No
Slug: Yea
Girls: You're so full of bullshit
Slug: No, its not full of shit, I mean, have you ever
heard our songs? I mean, basically... exactly, that's what I'm saying

Smile, smile with me, smile with me, smile with me,
please won't you smile, smile with me, smile with me,
smile with me, please won't you...
Oh look at her she's lookin as good as dinner
and she's lookin back at me as if maybe I'm a winner
I'm in my late twenties little girl don't flirt with me
I've got the capabilities to program your circuitry
You don't have to believe, do yourself a little justice
don't let Slug undercook your muffins
Oh wait, did I say that? I did? Must be losing it
'cause it almost felt that it might just have some truth in it
Now back to the platter at hand
she said she's 21 and quit school to go work for the man
A switch up in the plan, now she's happy as a chorus
'cause now she makes rent and now she drives a Taurus
Unwindin and hangin out at the bar
I wonder if she knows that I'm not really a star
She seems to be impressed with my lack of an ego and
my self-aware style, I like the way that she smiles
She want to know how I find the words I use
I don't really know but I can lie if you want me to
Angels sing to me in my sleep
I sold my damaged soul for the magic of speak
Now she's laughin, she likes the sarcasm
Naturally, I'm askin if she's got a captain
A captain? You mean a man at home? The answer is no
I came to this bar alone
Well heaven's to Betty, enough about boyfriends already
just tryin to keep the conversation petty
As much as I would love to run and play in the forest
ain't no way this girl is gonna break into my fortress

I've never made a practice, of introducing the mattress
to women that I meet at my own gig
I don't know, can't imagine anything as small as
alcohol and hormones turning out to be anything big
Baby's hella beautiful, even kinda bright
I've got the fire of a vampire inside me tonight
It might be alright, everything seems tight
I've got a good buzz and she's giving me the green light
So tell me girl, what you doin after?
She says hopefully hangin out with my new favorite rapper
Now wait a minute, that's not fair, you're throwin boulders
I can tell by the way your hair touches your shoulders
Be straight with me and I'll be mean with you
I can think of some of us that we should do
So if you think I'm coming home with you tonight
you're probably right(probably right)
A few more beers, a couple more laughs,
undressing my past with the questions she asked
Yes, I love cats and I would love to take a bath
If I would spend the night, would you massage my back?

She's closin in for the embrace
and slightly tucks her head under my face
her hair smells so good, I gotta have a taste
where's your Ford, let's ditch this place
In the parking lot, she sparked it off
she must be starving for someone to hit the heart
I've never been kissed with such passionate bliss
pornstar damn near tore my lips apart
honey slow it up, hold it up, start the car and
leave this garage, lets go to your apartment
Lendale Avenue, on the way to her rest
her drunk ass turns to look at me and she says,
""You're so beautiful from the hair to the soul
I can't believe that I've never met you before
it feels like I've been waiting for you my whole life.""
She missed the red light, hit a pickup truck and we both died",Hair,2002
Atmosphere,"Â??Dungeons and Dragonsâ?? by Dr. Demento

Narrator: Dungeons and Dragons, Satan's game. Your children like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the Occult and a game like D+D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special, while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo. This afternoon the Dead Alewives watch tower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session. Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons

Graham: Galstaff you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself standing in a dark room, the pungent stench of mildew emanates off the wet dungeon walls.

Nightblade: Where are the Cheetos!

Graham: They're right next to you.

Galstaff: I cast a spell.

Nightblade: Where's the Mountain Dew!

Graham: In the Fridge. DUH!

Galstaff: I wanna cast a spell.

Nightblade: Can I have a Mountain Dew!

Graham: Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew just go get it.

Galstaff: I can cast any of these right, on the list?

Graham: Yes, any any of the first level ones.

Nightblade: I'm gonna get a soda, any one want one? Hey Graham I'm not in the room right?

Graham: What room?

Galstaff: I wanna cast magic missile.

Nightblade: The room where he's casting all these spells from!

Graham: He hasn't cast any thing yet.

Galstaff: I am though if you'd listen. I'm casting Magic Missile.

Graham: Why are you casting Magic Missile, there's nothing to attack here.

Galstaff: I- I- I'm attacking the darkness.

(laughing)

Graham: Fine fine you attack the darkness there's an elf in front of you.

Picard: Whoa! That's me right?

Graham: He's wearing a brown tunic and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

Picard: No I don't, I have gray eyes.

Graham: Let me see that sheet.

Picard: Well it says I have, well it says I have blue but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

Graham: Whatever, ok, you guys can talk now if you want.

Galstaff: Hello.

Picard: Hello.

Galstaff: I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

Picard: Then how come you had to cast Magic Missile?

(laughing)

Graham: why- why- why- You guys are being attacked.

Nightblade: Do I see that happening!?!

Graham: NO! You're outside by the tavern.

Nightblade: Cool, I get drunk!

Graham: Ugh. There are there are seven ogres surrounding you.

Picard: How can they surround us? I had Mordenkainens Magical Watch Dog cast!

Graham: No you didn't.

Nightblade: I'm getting drunk! Are there any girls there?

Picard: I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no, but I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainens Faithful Watch Dog.

Graham: But you never actually cast it.

Nightblade: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!

Graham: Ugh. Yeah you are.

Nightblade: Are there any girls there?

Graham: Yeah!

Picard: I did though; I completely said when you asked me...

Graham: No you didn't. You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell so now there's ogres. Ok.

Nightblade: OGRES!?! Man, I got an ogre slaying knife! It's got a +9 against ogres!

Graham: You're not there, you're getting DRUNK!

Nightblade: Ok, but if there's any girls there I wanna do them!

Narrator: There you have it. A frightening look into Americas most frightening past time. Remember that it's not you children's fault that's their being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare. It's their gym teachers fault for making them feel out cast when they couldn't do one single pull up.

Atmosphere,"""You see, what you mistake for madness is just over acuteness of the senses
And now it came to my ears a low, dull sound,
Such as a watch makes when wrapped in cotton,
I knew that sound too. It was the beating of the old man's heart.""

Man, I'm telling you some motherfuckers just have no kind of heart, man.
Serious man , motherfuckers man, these motherfuckers man, these motherfuckers have no self respect.
Don't wanna pay no dues, just wanna drop like a fucking LP tomorrow..
And then to top it off, these motherfuckers, they don't have no heart to their music, you know what I mean?
Sound like little girls and shit..

If you respect yourself [Repeat 5x]

[Slug]
Do you--
Now, it's started off rather basic,
Just some small scale davilin confined to the basement
Never knew I'd grow to this full time user
Never figured that I was a winner or a loser only did the due to have fun
And only got with a crew because it seemed natural to have one
Capture the life in the form of the grip around the mic hold it
Right like a love hold it tight with plight fortifies my
Existence reinforces my position in this course that I'm sticking to my path now
I can see it all laid out in my past while trying to catch what it's about in my last breath
Pull the toxins in, and I bet death's about to box me in, but before this bitch comes to get some,
I'mma do my job on this m-I-see, and feed you a thick one

[Chorus: Slug (Repeat 3x)]
You can have all the heart in the world, doesn't mean I'm gonna respect ya
I'm getting older and I'm knowing better

[Slug]
Let a, pissed rapper step to this captain and get up off your
Head kid, I'll bitch smack Hugh Hefners
Now, I'm about to put a (Slug) in
Show business and if everything goes right, I'm leaving no witness
I hold this inside the chest, so big it hardly fits it trips between a true fan of party
Shits quit to lace the track with substance for all the young guns that's really listening
At the functions so you can love it or leave it, fuck it or keep it, either way
I'll be here trudging through the deep shit
I've done well over hundred cuts and gotten the feed back of love
From some of the ones I've touched and thus, I'm not quitting never stop rippin' you gotta be kiddin' shit
He's on a mission is it possible the mics got my soul?
I'll make them all say ""Ho!"" and Rhymesayers
Rock the show let 'em know that it's more then a career goal
Cut that zero and let the hero in your ear hole, yo!

[Chorus: Slug (Repeat 3x)]
You can have all the heart in the world, doesn't mean I'm gonna respect ya
I'm getting older and I'm knowing better

[Slug]
Let a, piss rapper step to this captain get up off your head kid
I'll bitch smack Hugh Hefner emcees please excuse the ""you's"" and ""P's"" but I grew up on BDP, EPMD, Run-DMCs
I don't believe you should hold a mic and rolled up with a bus full of friend that think alike
I'm having a hard time trying to keep it simple just for the fuckers that don't seem to read between the ripples
It's all nipples and clits in this rap shit, catch a licking if you lay back passive bastard
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all, art imitates life than most of it it's wack y'all
You gotta learn how to read the info the individual provides they probably won't dig me 'till I've died

Paranoid of exploiting the verdict
But in the same breath

And we all got burnt that summer

She came to the shows
But I never met her, don't even know if she was listening

That night, somebody lost their daughter
He raped and killed her at the venue
Can't comprehend what her friends must have went through
That night the sun went dark
Now watch everyone on the tourbus fall apart
That night, lord have mercy
The music died, that night, in Alberquerque

Stop, it can't be true right
This type of real deaont happen to you right?
Crescent, Murs, Dibbs, Jaybird
I wanna go home now and start a new life
Wish I could protect the kids
I guess safety's a hit or miss
With a prior convicted sex-offense against a 4 year old
Why we let you live?
Don't know what I'm trying to write
But there's a part of me that keeps dyin at night
When I think about her mother
I become another number that wants you to suffer
You're locked up for now, you have no more chances to steal the children's laughs

Alcohol and dialogue, perfect combination
Throw in a cokehead or a pothead
Just can't stop them thought provoking topics

The music's too loud to hear the fire alarm

C'mon

Nothing but love
Yeah there was a party, many people came through
Standing on the wall, cause that's what I do
Small-talk shot dialogue push snooze
Defense mechon cause I got a lotta shoes (issues)
The moment got stolen by a lady in red
With a campaign slogan about the straight edge
But her sentence is broken
Her focus a fraction
The ash on her Camels at an inch and a half
And her voice starts to crack
And her head starts to twitch
And Ant looks at me like, ""What's up with this bitch?""
I can tell by the stains and the way she complains
That pills ain't to blame and it ain't cocaine
She's had too, too, too much coffee

Nate must have drank a lot of Black Label
Tryin' to play the Rottwieler under the table
Now light another cigarette off of the stove
Both ya'll drunk, which one of ya'll drove?
These people need to stay off the sauce
I'm shocked that the neighbors ain't called the cops
The music, the drunk, the fights out front
And half of these kids ain't even near twenty one
Who's party is this, who's home is this?
How'd I get here man, I do grownup shit
Let me know when your games are all done
Cause I can't fuck with these games you call fun

Have fun [x11]

Atmosphere,"Blue collar Eddie and his better half Delores used to be mantel pieces down at the Black Forest. 
And I don't know if that bar still exists, but when it did, so did they, a couple bleeding heart kids. 
Everything volatile, every night rocker style. Hop a stool, be discrete and just watch a while. 
But do your best to keep the level observational, drama is attractive so push it when it takes a pull. 
And each night's a random when you pay a ransom for the right to sing along with them drinking anthems. 
And these fools paid so many dues that everybody stops to salute. 

But one night after another fight a couple from an opposite table offered an invite. 
Dolores didn't want to join 'em, wasn't feeling social. 
But Eddie was so aggravated that he had to poke holes. 
He walked over, sat in the dialogue and called at Dolores like some kind of dog (hey girl come here)
She can't believe it, she's done, she's had it, but she doesn't want to make another scene in this establishment. 
She got up and mosied over, and put her arm up around Eddie's shoulder. 
Nobody's sober the song is the same; sometimes you stick out your chin to catch the rain.

You can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster.
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes.
You can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster.
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes.

The clock keeps drinking, they keep ticking. There's two more people who get to play positions. 
Samantha and Chuck; not a couple, just roommates; out having too many shots on a Tuesday. 
Who knew they'd be tools for the duo, put a little bit of fire on the fuel. 
It's a kinda blue, intentions ain't cruel, but everybody's so ready to bend up the rules.
Now there's Chuck, staring at Delores. 
Eddie is distracted by Samantha so he doesn't notice. 
And everybody's too fucked up to even asses the mess, much less care enough. 
More whiskey, a pitcher of Premium, Eddie's getting tipsy, he didn't see it comin. 
On his way back from a visit with that urinal, tryna straighten out his thoughts and the vertigo. 
Weaves through, stops when he's seen em. 
Picture perfect, it looked just like freedom.
Dolores on Chuck's lap kissing him hard. Eddie dipped into the winter left them all at the bar. 
Sometimes ya gotta follow what's felt inside; between the power struggle and the selfish pride. 
No one's allowed to cry unfair because now they both get to drink alone somewhere. 

You can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster
Sometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes

Atmosphere,"Ain't no way to explain or say
How painful the hangover was today
In front of the toilet, hands and knees
Trying to breathe in between the dry heaves
My baby made me some coffee
Afraid that if I drink some it's probably coming right back out me

Couple of Advil, relax and chill
At a standstill with how bad I feel
I think I need to smell fresh hair
So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
The sunlight hit me dead in the eye
Like it's mad I gave half the day to last night
My bad sight made me trip on my ass right into
That patch of grass like that's life

All of a sudden, I realize something
The weather is amazing, even the birds are bumpin'
Stood up and took a look and a breath
And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed
Never really seen exercise as friendly
But I thing something's telling me to ride that ten speed
The brakes are broken, it's alright
The tires got air and the chain seems tight
Hopped on and felt the summertime,
It reminds me of one of them Musab lines like

Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind,
Sometimes you gotta give in to win,
I love the days when it shines, whoa let it shine

Sunshine, sunshine, it's fine
I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind,
Sometimes you gotta give in to win,
I love the days when it shines, whoa let it shine

If I could I would keep this feeling in a plastic jar
Bust it out whenever someone's actin' hard
Settle down, barbecue in the backyard
The kids get treats and old folks get classic cars
Every day that gets to pass is a success
Every woman looks better in a sun dress
The sunshine's an excuse to shoot hoops, get juice
Show improve their moves and let loose
I hear voices, I see smiles to match em
Good times and you can feel it in the fashion
Even though the heat cooks up the action
The streets still got butterflies
Enough kids to catch 'em
Ridin' my bike around these lakes man
Feelin' like I finally figured out my escape plan
Take it all and the day started off all wrong
Somehow now that hangover is all gone
Ain't nothing like the sound of the leaves
When the breeze penetrates these south side trees
Leanin' up against one, watchin' the vibe
Forgettin' all about the stress, thanking god I'm alive
It's so simple, I had to keep the song simple
When I get home I'm gonna open all the windows
Feelin' all right, stopped at a stop sign
A car pulled up, bumpin' Fresh Prince's Summertime

I feel it in my skin, warming up my mind,
Sometimes you gotta give in to win,
I love the days when it shines, whoa let it shine

Atmosphere,"She got a condition of the heart
A heart condition
So as a kid she had to adapt to smarter living
Not much room to rebel because of health
No drugs, no booze, just kiss and tell
Well known on the scene
Jail bait queen
Had the first baby barely eighteen
Father of the child was after one thing
When the daughter came the dad was unseen
It don't matter he ain't got a job
So she had to go to work and leave the baby with her mom
Second shift till the neck is stiff
But she worked it and built her own nest to live
Soon after that baby's daddy slash lazy bunk
With no cash he want to come over and crash
He want to play his part
So she let him move in to that garden level apartment
She knew better she did it anyways
Explain better when your trying to see some better days
The suns up catch those rays
Butterfly style who's got chase

[Chorus: x2]
But she still dreams after she woke
Tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it can seem so cold
Do what you got to do to cope

Two years later two months pregnant
Same daddy same broke ass situation
This time the doc said that her heart might break
Praise god that the job got her health benefits straight
She believes in the right to choice
But she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
Makes more now a days on the day-shift
Balance that with night class
Take some time and space and make it all fit
The apartment they now live in is overcrowded
Raised her voice and made her point
Told that boy go get employed
He put on his best shirt
Said he wasnt coming back till he gets work
She knew what that part meant
So she swept every piece out that apartment
Peace out keep out
Take the scenic route
Rather only have to feed three mouths
She adapts to everything know
And nobody asks what she dreams out

[Chorus: x2]

Little girl was the first reason to breathe
And the little man was the first man she believed in
She gotta live right and do right by self
She do for self she don't want your help
Afraid of being alone
But fear ain't enough to knock her off of that stone
Gonna make that home her home
With or without a man that she can call her own
Big boss at work is anxious
Continues to hand her the wrong advances
She passes the test
She knew the answers
Quit the job to go take a chance
With life
This is life we all scream
While we pray for dollars and we work for change
Its all the same, we all struggle
Sometimes you gotta say fuck you
When you smile and she doesn't return it
Give her room and don't disturb it
If it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
Go ahead and hate the world girl you've earned the right

See I've been here for thirty-some years
Lookin' at myself in the same dirty mirror
So it ain't like I don't comprehend
Open that bottle, swallow that friend
No crime to take a little too much
Got time to drink away a few months
Got a little cocaine habit
But he says he only does it if somebody else has it
Go do that shit, do that shit, lady
She went vegetarian for the baby
Third trimester, I see the kid kick
She showed me outside when she gave me a cigarette
Shit, there's no way to measure it
Not every pony grows up to be a Pegasus
Ya gotta let people be hypocrites
Count your blessings and mind yo business

Must be drinkin' that name brand scotch
All of us cut from the same damn clothe
Some of us never cut the price tags off
She ended up on the pole
With her heels pointin' at her Jesus she used to know
Stripped her down to her naked body
We made her drown in a lake full of patriarchy
In between the pride and the misery
With the infinite supply of sympathy
Are these invisible walls that hold me
Like this goldfish bowl is the whole sea

Or broke on a stroll

Make you suck it all the way to the ass now
Cause all of y'all heifers are cash cows
And at first it was just a little game
Had no idea that he was fucking with your brains
When he was around you seemed mature
He helped you calm down and feel secure (sure)

Give them some gifts, get on they lips
Before they even get a chance to get hips

Shake you down
Make his mark
Take you down
Break your heart

Say some even put themselves in treatment
Some get away but still gotta keep looking over they shoulder forever

Got em paid off some kind of trade off
Gonna stay in the pocket
As long as the money stays long and the hands stay strong

But I didn't stop cause you was walking the opposite way
I guess I could have shouted out your name
But even if it was you I don't what I would say

Maybe share a cigarette because we both fools
Chop it up and compare perspectives
Life
Love
Stress
And set backs
Yes
You could tell me how hard you had it
And you could show me all the scares to back it
And we can analyze each complaint
Break it down and explain these mistakes I make
I like to tangle up the strings of the puppetry
But you knew me back when I was a younger me
You've seen Sean in all types of life
And I've been meaning to ask you if I'm doing alright

Yesterday, was that you
Looked just like you
Strange things my imagination might do
Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy cause I miss you

Take a breath reflect on what we've been through
Or am I just going crazy cause I miss you

I'm shook
I know
I pushed when I should of pulled
Took it all back if I could I put that on my soul
And I would make a top notch good listener
If you could block off a little time out to give it here
Since we went our separate paths
I hits a couple of snags
That remind me of the past
I cant front I'm having a blast
But damned if I ain't afraid of how long its gonna last
Sitting here wishing we could kick it
Gimme your opinions I do miss the criticisms
I didn't mean to be distant

Get the bag, make the get away exit
You get mad like your middle name desperate
No net, better not get left back
Yeah, you should probably protect that

Beat my chisel, leave my initials
Fly so far when you follow the signals
Sky full of stars and all of them wishful

But you feel safe underneath that mask

Ferris Wheel, give rides
The scars healed in time to get high
Lock the doors and hide the keys
Lets go describe how to climb a tree
Don’t sign the lease just cop a corner
For you to curl up and try to sleep
Those cheap police won't find my wings, I keep my dreams inside my dreams
And If I had a time machine
I’d probably use it like a vacuum and try to clean
It kind a seems, quite more than a handful of these regrets have been circumstantial
Now give me all the cash out the drawer
Touch that mustache down on the floor
And I’ll be in court holding a pitchfork
Before I let the contest outlast the sport

Pocket watch, impatient
Find a mate then make the migration
Break the rules, but first break the rulers
And keep it moving like a rumor
I don’t need to defend my defensiveness
I keep to myself, my family, and friendships
I’ve got enough people I could disappoint
If you disagree I think you missed the point
Now go ahead and grab a chair
Let me tell you about the last few years
Pulled out a sack full of Samson’s hair
And put it on the dash like a dancin’ bear
I wrote you a horoscope
It won't fit on this post-it note
But if I had to sum it up into a shorter quote
It goes fuck it, you might as well row that boat",Camera Thief,2014
Atmosphere,"I highly doubt that y'all think about sex
Anywhere near as often as I think about death
Go ahead and shout at the top of your lungs
But don't wake the baby up, we got a lot to get done
That little light indicates a connection
And if it's all the same I'd like to make a suggestion
See, if everybody on this comet agreed
We could set the clock to whenever we want it to be
I just might just modify the mileage
I don't know much, but I'm confident the fight's fixed
So high that I feel like a pilot
Falling out the sky full of brilliant brightness
Hurry up, stir me up
You gotta learn the words before the whole Earth burning, but
We wouldn't even need to recognize your birthday
If you were the center of the universe in the first place
If I had feathers I would fly away
If I felt fresher in fur I would hibernate
If I ever figured out how to communicate
Maybe then we could accumulate
For now face the wall, I ain't the same as y'all
A real friend wouldn't make you take the fall
Sometimes life'll try to break your balls
With the long list of missed wakeup calls

You know I wanna feel special
Walk around the festival carrying a big stuffed animal
I try not to make a mess though
Gotta stay sensible, ain't nobody coming with the antidote
I wanna watch you grow
And I wanna leave the planet better off than it was handed to me
And I don't know, there's possibility
So I settle for selling my soul to the slaves of the land of the free
I don't wanna leave my family tree behind
I don't anyone to miss me like I miss you
But I don't wanna take up too much time
I'm not trying to run away from the line we drew
The sunshine seems to feel so seamless
The soldier is a dreamer and a realist
And history sealed this
Thought me that a hero ain't nothing but a field trip
Nah, I know you're down to do something profound
Put a stick in the ground to prove you was around
No amount of time will ever be considered enough
I'm trying to tether it up and live forever through love
We're not lucky, but we're fortunate
I'm pretty sure of it
And all the life we wasted trying to make some bread
Might've been better spent trying to raise the dead",Fortunate,2014

I might bite my lip, like the silent type
You might make a fist, like you trying to fight

You separate the foe from the friend by the showmanship
And the bones that don't bend

You the only one that knew how to do right
Present it with a sleeve of success

Unless you slept a night in my nest

Looking at the clock and the remote control
The circle contracts till you all alone
I put that on the people you've outgrown
And maybe it was all for show
But it was so convincing that the ground got cold
I guess anything's possible, under a spotlight we all got a note to hold
It goes: don't throw no stones if you're living in a fish bowl
Blow a kiss though
Where the aim is based on which way the wind floats
And pride is a bottle on a fence post
I keep the shoes laced up
In case the people I love come to shoot the place up
I know we ain't cut from the same cloth
But a lot of those fights were just to say we fought
The mother turns, life is fragile
The struggle burns from inside of the candle
It doesn't matter how far you run from it, you're still gonna find it
You come from it
And even though we all equivalent
We gotta, hold on to the differences
We gotta, stand up for what we won't fall for

Put a dollar in the jukebox, ordered up a shot
Now everything is frozen just floating flickering dots
As we fade into the night without ever giving it thought

Countless times that we found a way to even out

Look, y’all know that I would help if I could
But I was too busy tryina nail myself to some wood
There’s more songs praising the people we went to prison with
Then there are praising the people we make children with
And I ain’t saying either one is more legitimate
But it’d be ridiculous to think that it’s coincidence
Shit, I’ll never be the best at this
I write songs that I’m living in, welcome to my sweatshirt
I think it’s magnificent that you’re presently present
Thank for listening, appreciate your effort
Cinderella, fit your hand in the glove
We’re on a spaceship crash land from above
We’re on a lazy river fly fishing for love
We’re on a double barrel shotgun hunting for dove

It starts with hello and it goes till I die

I feel faint like an old ass flashlight
I don't remember how I got there
Waiting at the train stop, hoping that the rain stop
The pain throbs at the front of the skull
I should have took the day off, looking for a pay off
The brainwash is insufferable
I'm on purpose, coffee in a thermos
Squint like Clint tryna spot me in the cursive
Missing persons, lost in your costumes
Blood, moon and a boombox full of volume
If I had the authority I would probably
Make everybody throw their hands in the sky
And everything I said in this song would be classified

I absorb it before I get deported back to orbit

Do a couple of spins and shit, synchronicity flips

And I ain't tryna kill the vibe, but I'm grateful that you're still alive
Now gimme a high five

It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when it come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me

And that's what we s'posed to do I guess
Spread love 'til you've used your last breath
No matter what the challenges hold
I was bold because I knew that we could handle the cold
And just in case I don't say this enough
Thanks for the love, I love the way that you love
And I ain't making this up, you put some change in my cup
And then you gave me a hug, it's like you came from above

It doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly
And when it come to divide, we've gotta multiply
You make me wanna understand your graffiti
You're tryna make me feel like somebody needs me",Graffiti,2018
Atmosphere,"I ain't the one
I never was the one, just another son of a son of a gun
Grandpa had the skin of a drum
R-r-run but you can't escape what you came from
Bite your tongue, chew blood like it's gum
Climb aboard the diving board
Time gets shorter when a child is born
I'm a quiet storm but when I'm dry and warm
I take final form until you slice the cord
And make the line go flat on that life support
I gotta make some space so I can reach these stars
My face looks like an old race car
Tryna put it together before it came apart
And when they lay my parts where my name is carved
They should save my heart in this mason jar
Minnesota, Uber drivers, Google Maps to the universal fibers
You're nobody 'til you stole some lighters
Cat burglar disguised as a nervous tiger
We've been to many places but earth is liver
Save it, give me likes and favorites
Everybody's famous, I'ma need a lifetime of patience
Remind me what your name is?
You won't find me in the known locations
I'd rather be alone in my beautiful basement, woo

This on my list of shit to do
After I pick which whisper to listen to
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh
And we can fight about it after school
Whatever you have to do, I'm cool

When I leave this Earth, you feel the after tremors
Might see my curse up on the back of the mirrors
Graffiti bridge is all tags and stickers
But we are the children of the action figures
And now we drop like matchsticks, figures
I got too many friends, and I can't keep up with the trends
And I know that I'm supposed to pretend
Like I'm afraid of the day that it's all gonna end
Where the hell have you been? And how did time get spent, huh?
I gotta, gotta stop messin' about
Stick the neck out like you're stretching it out
The king wears a crown made of clouds
The whole crowd'll get loud if you miss this foul
If you don't mind I'ma go mind my business now, woo

This on my list of shit to do
After I pick which whisper to listen to
And you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, ooh
And we can fight about it after school

Atmosphere,"It was a dark and stormy night
Puddles of rain reflected the stop light
The world fell asleep but I'm wide wake
Listening to traffic on the highway, from half a mile away
I'm looking up in my family, kaleidoscope
I'm trying to float with some harmony, hit some higher notes
And I don't know if I'm supposed to cover your eyes
But I chose to hold your hand and watch the sun rise
Live within the gift
Recognize the warnings
Memorize the answers
This is a recording
I love you 'til the moon and back
There's nothing new 'bout that
It's just a proven fact
And somewhere my dad is listening to the engine purr
Someday I'm gonna finish my verse
I inherited that free-refills-type thirst
I'm counting on my children to break this curse
It goes

I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'ma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth
I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'ma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth

It's funny, right?
Our only reason that we're trying to find this money is to buy us some time
Rise and shine, I gotta weigh these fish
To educate my kids on how to bait they lines
I wonder if this is how the aliens felt
Just 'cause the hate theyself, don't mean they change theyself, nah
Still chasing after gratification, at this point I ain't even know what that would take
Don't make a mess in your drawers just to get some applause
You don't wanna be the bullet that your ex has dodged (haha)
Another bumper sticker, but it's enough to consider not to jump in the river
I can play the xylophone out of a pile of bones
But sometimes can't even find the stones to dial your phone
I built a whole kingdom out of styrofoam
And you can have it when I'm gone

I don't know how much time we have left
But I promise you that when I breathe my last breath
I'ma exhale and remember your birth
It's never too late to get some heaven on earth

Atmosphere,"As the sun sets, the moon rises with vengeance
I ask you to witness what revenge is
Moving mountains and inches
The business is resistance
Powerful as we evolve (we evolve)
Get involved, we can get it all (get it all)
Altogether we could get it solved (get it solved)
Bosses that'll pay the cost

This is what you wanted in life
You gotta try now
Sleepin' all warm at night
This is what you want in life?

Hot Juba, black Buddha, smoother than Luther
Out of the womb ruthless, deliver with no toola
Rougher than loofas, clueless and ruthless considered nuisance
Barren and fruitless, no power, the cup juiceless
I aspire to inspire givin' devil's fire
A sin higher, make profit like Jeremiah
Turn the mercury to gold to extract worth
And my circumference trying to tell me it's a flat Earth
Elegant aggression, glamorous suppression
Ballad of the bullet, immaculate conception
And the shitty slums seeking galaxy connections
Trying to follow God, hollow like a faulty log
Han Solo in the Jedi, I'm unthawed
Hyper-vigilant and militant, en garde
Unscathed, slaves free while they unchained
Life's a maze, fiends live in concaves

I would send you back to the bowels you're born from
I raised a glass when you swallowed your forked tongue
I recognize your counterfeit confidence
Got me convinced that the crime is the consequence
You're a derivative of bullshit, literal
The unoriginal, that's why you're miserable
We had to pick up the pieces, it wasn't difficult
I guess you didn't know, your impact was minimal
The opposite of opportunism
Your costume is so transparent, now you're virtually invisible
There's no such thing as a typical individual
There's nothing left except ""fuck you"" on principle
Seventh of September, still running the temperature
Smoking like an ember, drinking like an amateur
Tripping like your grandpa at the strip club without his pills
Make it rain two dollar bills

Yo, peep the piece of scum, you proceeded to become
Competing with me is dumb, seed it deep inside the trunk
You must be drinking cum, 'cause you talk a lot like a cunt
Get punched and knocked out in the crosswalk right in the front
Your resistance is food for my machismo
When I push up on a fool, he's stuck on freeze mode
That ain't a full quip, riding on the Jean-Paul
I ain't got no attitude, I just got a mean soul
Everybody else telling me I needed to grow
Shut your pharmaceutical ass up, and put that weed in the bowl
Got some cancer cells to kill, now the answer from hell
So pass the bill fast, 'cause I over pressurize my master seal
Don't over glamorize a man to kill
Don't let 'em grow up, thinking he has to actually blast to steal
And make sure they know there's more to life than just some rap skill
It's like decades later emcees get trapped still

Power to the people
Don't let a coward lead you
Can't preach to you if they don't know how to feed you
I burnt the haystack and found the needle
Then proceed to, invest in water, cows, and diesel
And sour diesel, wholesale banana trucks
Hotels in Panama, no dope sales, we're manning up
Unplug the cord, debug the store
We love the lord, but keep getting drug into war
What's the gun for? If all we're doing is talking
What are you doing marching when all of these humans starving?
The diamond's like, shine a light, they got it right
Or, we can set it off like dynamite
The balance is found, Los Angeles bound
In a van full of cannabis pounds
We came back to stick our flag in the ground
If you're down, put your damn hands to the clouds

Shit
Your paint brush might have made the stars in space
But they ain't got nothing on my partner's face

Burn the older testaments of what we used to struggle with

You complain but you're still in the soaking rain
Hoping that she'll come and open up the drain
The years go by, you grow that grain
Until you try to find a bowling lane where somebody knows your name

I wish it was as simple as a sitcom, from the 80's
I wanna crack jokes and raise babies
With a laugh track and ""Aww"" for the shit the kids do
""Ooh"" and whistles every time that I kiss you

Girl, I wanna call the front desk and tell them everything's messed up
The whole world's messed up

But life is limited if time is how you measure it
Nobody's innocent
Let's quit pretending such
Just let it finish up so this message can self-destruct
And I don't know my high from low anymore
I'm just trying to do my best
Trying not to get carried off the floor
Climb down the fire escape and throw the mask in the trash
We drowning in a tidal wave from a bath tub splash
And when they finally try to harvest a colony
It's probably when everybody is around an olive tree
It's likely gonna be too late to crown a hero
But we can make a statement making party at Ground Zero
And I can do this to ya all night long
But uh, no matter what, I'd still be doing ya wrong
And when I'm strong enough to break out of my eggshell
I wanna hear the ladies yell like I've aged well

Now I believe I've got the right of way
To make a brighter day
Instead of wasting life away
Waiting for lights to change
You not seeing me
I'm swallowed by the scenery
Camouflage my injuries
Channel all my energies
I leave room for the lens to shift
Should've predicted or presumed that you'd be sensitive
But every story needs a conflict, an ours is
I can't find a fuck to present you with
And baby it's the same song whole world singing it
Some of us just humming along some of us really bringin' it
And if it fires up a fraction of the sleeping giant
May we live long enough to see the times that redefine it
And I'm certain all that pain is for a purpose
Makes no difference who's the first one to write their name up on the surface
Some day your work will find its way to get observed
It's just there's too many words and nobody's getting heard
