Portugal. The Man,"Do you ever listen
For the sounds that your hands make?
Did you know that
We could make sounds?

I don't know what the palace knows
But I don't run with sheep
The shepherd can't herd me
My feet ever slow
The age that takes me
I'll slip out to the mountains 
Where nobody knows me

I will make my home here
I will make my home here
I will make my home here

Grow a field of plenty
To hold me tight and keep us warm
From the cold that burns me
My feet ever slow
The age that takes me
I'll slip out to the mountains 
Where nobody knows me

I will make my home here
I will make my home here
I will make my home here

Do you ever listen
For the sounds that your head makes?
Did you know that
We could make sounds?

I don't know what the palace knows
But I don't run with sheep
The shepherd can't herd me
My feet ever slow
The age that takes me
I'll slip out to the mountains 
Where nobody knows me

I will make my home here
I will make my home here
I will make my home here

I will make my home here
I will make my home here
I will make my home here

I know that I was fine before 
Fine before, fine before
I know that I was fine before 
Fine before, fine before

Portugal. The Man,"Mornings go best with the sunrise,
The sunrise I used to see
But will never see now,
Even if I was waiting, we would just build it all up,
We'd look around until we find, we find 

The people found the mountain,
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the cracks in the sky
And threatened to fall,
Still I don't believe, no I don't believe.
And we'll be just fine, and we'll be just fine.

The future was born with the sunrise,
The sunrise that builds into days and even more years.
And as it rolls burning,
Burning up like the trails (of the comets pulled tails)
We'd look around until we find, we find 

The people found the mountain,
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the cracks in the sky
And threatened to fall,
Still I don't believe, I don't believe.

And we'll be just fine, and we'll be just fine.

As the sun it rose up from the belly of sea,
Found his bedding of clouds where it hung for years,
Still I don't believe.
While colors rained and poured from the cotton bound
Pools and the drips,
The drips stained us all, painted us all,
Still I don't believe.

The people found the mountain,
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the cracks in the sky.
Still I don't believe, I don't believe.

The people found the mountain,
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the cracks in the sky.
And I don't believe, I don't believe.
And we'll be just fine, we'll be just fine.
We'll be just fine, I don't believe.
No, I don't believe. No, I don't believe.",Mornings,2009

Sitting in the stars
Glistening, glistening
Waiting for the band to come
Just waiting for that man to come

Slip on down from that sun
To climb down to earth
And down to things like time
Because we are all, we are all just lovers
Born of earth and light like all these others

The moon might sing about the universe

It's grinding like gnashing teeth foaming out, foaming out
Mixing up that hell to come
Just mixing up the hell to come

Fixing up to swallow me whole

Are you living your teens in a shed?
Is growing up giving you the bends?
My little sunshine getting jealous
Of the moonbeams feeling gloomy
In your bed?
Left your friends
Where the pavement ends
Little broken bones begins
But can you hear me now?

There's glitter falling
And a banner that says
Welcome to Hell
Make yourself at home
Leave behind free will
Can you feel me now?

You know I can't feel this pain in my heart
Because it's honestly been falling apart
Maybe I'm too blind to see
Why trouble finds me
But if it's here I'm gonna see where it leads
Call me Mr. Lonely

You can call me anything
Call me if you know me
You can call me King
I don't know if you think below me
You can call me anything
Call me if you know me
You can call me King
While they're hanging out below me
You can call me King
I don't think you wanna know me
Don't call me
Call me Mr. Lonely

The stars are falling
And I bet they got some stories to tell
Been not long ago
When I knew you well
Listen for a change
Can you hear it now?

You know I can't feel this pain in my heart
Because it's honestly been falling apart
Maybe I'm too blind to see

She left me naturally
She left with Natalie
They left in the back of a taxi
They was laughin' at me
So I lit the club
Bottles up, poppin' shit
False sense of happiness
Perhaps I'll take what I get
I guess it's better than nothing, right?
At least I got this blunt to light

I got a Brooklyn honey and she don't want me for my money
Laughs at all my jokes, especially when it's not funny
And I confess that I'm her all true man
She got a fly hairdo, little trinkets on her hands
Her ears is pierced, and in them diamond trunks
My rhymes is fierce, so won't you back up off her punks
Junk in her trunk, so I know the brothers sweat her
But that's OK, cause I know she know better
More cakes than Drake's and more things than ring-dings
It ain't no need to try to gas her to swing
She's not impressed, by your fancy car
She got a body so she's snotty and she don't care who you are
So don't get mad and diss her reputation
Callin her a floozy, any conversation
Mad grammar backstabber, girls they want to be her
But like Stevie Wonder, none of y'all can see her!
So when your fellas turn, just learn to keep lookin
Cause I got me a flower, that grows in Brooklyn

That grows in Brooklyn

Walkin down the street, fellas go by watchin her sayin
	""Hey baby.."" -> Sadat X
	""Hey baby.."" -> Sadat X
	""Boom, the bip, the boom bip.."" -> Q-Tip
Here's a little quote, from Anita Baker
Give the best to God, so won't you move with the shaker
I come back like a boomerang-ah
Make women wind, like a zoom to zang-ah
You fellas want to know if I can hang?  Yeah, yeah
All you ladies want to know if I can hang?  Owwwwwww
I rips the show I gets the dough I licks you low I let you know
that times have passed that fast -- dere it go!
I see your girl, I know she right
I run that Johnny Gill line and say, ""You sho' look good tonight""
But alas, that's the past, I'm not hookin
I got me a flower, that grows in Brooklyn

	""ya, why'know, ya ya why'know.."" -> ?
Brothers in the neighborhood don't like my style
They don't likes the way I walk, they don't like my smile
But when I go see her they don't try to play me though
They give me a pound and say, ""We know you from the video""
And by the way, do you live on Canarsie?
Nah, but much respect to the Brooklyn posse
I step to the rear, cause I don't want no beef baloney
They might know my name, but now look, they don't know me
Nots to worry, cause the kid is thorough
Prepared for riffin any town street or borough
Cause you know, there's a Brooklyn wherever you go
And every girl, there's a flower that's dyin to grow
So when I'm town, you know I'm at her hut
Loungin like a Band-Aid, in the cut
And when I get dat feelin, uhh!
Legs hit the air, footprints get left on the ceiling
She came a tight end, and she left a wide receiver
I make white girls a believer ever since the Jungle Fever
I came a long way to say she's taken tooken
And that's why she's my flower, that grows in Brooklyn

Now it's your friends you gotta worry about, to say the least
Cause man, they're stickin to ya kid without the grease
Runnin game in the name of fame
Or talkin about every nice little thing for ya that they've done
And they've done nuttin now too late you learn
Cause all they wanted was uhh, somethin in return
That's a flam and a scam, you can tell I ain't gas it
Bite a check on my rep, and then later, try to cash it
But I got more bounce to the ounce, what I'm sayin
Seven and a half ounces, braincells, on the way in
Cause momma ain't raised none, I ain't changed none
I got work in my work and it stays done
A man twenty-three years yes I've grown
And I've learned that I can do bad on my own
I don't need a friend cause, I've got a brand new car
All cause I'm a, hot new rap star
Maybe cause my bank account is so profound
And since you're my friend, I gotta put you down
Anyway I know clout, only respects clout
And it's your friends kid, you got to worry about

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
It's your friends, oh yea your friends, YOU GOTTA WORRY ABOUT

[Positive K]
A let me tell you let me tell you who your friends are
Your friends ride around, in your new car
They ask for dough when they know you just got dough
They call your house every minute on the hour yo
Talkin bout - let's hang - you don't want to hang
You want to go wild maybe do your own thang
But they get mad, and they sweat that
Cause what ya got man they know they can't get that
And they don't take no for an answer either
They want to see you drivin round like you're Alex Rega
But you can't see, you're not a +Taxi+
that bring girls around when they know you got a main G
Cause that's the person that you spend time with
and spend the time with, it does not combine with
what they want to do, and what they want to do
is hang and if you can't somethin gotta be wrong with you
So tell me why a woman takes a man hand
and tells him things, that makes him feel grand
Large and (?) you're my knight in shining armor
Known this woman, from a soap opera drama
Weak in wickedness I know how you kick it miss
I know you're gonna say who's gonna pay before he's stickin this
Now you're caught without a thought, no need to pretend
Who hooked you up with this girl huh, a friend
No one wants to be around when you're down and out
Cause it's your friends kid, you gotta worry about

[Chorus]

[Positive K]
A nevertheless I, don't like to stress abouts I
Likes to take it easy, do my job, dat's why
My so-called friends, I grew up with
Either fell off, smoked out, or just ain't shit
And the rest I just don't like
And if I see him again, I swear we're gonna fight
But I'm a cool brother, thanks to my mother
And a friend, I really don't need another
But I got peeps, peeps that's true
And on my record - I'm singin all praises due
Just for givin 'em each day, I'm livin on that
To the babies I got to put the Positive in 'em
Cause I'm a loner and known to entrepreneur
And I'm sure you see more..
Whoever made up, the word friendship?
They need to get beat, up with a slave whip
Because they never knew, of what a friend would do
Cause when you're down and out, they never helpin you
They always lead you on, and they sing a song
And when you need 'em somethin's always goin wrong
They said I'm broke yo, I'm on welfare
I didn't have dough, I couldn't get there
My mom is sick, my sis is pregnant
My father's drunk, my house is hectic
And then they flip the script and say I need a quick G
Or couldn't you spare a beat?  c'mon, this is me
You know you'll get it back, aiyyo yea that's a fact
I've already lost a job, and plus be smokin that
Off with you give the dough, cause youse a true friend
But what ya know now if you only knew then
He wouldn'ta got jacked, for the big smack
And it's only right, because it's like that

in order to be the boss
I was on it but knew how she was livin
And every time I seen her it seems that I was driven
possess will possess you like +The Exorcist+
She was, so bad the devil's son-in-law he couldn't even resist
It was said in the bed she was wicked
Married men - they couldn't help but stop and kick it
Fellas passin her was harassin her
""You got a man,"" they was frequently askin her
And she loved that, stone to the bone
And wouldn't give it up, not even for a happy home
Not for a man and a family
But every Friday night, they was bettin that she was sure to be
at your local discotech
Dancin dirty, uhh, and workin up a sweat
The neighborhood heart breaker
And once you made her yours, the next man would come and take her
away to the Casbah
Because you didn't have it goin on, up to par
I'm a million dollar man but I'm not Steve Austin
You can take the cake but what's the cake without frostin
Success ain't nothin without someone to share it with
Except a girl with a Robin Givens starter kit
She did it hit it and quit it and now she's gone
See ya! But ya know I know

To top it off, she had a ninety-two Jetta
Now that's a girl who love to ball
She didn't want a lot of things cause hey, she wanted it all
Him, him and him
Yeah the guy with the Benz and the five-star rims
She had a million dollars in nickels and dimes
And sat around and counted 'em all a million times
She was tall, fly, and skinny
And if you don't know I'm talkin bout Minnie the Moocher

Postage Era,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night 
Take these broken wings and learn to fly all your life 
You were only waiting for this moment 
For your moment to arise blackbird 
Singing in the dead of night 
Take these sunken eyes and learn 
To see all your life you were only 
Waiting for this moment for the moment 
To be free blackbird singing in the dead 
Of night take these empty lungs that cry 
To sing eventually all your lies the ones 
You wasted for were only waiting for this 
Moment now your moment passed you by 
Blackbird fly into the light of the dark black night.",Blackbird,2002
Poster Children,"Underneath the broken mask
Expose the skin in a flash
The skin reflects a silent trust
In between two who are touched

The perfect are marked for life
The slow decay they try to hide
We are told not to watch
An image says so much

Surrounded by these photographs
Each one has a negative
In the spring two more jumped
On this day she'll become one of us

",One of Us,1995
Poster Children,"I'm wide awake and you're fast asleep
Here in the dark, watching you dream
My mind is tied up in the sheets
Lost in a thought I'll never leave

Monday arrives as Sunday escapes
Locked up inside, it's raining again
Starting to stall caught in the gray
Can't tell if I'm too early or too late

",Wide Awake,1995
Poster Children,"You say that you have got an open mind
But it's your mouth that's open all the time
Tell me how you're going to save the world
Screaming fire in an empty theater

Another heaven with another name
Revolution is always a day away
Strong opinions are not strong enough
The sky is falling, time to wake up

Get a life, get a life
Take a chance and change your mind
You're out of touch, you're out of time
Take it all, get out of line

Riots are red and violence is blue
Question them before they question you
It doesn't matter which side that you're on
When there's no difference between right and wrong

No one told me that the world was flat
Don't go too far you might fall off the edge
This is not the place I want to live
Where good energy rules with an iron fist

",Get a Life,1995
Poster Children,"There's a gun aimed at your head
Loaded with all that you said
One false move and bang you're dead

The machine that drove you here
Is getting difficult to steer
In reverse and high gear

From the TV to the tabloids
From the radio to the grave
From the headlines to the red line
You've been crowned king for a day

Crucified yourself again
All you've got is one free hand
Let us help you nail it in

We all want to see the crash
Slowing down as we drive past
You're not the first, you're not the last

From a leader to a loser
From a master to a slave
From a hero to a zero
You've been crowned king for a day

",King for a Day,1996
Postmen,"There's girls I've been in love with I smoked pot with
I've met enough things in life
I need this woman to get stuck with
Scuff with I need it for my rude character

And my cold temperature
It's the main topic might marry her
In mind she's with me shy smile made her pretty
We took boat trips around the city

I told her how this world became evil and disputed polluted
Buildings and monuments just sooped
It we talked about a livin' I'm still missing but I pray for
Want to buy her stuff that she adored but I was raised poor

Covered my sorrow praise them for a better day tomorrow
'Cause all I have I borrowed bought myself lotto's
Live on a hustle exploiting talents is my motto
Produce half my world for money and more to follow

My sins will be committed on a female body and
If I die it's between legs police claiming pussy got me
 
Fly cocktail about a fly female
Explain what I feel without further details
We had future plans but she wasn't keepin' it real
She broke my damn heart that's the deal, that's why
 
Love left me with a hangover
Fly cocktail I will get over you yes
You don't treat me right
Still Jah is my guide on this road to life
 
I gave her lots of lovin' but she returned me nothing
She couldn't give me no respect she's flexin' with a lot of men
I finally left her in the cold took back my heart she stole
'Cause when l called her on the phone she often put me on a hold
No baby no this is not my steelo

I see so many eyes spy when I mingle with my people
Dwell single that's the sequel
When we was real you gave support
Now you act like you are bored gave your girls your home rapport

From my next to my ex from my ex back to the next
Maybe I did it for the sex maybe I did it to relax
You will never know that's right I keep it to myself
I know you dying inside holding my pillow tight

You was my new flavor couldn't give I never gave ya
Never played ya
Can't understand this strange behavior no longer date ya
We've grown up we splitted up I reminisce about you
While refilling my cup
 
Fly cocktail about a fly female
Explain what I feel without further details
We had future plans but she wasn't keepin' it real
She broke my damn heart that's the deal, that's why
 
You used me abused me
Mentally confused me
Lord no longer will you fool me
Oh no
I thought you was my guided light
Fly cocktail you don't treat me right
 
[Chorus]

I heard from him and him say me that she said she was pregnant
It's been a long time since I stinged her like a cactus
Put on the spot for what I did not
Messed my thoughts claimed support it's not my fault
To make a long story short
She had a miscarriage a broken street marriage
Her daddy kicked her in the belly
Caused a lot of damage
So now she's worried about them one night stands
She didn't plan
She never had a man until she had a Postman.
 
[Chorus]",Cocktail,2000
Postmen,"They come and ask you for your life
Men it's a fever
Let love abide and joy will rise (2x)

The only thing next to meet is the grim reaper
While your life is terrorized by the late fever
They paralyze ya by legalizing the reefer
I know 'cause my nose got the sense of a golden retriever
But trial is on the disbeliever
The highest bidder
We got the cure blowing out ya transmitter
Politics, music it `s all the same but the
Post not to blame for all sorrow and pain
Campaign, 'cause we reign let`s get the
The kabinet changed
Keep ya to ear
To it music and we do it again
Don't let a fever ruin your plan.
The future is at hand
Don't feel accused, but you been used in many attempts

[Chorus]
Everybody likes more freedom and more welfare
More shares of the pot that feeds'em
We talk sense if it ain't teaching
We got demands from a nation that´s starving and dying to get a chance
Where's you heart at take part of a dream starting
Increased violence in the luxury life supported
Already thought it would lead the way the finger points to
'cause they're the ones that really you.

Men the air you breath only temporary
No money can?t compete
Against the value of life we all know we need
Squeeze the fever out of breathers to lust for greed
Life's a breeze can't seem to live comfortably
Global politickin judging us scarfully
Plus the streets never really took care of we
Packin heat as means to live carefully
Reality fever

[Chorus]
Young life insecure not sure about wrong or right
What is it that makes you fight
And why live it we know it ain't not permitted
But it does in the streets
Where there's rules and they not to keep
Opposite things a state of mind poverty brings.
We tell you about jobs and the value of market it in
Put a target on print for the bombardment
Generals marched in roll out the red carpet
There's control by the fever at the bank, it runs where the money goes
Everybody love it that's how grows
Pullin plugs on a mind that is easily bugged
They get you drugged, get you what?

I hurt you screaming out loud we commercial
Shots are verbal, virtual ?? to nurse you
We celebrated because the value now has elevated
A permanent fact the underground buzz vaporeded
The luggage has changed the travel remains
The more original we came the more power we gained
Now we shower on your cowards that will never maintain
Just a new formula arranged we never switched lanes
A little action on the snaredrum pattern, the drums attacking
A draggin' bassline, howling guitars and piano stabbin'
Expend from my Dutch network to Hamburg
Analyze this revolution kid it is handsworth
And of course the lord protect us from falling
Ain't we all and same
It's first falling and it seems we are walking again
From rockbottom now we got something
We never give it up we live it up and still?

A lot a labba labba talk them already start fi run there mouth
Don't know how things a gwan but still them every where about
Where I see some try to use me like a dummy handing out
Me dun seen a couple of them so me just steady check them out
A lot of friends them no friends try to ride like a trend
Fishing for a dollar lend just to come back again
Me no greedy man but me no like no cheeky man 
Hypocritical like them a work for Babylon so

[Chorus]
We never claimed rasta we're just reggae lovers
And from the first stone laid we were hiphoppers
And now the game changed a bit
You're hearing our name in your crib
Fronting on your moms because she is singing our hits
Hate to see your sister screaming when she is grabbing my wrist
Hate to hear your daddy tell you what real music is
So how your still in denial while we're climbing the list
The problem is we just don't quit
Live it up
See them try always these pacified fools
But them can't overrule what we do

Gotta get that dough like I just passed go

Drinkin a little boo and then they had enough of that
Dark is what I do can never get enough yak
But when I do what I do while they mixin em
What I gotta ask
Sane lookin man gon make me three
Cups of delicious K.C. Tea
That's Hennesy, Sprite and lemon
If you got better than that you gotta make me see
Off in the club fucked up
And I got all of my bucks up
Twenty women at the bar right next to me
Every one of them just lucked up

It's so wonderfully all good and everything's superb
I got the herb, I got my Hen mixed in with the Bird
So hear the word, potna, I'ma look up
A bunch of monkeys, so then we can get the hook-up
That ain't a problem cause you is like kin with me
I said you been with me, you sipped gin with me
A true potna won't hesitate to dial the crew
Cause if it's foul with me, I know it's foul with you

Sidin shotgun at the sideshow
I show no love if your shit ain't came back, so
They can't fade Young Rube the Rascal

Me and my killa [Name] run and let the thoughts soak
Forget about [Name] and Little Skinny, shit
We gon' do it right and do it right, slick
And come up at em loose with my trouble hounds
Fuckin with the proof and not the double downs
In this thang ain't no suckers that I'm runnin with
Old school way back is all I'm comin with
And play the dominos like a nympho
(Come on, man, it's on you, dude) tint them windows
And potnas are reserved for the dunk funk
You get em juiced and find your ass with gorilla dumps
And dying for each other's just way real
So get it tight when you're comin for the rough skill
They after the crew, I gives a fuck and I'ma go 'head
And put a hollow slug up in they fo'heads
Doin time for all the backstabbin trick hoes
I'll do a solid any day for my potna, doe

Who got dank, man, I need a response
Now money, watch out, cause I got twomps
Whether it's Tallyho, bombs or hay
And about the women, man, it's Cock Holiday
Had it goin on since young types
Done been through Converse and to' down Nikes
So come get with this jamboree
Where we're treatin our potnas like family
Down as the ground straight from the 'Joe

Come on and ride on the funk

I'm comin throooough like a drifter
Suckers swim, let the funk uplift ya
Another plot from the playa's point of view
Fo' deep, been through a joint or two
And young ????? want to jock and rag
But heffas don't trip if you get the nag
I hook it up for the late night holiday
I got the killer crossover plus they can't stop the trey
It's all major when the pager starts to chirp
I got hoes or maybe I got dirt
A product of the city, slick in the oven
Lovin to hear the funk when the head starts pervin
Drinkin that stuff that'll kill ya
I got so much love for my familia
And real potnas on the slippedy slide
Forget about your troubles and take the ride

If you ask me, it's time for Young Rube to kick it
I got the cup full of hard brown liquid
So sick with this, don't forget the melody
Now I know how I feel to be a celebrity
I snap my fingers when I want some punani
You think I'm bluffin ?????
I ain't gotta lie to kick it or lounge
I'm in a circle of funk and never out of bounds
And then my potnas say what to do now
Cognac to the head, boo-yaw
I heard the competition flowin local
That's when Young Rube said he'd go vocal
Behind a funked out, bumped out earthquake
All songs stuck on strong upon the first take
So come inside on a ride, pony, giddy-up
Break em off a chunk that'll funk the whole city up

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Chezski ]
I'm thinkin if I should stop and do it all again
I'm in and out of traffic with an evil grin
Ridin with the funk ain't but an old trend
And I push up on the gas and let the tail spin
And maintain with the whole Bay
I give it to em rough and try to fly straight
I'm sideways I just smell the tires burn
Funk ride heated when the spokes turn
Let it coast as the rump shakes
Short stop, they caught me with my running mates
I gotta watch for the lead shot
Sucker fools tryin to stop us goin top notch
And let Potna Deuce ride
To the funk and the feelin of the Bay's vibe
We bring it out from the trunk quick

I need yokes on a bitch I want to get with
I need a old school mob with a shift kit
Left, right, head bobbin, mob type of chaos
All you punks talkin jeal', tear the shit way off
Cause I ain't with the funny style charades
I rather hit 'em doggy while I'm tuggin dookie braids
I'm talkin bad muthafucker with the sick rappin
I'm talkin slang from the turf and not the pig latin
My pops told me when I was at the AJ
Never become a suspect of a date rape
If she don't want ya you don't need her
You don't buy her clothes, you don't feed her
Never would I cross over for applause
Never would I save a hoe for the drawers
""Can't we all get along"" was the question
That they shot to the blacks and the Mexicans
Answer came back like this, potna, ""Eat a dick""
Shit is fucked up and you too blind to see a trick

Crack my cranium, check what's inside

Feelin like a bloodclot
I'm stuck in a state, weary of the jack move
I couldn't stand the rock, I stay hip to the black groove
Playa pimpin shittin for the swingers, man
House parties bunk, gettin out of hand
Young buck strivin for the cockola
15 and couldn't wait till I was older
At that point didn't think about carryin
A fat gat, all my potnas, they be buried in
And now I'm my twenties and I'm like fuck
I got the rabbit's foot searchin for the right luck
And house parties shut down before they get started
A young fool had to go and try to get retarted
That's how it goes in the nine-o, I can't deny it
I'm out to get mine, pockets never on a diet
Black on black and brown on brown

And really when you think about the pain stroke
Busy tryina do for me and all my kinfolk
I hate it when I'm lookin at my po' father
Strugglin to keep his head above the risin water
But still he's gotta push in the cold wind
Take a look up at his life till it soaks in
And promise to myself when I'm holdin fat
I'ma break him off a chunk and give some love back
Get it 'fore they do is how the game's played
I try to follow rules and mama cool-Aid
Then again I'm lookin up for the steep hill
My people first, and need a nother refill
And brothers on the search for the good job
Tired of bein labelled as an old slob
But never does he find what he look fo'
A lotta jobs for the rich and none for the po'

I'm from Vallejo, California where the players dwell
Where the game and the city run parallel
And don't trip, tie your shoes when you about yo scratch
And don't let a bitch be the reason to funk, that's
A move used by them aliens, man
You better stick to your plot and to your game plan
And eh, cut me with the fiasco
And bring that ass, hoe, and all that cash flow
And touch down when your game is tight
And trust not a motherfucker, ain't that right?
And don't play the role of a lollypop
And don't trip, hit a hoe if the bitch say stop

And to the hoes out huntin for up my wallet

So Tallyhoe and tell a hoe
About the young playas mobbin' in Valley-Joe
( ? ) as I change I switch, I watch
I trust Mr. Heckler and Mr. Crotch
Not a stank to set me straight
Have my baby want bank and lit the lley
I goes about not like a trick

I got a brand new freak, and man, I'd say she proper
And it's all tremendously good and great, glorious
Smooth sailing and victorious
And about the old one, I had to fly the coop
Cause when you hunger for the loot, bitch, you get the boot
Size 10 to the chinny-chin-chin-a
And like that I had to do-koo-kin ya
So get ghost, adios, hit the roses
You been waved, my peace of mind has been saved
By the new freak and she's lovin this Latino
Showin off, lettin me know
Sexin is spectacular
I starts on the bottom, but ends up in the back of her
Hittin them, gettin them nice and juice

You see, all my young potnas want to sneak a peek
Cause she got the cool grill with the cool trunk
That be hittin like Pippen on the alley hoop dunk
Last freak wasn't meant for poppa
She was fickle and predictable like a soap opera
Had to stop her in the tracks from makin me go savage
Let the hoe go, now Rube is blowin so lavish
I thought you knew, freak 2 is so righteous
Put her on the top of my list of my pipe bust
I might just open a bottle of ??why-Zippendale??
Show my new thang how poppa is livin swell
Put her in a spell, take her to the motel
It's all good, but I kicks down no mail
Cause I got no loose change and no time for games
Ain't nothin here ever strange, mang
Cause poppa's on top of thangs

y'all don't understand about the Hillside hound hoggin
I creeps up on the proper for they want some of
The gut-runnin killer, call me beaver hunter
And smash up on the guts from the back porch
Give em that tropical vibe from the hot torch
And play the game dirty with my knuckles in it
Freaky little somethin, here I come for the late visit

And swing like a swinger really oughts to

Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl

But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful

Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me

Going hard 'til the day that I'm old

Sipping this Honey Jack shit 'til it's gone

Slap a motherfucker, then I squeak off clean
Can't be sort of macking, bitch I'm candy quarter stacking
Made me snap and grab that ratchet from my Ralphy Lauren fashion
Tech is squeezing this ammo, now rest in peace on his mantle
Took his bitch and killed that pussy like second season Sopranos

12's in the back, got'em kicking like Pelé
Kato on a warm day, might be in L.A.,
Nice breeze, palm trees, hanging with the esés
Heard about the gun ban yesterday my homeboy
Went and got a motherfucking SK
To me that feels mulled off, probably means Zoloft
Can't shake the problems in my life they won't roll off
Lately I've been hanging around Kaine like O-Dog,
Feeling paranoid, am I tripping on all y'all
Life's in Atlanta
I might go bananas
No Basquiat nigga
My paint on this canvas
These voices I hear
When they call me I answer
Keep feeding me rappers
I'll eat 'em like cancer
Aghh
I go ape shit
I am not a human being, speak a different language
Shawty give me stupid head, call the ho brainless
Funny what these sucka niggas do to get famous

Cause you're so easy going, conversations flowin'

And I'm feelin' dizzy, little weak kneed

When you're with me

And I don't know if I can explain it

It's kinda cool ain't it ?


Now I'm not tryin' to move too fast

I've always heard it's best when you take it slow

But girl I'm dying just to take you by the hand

And dance with you all night right here on the patio

Boot leather on a barroom floor, fightin' over a dance hall girl

Give me your gun and come peacefully

I can drop you right here, or you can tell the court your story


Chorus:

Hang me high, hang me low

They're gonna hang me in the morning

Stay away from Jericho, all you rounders,

I give you fair warning


Entered my plea, called it self defense,

a sober judge sittin' on the bench

And I stared into 24 eyes of a hard-nosed Jericho jury

They called it murder in the first degree,

The judge said, son, stand and look at me

Hang him - and may the lord have mercy


Chorus


Thirteen steps to the scaffold high,

the whole town's out just to watch me die

And not one to shed a tear of mourning

Please would you honor my last request,

when they lay me down to rest

Let the epitaph on my tombstone read this warning

If it's in a mob, she can't be my baby mother
You know, I wanna fuck you bitch
But I know, I'm not givin' you one red cent
My dough, ain't helpin' you with your rent
I never been a trick, you oughta pay for the dick

Slidin' on a slab and all she wanna do was rape me
But payin' for some puss, girl, you must be mistaken greatly
You say you wanna taste me, blow and decapitate me
What you need ain't give me gravy, paid me, my dick ain't lazy
Trickin' is dead, holmes, she givin' me head phones
She thick in the red thong, I refuse to be led on
Cause I'm a leader, not a follower
She gon' be a squirter and a swallower
Late night gobbler
Big maniac, she a brainiac, just like she go to Princeton
In a Cadillac, fuck a battle rap, motherfucker, keep it pimpin'

And to inspire, she opened wide, and swimmin' in my denim (You, you, you, you, you bitch)

Same thang I can get out her pussy, I'm a get out her mind
Money in my pocket, good, but it ain't comin' out of mine
If you pay for sexual favors, your trick ass out of line
And with every time I call her phone number (Number)
My neighbor is what she lay her head under (Under)
Ain't no fillin' child support on me unless a nig get pregnant
Bitch, suck it while I'm behind the wheel, that's why I'm drivin' reckless

Did it however which way I could've, then I kicked her up out the Hummer
Nothin' but a head hunter, and she wanna taste me
Bitch, pay me, this dick ain't free
I said on how she bring it back, so how the hell could I pay for that

Tha name is Krayzie
Big Bad Ass Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash
Even took the mayor's daughter
Now that theres kidnappin
But she was wid it so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double crossed by the law so theres nobody to run to 
Yeah, its just me and my sawed off shotgun
Outlaw, call him Leather Face
Im headed for the west
Heard they gotta couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well uh, I oughta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time to get tha whole run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin dark so now Im watchin for them damn Injuns
They like to catch ya
Then they rob and split
I be a rootin tootin shootin damn fool
Protectin my chips
All of a sudden 
I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse
Whoa Nellie!
Who in the bushes?
Ya betta speak out
Or Ima let my shotgun song sing out

Who is this?
Hope this ain't tha law
Drawed out tha bushes with my sawed off shotgun

Come on out
Right now, Im gettin angry
Took a step back cuz it could get dangerous

Please don't shoot its just me, Thug Queen, a horse stealer

Then why the hell is you hidin in them bushes?

Im wanted in four counties 
For armed robbery
Killed 2 sheriffs, 6 of his best men with my hands
Stole 2 horses
Thought you was the law 
Thats why I jumped in tha bushes

Goodness
Now she was hotter than a barrel of fire
But I could use her for the job
So I told her to ride
C'mon

May I ask whatcha headin to the west for?

Cause you're wasting my time girl we just don't get on

Picking over the bones of the love that remains

I feel I've got such a long way to go
We got lost on the winding road
I feel its just such a long way through
So if you let go of me then I'll let go of you

Don't resist just relax and let go
You can tend to the seed but you can't make it grow
Don't invent a new way to hold on
'Cause your testing my patience you just don't belong

If life is so smooth why can't I get enough

I'm still lost and running

Everyday moves like a hurricane
That's dragging me around no matter what I say
Night time in the city streets I'm out of luck
The cobblestones are dark and wet there's no one I trust
And it comes around, yeah it comes around
Mr So'Easy say where have you gone
I'm looking for somewhere I can lay down my arms

I'm still Lost and running

I never felt the hook go in
Until you came around
And broke me right back down.

There's just thing that I failed to tell you
I'm wishing on the same moon and stars above you
We're wishing on the same moon

Hear me now I'm calling out for you
Pleading for your love
You're falling from my view and and there's nothing I can do

I'm waiting in the afternoon
For the sun to sink
And let the night back in
It's when I feel close to you
When the stars they swoon
And bring their night time bloom

I'm wishing on the same moon and stars above you
We're wishing on the same moon

Power Tool,"Well, I remember the sparks that flew 
In the summer of '79 
My brother went wild 
For a pretty girl's smile 
But he didn't care that she was mine 

We fought each other 
Like never before 
And beat till we were black and blue 
And when we told her it was time 
She'd made up her mind 
She said, ""I've had it with the both of you"" 

 That was when the pact was made, uh 
No woman could sever 
We swore it brother for the rest of our lives 
We would stick together forever 

'Cause 
Two (two) heads (heads) are better than one 
(Woo hoo hoo) 
It's double the pleasure babe 
It's triple the fun 
I said 
Two (two) heads (heads) are better than one 
(better than one) 
It'll make you come undone 
Two heads are better than one 

Well we found ourselves in Vegas 
The city of sin 
We were restless and looking to play 
When this little blonde dolly 
In the hotel lobby 
Blew a kiss as she walked our way 
She said, ""I'm feelin kind of lonely"" 
And gave us a wink 
Feeling bold we expressed our intentions 
We said, ""you gotta have both"" 
She said, ""That's a joke."" 
""It takes two, just to get my attention"" 

Both to share and share alike, uh 
That's a part of our lifestyle 
So I'm gonna tell you baby 
Just where we stand 
If you won't love us both 
It ain't what's wild 

Because 
Two (two) heads (heads) are better than one 
(woo hoo hoo) 
It's double the pleasure 
Triple the fun 
I said 
Two (two) heads (heads) are better than one 
It'll make you come undone 
Two heads are better than one 

We've come this far together 
It's too late for turning back 
But it's only fair to warn you 
That when you rock with the boys 
You never come back 
(oh no) 
Hey! 

Two (two) heads (heads) are better than one 
(woo hoo hoo) 
It's double the pleasure 
Triple the fun 
I'll tell ya

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kids knock him down.

When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland.

Oh, the weather outside is frightful,
But the fire is so delightful,
And since we've no place to go,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
It doesn't show signs of stopping,
And I brought some corn for popping;
The lights are turned way down low,
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

How I'll hate going out in the storm;
But if you really hold me tight,
All the way home I'll be warm.

Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face

The whole world just fades away

Is the beating of your heart

It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before

Pram,"In the hum of time you stand
Frozen like a stopped clock's hands
Wrapped in the things you wear for comfort
Only your eyes show your terror
Your chalky skin is thick but frail
Like Egyptian paper
And pent blood deafens your brain
Till you think you've let the outside world in

And you're like a star in the heaven
That's cold bright and beautiful
And just like a star in heaven
You're so unreachable

You imagine yourself a statue
To be looked at with a price
Around your neck to show how much you're worth
And how you shouldn't be touched
But you're made of flesh and yearnings
Like all the rest of us around you
No statue ever cried like you
When your mother weaned you",Blue,1995
Pram,"Oh my darling, let's join hands
Go swooping through the air
And at night we'll safely land
And fold our wings with care
We'll have the sun and moon as friends
And wrap ourselves in the silver sky
And there'll be no more to doubt
No more to cry about

One of these days I'll be up in the heavens
Live my life in the clouds
And you'll put aside all your fears of flying
Dance with me on a star",Dancing on a Star,1995
Pram,"Once I thought I was in love
But that was a mistake
For it was a warm feeling
Wrapped around me like a shawl
Learn to love the corners
And the angles of the world
To not love them you'll never live
The only peace is death.

Love isn't a glow or a song in the heart
It's bony fingers tugging through your hair
It's sharp hipbones bruising blue your thigh
It's saying something softly that goes unheard.

Love snarls up the patterns
Of everything you know
It doesn't send you off to space
But buries you instead
Love holds on to gravity
And gravity is love
To love another human is
A puzzle for the head.",Gravity,1995
Pram,"Where are you going?
Come back here I'm helpless without you
I wave my tiny limbs in useless gestures
I need you I am dependent
And when you leave me terror darkens
My mind like crows wings
I can't even form words to tell you
How I need you and how I resent
It that I need you so

I run towards light
Maybe the glow of people
Something warm and enticing
My heaven is other people

Sometimes I would like it if
Everyone did the same thing
I could get a grasp gain control over events
I would bite you but
What would hurt you once would hurt my twice
I have a dark force in my head
Could be used to smooth things over
But wood is full of splinters
And people are nevr doing quite what
You want them to","Little Angel, Little Monkey",1995
Pram,"My heart is heavy as I help you
Into the costume in which you learn to fly
Always chained to somewhere
In case I might hurt myself
Sitting in the sawdust
That's stained by the animals

Twisted leg in iron and plaster
Dragging 'round and 'round
While I dance with my father the clown

While she's in lace and feathers
I'm the one in clumsy shoes
Always being told I damage what I touch

Can I ever be unfettered
Free as she is front of them all
Or must I stay and eat my own skin
Like the lion in the cage",My Father the Clown,1995
Pram,"If I could record the moment
Just before you leave I'd never
Let it go
To never have to recognize that
I live in the boundaries of my own
Skin and bones

When I'm on my own I hear
My heartbeat like a clock's ticking
Filling the room
And the gentle dark hands of the shadows
Clasped in corners in the gloom

If I could I'd merge with you
Forever live as one as whole complete inside
But I'm afraid that you don't want that
And one day you'll poison me and leave with relief

Like a soldier when you're dressing
Going to do battle with the Town
And I lie here frightened how much
I am tempted to pin you down",Shadows,1995
Pram,"There's no moon today
Because of the yellow light
That hovers live a faint fur
Over the rooftops
Blocking the sky from sight
If you're never left in the darkness
Then you never feel alone
And the things that are left on the pavement
Means that you're never ever alone

I could sing a lullaby to them all
Nighttime over the tannoys
Wish them safely home

Outside my bedroom window
The night will never fall
It stays outside the city
Like a glove waiting to be worn
If you're never left in the darkness
Then you never feel alone
And the noise that thickens up the air
Means you're never ever alone",Things Left on the Pavement,1995
Pram,"The sky keeps on weeping
The sun is sleeping
Don't wake the moon
The light would show the cracks in her face

The earth on its ancient last legs
Wobbles round the sun
Like a drunk around a lamp post
And I shut my mouth sore from cursing
And my eyes that are tired of seeing

If I could shake off this feeling
Of being guilty for living
Of never doing what others wanted
Of simply being inconvenient

Then suddenly the sun could warm me
To the marrow of my skeleton
My mind could ride the breezes
Hover and flutter in the cold air",Crooked Tiles,1995
Pram,"Something's gone and something's over
You put the pieces of yourself together
Put them all into a suitcase

And there you'll find yourself safe again
You won't make the same mistakes again

All your anger and misgivings
Tie your shoes up, polish your mask
But all your anger and misgivings
Makes you tattered round the edges

You think there's a better a place for you
Where everything will be brand new
And there you'll find yourself safe again
You won't make the same mistakes again

Next time someone comes along
Gets close enough to pull a loose thread
All of you comes crashing down
And there you are back where you started

You think there's a better a place for you
Where everything will be brand new
And there you'll find yourself safe again
You won't make the same mistakes again",Loose Threads,1995
Pram,"Suddenly I notice that the brightness of the day
Makes the shadows darker, makes the shadows deeper
As they creep from the corners and a feeling in myself
As if I were weighted down with lead

Somebody's whistling in the winter sunlight
Some old bitter song that makes me want to shiver

All the hours are hanging as if caught on celluloid
Reeling ever closer, coiling ever tighter
As if they conspired to conceal from me
The secret of my gloom

Somebody's whistling in the winter sunlight
Some old bitter song that makes me want to shiver

Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

One, two
And you don't stop
Yo!
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'mma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Trying to find what's really going on in the streets

Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pot of beret
Kick your balls like Pele, pick 'em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling ""Ole!""
Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K. to Cali

Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
2-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

Well I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, 
I'm hanging out partying with girls that never die
The C.O picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar

Hey, yeah
Ooh

Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go (illusion)

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air?
Never let your feeling let you down
Open up your eyes and look around
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go (illusion)

Hey, yo I don't write love songs leave it up to Luther Vandross
How I choose to live, you don't wanna know the cost
I paid to be the boss, hear it straight from the source
Fortune 500 is how I like to gloss
High side, Korneesh Style, joy ride
Blowin' candles in the wind like Princess Di
Get at me, mom, tell me how you really like it
'Cause we could fly high, I'll be your co-pilot

Hey, yo back to the girl with all the razzamatazz
(Hey, yo, I love you shorty) You talkin' all that jazz

Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go
I know you want me but you play me like the lotto
Use and abusin' so there won't be no friction
I gotta leave, I can't be in this illusion

Oh, oh (It's just an illusion)

Through many dangers, toils, and snares

Heh, yeah.  Aaight.  Just count me up in here, aaight?
Yeah.  Uhh.  Uhh.  Uhh.

Verse 1
First and foremost let's distinguish the boys from the men
The start to a end, a foe from a friend
Who next of kin when I bust this iron across yo' chin, nigga?
Let me extend payments due on your arrangements
Turn on the news, nigga, listen to the latest development
Extra extra, read all about it
Master Pras always Bout-It-Bout-It
Bring tears to your fears when I shout it, shout it
??? believe, though he doubt it, doubt it
Yeah, what's all the fussin' and bickerin' for
Yeah, few shots up your ass, hear from you no more
For sure you belong with an M-16
Stand in front of the door, that you just can't ignore
Go figure.  Hit the floor, nigga
Random shots - run for your life, nigga
This goes for my niggas who gets no bigger
Sweat on your forehead, let's see who pull quicker

Chorus:
Yeah, murder dem.  Murder dem.  In a, competition me go, murder dem.
Wha' what, follow dem.  Hm.  Follow dem.  
In this, situation me no, follow dem when me gone.
All pussi haffi run when me gun.  All cowards haffi run when me gun.  
No man haffi come 'cause we, murder dem.  Hm.  Murder dem.

Verse 2
I'm livin' on danger's ground, where the danger's mine
Hold firm, stand strong, 'bout to blow like land mine
Never mind, draw, reach for yours, I'ma go for mine
Leave you paralyzed with a broken spine
They seize and they shrine in the line of fire
Retreat, recline, from all firearm
Ring the alarm, bring the bomb squad, word to God
Got your number, nigga, watch I'll pull your cord
Pardon me, sincerely yours
Down by law, out to settle the scores
Haters shoutin', ""No, he can't be no more!""
Parasite, leachin' down, rottin' to the core
Cash rule, jewels cool, drown in my whirlpool
'Scuse my rudeness, rudeboy from Providence
These fists of fear remain to be fearless
Move like flyin' ??, full automation
Pumpin' carbon monoxide through your blood circulation
Separate these facts like segregation
Trial and tribulation, high expectation
The brigade shut off, backs seen me run off
Cagein' with Nicholas, it's a face-off
What?  Yeah!  Hah, mmm!

Chorus

Verse 3
In case you didn't know, it's the P-are-A-S
Got strategies like playing chess
Penetrate through your flesh, yes, hit me with your best
Got issues to address, nonetheless
Checkmate, only makin' moves with my playmate
Prakazrel is Pras when it's abbreviate
My puncture is accurate, nigga you dead weight
Dislocate every bone in your body
Then sit back and evaluate
Every mental ?? process is isolate
Preception is clear with my steel, I should demonstrate

Come clean, nigga what, with an 18

Uh, yeah, huh, yeah
Yo, yo, yo, I'll do a double dish cleaner 
The funny ass cats remind me of a skinner
Now you listen up, now what, heat on spitter

A renegade with my blade watch you get cut up
Sucker ass punk, you used to get beat up 
Type of dude that'll smoke your weed up and eat up
Hold up, surrender your squad, it's a stick up

Fifty-two pickup, you high school drop-out, gives you enough float 
To succeed or get tighter, what up, your block, get up 
Shut up, or put up I'ma bout to let up 
Licky, licky here, two shots you gone lick up 

Take her to the news under: You should've eased up
Wha' What Wha' you got me fed up, get up or shut the f up 
You done f'ed up, 8 or 9 enough even if she has seven runner up
Like the fans, like your thumbs up, what up?

I make them bowl like Shopper Ranks 
I'm the Captain of the Ship, make them cats walk the plank 
What the f you think I'm point, point blank
Turn off my sound niggas, let... crank

East Side where you at, where you at?
West Side throw it up, throw it up

South Side throw it up, throw it up

See, blaze me above the game with no limit
Niggas nowadays can slick and pull gimmicks 
Cowber use roly well iced that been in it 
Mines is loose rocks and the Beverly spin in it 

Only place tin linid they cost a lot 
When no money on the game you sure talk a lot 
Never like a nigga car, you walk a lot 
See I make cream a lot, while you niggas dream a lot 

Can't you see it's all real, bras want to do me 
Get it attached to me like I'm starrin in movies 
Nigga Nor want to do me, thing is I got none 
want to be my main chick, chill I got one 

If it's hot in a lady then I can cop some
Most players all fall, tightly tint
See me fly through the window cause it's lightly tint 
But its strongly minute got a fall so cats frequent

Hate weed peepin, best cats seekin
want to kill me in the daytime, look it won't happen 
You ain't a thug nigga this is some girls is rap, what
(Yeah you don't won't no problem)

It means it's copper, don't need to stop ya 
When I'm speakin opera, which why'all don't understand 
That it's my channel Boo-Bionic mister man

So our house can finish, wait a minute 
Change the color of my whips, despite you bastards 
Spit it green-cold on it, like you won the masters 

Flow... faster, speed it up, heat it up why don't why'all just heat it up 
Spit it on some feeder bust, slow it up, make the beat that we blow it up

Ah, ha, alright, baby

They don't know how it feels
(When you're out on your own, yeah)
(And you're lookin' for that home)
They don't know what it feels
(When the world's on your shoulder)
(And your baby, gotta be a soldier)

Yo, I was born in the projects, with roaches and rats
And our credentials were our, nines and gats
Stay the hell out the hood read the welcomin' mats
I remember them days, it was hard bein' black

Welfare checks and government cheese
Take your family in portrait, everybody smile say cheese
And it's a wonder how I kept my head from goin' under
Sun don't shine where there's, lightning and thunder

Some got ways, some got means
But still, we all just got hopes and dreams
The two blend together like dope and fiends
Cope with teens, has that new gangster lean

Everybody just wanna be a ghetto star
Fly cribs and drivin' them big cars
That's all Mr.President, hear the voice of the youth
I don't lie, I speak the truth

They don't know how it feels
(When you a single mother)
(And don't have that significant other)
They don't know what it feels
(To be in the ghetto)
(And your life be in slow a mo')

Been around the world a couple times with the refugees
From the boot of Italy to the land of Pawnee
Fell in love a couple times on the London Bridge
Fast cars, fast life, that's how I wanted to live

What a crusade, one of my great escapades
Cut many hearts, like the game of spades
But nuttin' was as fatal when they blew the World Trade
Now we at war momma, tradin' lives for grenades

Send in the troops, here comes the brigades
American resolve and our hearts'll never fade
I know you somewhere out there chillin' in the shades
But I hate to be the one to rain on your parade

See, God is merciful and God bless his children
That's how we gonna reconstruct them buildings
So stop the killings, we runnin' out of graves
In the land of the free and the home of the brave

They don't know how it feels
(To hear our babies cry)
(And watch our mothers die)
They don't know, what it feels
(To see our brothers in prison)
(While they losin' their religion)

These, eyes of mines are like, camera lens
Loved by many but stabbed by my friends
Is this the end? Some may cry out loud
But I won't worry, we gonna make it now

The ghetto fed up but they won't break us down
It's an eye for an eye, what goes around comes around
Do dis for my peeps who couldn't speak
Survival of the fittest, what happens to the weak?

They either in between, above or beneath
Tryin' to play me like a scrub in a passenger seat
Racial profile to say the least
There won't be no peace in the belly of the beast, c'mon

But we gonna make it through baby
Even though the world is so crazy
And if they ask you, tell 'em it's pain times three
'Cause it's a million of them kids stressin' just like me, baby

They don't know how it feels
(To see us go to war)
(And see the people free for no more)
They don't know what it feels
(To be a black man in America)
(And feel like they're comin' to get'cha)

They don't know how it feels
(To work for minimum wage)
(As your life starts to fade)
They don't know, what it feels
(To be down to your last buck)
(And no one really gives a mother, ha)

Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh, uh
From one corner to another, uh, uh

Uh yeah, yo, yo,
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream

Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million refugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top squeezers
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa

They just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on

I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin' it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
Politic with ghetto senators on the deelow

From one corner to another, uh, uh

One, two and you don't stop, yo my eyes is sore, bein' a senator
Behind closed doors hittin' truth to the sea floor
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores

So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself, walkin' the streets
Tryin' to find what's really goin' on in the streets

Yeah, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay

Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin' ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yellin', ole
Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K., to Cali, come on

Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losin fast in the horse race
Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screw face

Well, I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out
Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was
Pickin' on the small fries, my campaign tellin' lies

Was just spreadin' my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holdin' the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understand
It's all together now, in the hood

(When you're out on your own, yeah)
(And you're lookin' for that home)
They don't know what it feels
(When the world's on your shoulder)
(And your baby, gotta be a soldier)

Yo, I was born in the projects, with roaches and rats
And our credentials were our, nines and gats
Stay the hell out the hood read the welcomin' mats
I remember them days, it was hard bein' black

Welfare checks and government cheese
Take your family in portrait, everybody smile say cheese
And it's a wonder how I kept my head from goin' under
Sun don't shine where there's, lightning and thunder

Some got ways, some got means
But still, we all just got hopes and dreams
The two blend together like dope and fiends
Cope with teens, has that new gangster lean

Everybody just wanna be a ghetto star
Fly cribs and drivin' them big cars
That's all Mr.President, hear the voice of the youth
I don't lie, I speak the truth

They don't know how it feels
(When you a single mother)
(And don't have that significant other)
They don't know what it feels
(To be in the ghetto)
(And your life be in slow a mo')

Been around the world a couple times with the refugees
From the boot of Italy to the land of Pawnee
Fell in love a couple times on the London Bridge
Fast cars, fast life, that's how I wanted to live

What a crusade, one of my great escapades
Cut many hearts, like the game of spades
But nuttin' was as fatal when they blew the World Trade
Now we at war momma, tradin' lives for grenades

Send in the troops, here comes the brigades
American resolve and our hearts'll never fade
I know you somewhere out there chillin' in the shades
But I hate to be the one to rain on your parade

See, God is merciful and God bless his children
That's how we gonna reconstruct them buildings
So stop the killings, we runnin' out of graves
In the land of the free and the home of the brave

They don't know how it feels
(To hear our babies cry)
(And watch our mothers die)
They don't know, what it feels
(To see our brothers in prison)
(While they losin' their religion)

These, eyes of mines are like, camera lens
Loved by many but stabbed by my friends
Is this the end? Some may cry out loud
But I won't worry, we gonna make it now

The ghetto fed up but they won't break us down
It's an eye for an eye, what goes around comes around
Do dis for my peeps who couldn't speak
Survival of the fittest, what happens to the weak?

They either in between, above or beneath
Tryin' to play me like a scrub in a passenger seat
Racial profile to say the least
There won't be no peace in the belly of the beast, c'mon

But we gonna make it through baby
Even though the world is so crazy
And if they ask you, tell 'em it's pain times three
'Cause it's a million of them kids stressin' just like me, baby

They don't know how it feels
(To see us go to war)
(And see the people free for no more)
They don't know what it feels
(To be a black man in America)
(And feel like they're comin' to get'cha)

They don't know how it feels
(To work for minimum wage)
(As your life starts to fade)
They don't know, what it feels

Got the masterplan, glance at the Melo stance
Arms are crisscrossed, posture rasta

Rrrrring - I think that's my time

[ VERSE 4: Bass Blaster ]
The biggeda-Bass Blaster with a tongue-twistin rhyme
(This is how we run it down the line)
Yo, literally, literary literature
Six slippery Seals slippin silently ashore
Sally sold seashells down by the seashore
Sold two shells but couldn't see to sell no more
Beautiful babblin brooks bubba between blossom and banks
Brothers above the Brooks take a punch off the plank
A big black bug bit a big black bear, bit him on the rear
The bear was big but the bug didn't care, he had no fear
 
How much would could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Yo, I don't know, all I know is I say it good
Asu, you got the funky, funky rhymes
Yo my brother, run it down the line

[ VERSE 5: Asu ]
Yo, rhymes is rippin and the mic is passed to me
It was too young so they got me for statuatory
Don't take me for granted, punk, yeah, and think I'm worthless
Fuck movin mountains I move planets and you'll be earthless
You don't wanna battle Asu, all I leave is fossils
Lethal Weapons Die Harder cause the Mission's Impossible
And my rhymes is riper, I'm ready to come crisper
Old jacks know that so they go back and whisper
Takin surveys, gettin nervous, I'm just too worthy
They can't stand me and say, 'He can't be from Jersey'

[ VERSE 6: Guru ]
Mad, mad response I'm catchin just as soon as I step into the place
That's why a smile's on my face
I got styles that you trace with haste but I'm too deep
Lots of the ladies I meet, I must be sweet
So I say hold up and wait up and then listen here
My rhymes come crisp and clear, but beware
My format is all that, my concept's refined
The Gang to the S-t-a-double r shines
Chumps be losin it, abusin it, not gainin
So there my gain is they vanish while I'm remainin
And twice as Nice with a Smooth groove I end my rhyme
And yo (this is how we run it down the line)

[ VERSE 7: Smooth B ]
Yeah, lyrical, financial and spiritual
A dream of touchin my style would take a miracle
You didn't know how deadly was my flow as I grow
And bumrush and crush any foe
But I prefer to have a good time when I rhyme
But lately I have had to refine and be sublime
Cause sometimes some people don't understand
That I'm a man with ambitious plans and I stand to live grand
And they fight with all their money invested to hold me back
But now I'm featuring the mack pack
Smooth B, you know I'm feelin fine
(This is how we run it down the line)

I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?

Preacher Rollo,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1998

Some of y'all may think 
That this next track
A little risky for a Luther joint
But all you gotta do is listen to get it
Get it right
Alright, ch'all, lets start from number one
And get down till it's done

Now watch this sketch as I stretch this mall
Too live to drive so we put it in park
With Luther hoping that you feeling his groove
Get you open on the instruments too, one two, one two
And I say, jottin' down the lines
Like dots on the Parkway
My Auntie Eloise say stay on your Q's and P's
And until the days of D's, I'm doin' what I please
Ease on down like the road
Depending on the mood, definitely into more
And you can catch a yellow brick
You need to run and tell your click
That the female in town is bringing it
Now listen, Mission Impossible
Keep it general like the hospital
Shake, rattle and roll, to rock wit' chu
The Pre to the C-I-S-E do

Let's get this thing to workin'
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start it
We all could use the change

Do it till we get
Stay with it and get it right

Never stop, Luther take it to the top
Do it till we get it
Take the time and get it right

Get all up in your back and down your spine
Got to keep it on track like the A train line
To the junction out in Brooklyn
What's your function
Keep you lookin' once again
As I punch in those lines like the SV-1200
Precise on the mic, you
But we gon' get top shot at the party
Started rockin'
And I got first dibs on the dark skinned kid

And I know just how to do it
To make it really nice
There's no mystery to it
Do it till you get it right

We can make it, we can take it right to the top
Come on and never stop
Oh, and let's reach for the sky
And if we keep believing we can never go too high
Why don't we give it a try
Come on and keep reaching up
And don't you worry
No, you won't use up your stuff
No way to get enough
Do it till we get it right
And even if it takes from morning till way into night

Precise,"There's a party in Harlem, come on

I like to reminisce about that night we kissed
It was somewhere one night in Harlem
The nights were hot and bright
You could treat your honey right
?Cause Sylvia's would burn all night

The people there were really something
(You know that's right)
The music always kept us jumping
And it used to knock me down
When Smokey came to town
(And the miracles, please)
My favorite song was ""Tears Of A Clown"", oh yeah

There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
And I'm gonna take my baby back
To the heart of Harlem

Big sister had a group 
And they'd sit out on the stoop
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)
My cousin Joe could blow
Just like the radio
And he used to drove them ""B"" girls wild

But when grandma started happy dancing
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')
She really turned the mother out
I like the way they do it up in Harlem
When there's a party up in Harlem
That's what it's all about

Ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem
They never fake the funk up there
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem
And tonight I'm gonna take her back to the 'pollo

There's a party in Harlem
They say that all the stars will be there
Everyone is going to Harlem
Harlem is a party and everybody's going there

Follow me visually, ?cause I usually be all around
Originally everybody headed uptown
Finessing the fly way you ?cruisin in your car
On the West Side to the highway, East Side D-R
And yes, we are about to set it
Forget it, I thought you knew
The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance
Who frontin' nonchalant up in the restaurant
What you really really want, we grabbin' by the clutch
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much
It's such a love flow, high but natural
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool

Nothing like them nights in Harlem
They really shake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem

Nights in Harlem
They never fake the funk up there
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem
Back to the Harlem Apollo

Nights in Harlem
They don't let you fake the funk up there
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem
I'm gonna take my honey
Back to the Harlem Apollo

Had a really good game but you missed your last shot

Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door

But there's a flip side to all things
So before you sign yourself up to the high life
Make sure you read the small print
Please, listen to me when I'm talking
The guy you're looking at right now is the guy I was this morning
I never had a pen but I made a mark
Even when I top the chart I'll be the same guy that I was at the start

You left Mount Olympus
To find your soul mate

""Dear Pa, this here harvest can wait""

You took a match to my dry August days
Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
Flames licked the sky
That was some summer haze

Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
How do I love you?
Let me count the ways
Cornfield ablaze

Pa don't be angry
The fields that were host
To the corn and the wheat
The fact is they're toast

In self defense
I'm obliged to point out
There'll always a risk of combustion
When there's been a drought

You took a match to my dry August days
Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
Flames licked the sky
That was some summer haze

Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
How do I love you?
Let me count the ways
Cornfield ablaze

Imagine if the firemen worked
And worked for days
And still the cornfield stayed ablaze

Her hair it was golden
Her hair it was yarn
We were playing with fire
In the number one barn

Carried away like two sparks
On a breeze
Then we fused into one
At a thousand degrees

You overwhelmed agricultural man
Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze
You wild pyromaniac daughter of Pan
Cornfield ablaze, cornfield ablaze

You took a scarecrow
And made him a man
Cornfield ablaze

The salted taste of all your tears and woes
Sent me in haste, my melancholy rose
Those tasteless lips were closed
You watched me come, you see me go

Packing my bags for the path of the free
From pillar to post, I am driven, it seems

The ghost of shame, he sits here and sighs
I love the flames like I've loved the cold
I'll learn to love the life of the 'Could I, Could I, Could I'

How could you ask for more

Prefuse 73,"My mind compliance like a science
Analyze my data, not a fader on the face of the earth
Can blend rhythms like my will, surreal spinnin'
Ever-movin' like evolution it's retribution
For sellin' roots, lessen futures, I'm steppin' to fuse? ya
Sun rises my subconsciousness culminates constant
Live to see various I-de-ologies, angles like isosceles
Read my auto-b-I-ography
So many stars? to me that vibrantly shine
Velocity's properly thick like mahogany dimes
We findin' beauty in this urban-gritty usually overlooked by many
Movin' through the densely populated city
And soon and eventually 'we gotta get ova'
I document culture closer to the edge
Bolder than a print, open to interpretation, gazin deep into the glitz?
To my people, raise you fists
I know it stays intent, whatever pays your rent, but saves your soul

Who the poisoned pen?
Mos got the inkwell full of syrum
Prescribed for any emcee claimin' they ill
A small dose'll change the way that they feel
Milligrams in the raw, snow-cut, check how I label the pill
It's MD, the spit-doctor, chant like a witch-doctor
Recite me, and ya whole ailment get proper
I'm the, medicine man, representin' my clan
Mixin' the potion with verse fire and simmer, my man
And stay shoutin' out the home team wherever I am:
It's the B-R-O double akh-K-L-wY-liN out
The cowboys who don't fret to pull they lamas? out
Ironhorse style cab?, hoop-te ville ridin out
No lights, no cam, action, drama'd out
? out, absorb the shit that I'm about
Inner-city Bruno, ghetto folks, holla out
I'm good money, tell the doubters get they wallets out
Hot when the dice is out, they go broke findin' out
Smack ya mojo, caught a half of 'oh no'
Magical vocals, get it down like coastals?
Underground nigga that spoke truth and broke through

When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who
Tell your whole crew, it's somethin' that you need to know, dude
This is how we go through

Exposed to a higher set of variables, as fly as aerial
Definin' stereo components, moments with my master
Remasterin' techniques, havin' some fresh sheets
Damagin' margins with a broader outlook 'we lookin' out, y'all'
Me and Mr. Mighty Mos, we outlaws
Blazin' in the saddle, raisin like the mornin' star, formin majestic
Candescent like the street lamps, I-be-amped to inn-o-vate
Reminiscent of technology, probably just my will to build
To real notions of emotions similar to the seven seas
Steadily sparkin' cables, tables turnin' like the high tide
I'm captive to this music, vastness, into it I skydive
Tumblin' like buildings crumblin' on inner-cities cumbersome
They comin' to run us out, my niggas shout for justice
You wanna link with me, then let me know
This music is like my vessel so we seem to be inseparable
From C-C-town, headed eastbound

Prefuse 73,"Thinking clearly never came,
As easy as it did for you,
Driving this route out of town,
I wish you were still around,
And in the dead of night I always,
wondered whether you were true,
Someone better than myself,
An offer you just can't turn down,
A morning fight,
And a wasted night,
You crept back to your room

Run along back to your new man

Limassol, hold on I couldn't trap you,
We're gonna head for new horizons,
Limassol

When its all good keep things close at hand

I could never bear to hear you,
Struggling against the tide,
Promises I couldn't keep,
I couldn't admit I was in too deep
Saw the lights on in your window,
Even though they'd said you'd gone,
The darker nights have come again,
Quicker than the year before
A morning fight,
A wasted night,
You slipped back to your room

You better run away back to your new man

Limassol, hold on I could never catch you,
We're gonna head for new horizons,

Pregador Luo,"Vou sair pelo mundo apreciando as rosas
Olhando as coisas bonitas, notando as maravilhosas
Ciente que há flores que também são espinhosas
Que a coroa de Cristo na cruz não foi nada prazerosa
Sabendo que a situação nem sempre é favorável
A luta às vezes se torna insuportável

E ao invés de olharmos para cruz
Olhamos para o escárnio daqueles que dizem
Que nós não vamos conseguir
Que olharam Jesus na cruz e começaram a rir
Dizendo pro Senhor que se ele fosse Deus descia dali
Mas Ele ficou lá, foi até o fim
Pois a missão que tinha não terminava ali
Foi consumado é fato, Teu amor espalhado
Pelo homem louvado, como Deus adorado
Amado por bilhões, odiado por alguns
Fez o bem, fez o certo não fez mal pra nenhum

Testemunhe, todo bem que ele te fez
Testemunhe, todo amor que ele te deu
Testemunhe toda cura, milagre que ele te entregou
Erga as mãos e louve a Deus
O Senhor que te salvou, que te salvou

Gerações andam pelo seu conselho
Estava com Moisés quando abriu o mar vermelho
Exato não é dúbio, avisou Noé sobre o dilúvio
Fez de Salomão um grande homem pensante
Capacitou Davi para derrotar gigantes
Lutou com Josué na batalha
Evitou que Daniel e seus amigos queimassem na fornalha

Curou homens e mulheres de suas limitações
Mais que o corpo e a carne curou vários corações
Iluminou a mente, confrontou facções
Instruiu multidões, motivou doações
Setenta vezes sete é a cota de perdões diários
Reprovou atalhos, falsos profetas, fúteis
Repudiou doutrinas humanas inúteis
Morreu por amor e pra você testemunhar
Que ele ressuscitou e logo vai voltar

Testemunhe, todo bem que ele te fez
Testemunhe, todo amor que ele te deu
Testemunhe toda cura, milagre que ele te entregou
Erga as mãos e louve a Deus
O Senhor que te salvou, que te salvou

Cordeiro verdadeiro
Que nos amou primeiro nossa fé testificou
Abençoou com milagres infindáveis
Sinais incontestáveis que me fazem te seguir

Testemunhe, todo bem que ele te fez
Testemunhe, todo amor que ele te deu
Testemunhe toda cura, milagre que ele te entregou

Pregador Luo,"Viva com amor
Viva com paixão

L-U-O

Pessoas matam e pessoas morrem
Quem as pune ou quem as socorre
Quem se compadece quando outro corpo desce
Quem chora pelos órfãos, quem zela pelos velhos
Quem respeita as rugas, quem chora pelas viúvas
O governo se alterna, mas a vida não muda
Basta andar nas ruas pra encontrar rancor
Será que o estoque 'tá zerado e acabou o nosso amor

O ciclo da vida pode mudar
As pessoas sempre podem recomeçar
Sou eu quem escolho como quero andar
Se vou ajudar ou vou ignorar
Indiferença não faz bem, só vai afastar
O caminho da paz é a compaixão
Amo a justiça, amo meu irmão
Deixei abertas as janelas do meu coração

Lá, lá, lá, lá onde eu vou morar
Eu vou refletir uma luz maior
Lá, lá, lá, lá eu serei melhor
Comecei aqui o que termina lá

Eu encontrei amor nas palavras do meu Mestre
Eu encontrei amor no ventre de minha mãe
Me alimentei direto na fonte de El Shaddai
Eu encontrei exemplo nos calos das mãos de meu pai
Nas preces de meus avós
Encontrei amor na voz do meu pastor
Me tornei capaz de produzir amor e de refletir a luz
Meu Senhor, obrigado por nos enviar Jesus

Pregador Luo,"João 11. 43
Clamou com grande voz, Lázaro sai para fora

Porque os dias são maus e não temos muito tempo
Mesmo respirando sente que morreu por dentro
Confundiu sentimentos no caminho do mundão
Silenciou aquela voz que fazia coração
Tipo morto vivo na estrada para a perdição
Já não tem o santo espírito não vive sua presença
A alma não tem paz 'tá cheia de doenças
Era pra ser muita benção, mas agora é muita treta
Enterrou seus sonhos abortou seus planos
'Tá longe dos pais, 'tá longe dos seus manos
Igual a um acidente que te afasta do teu pessoal
Deixa em coma numa Uti espiritual
Não é só mental, não é só mental
A segunda morte é uma parada real
O mal quer esmagar os seus ossos
Desperta tu que dormes e levanta dos mortos

Lázaro, Jesus chamando você
Sai para fora e volte a viver
Cristo vai te esclarecer
Lázaro, desperta tu que dormes
Levanta dos mortos e volte a viver

Lázaro
Lázaro volte a viver
Lázaro
Lázaro volte a viver

Nesse lugar escuro é difícil ver a luz
Mas a prece introduz um raio de confiança
A espera não pode matar a esperança
A desolação interna traz total desconfiança
Sensação mental de quem quebrou a aliança
Falta amor, falta paz, falta o toque e o carinho
Desse caminho frio onde vaga sozinho
Desespero bate a porta
Quer manter sua alma morta
Se visualize, superando essa crise
Saindo do sepulcro onde querem te manter
Calando as aflições que te impedem de viver
Vencendo a depressão que corrói o coração
Pelo poder da oração pode haver ressurreição
Súplicas ao pai nunca serão em vão
O sol nasce no ponto, mas no escuro da noite
Troque o açoite das trevas pelo amanhecer
Volte a crer

Lázaro, Jesus chorando você
Sai para fora e volte a viver
Cristo vai te esclarecer
Oh oh Lázaro, Desperta tu que dormes
Levanta dos mortos e volte a viver

Lázaro
Lázaro volte a viver
Lázaro
Lázaro volte a viver

O que 'cê acha que acontece com quem passa a vida inerte
Quando morre de verdade o que será que acontece
Eles nos deram muito o dom da vida é valioso
De fato, a quem muito é dado muito será cobrado
Seu tesouro é um só, não vá desperdiçá-lo
Desenvolva consciência do raio de abrangência
Que sua vida já foi liberto, não é escravo de ninguém
Mesmo que se fraquejar o espírito intervém
A mentalidade da carne nos faz morrer
Perecer por conta do pecado
Os traumas do passado nos deixam espatifados
Quebrado em mil pedaços e sem esperança alguma
Mas deixa na mão dele que o carpinteiro arruma
Pois Ele é a ressurreição, a vida, em quem devemos confiar
E todo aquele que nele crê ainda que esteja morto, viverá

Lázaro, Jesus chorando você
Sai para fora e volte a viver
Cristo vai te esclarecer
Oh oh Lázaro, Desperta tu que dormes
Levanta dos mortos e volte a viver

The finest bitches
Lexus' and Land's driving 'round without a plan
Everyone wants to go buck
But can you plant some food for yourself 
When the land is looking rough?
This is the life
Equivanlent of the real
Don't live beyond your means
In this harsh-ass dream
Cause who will be 'round
When your life is looking down?
Be true to yourself
Plants your roots in the ground

But don't be forgettin'
Money exchanges hands like Off Track Bettin'
Project heat will keep ya sweatin'
Release energy through pores
Battles for thesis that held the project wars
Bullets never pour
Snatch your life from menacin crack-whores
By standing just outside of the limits of the law
On the face of human waste
Standin' out like cold sores
It's what Black kids embrace
So fuck a Cold War
If the Berlin Wall falls
What you be fightin' for?
Cause devils come together to oppress me some more
It's clear fuck a tactic that's old like menopause
Yo I get down for mines
Stay out my way gettin' yours
MC's who was just fakin'
You should stop now because
Real guns in your mouth
Cause shit in your drawers
And besides, you got much more to live for
Is hip-hop worth dying for?
Are you sure?
Whenever I arrive
Niggaz know my steez
Au-revoir MC's
Hit the floor and freeze
All my sons waving guns in barbaric fashion
Yo they children don't listen
They just imitate they actions

Effeminate character MC
Miscommunicate, oppress us, distress us
Relay the data like a messenger from Mecca
How many men can testify to they treasure?
Is this the neverland, the promised land?
Sheep for slaughter
Frontin' sons but ya can't feed your daughters
What's your livin?
Playin' to push a man for ¿Sam?
Gettin' wired
And these are the days, the last plague
Watch the fire
Sensation relation the physical manifestation
Man's elation -- material accommodation
Facin this world
Conglomeratin' corporations
Deeper than the thesis
Observation of creation
Money makes a man rule a nation
After greed is lust
And soon to follow is distrust
This ghetto paranoia is the reason that you bust
Caught up in the cipher
Having negative thoughts
There's one less millionaire every single day
And you could be the next
This life is rougher than the sex
Sex, sex

Yo I wonder when I get the land cruiser and the lex
(No sweats)
Dodgin' users from the other sex
I wonder if my own people will be next
I need respect that don't come with no weekly check
I know ghetto millionaires
They got cold chillin stares
And drug-dealin airs
They make hairs stand up on the backs of necks of ¿mayors?
Who blow up fish markets and got various targets
They sweepin' shit under carpets
I move stealth through the chicken-heads
With talcum on they chests
Yo Malcom's gone
And the elders ain't impressed with my struggle
I try to make a profit and I'll flip it so it double
Being poor just ain't worth the trouble
Extension of my mansion 
Where I keep my stacks
Deep in the study where my nerve endings react
There ain't no stoppin me
My feelings and thoughts I have monopolies
Magnetic fields and fields of dreams is my property
Poor people who are stupid die quickly
I'm a millionaire that's carrying all my assets with me
I go past the physical world like Sufis
My people's was sold one-by-one like Lucy's
These niggaz got grams but no lands yo you losin me
Watch that first step, its a doozie

Prelude,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
