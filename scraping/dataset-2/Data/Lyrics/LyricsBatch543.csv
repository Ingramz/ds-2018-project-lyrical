Kenny Davern,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.",I Want to Be Happy,1972

Kenny Davern,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity

I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.",Lady Be Good,1983
Kenny Davern,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow
For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else",Love Me or Leave Me,1983
Kenny Davern,"When the mellow moon begins to beam,
Every night I dream a little dream,
And of course Prince Charming is the theme,
The he for me.
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true,
For/To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along,
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong,
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand ;
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand ;
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not ;
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two,
From which I'll never roam,
Who would - would you ?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love.",The Man I Love,1983
Kenny Davern,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

Kenny Davern,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo.

I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me

Don't cry

Kenny Davern,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere

Not a thing to sell ya.

To the Riverboat Shuffle!

Kenny Davern,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'

There'll come a time when you'll regret it

Kenny Davern,"Every day seems like a year
Sweetheart, when you are not near
All that you claim must be true
For I'm just the same as you

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
If I can find the sun in your eyes
Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you
That's how I am, so what can I do?
I'm happy when I'm with you

Stars are smiling at me from your eyes
Sunbeams now there will be in the skies
Tell me that you will be true
That will all depend on you

Kenny Davern,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?

Kenny Davern,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1990
Kenny Davern,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1990
Kenny Davern,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1990
Kenny Davern,"Sadness just makes me sigh,
I've come to say goodbye,
Altho' I go, I've got those farewell blues.

Dreaming of you is sweet,
Someday again we'll meet.

Kenny Davern,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

Kenny Davern,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

Kenny Davern,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

And maybe I'm ruled off his list
I'll never be missed
I need that person much worse 'n just bad
I'm half alive 'n he's drivin' me mad

You taught me how to care
Am I to be just the remnant of a one-sided love affair?
All you took, I gladly gave
There's nothing left for me to save

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them

How can I go on dear without you

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2005

I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms

I'll be loving

But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again

Kenny Dorham,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love [Take 1],1961

Kenny Dorham,"If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no! not in spring-time.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you at all.

No, never could I leave you at all.",If Ever I Would Leave You [*],1963
Kenny Dorham,"My old flame, I can't even think of his name but it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same 
Until I discover what became of my old flame

Kenny Dorham,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Kenny Dorham,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1999
Kenny Dorham,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew

From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Kenny Drew,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1953

And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Kenny Drew,"Do you remember one September afternoon
I stood with you and listened to a wedding tune,
And didn't I go with you on your honeymoon?

Where every day I had to pay another bill?
And if I'm not mistaken, dear, I pay them still
Remember me?

I can see that little angel on your knee
Can't you see, He kinda sorta looks like me

I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1957

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that

And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Remember Christ, our Savior,

To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Jewry,
This blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger,
Upon this blessed morn;
That which His Mother Mary,
Did nothing take in scorn.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

From God our Heavenly Father,
A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

""Fear not,"" then said the Angel,
""let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Savior
Of pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.""
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding,
In tempest, storm, and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Savior lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood

Kenny G,"Te cansaste de mi
Me alejaste de ti
Why la sal de este mar se seco
No se puede salvar
Lo que ya se quedo
Si en la piel esta escrito el final

Fuiste el unico amor en que crei
Pero el tiempo mato lo que te di
Tu tambien estas triste
Porque duele oir la verdad

Es hora de decir adios
No queda otra salida, termino
Abrazame en silencio, lo siento
Dejemoslo pasar, digamonos adios

Tu why yo sin amor
Dos en la obscuridad
Compartiendo tanta soledad
Ya no hay a donde ir
Aceptemos que todo acabo de una vez

Te propongo olvidarnos del ayer
Separarnos ahora sin llorar
Aunque sea muy triste
Es mejor oir la verdad

Es hora de decir adios
No queda otra salida, termino
Abrazame en silencio, lo siento
Dejemoslo pasar, digamonos adios

Te perdi, lo se
Nada queda ya
Solo las cenizas de un recuerdo
Tienes que seguir
Tengo que seguir
Why buscar consuelo en otros besos
Siempre hay un talvez
Siempre habra un despues
Sobreviviras, sobrevivire

Ya no es tiempo de finjir
No podemos ignorar
Lo que pide el corazon

Kenny G,"I saw the lamp light from your window
I didn't think you were home, sitting there all alone
So I came up to your room to ask you why
Why did you hurt me so?
Why did you have to go, away?

I never wanted anything in my life
Not until I met you
I thought you'd see me through
All the bad days that I've had before I met you
Something in the past, never thought it couldn't last, forever

There's one thing I can say, everyday, how I miss you, oh oh

Every day that I'm without you hurts just a little bit more than
Than I've ever been hurt before
Every day that I'm without you hurts just a little bit more

And now I look down from your window
To see a young man across the street
He looks something like me
And he's walking with his head down to the ground
Did you want to hurt me so?
Why did you have to go away?

There's one thing I can say, everyday, how I miss you, oh oh

Every day that I'm without you hurts just a little bit more than
More than I've been hurt before

Every day that I'm without you hurts just a little bit more than
More than I've been hurt before

I need you around for every day to start;
I haven't left you alone.

Everything I'm looking for I seem to find.
All this time away is killing me inside -
I need your love in my life.

I want to spend time 'til it ends,
I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,
I want to fall with you again.

We fought in a battle, but nobody won,
And left ourselves a mountain to overcome.
You can't turn away: the past is said and done;
I need us to carry on.

I want to fall with you again.

You can always give 'em some more.

Master the challenges of life

True at heart, I want to see how you really feel 
Take off your mask and reveal...

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Kenny J. Charles,"Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and
My heart will go on and on","My Heart Will Go On [From ""Titanic""]",

You have and you hold, she could understand the problem
She let the little things go

Kenny J. Charles,"It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To become when you've found
Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do, it turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way, and I know
That I have to go away
I know, I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down
And take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

All the times, that I've cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
And it's hard
But it's harder to ignore it

If they were right, I'd agree
But its them they know, not me 
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away 
I know, I have to go",Father & Son,2010

We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Someone else moved in from far away

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die

Kenny James,"Spent my days with a woman unkind, Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start, Going To California with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me there's a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
as the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the Gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king,
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.",Going to California,2007

What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size
I'll just tell him, ""Baby, won't you swing it with me""
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely ""Darling may I intrude""
He said ""Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood""

Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance

Kenny John,"Me and my wife live all alone 
In a little log hut we're all our own
She loves gin and I love rum, 
And don't we have a lot of fun! 

Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
Ha, ha, ha, you and me, 
Little brown jug, don't I love thee! 
When I go toiling on the farm 
I take the little jug under my arm

Place it under a shady tree, 
Little brown jug, 'tis you and me. 
'Tis you that makes me friends and foes, 
'Tis you that makes me wear old clothes
But, seeing you're so near my nose, 
Tip her up and down she goes. 

If all the folks in Adam's race 
Were gathered together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to shed a tear
(I'd let them go without a tear) 
Before I'd part from you, my dear. 

If I'd a cow that gave such milk, 
I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day. 

I bought a cow from Farmer Jones, 
And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep. 

The rose is red, my nose is too, 
The violets blue and so are you
And yet, I guess, before I stop, 
We'd better take another drop.",Little Brown Jug,2014

Stuck right in the middle of two broken hearts

Just keeps right on giving till it fills you up

Putting my heart out on the line
My emotions say this is serious, but do you agree?
Or am I living a fantasy?

You always say he's just a friend
Thought that I could take it, but this heart of mine is breaking

Kenny Lattimore,"Had so much to give you, had so many plans
For our future happiness, isn't that the role of a man
I knew that I could provide everything you need
All I wanted was a little time, then to you I could commit

So, you waited on me believing in all my dreams
I didn't think I'd have to learn in the worst way

Why wait till tomorrow, you got a good thing right now
Baby, 'cause tomorrow may not ever come around

You weren't too demanding, never asked for much
Didn't even mind the struggle as long as it was all about us
You wanted my mind, hey, my body and soul
But I told you to hold on, I'm still working some things out on my own

So, you waited another year despite the pain and all your tears
I wasn't sensitive enough to think you had an option

She'll wait till tomorrow, how could I have been so wrong?
Surely cause tomorrow, my, my sweet lady was gone

Now I'm living my dreams, but it ain't nothing cause you're not with me
I'm so all alone, it wasn't even worth it, no

Waiting till tomorrow, I had a good thing then

Kenny Lattimore,"Trial separation, many days and nights
I sat and thought about our plight
And what I think is maybe that we need a change
Though sometimes you make me feel I'd rather be alone

We've got too much to throw it all away
We tried talking it all out, even gone around the world
But that didn't make it better
Tell me how do we save what matters?

Maybe we should try separating
'Cause it ain't working, baby
(Baby)
You and me being so close all the time

Maybe by separating
We can take a good look at saving
Love that it took us so long to find

Maybe where we're at is the result of moving fast
You see it's so hard to tell when you're in love
But looking back on what has happened since back then
I wonder if that's really what it was

We're leaving out a complex situation
We can't deny the way I feel and you feel for me
Maybe we're just too close to see, oh

Maybe we should try separating
'Cause it ain't working, baby
('Cause it ain't working out)
You and me being so close all the time

(Maybe we're just too close to see)
Maybe by separating we can take a good look at saving

Oh, ooh, what are we gonna do?

Maybe we should try separating

Maybe by separating
We can take a good look at saving

How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice
It's turning

While every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

Look at you all

Who's gonna turn your back on...
All that we had?

Who took the vow that that they would be there
til death do us part?

If you could see you through my eyes
If you could see you

You should know no one else could ever take your place
Don't think I'll ever stop needing you
I need everything about you
Can't see a life lived without you

You're my only heaven
You're my world, you're my dream
You're everything to me

And if you could see you through my eyes
You'd see someone beautiful
On the inside and outside
So beautiful, you will know how I feel
You'd see, you'd see how much you mean to me

If you could see you through my eyes

You would see, you would see
What you mean, mean to me
You would know
There's no one else I need

You would feel, what I feel
You would know
There's no way to change
This love I have inside

And if you could see you through my eyes
You'd see someone beautiful
On the inside and outside
So beautiful, you will know how I feel
You'd see, you'd see how much you mean to me

If you could see you through my eyes
You'd see someone beautiful

If you could see you, oh through my eyes
If you could see you through my eyes
Oh, through my eyes

We would never need to face the world alone
They can have their world we'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart
I know love will find a way

Anywhere I go I'm home
If you are there beside me
Like dark turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

Now I realize love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world shining in your eyes
And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you

Would mean, so much

I can even recall the day that you came along
All the years that we dated baby, then I made the call
And I brought you a cla**ic rock like the 80's songs
We the unbreakable perfect couple, he made us strong
Who would've ever predicted that I take a fall
You could've packed up and taken off
But instead you stuck with me through the greatest storm
And that's love, man the rain clouds
Didn't have a rule 'till you thought of how we exchanged vows
Yeah we faced trials, by the grace of God
Still good, now great, now real talk

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,
Kenny Loggins,"People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun
Think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love
Sun is gonna shine above

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the mornin' when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

Seems as though a month ago I was Beta Chi
Never got high
Oh, was a sorry guy
And now I smile and face the girl that shares my name, yeah
Now I'm through with the game
This boy'll never be the same

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the mornin' when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be all right

Pisces Virgo rising is a very good sign
Strong and kind
And the little boy is mine
Now I see a family where there once was none
Now we've just begun
Yeah we're gonna fly to the sun

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the mornin' when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be all right

Love the girl who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love her and she'll bring you luck
And if you find she helps your mind
Buddy, take her home
Yeah, don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers own

And even though we ain't got money

Pickin' with my Uncle Bill
The neighbors don't mind 'cause they have a good time
Sippin' on my pappy's still
Old brother Dan's got a fiddle in his hand
Momma's on the mandolin
When the music is right and the band gets tight
You ought-a see 'em pick and grin

And everybody starts movin'
To the sound of the guitar strums
And everybody starts groovin'
To the beat of the rhythm and drums
So come along and let yourself really go

While the feeling is good
Just sip that wine, have a really good time
And listen to a country song

Old Sheriff Brown he never comes around
Knocking on the old back door
As a matter of fact you can find him in the act
Pickin on the old banjo

Tries to get to sister Sue
Well she throws him on the ground without turning around
'Cause she knows a lotta jujitsu",Listen to a Country Song,1971

You're refreshing as a morning rain

And I don't want nobody
I don't want nobody but you 
And if I need anybody, Darling
You're the one that I would choose

Just looking for the right way to love you
Every time I felt your doubt
And I heard the word from above
Hold on, she's coming soon
Woman who would change your whole life
And now that I have my choice
Well, I'm chosing you to be my wife

That keeps filling our heads full of lies
Can we trust in new directions
When their promises are in disquise
Well someday the truth will catch up

They preach this thing, religion
But we show no faith at all

But on Monday forget it all
If the times should find us needing him
Then my friend, Lord have mercy on our soul

In a brand new bottle
It's the same old wine

Then we ask ourselves the question
What and the hell are we fighting for?
If you suddenly find a reason
Well don't be afraid to open the door
Well don't be afraid

If you'll be smart

Don't let it start
You'll think you're different from the rest
You'll try to do your part
Until he breaks your heart

Lunch for the lonely
Looking at picture postcards of someone else's scene
Somehow they don't seem real
The sea's too green

Giving out information
About the boy on the moon

You come to me and hold me tight, winding your body all around me
And everywhere you touch I feel, that my love for you is much too real
Oh, it's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams
It's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams
Sleepwalkin' - I know every move you make, and every word I say
Keep it comin', comin' - comin' on stronger, this time I'm going all the way
Is this moment just a fantasy, or a vision of what will be
Oh, it's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams
Every night the same thing, wanting you in my dreams
(Dreams fade away)
I better find you in my days, or I'm losin' you to the nights
It's the same thing - every night
It's the same thing - oh, you're so right
It's the same thing - wanting you
(Instrumental break)
And tonight, evening's shadows are sure to find me
On my nightwatch, waiting for the warmth of you beside me
And every second that you're here I feel, this dream is real
And it's the same damn thing, it's the same thing
It's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams, dreams",Nightwatch,1978
Kenny Loggins,"Out of my head and delighted, somebody knows how I feel
If you ask me to play it, you won't have to say it twice

I'm so glad you made it, and now that you're ready
I'll begin to tell you what you want, but I know

(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel, I feel)

Kenny Loggins,"Here's a sweet September morning, there's the sense of Autumn on the rise
He steps into the wind and sadly sighs
""Why does it always seem to be, there's a cold December wind in front of me?""
The more he fills his empty evenings
The less he feels that there's a chance to find
Something that can bring a peace of mind
Is there a place where you can go?
A little something you should know to turn the tide to your favor?

[Chorus:]

Wait a little while to welcome what you're after
Give it the time to find its way to you
And soon as you no longer try, you'll turn and find it standing by your side
Come and get it, when you let it, it'll come to you

When I run short on inspiration, I best recall what I've known all along
'N I remember sweet September's song, there never really has to be
A cold and bitter wind in front of me anymore

Just forget it and wait a little while, while, while
Wait a little while, everything will come to you in time
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time
Wait a little while - every little thing's gonna come to you in time
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time

Kenny Loggins,"I wake up
In the middle of a dream
To an unfamiliar scene
Wonder what I fell into
Who knows why
People look for alibis
In a passing stranger's eyes
What am I supposed to do
So tonight
Tell her that you love her tonight
The only way to know is to try
tonight
Give it half a chance
And the glow
From the bathroom down the hall
Lights a mirror on a wall
Where a stranger stares at me.
""Hello, stranger,
Where you been?
Do you still remember when?
Well, every heartache has an end
'N maybe yours is on the way""
One by one

And you won't need yesterday

And believe in the arms you're in
Tonight.

Evening ember glow
And you're wishing you could see
How far it flows
Rolling on to an endless sea
You'd be well on your way
If you could only set sail.

But dreams can drift away
And sails can fill with doubt
Where's your vision
If the embers flicker out?
Don't let it slip from view

The horizons are waiting
Your river is fading

[Chorus:]
So keep the fire burning tonight
See just what comes into sight
Don't take forever
Take it through the night

And believe the sun
Will rise with the dawn
That's all you need to go on
But for tonight
Just keep the fire burning bright

I will never need to ask
""What have I done?""
Comes a moment when it's clear
There's only one.
Oh, whatever you need of me
I've made up my mind
I'll give you more than you've asked for

And there are those who can foresee
Where we will go
All the future...

Only that you'll be here with me.

Kenny Loggins
(This Is It)

The many times you've learned the lines
That love has spoken
So easily you love to leave
Your heart's unbroken
You've opened up a hundred eyes
And given them a point of view
Now think about the times you knew
And hold them up to me and you

Love has come of age

You close your eyes and
Fantasize a lost horizon
A memory, a gentle breeze for love
To ride in,
But in your dreams you turned arouind
And stumbled on a Shangri-la,
You'll never be along anymore,
'Cause brother now you've gone too far

Love has come of age

I'll stop by by tomorrow
I'll stop by by tonight
I'll stop by by morning. Momma
It's alright.

If a gigolo's what you're after
You'll have to hold on tight
Bye bye bye, later, baby
Make it, make it right



",Love Has Come of Age,1979
Kenny Loggins,"I read your letter, it said between the lines
You're visitin' Mexico for an indefinite amount of time

Roll Mr. Night, you know what you gotta do
Anymore I ain't askin' you, go on out and do it tonight
Come on Mr. Night, now I'm in the driver's seat
Till we reach our destiny, go on out and do it tonight
Your Mona Lisa, she took her smile of gold
Run under the border guard and put it over on her Romeo
Your love for seæ??rita I see is none too cool
Here comes this drivin' fool to Detomaso the night away
Detomaso a ride away

I see those ivory lies in sweet Rosita's eyes
Gonna leave them both behind when we 'tomaso all night
Your love and money this time are gone for good
Little Rosa took a boda bag and hit the road like a Robin Hood
And I see by the headlines that I'll be drivin' south
And when I pull you out we'll Detomaso the night away

Kenny Loggins,"She sings to me now and then
Gentle refrains of summer mornings
The first rays of sunlight
And dew-dropped roses

Winds rolling through falling leaves
Whistling in the sycamores
These are her songs of love

She needs to be reassured
of all of the hope you hold for her
And when the lady loves you
Don't ever let it go
Take your world into your arms
And let your feelings show

And she, never will leave
Always these memories will stay with me
And I'll think of her now and then

She, she needs to be reassured
of all of the hope you hold for her
And brother, when the lady loves you

And let your feelings show

Kenny Loggins,"(This is it) 
I've grown tired of fighting 
Whether you're right or wrong 
Whether I'm weak or strong in your eyes 
'Cause this is a lonely feeling 
Watching you turn away 
Why does it have to be this way? 
On and on tonight 
You've made a point of being right 
Making this a game instead of love 
You should know 
Where this goes. 
Someone's heart will surely be broken 
Before too long 
If we keep on playing this game 
Of right or wrong 

[Chorus:] 
Who's right, who's wrong 
When love is gone? 
Who's right or wrong -- false or true 
Never used to matter to you
You're almost crying

Easier said than done 

Tell me why 
I want to know what you're hiding 
Turn around and look at me 
I've never been this hard to see before 
If we'd only come together 
For a moment here tonight 
You could hold me tight 
And ease your troubled mind

Rolling thunder rumbles down the hall
Once in awhile, everyone paces the floor
Lately, it's more and more
Love, if yu must be started go easily on your way
Still I wonder could it wait another day?

Will it last enough to say you have your freedom?
Is the answer just another road to go?
Does it have to leave to be?
Can it stay and be with be with me?
When will it last enough to have it here at home?

Too many roads are needlessly divided
By silent walls we build along the way
Why be alone to learn that your life has more?
That's what our love is for
Tear down those angry walls. I'll walk with you where you go
Still, you're the only one who'll ever know

Will it last enough to say you have your freedom?
Is the answer just another road to go?
Does it have to leave to be?
Or can it stay and be with me?
Will it last enough? Oh, will it last enough?
Will it last enough? Oh, will it last enough?
When will it last enough to have it here at home?



",Will It Last,1979
Kenny Loggins,"Day is done and night is calling
From the window light is falling
Shadows spinning on the walls
And dancing in the light

And 'round the door the kids are playing
Like June bugs into the light
And it seems like I'm looking at a mighty good time
All alone tonight

Hands a-clapping, voices singing
Tambourines and guitars ringing
Echoes through the willows
Bringing music to the night

And in the wind the whippoorwill's crying
Cold and all alone
And I am standing outside of a mighty good time
All alone tonight

Well, I can't recall when Louisiana music
Ever sounded so sweet
Just listen to the fiddle playing
'Bonaparte's Retreat'

Well, I just can't take no more
I gotta make it through that door
And dance until the break of day
As long as there's still music playing
Bet your life, I won't be staying all alone tonight

Well, I just can't take no more
I gotta make it through that door
And dance until the break of day
As long as there's still music playing
Bet your life, I won't be staying all alone tonight

Kenny Loggins,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

I begged the dream to fade away
And please awaken me
But night took a hold of my heart
And left me with no one to follow
the love that I lost to the dark
I'll always remember

Forever in my heart
Forever we will be
And know that when I'm gone
You'll be here in me
Forever in my heart
You always thought I'd be
I'd be yours

Together, believed that we could live there forever

Forgetting, we wandered too far from the land we'd known

Of all the lonely people, you're among the lucky few

It's never as easy to return
But if you're willing to go on

He held her in his arms and planned it all

And everything had changed
He noticed the sun on her face as she turned away

All the lonely people, you're among the lucky few
If it comes even once in a life

And when you come to know the miracle, it's mystical
When someone else's heart is in your hand

you gotta want it bad.
If that girl's (boy's) got into your blood, 
go out and get her (him).
If you want her (him) to be the very part of you
That makes you want to breathe,
here's the thing to do:
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.
 
I know somethin' about love;
you gotta show it and make her (him) 
see that the moon up above, reach out and get it.
If you want her (him) to be always by your side
and if you want her (him) to only think of you,
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.
 
Ever since the world began, 
it's been that way for man, and women 
were created to make love their destiny.
Then why should true love be so complicated?
Oh yeah, uh huh!
 
I know somethin' about love;
you gotta take it and show her (him) what the world's made of.
One kiss will prove it.
If you want her (him) to be always by your side
take her (him) hand tonight, swallow your foolish pride and 
 
Tell her (him) that you're never gonna leave her (him),
tell her (him) that you're always gonna love her (him),
tell her (him), tell her (him), tell her (him) tell her (him) right now.

Kenny Loggins,"I tried to tell you
But the words always came out wrong
You never knew it
But I loved you all along
Are we two worlds in collision
Maybe it's time for you to listen to my

[Chorus:]
True confessions
My love, I'm givin' you
My true confessions
Show love when you hear my
True confessions

Never meant to hurt you
I was lonely and she was so kind
One stolen moment
That I can't get off my mind
Let's end this silent suspicion
Baby it's time for you to listen to my

Kenny Loggins,"When you feel afraid,
When you lose your way, I'll find you,
Just try to smile, and dry your eyes,
I will bring back the moon into your skies.
And ever you will, remember darling, I'll be there to:

Say to you
I'll promise you
I'll promise to
Comfort you and say to you
Darling, I'll be there just for you.

There's so much to learn,
And when you want me
Then I'll show you,
And through the years,
You'll always be
The lullaby in the heart of the child in me.

Whenever you will, remember darling
I'll be there to

Say to you
I'll promise you
I'll promise to
Comfort you and say to you
Darling, I'll be there just for you.

Hold it, feel it,
Music is in your heart.
When you need it,
Just keep listening,
Let it sing, let it sing.

Though you've grown away
No matter how you'll change
I'll know you.
And when you tire of life alone,
There will always be one sure way back home

Just turn on the quiet,
And you close your eyes
And listen inside

Kenny Loggins,"Where are the dreams that we once had?
This is the time to bring them back.
What were the promises caught
On the tips of our tongues?

Do we forget or forgive?
There's a whole other life waiting to be lived when
One day we're brave enough
To talk with conviction of the heart.

And down your streets I've walked alone,
As if my feet were not my own
Such is the path I chose,
Doors I have opened and closed

I'm so tired of living this life,
Fooling myself, believing we're right when
I've never given love
With any conviction of the heart.

One with the Earth, with the sky
I believe we'll survive
If we only try
How long must we wait to change

This world bound in chains that we live in
To know what it is to forgive,
And to be forgiven?
It's been too many years of talking now.

Isn't it time to stop somehow?
Air that's too angry to breathe
Water our children can't drink
You've heard it hundreds of times

You say you're aware, believe and you care, but
Do you care enough
To talk with conviction of the heart?",Conviction of the Heart,1991
Kenny Loggins,"Love, where are we going,
And when do we reach the promise on the horizon,

Out on the ocean, under a sunset,
I was invited to come out and play a while
with magic and move a mountain.

Has anyone ever captured the sun,
Is the eagle ever truly tame,
Given just a little time,
I know that you'll find a way.

I would do anything for you,
Give up the world I've made me
And take you away,
I swear from now on,
The trust in my heart,
The vision of you in my life

My love,
I will be faithful,
but how can I make a promise
to a place I've never been?

Something has taken me off,
and I don't know if I will survive.
I believe that everything
I'll ever need is here by the roadside.

How can you fly,
keeping heaven in sight,
blinded by the light of day?

Given just a little time,
I know that I'll find a way

I would do anything for you,
Listen with all of my spirit,
for ecstasy calling,
You know I believe,
Cause all I have seen,
From the mountain,
The view from the heart.

I would do anything for you,
Give up the world I've made me
And take you away,
I swear from here on,
The trust in my god,
The vision of you in my life

Freedom is mine,
One beat at a time,
Where are we going,
I just don't know yet,
How will we make it,
I just can't say,
All that I know is that we've finally sailed away.

Seems everyone's made a prison of love,
But if anybody can escape,
Given just a little time,
I know that we'll find a way.

I would do anything for you,
Listen with all of my spirit,
for ecstasy calling,

Sometimes a selfless step is all it takes,
From the mountain, he can watch it all burn,
Welcome friend, to the point of no return

and you get to turn it down, turn around, temporary sanity
And then the mountain disappears without a trace,

You appear every year in my life.

Standing still in my father's house,
And I try another time to walk away.

I learned that music and laughter,
From the child that you hid in your eyes,
And it's his song that I sing,
Now who will sing for me?

All my life, no voice inside,
Has whispered, ""set me free"",

I know I said I'll always try,
But you're going to bed alone again tonight,
And you lie there in the dark and wonder why.

I did it for you, and the boys,
Because love should teach you joy,
And not the imitation,
That your momma and daddy tried to show you.
I did it for you, and for me,
And because I still believe,
There's only one thing,
You can never give up,
Never compromise on,
And that's the real thing you need in love.

You're so afraid your life is over,
And nothing I can say can change your mind.
How can anybody be so selfish,
And treat you all so cruel,

Kenny Loggins,"Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved 

Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved

You and me
Love is knowing
We can be

Kenny Loggins,"Hold your breath
Make a wish
Count to three

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination

We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in a world of my creation
What you see will defy explanation

Somewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight

Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that great somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

I know a place where dreams are born and time is never planned
It's not on any chart
You must find it in your heart
To come home to Neverland

It might be miles beyond the moon
Or right here where you stand
Just keep an open mind
And then suddenly you'll find Never, Neverland

Treasure when you stay there
It's precious more than gold
Once you've found your way
You can never grow old

And that's my home where dreams are born and time is never planned
Just think of lovely things
And your heart will fly on wings forever
To Never, Neverland

If you wanna view paradise, simply look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
Wanna change the world
There's nothing to it

Come with me
And you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination

We'll begin
With a spin
Traveling in a world of my creation
What you see will defy explanation

If you wanna view paradise
So then, look around and view it
Anything you want to, do it
You wanna change the world, there's nothing to it

There is no life I know
To compare with pure imagination
Living there, you'll be free
If you truly wish to be

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true",Neverland Medley: Somewhere Out There/Never Never Land/Pure ...,1994
Kenny Loggins,"Why are there so many
Songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side
Rainbow's are visions
They're only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some chose to
Believe it
But I know they're wrong wait and see

Someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
And look what it's done so far
What's so amazing
That keeps us star gazing
What so we think we might see

Someday we'll find it
That Rainbow Connection
The lovers the dreamers and me

Have you been half asleep
And have you heard voices
I've heard them calling my name
Are these the sweet sounds that called
The young sailors
I think they're one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
There's something that I'm supposed to be

Someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me",Rainbow Connection,1994

Kenny Loggins,"Christopher Robin and I walked along
Under branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore
As our days disappeared all too soon
But I've wandered much further today than I should
And I can't seem to find my way back to the wood

So help me if you can, I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (chase the clouds from above)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
He came to me asking help and advice
And from there no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

So help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (chase the clouds from above)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

It's hard to explain how a few precious things
Seem to follow throughout all our lives
After all's said and done I was watching my son
Sleeping there, with my bear by his side
So I tucked him in, I kissed him and as I was going
I swear that old bear whispered, ""boy, welcome home""

Believe me if you can, I've finally come
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
What do you know, there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive

The one thing on your mind
Not until you know
The Art of Letting Go
'N it may seem to be
Defying gravity

The Art of Letting Go

You may think
You built a present perfect world
And you may wonder to yourself
Does anyone really know what else could ever matter?

But the Man with His hand
On the hammer
Wears a velvet glove

Does the rich man know he's poor?
Does the beggar care for much more than survival?

When you look into the eyes of children laughing
Do you remember who you were?
Or who you are?

Life is nothing without love
Love is nothing if not freedom

They tell me the gates of hell
That you shake 'n you rattle
Are secretly locked
From inside

You hope and pray you'll find
A love to last all time

With a light heart, with laughter,
Wth no expectation, with humility
But for the grace of Thee, go I.

May I be a child forever
Intoxicated by hot sand, cool winds, by love
By my own communication to the Spirit.
May my aliveness always be as loud
When I make love, as when I cry
May I see my own reflection in the mirror
And smile

It's just a fact of life, no we ain't in charge
There ain't nothin' that's wrong with me
Ain't nothin' that's wrong with you

Love's got nothin' to prove, it's not up to you

Of time and space, searchin' for the truth
With nothin' but love to prove
And find it in the gift of a moment of grace

Your heart is broken
'Cause your love was untrue

""Oh, why you?""

Of time and space, searchin' for the truth
With nothin' but love to prove

You'll come to know
Is not the one who loved

Whirling round each other for eons
Let's be god this time
Let's be human
Let's be light
Let's be all that is dark
Everything you are I see
And seeing is loving
And loving is remembering
Because this blueprint of your heart
I carry inside me
For all time
This soul memory of spirit
Wakes me from my dream
Rips the veils, pierces the certainty
Of my ever effusive despair
And I meet myself for the first time
We are, and all that I've learned about life
And love and men and women
Is false and phony and obscene
Love, take me, rip me into shreds
Baptize me again and again
In the warm wetness of my own tears
Burn down my walls, fast and furious
Like a drunken, divine glass blower
For all my fear is camouflage
My rage is the fuel of my truth telling
My demons are at home now
All my days and nights are for love}

Is just trying to get that feeling back

Some children see him lily white,

Some children see him lily white,
With tresses soft and fair.

Some children see him bronzed and brown,
With dark and heavy hair.

Some children see him almond-eyed,
This savior whom we kneel beside,
Some children see him almond-eyed,
With skin of yellow hue.

Some children see him dark as they,
Sweet mary's son to whom we pray,
Some children see him dark as they,
And, ah! they love him, too!

The children in each diff'rent place
Will see the baby jesus' face
Like theirs, but bright with heav'nly grace,
And filled with holy light.

And with thy heart as offering,
Come worship now the infant king.

Kenny Loggins,"All alone in a sleepless night
Passing time with a runaway moon
Talkin' to myself 
Wishing I was somewhere else
It's been too long since I held you girl
Twice a thousand miles
But my heart won't beat alone
I need the love I left behind

Hold back the dawn awhile
This will all work out
Don't let this dream die
There's a fire in the sky
It's like the light in your eyes
Thinkin' of you
And I won't give up till your in my arms
Never give up till what's lost is found
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love again

Now the night is dark with diamonds
And I'm standing inside the rain
Giving up your love
Was the worst mistake I made
There's a sound I hear in the distance
Seems it's calling out my name
Well I'll pay most any price
I just hope I'm not too late

Turn back the clock awhile
Things will all work out
That's what the dream is all about
There's a fire in the sky
It's like the light in your eyes
Oh, it's true
That I won't give up till your in my arms
Never give up till what's lost is found
Won't give up on your sweet, sweet love 

Turn back the clock awhile
Things will all work out
That's what the dream is all about 
I see a fire in the sky

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

That I'd be over it by now

I miss us

Like a child, I know it is selfish to say
But sometimes I want you all to myself

Sunsets that would last forever
No where else to be
Side by side just you and me

Spending someone's hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving on our way back home

We're on our way home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches on our way back home

We're on our way home
We're on our way home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun

Rita's got a house to keep, dimestore novels and a love so sweet

And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it, then I can do it (I can do it)
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, if I just spread my wings
I can fly
I can fly
I can fly, hey
If I just spread my wings
I can fly
Hum, fly",Believe in Me,2008
Kenny Millions,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue

You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

I could lay me down and die.

Kenny Nolan,"I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine.
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine.
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight.
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light.

I see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshine.
We've walked along St. Thomas beach a million times.
Hand in hand, two barefoot lovers kissing in the sand.
Side by side, the tide rolls in.
I'm touching you, you're touching me.
If only it could be.

I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine.
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine.
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight.
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light.

Through each dream how our love has grown.
I see us with our children and our happy home.
Little smiles, so warm and tender looking up at us.
Blessed by love, the world we share
Until I wake and reach for you
And you're just not there.

I like dreamin' 'cause dreaming can make you mine.
I like holding you close and touching your skin
Even if it's in my mind.
Oh, sweet dream baby, I love you.
Oh, my sweet dream baby, you're in my dreams every night.

Kenny Nolan,"I love you, so much 
Somewhere back in time 
You became a friend of mine 
And day by day we've grown a little closer 
You're my spirit to be strong 
A friend when things go wrong 
So I've written down these words to let you know 

Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me 
You've become a part of me 
Let us plant the seed and watch it grow 
Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me 
You've become a part of me 

As we travel down the road 
Side-by-side we'll share the load 
Hand-in-hand we'll see each other through 
Though we've only just begun 
Let's count our blessings one-by-one 
I thank God for life, I thank God for you 

Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me 
You've become a part of me 
Let us plant the seed and watch it grow 
Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me 
You've become a part of me 

And as the seasons slip away 
Forever lovers we will stay 
Together, do-or-die, with all our hearts

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree
