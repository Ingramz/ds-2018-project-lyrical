John Scott Trotter,"Can't run away from you, dear
I've tried so hard but I fear
You'll always follow me near and far
Just when I think that I'm set
Just when I've learned to forget
I close my eyes, dear, and there you are

You keep coming back like a song
A song that keeps saying, remember

The sweet used-to-be
That was once you and me
Keeps coming back like an old melody

The perfume of roses in May
Returns to my room in December

From out of the past where forgotten things belong
You keep coming back like a song",You Keep Coming Back Like a Song (From Blue Skies),2003
John Scott Trotter,"All day tomorrow
I'll be whispering your name
And the day after forever
I know I'll do the same

May time or winter
I won't let you out of sight
And the day after forever
We'll talk about tonight

Your laughter is a melody
That I'll remember long
It plays upon my heartstrings
It's my favorite song

All through a lifetime
I'll be loving you and then
On the day after forever
I'll just begin again",The Day After Forever,2003
John Scott Trotter,"I'm just a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I'm just a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray.
Raindrops have brought us together and that's what I longed to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.
So I'll be the fella, the fella with an umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.

I met a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I met a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Waiting for the skies of blue to turn into skies of gray.
Raindrops will bring us together and that's what I long to see.
Maybe a break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.
I told the fella, the fella with the umbrella,
I could be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.",A Fella with an Umbrella,2003
John Scott Trotter,"Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Oh, what a couple in love
Frankie was loyal to Johnny
Just as true as the stars above

He was her man
But he done her wrong

Frankie went down to the drugstore
Some ice cream she wanted to buy
The soda jerk told her that Johnny
Was making love to Nellie Bligh

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

Now Frankie's dad was a policeman
She stole his old forty-four gun
Then back to the drugstore she beat it
Just as fast as she could run

After her man
Who was doing her wrong

Now Frankie peaked in on the party
She got a surprise when she saw
That Nellie and Johnny were making love
And sipping soda through a straw

He was her man
But he was doing her wrong

So Frankie flew into a tantrum
She whipped out that old forty-four
And her rootie-toot-boom, that gal did shoot
Right through that hardwood swinging door

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

So bring on your crepe and your flowers
Bring on your rubber-tired hack
'Cause there's eight men to go to the graveyard
But only seven are coming back

She shot her man
'Cause he was doing her wrong

Now this is the end of my story
And this is the end of my song
Frankie is down in the jailhouse
And she cries the whole night long

""He was my man
But he was doing me wrong""",Frankie and Johnny,2003
John Scott Trotter,"In us you see a couple of song and dance men
I'm the song
I'm the dance

For laughter, joy and happiness, we're advance men
With a song
And a dance

I sing for my supper
I dance for my lunch
I croon when the landlord comes around

For miles around the women and children pass out cold
When my voice hits the air
And my feet hit the ground

Last night
Out in the moonlight
I came to serenade
A very pretty maid
I sang her to sleep with ""Asleep in the Deep""
That always makes them collapse
I saw her eyes close, then she started to doze
But she arose when I sounded taps

Which goes to show what women will do when we're around
And my voice hits the air
And my feet hit the ground",A Couple of Song and Dance Men,2003
John Scott Trotter,"It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit before the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things",Just One of Those Things,2003
John Scott Trotter,"Dreary days are over
Life's a four leaf clover
Sessions of depression are through
Every hope I longed for long ago, comes true

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last!

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's Lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you",Long Ago (And Far Away),2003
John Scott Trotter,"Do I want to be with you
As the years come and go?
Only forever
If you care to know

Would I grant all your wishes
And be proud of the task
Only forever
If someone should ask

How long would it take me
To be near if you beckon?
Off hand I would figure
Less than a second

Do you think I'll remember
How you looked when you smile?
Only forever
That's puttin' it mild

How long would it take me
To be near if you beckon?
Off hand I would figure
Less than a second

Do you think I'll remember
How you looked when you smile?
Only forever
That's puttin' it mild",Only Forever [From Rhythm on the River],2003
John Scott Trotter,"The pale moon was rising above the green mountain,
The sun was declining beneath the blue sea,
When I strayed with my love to the pure crystal fountain,
That stands in the beautiful vale of Tralee.

She was lovely and fair, as the rose of the summer,
Yet t'was not her beauty alone that won me.
Oh no, t'was the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee!
The cool shades of evening their mantle were spreading,
And Mary, all smiling, was listening to me,
The moon through the valley her pale rays was shedding,
When I won the heart of the Rose of Tralee.

Though lovely and fair, as the rose of the summer,
Yet t'was not her beauty alone that won me.
Oh no, t'was the truth in her eyes ever dawning,
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee!",The Rose of Tralee,2003
John Scott Trotter,"Some enchanted evening
You may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
And somehow you know,
You know even then
That somewhere you'll see her
Again and again.

Some enchanted evening
Someone may be laughin',
You may hear her laughin'
Across a crowded room
And night after night,
As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter
Will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it?
Who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons,
Wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening
When you find your true love,
When you feel her call you
Across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side,
And make her your own
Or all through your life you
May dream all alone.

Once you have found her,
Never let her go.
Once you have found her,
Never let her go!",Some Enchanted Evening,2003
John Scott Trotter,"Tell me that it's true, Tell me you agree,
I was meant for you, You were meant for me.

Dearly beloved, how clearly I see,
Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me,
Angel eyes knew you, angel voices led me to you;
Nothing could save me, fate gave me a sign;
I know that I'll be yours come shower or shine;
So I say merely, dearly beloved be mine.",Dearly Belove,2004
John Scott Trotter,"We strolled along
Through the heavens
And it was June
June on the Isle of May

Your lips were sweet
As the heaven
Love was in bloom
There on the Isle of May

Close in your arms
Heaven opened its doors
Then like a fool
I sailed away

But our love
Will bring us together
When it is June
June on the Isle of May

Close in your arms
Heaven opened its doors
Then like a fool
I sailed away

John Scott Trotter,"Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds all day long

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my, how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on

John Scott Trotter,"Just say that I'm a friend o' yours
And maybe they won't get wise,
And if they see us together,
I'll brush the dreams from my eyes.

I'll tell my heart it mustn't sing
The song of remember when,
Just say that I'm a friend o' yours
That you happened to meet again.

John Scott Trotter,"Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go
Let's look at the snow
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand
Just holding your hand
(We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land)

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

(There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray)
(It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day)
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts
(Pop, pop, pop, pop)

There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the coffee
And the pumpkin pie

It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

John Scott Trotter,"You're clear out of this world
When I'm looking at you,
I hear out of this world
The music that no mortal ever knew.

You're right out of a book,
The fairy tale I read when I was so high;
No armored knight out of a book
Could find a more enchanted Lorelei than I.

After waiting so long for the right time,
After reaching so long for a star,
All at once from the long and lonely night time,
And despite time, here you are!

I'd fly out of this world
If you said we were through,
So let me fly out of this world
And spend the next eternity or two with you;
I'll spend the next eternity or two with you.",Out of This World,2005

And my laundry is back

It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean,

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember,
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

Twine around the door

In the army last year
Now he's back to business in his father's place

When I asked why he felt so happy
Johnny chuckled with glee
He winked his eye and made this reply:
""Something wonderful has happened to me""

He wanted work so I made him a clerk in my father's factory
And bye and bye I'm gonna have him wrapped in work up to his brow

I come around about four hours late
Ev'rything comes to those who wait
I've got my Captain working for me now

He's not worth what I have to pay him
But I'll never complain I've agreed to give him fifty dollars per

He's outside working hard

That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
Hospitality, they were good to me.
I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
Oh yes, them Blues.

They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
And folks he sure do pull some bow.
And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.

Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
That blue refrain.

There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
Oh play them Blues.
That melancholy strain, that ever haunting refrain
Is like a sweet old sorrow song.
Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart.
It sets me wild to hear that loving tune a gain, the Memphis Blues.",Memphis Blues,2006

Were searching for a diff'rent tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the south land 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2007

All whistling Sam's Song

Classic American Theme
Brought to you by, Mr. Gary Crosby""

But we'll travel the road

Just a-traveling along

Something we don't know what
'Cause none of us are satisfied with things we know we've got.
We all forget about moonlight,
As soon as we've given our vow

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams

Were parted by only a slight thing.

Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin

Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

No tears, no fuss,

This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension, 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension.

With mr. einstein's theory,

Relax, relieve the tension. 
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved, 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed.

A kiss is still a kiss, 
A sigh is just a sigh;

On that you can rely; 
No matter what the future brings, 
As time goes by.

Love will be found the sweetest song of all.

Nashville cats, play clean as country water
Nashville cats, play wild as mountain dew
Nashville cats, been playin' since they's babies
Nashville cats, get work before they're two

Well, there's thirteen hundred and fifty two
Guitar pickers in Nashville
And they can pick more notes than the number of ants
On a Tennessee ant hill
Yeah, there's thirteen hundred and fifty two
Guitar cases in Nashville
And any one that unpacks 'is guitar could play
Twice as better than I will

Yeah, I was just thirteen, you might say I was a
Musical proverbial knee-high
When I heard a couple new-sounding tunes on the tubes
And they blasted me sky-high
And the record man said every one is a yellow sun
Record from Nashville
And up north there ain't nobody buys them
And I said, ""But I Will""

And it was

[Chorus]

Well, there's sixteen thousand eight hundred 'n' twenty one
Mothers from Nashville
All their friends play music, and they ain't uptight
If one of the kids will
Because it's custom made for any mothers son
To be a guitar picker in Nashville
And I sure am glad I got a chance to say a word about
The music and the mothers from Nashville

John Sebastian,"I was down in Savannah
Eatin' cream and bannanas
When the heat just made me faint
I began to get crosseyed
I thought I was lost
I'd begun to see things as they ain't
As the relatives gathered to see what's the matter
The doctor came to see was I done
But the doctor said give him jug band music,
It seems to make him feel just fine

I was told a little tail about a skinny as a rail
L.A. put cowboy with a headache
He was hung up in the desert swappin' rats
And tryin' ta get a drink of water with his knees gettin' mud caked
And I'll tell you and exceptance how he stumbled into Memphis Tennessee
Hardly crawlin', lookin' dust baked
We gave 'im little water; a little bit of wine
He opened up his eyes but they didn't seem to shine
And the doctor said give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine

So if you ever get sickly
Get sister run quickly to the dusty closet shelf
And pull out a washboard; and play a guitar chord
And do a little do it yourself
Call on your neighbors to put down their labors
And come and play the hardware in time
'Cause the doctor said give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine

I was floatin' in the ocean
Greased with suntan lotion
When I got wiped out by a beach boy
He was surfin' when he hit me but jumped off his board to get me
And he dragged me by the armpit like a child's toy
As we staggerd into land with all the waitors eatin' sandwiches
We tried to mooch a towel from the hoi poloi
He emptied out his eardrums; I emptied out mine
And everybody knows that the very last line is
The doctor said give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine

And the doctor said give him jug band music
It seems to make him feel just fine",Jug Band Music,1999

How the music can free her, whenever it starts

How you got there, so just blow your mind

And maybe, if the music is right

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

And there they are, they fell in love, 
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart","Oh, You Crazy Moon",1996
John Sheridan,"Don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
You can't lose a broken heart

If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start

Take a walk
Think it over
While strolling beneath the moon
Don't say things in December
You'll regret in June

Ware your remark
Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon,
Don't be erratic 
Be diplomatic
To keep your heart's in tune

Cruel harsh words
Often spoken
Will upset your applecart
So don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
Because you can't lose a broken heart
No, you can't lose a broken heart",You Can't Lose a Broken Heart,1996
John Sheridan,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1997
John Sheridan,"Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by, I'll come to you
Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in lovers lane, my deary

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Every tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

Till we meet again
Down in lover's lane
Wait and pray each night for me",Till We Meet Again,1997
John Sheridan,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very

John Sheridan,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me,1999
John Sheridan,"In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear
And what insane and silly things we do
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear
As I recall it, you were in it, too

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did
I never dreamt it could be
Yet there you were, in love with me
I found your lips close to mine so I kissed you
And you didn't mind it at all
When I'm awake such a break never happens
How long can a gal go on dreaming?

If there's a chance that you care
Then, please, say you do, Baby
Say it and make my craziest dream come true",I Had the Craziest Dream,1999
John Sheridan,"I don't know why, I made you cry
I'm sorry sweetheart and yet
Though you shouldn't be lenient with me
I hope you'll forgive and forget
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
 
You made me glad, I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue
And who ever knew 
Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you
Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
I know that I made you cry, and I'm so sorry dear
So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?

You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea
I forgive you, 'cause I can't forget you
You've got me in between the devil and the deep blue sea

[Repeat: x2]
I ought to cross you off my list
But when you come a-knocking at my door
Fate seems to give my heart a twist
And I come running back for more

John Sheridan,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

For everything that love could bring you brought me
Each tender love-word you happened to say

You made a million dreams come true and so I'm saying
Thanks a million to you

",When It's Sleepy Time Down South,2004
John Sheridan,"How we danced, as we dreamed at the Mardi Gras
Was romance what it seemed at the Mardi Gras
Was the love that we made just a brief masquerade
Was it gone with the song that the orchestra played
With a sigh, with a glance at the moon above
Was it just by chance we spoke of love
Or did you somehow feel that the wonder was real
While we danced at the Mardi Gras",While We Danced the Mardi Gras,2006
John Sherry,"Now my room has got two windows but the sunshine never comes through,
You know it's always dark and dreary since I broke off, baby, with
you!
CHORUS:
I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, ""I do"".
Well, I feel so sad and blue
and it's all because of you.
I could cry, I could cry, i could cry,
I could die, I could die, I could die,
because I live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.
2. (Now my) covers they feel like lead and my pillow it feels like
stone,
Well, I've tossed and turned so ev'ry night,
I'm not used to being alone!

3. Now I've been so sad and lonesome since you've left this town,
If I could beg or borrow the money, child, I would be a highway
bound!

And I miss you while I'm away
Your as pretty as a city in autumn too
and your like Manchester 'cause I love you

You are my Queen
And like a certain town will always reign
Your as pretty as a city in autumn too
and your like Manchester 'cause I love you....I do

But if you're like Manchester don't you Cheetham Me
If I rush home to find you've been in Whalley's Range

John Siegler,"Stick to your guns
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Nobody knows the trouble this poor boy's seen
People will believe anything

Man on the run
Always gets it in the end
Nobody cares 'cause nobody shares his dream
People don't believe anything

Everything is changed
Everything is still the same
It's just a part of the game
Blood on the moon

Patterns running across the floor
A musical inside a movie inside a dream
Guess you can believe anything

Everything is changed
Everything is still the same
It's all a part of the game
Mama, Papa, boys, and girls

Holding hands around the world
Wrong is wrong and right is right
Nothing changes overnight
I'll believe it when I see it in black and white

Tell me the truth
Nobody leaves here alive
In the black core of doubt
Trying to get out in the light

Sometimes you can't see anything
Everyone is changed
Everyone is still the same
They can't get out of the game",Black and White,1978
John Siegler,"Black Maria, you scare me so
I feel as though my heart stop dead
You're a liar, this I know
I watch you go around my head

Oh, I'm going down slow
You scare me so
Oh, you never let go
You scare me so

Gay deceiver, my eyes they burned
My insides turned, my brain it rolled
Unbeliever, but now I've learned
I took my turn, I come up cold",Black Maria,1978
