Angels & Airwaves,"It's a frightening night, and the wind has a roar 
It seeps through the hall, and from under the door 
Like the shit that was said 
Can take it that well 
I give and I give and I give and I give and I'm still 
Hurtin' from this, from the love that's been starved 
I know I got close but I'm sure it's to far 
From the point of suspense, we know it should be 
The end of the part, of our favorite movie 
When the guy grabs the girl and gives her his hand 
Says take me away from this torch in this land 
'Cause the grave is set up, the hole that I dug 
I gave and I gave and I gave and I gave you my trust 
Like the time that we kissed, and you gave me a lie 
To act of this scene you pretended to cry 
But I'm here and I'm cool, the way that it is 
Just give me a chance and I'll try to forgive 

And I don't know 
And I can't guess it's gonna be okay but now
My last wish is that you do this with me 
Kiss me here, and hold my hand 
Let me feel like I'm the only one 
I know you can 
Won't you do if for me now 

I really had it with the rain and the tears 
The predictable storm that has come every year 
And it sneaks from the shore with the bat in its hand 
I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I'm tryin' I can't 
You're a thief and a witch, but if love you to death 
You steal my heart and curse under your breath 
But the one thing that I will most willing prove 
That when you are gone I'll be fine without you 

And I don't know 
And I can't guess it's gonna be okay but now
My last wish is that you do this with me 
Kiss me here, and hold my hand 
Let me feel like I'm the only one 
I know you can 
Won't you do if for me now 

Now just hold on, hold on to me 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) 
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me)

And do you ever wish to be unknown?

I can say that I have
And I can say that I have

And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down

Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
And reach out your hand, and I'll make you mine
Everything, everything's magic

And do you ever lay awake at night?
And do you ever tell yourself don't try?
Don't try to let yourself down
Don't try to let yourself down
And do you ever see yourself in love?

And do you ever take a chance, my love?
Because you know that I will
Because you know that I will

Angels & Airwaves,"A blue, black shade of love.
Sent from above.
My hands are tied to worlds alone,
And this I know.
Your breath's like wine,
And just like clouds, my skin crawls.
It's so divine, the sky it glows with fields of light.

Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honestly, I will love you.
You make me feel alive,
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.

My hands shake clasped with fear as you come near
To say goodnight, just like a dove.
A peaceful sign.
To help us by as you come in.
Let this begin.
Stars fall like dust, our lips will touch.
We speak too much.

Did you know that I love you?

Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honestly, I will love you.
You make me feel alive,
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.
Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me.
I love you.
And honestly, I will love you.
You make me feel alive,
And I'll love you
Until the end of time.

I've got a lot to say, if you will let me
It's always hard, when you're around me
But here right now, there's interest in your eyes
So hear me out, and hear this the first time

That I love you (come and lay with me)
That I love you (and all this day)
And I love you (you make me feel alive)
That I love you
Till the end of time",Breathe,2007
Angels & Airwaves,"There's a little black, dark scar, tired divide.
This is it, can you hear me?
Have you ever felt a sad heart buried alive?
You can do almost anything.
There's a little red bridge with the view of the sun with a lake,
I recommend such a setting site
And the thousands of stars come out thousands of times
And we can go, only if you believe.

Only if you believe.

Do you feel like you've lost everything you can lose?
This is it, can you hear me?
When you cry do your fears ever Chill up the room?
Calling out in a moment of need.
Do you ever lay awake with a look in the eye?
Asking god if a wish is too big to deny?
I will offer a line. And it is ready for use.
Let me know are you ready for me?

I'd like to say, that you're my only fear.
And when I dream, it slowly disappears.
And when I wake. I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart, beat in and out of time.

When the storm brings rain, snow, fate of all kinds,
You can feel almost anything.
When the day seems to melt, fall flat into night,
You can feel almost anything.
When you can't go on, you got to get up and try.
This is it, can you feel me?
And when the bombs come down. We will make it alive.
But only if you want to believe.

I'd like to say, that you're my only fear.
And when I dream, it slowly disappears.
And when I wake. I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart, beat in and out of time.
(Out of time)",Call to Arms,2007
Angels & Airwaves,"I will run the streets and hostile lands
I will touch the rain with all I have
I will breathe the air, just scream it loud
My feet will never touch the ground
Because the days they feel like ancient clocks
Like when kids grow up and learn to walk
Because your life is full of pure desire
A place so gloriously wired

The lights and sounds
Oh God this is such a mess
And it's like our world
But we're the last ones left
And the hair it stands
On the back of our necks
And I swear it shows
Heaven must be just like this

Do you see the hills beneath the clouds?
The stars and its to lead you out
Can you sense the pain? It's everywhere
And if you try you'll never care
And the love you had
When you were young
Is right outside for all to come
Because your life is full of pure desire
A place so gloriously wired

The lights and sounds
Oh God this is such a mess
And it's like our world
But we're the last ones left
And the hair it stands
On the back of our necks
And I swear it shows
Heaven must be just like this

If you see the light break through the clouds
And fire up the distant towns
Now the world will be begin
Exactly how it ends
When you call for help when you are lost
For evermore or what ever it costs
And the world will begin
Exactly how it ends

Please stay
Don't go
I've got you now
Are you curious?
Please stay",Heaven,2007
Angels & Airwaves,"With an urgent, careful stare,
I see panic in those eyes.
I see you lying there,
Thinking this was the last time

If you hear a distant sound,
And some footsteps by your side.
When the world comes crashing down.
I will find you if you hide.

If you wish it, wish it now.
If you wish it, wish it loud.
If you want it, say it now.
If you want it, say it loud.

We all make mistakes.
And turn it out.
If you want it, I want to.
We all make mistakes.
Here is a lifeline
If you want one too.

There's a field near the dream.

I watched it grow with widest eyes.
I watched us all reach out and read.
Feel the strength as we touched the sky.

If you hear a distant sound.
And some footsteps by your side.
If you feel like coming round.
I will take you for a ride.

If you wish it, wish it now.

Your lips sealed tight ready to being
I kissed you first then you kissed my ear
If I ask you once will you ask me every year

Do you feel alive? (Imagine Imagine)
Do you feel alive? (Imagine Imagine)

Angels & Airwaves,"I was locked all day in the summer heat,
In a small brown house in suburban streets
With a skateboard and my shit guitar,
I dreamed all day that they would get me far.
My dad would ask me about my grades,
The asshole sports that I never played.
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date,
Behind our back when mom had stayed up late.
It was near when I turned sixteen,
Got kicked out of school and so it seemed,
Things were closing in and ready to blow.
My dad moved out about that year or so.
It took an hour to start a punk rock band,
To upset my fucked up family land.
And as I held my mum would start to cry,
I swore ourselves, a better life

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldn't change a thing
This made me all on who I am inside
And if I could thank God
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

The summers gone, the years have passed,
My friends have changed, a few did last,
The smallest dreams got pushed aside,
The largest ones that changed my life,
And all I wish for was come to past
From rock and roll, to love and cash
It's all success if it's what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly

If I had a chance for another try,
I wouldn't change a thing
This made me all on who I am inside
And if I could thank God
That I am here, and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

The whole wide world is mine
(The whole wide world is mine)

If I had a chance for another try,

Angels & Airwaves,"If I had my own world
I'd fill it with love and desire
I wanted the glorious past you admire
And voices of kids out walking dogs,
Birds, planes, trees and cars

If I had my own world
I'd love it for all that's inside it
There'd be no more wars, death or riots,
There'd be no more faiths, packed parking lots,
Guns, bombs sounding off,

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the farlands
To spread love like violence

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the farmlands
To spread love like violence

Let me feel you, carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder

If I had my own world
I'd show you the life that's inside it
The way that it glows when you find it
The way it survives with it's families,
Friends or it's enemies

Let's make this a new world

I swear you can go if you want to
I know that you have it within you
Inventing the first clean musical,
God's greatest miracle

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire

Angels & Airwaves,"There's a weakness in the window, place my footprints in a dark room.
There's lonely voices like a scarecrow in the hallway like a lost ghost.
In the bedroom I see a shadow from the moon with light from a candle.
On a bed frame lies a girl, her reflection in the mirror.

I do this from time to time where I like to watch you as you sleep.
I do this from time to time where I like to think of you and me.

It's a dark night on the west coast, then a soft breeze as the sun rose.
Then the phone rang like a gunshot, like a siren on the beach rock.
There's a message at the river, a certain package here to deliver.
When the day breaks, after nightfall, I will be there you know I will.

Anger of the Lamb,"It starts with one thing 
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
 
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try, 
Keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme, 
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know 
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know 

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all

"Angerson, Tony","(At the tone the time will be
8:59 and 10 seconds)

[ VERSE 1: Hi-see ]
Nine o'clock in the morning, yes, I got dressed
Thought about my girl with the big fat breast
So I called her up and asked could I see her today
She said okay, so I said, ""I see ya Shante""
Hung up the phone, then I threw on my clothes
I pulled some tissue off the roll to blow the boogers out my nose
Put on my chain and my boots and things
Bout to step out the house and heard the telephone ring
I grabbed the telephone just to see what was up
She said, ""Gimme the place and time and we could hook up""
I said, ""Okay then, why don't you meet me in the park?
At a quarter to five, cause at six it get dark""
She said she didn't mind, okay it's on
So I grabbed my Skanless jacket, then I hung up the phone
I stepped out the house, smilin and grinnin
Sayin to myself, hot damn I'm winnin

[ CHORUS ]
Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Sittin in the park waitin for you
Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Shall I slap the trick and tell the tramp it's through?
I'm (sitting in the park waiting for you)

[ VERSE 2: Hi-see ]
On the way to the park I had to stop at the sto'
When bums beg me for a quarter I usually say no
But that day I made all they butt holler
Went in my pocket, gave the poor fellas a dollar
They couldn't believe it, they had to ask me what's wrong
I said, ""Yo, just take this dollar and get yo butt on""
I bailed five or six blocks with a skip and a hop
Mmh... what's that smell? Oh, the flower shop
Now I pulled a lotta girlies out they panty hose
And never never have I ever bought a chick no rose
But that day I had to be the Life Saver
To top it all off, I rushed to 31 Flavors
The girl said she loved me, she said I was cute
But all I thought about was just knockin her boots
I thought about doin it with no hesitation
Now I'm sittin in the park just waitin

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Hi-see ]
Now I'm sittin on a bench with my back against the fence
Hi-see's not dumb, I got a gang of sense
Flowers in my hand, ice cream in a cup
I'm thinkiin to myself, won't this girl hurry up?
I seen my homies comin and my butt puckered up
They said, ""There go the homie Crawf, hey Hi-see, what's up?""
I grabbed the roses, tried to hide 'em behind my back
But I was stuck in a - ouch - caught in the act
Then a old man walked up to me
He said, ""You know, whatever will be, will be""
I said, ""Excuse me sir, I don't mean to be rude
( ? ) I'm in a bad mood""
He said, ""Look like you got yourself a few problems
Why me bein a old man, maybe I can solve em""
""Pops, that sound familiar, what shall I do?""
""Well, just slap that trick and tell the tramp it's through""

Johannes Brahms is often mentioned 
In the same breath as Bach and Beethoven

These models inspired him 
To write some of the greatest music
Of the romantic era

Once during a rehearsal 
Brahms said with great conviction:
Gentlemen
I'm not Beethoven
But I am Johannes Brahms

Whatever took you from here
On these currents that run deep
I'll always love you

Always

We would sail into that big sky
Forget about the time
On the wind we would bide
Watching wild birds sweep and glide

I'll linger just a little more
Drifting on a foreign shore
Spend my nights
Waiting at the tide

Anggun,"Smoke fills the sky
Another day in a new town for me
I look for the light
Under the clouds, beyond the concrete

Up here I hide
Watching the crowds move along

Down those grey streets, I am lost here
In my dreams all alone, I still

Go back, in the memory of my home
Anticipating
One day you'll follow

Oh it's been too long
Since I could see the stars overhead

We used to count them
Shared all our passions, and swore not to tell

I hold them now
And now I know where those stars fell

Days would fly by 
When you were mine
Like these dreams I have known, I still

Go back, in the memory of your shores
Left you there waiting
So long ago

Right there, in the memory of my home
Anticipating
One day you'll follow

One day you'll follow

I'll be here waiting for you",Memory of Your Shores,2002

All of my unlucky number's hiding in the row
While the tap is dripping, predicting what will be
And even numbers scare me, they even set me free

It's funny when you think about your life
You could have another fate
You could be another place
If you turned right, you turn left
Or if you just walked out ahead

I'm counting all the crooked cracks, running through
My floor
Like tiny canyons showing me how to find your door
While a bell is counting out what destiny will
Say
More than eight I'll call you, less I call it a day

(Back to chorus)

If I had never met you
Surely I'd be someone else
Less I'm good, less I'm bad
Less the strangest love I ever had

Your voice in my head brings the smile on my face
Before it's too late maybe I should remember
That hesitate to beat the chance to regret

Cause I have all the time
To take it slow and easy
Sure let the devil in my mind
Decide too fast
Once upon a time
You got to make sure gotta tolerate
The devil in my mind
To think you'll live from your past

They said it's a mistake
That I'm afraid to keep it
They don't want heartaches
To be an adolescence
But then my mind said
Right from wrong
But I'll just have to wait
For love to come along

Cause I have all the time
To take it slow and easy
Don't let the devil in my mind
Decide too fast
Once upon a time
Got to make sure gotta tolerate
The devil in my mind

I try to hold back
But I'm falling for you

I breathe and shake it
Live each moment

Destined to be forgotten
Words you dared to say
That left the clouds in my eyes
On hold to be forgiven

Some things you cannot hide

To give it my very best

Can break my heart in two

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

Through all my darkest nights
Through you I've been touched by the light of love

Upon my heart, I'll give my all to you
?Cause when I lost the faith you kept your trust in me
And I know, that what I feel is real
For the first time in my life
I am complete

Until I finally realized
Your love was with me all the time
And now your spirit flows right through me
A better world is open to me

Dirty and hard
With a breast plate made of metal
She drives all day in her rusty Buick
Her feet don't reach the pedals
He got a jar of flies
His father's disguise
Where his heart should be
Her mouth is sewn together

Should have been dreaming

I got an old bone pocket knife
Tight in my right hand
To save my poor mother from the junkyard man

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Angie Chirino,"If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
How, tell me how will I know
Will my heart make me believe it so
Or can I trust the way I feel
If you could read my mind
You see how hard I've tried
Still I can't decide

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Oh, tell me could this be love

Do you know if it's true
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky
And do you know if you can fall for
Just a moment
Is a moment for all time
Why, why am I so unsure
Is that love knocking at my door
Or the sound of my beating heart
If you could read my mind
You know I just can't hide
What I feel inside

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Oh, tell me could this be love

Could this be love
Could this be love
I wanna know
If you only knew
Baby if you only knew, knew what I've been going through
Baby if you only knew, knew what I've been going through",Could This Be Love,1999
Angie Dickinson,"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten,
Glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in ev'ry store
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel,
On ein the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.",White Christmas,2012
Angie Fisher,"2000 bucks would save my life,
200 bucks would ease the pain,
The I.R.S. is on my case,
But I refuse to let them make me go insane.

2000 bucks would pay the rent,
200 bucks and fourteen cents.
Right about now would be enough some complement
So that I don’t have to sell my instrument

I’m aware, I’m aware, I’m aware,
That pressure makes diamonds, diamonds, diamonds
My mamma told me, my mamma told me
That a girl’s mouth doesn't get paid

2000 bucks would save my life,
200 bucks would ease the pain,
But I refuse, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
To let them make me, to let them make me go insane.

Today he said ""I do"" 
Friends said it couldn't be done 
But all his love I know I've won 
'Cause 3rd finger, left hand 
That's where he placed the wedding band 

He walked right up to me 
& pledged his love for me 
I longed to hear him say 
The sweet words he spoke that day 
Made me feel so good inside 
The tears came to my eyes 
I love him above the rest 
'Cause in my book he's the best 

'Cause he did something that no one else did 
Friends said it couldn't be done 
But all his love I know I've won 
'Cause 3rd finger, left hand 
That's where he placed the wedding band 

His words were precious few 
But all along my heart knew 
That no other boys in line 
Could ever change my mind 
Other boys I sent away 
I locked my heart till our wedding day 
I love him above the rest

All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry

One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high

You don't like that dirty money send yo girl to wipe me down
Million dollars on my neck and wrist shine for a mile
She wanna see it up close then she gotta walk it out

When I stop and I pull up I'ma be already full of Vodka
I keep that in my cup a bay bay on make me bussa
And if you try to take my chain ima snatch yo face off
I got diamonds in my ear the same size as baseballs
Where they at they lost I don't thank they on my level

A bay bay was just the beginning im finna run tha game

Their new clothes and toys and things
That they got for Christmas, this year

But watch your mouth, I'm the type that run the show
Plot the low, quick get your money and go

See y'all ain't really nothing to me
All day you hear my name and got something to say
But I'm a chill, lay it down, make a hit and do me
Angie, up close don't worry you'll see

Come on, let's do it now
Just move around
Move to the sounds
Look at me, Wow!

What you gonna do now
I'll make it real hot, let me cool down
Look I don't care what other people doin
I just want to spit and try to keep it movin

What they gonna say when a bitch drop hits
Y'all niggas ain't never gonna stop this
Watch this, you ain't never gonna top this
On your hot list, shit is just monotonous

You ain't never gonna be hot, shit
You rap mad like De-Da
Me I stay cool, I know the remedy
Make sure you cats all remember me

I ain't never want to fall I want to ball hard
And leave the hatin' motherfuckers all scarred
You got no points on the score card
So you can't be a part of the all-stars

[Chorus: x2]

Look at me getting cocky wit it
When its on then its on, ain't no stoppin' with it
Ride the beat like my Poppy get on top of it
Knockin' it for them fuckers that be poppin' shit

Not to wreck with, resources to dead shit

Love chicks that deep throat, love being left alone

Love having my cake plus eating it too 
Shit, I got cake what the fuck I'm 'posed to do 
Like chicks to dress, but I love a good shoe 
Sophisticated mama with love for the hood too 
Love sexing girls on that boricua shit 
Love black girls that's when the Levi's fit
Chicks that play hard to get on that Aaliyah shit 
If at first I don't succeed, then believe I split 
Can you blame me? Young buck, dirty-ass pops trained me 
Moms allowed it, daddy was about it (Bout it)
Game got inherited 
Mama said if you find love you better cherish it 
Teach me!

I like to slow dance, I like to romance 
I like to, stroll through the park holding hands 
Ask me how my day was, tell me ""Ma looking pretty"" 
On Sundays in the cut watching ""Sex and the City"" 
Having long talks and good loving in the morning
Walk them dogs when my body is calling
Flesh air force cuts a wound with a line 
No stress of course, cause I don't have the time
Like to wine and dine but please hold your liquor, 'cause 
I'm rolling with ya and I hate a silly nigga
Like 'em rough and rugged, love it when you tug it 
You bugging out of line on that thug shit is nothing
Dealt with cats before that I had to train 
Dealt with cats that's poor and a cat with fame 
One who played basketball and I had more game

I started in Brooklyn, comin up in the game 
Everybody has a story mine wasn't the same 
Angela, delinquent, I thought I was grown 
I went through a lot things way before I was known 
See my moms, she never knew I would make it all start 
She was through with the bad grades, the late nights in the park 
Causin my mom pain, my life was in the dirt 
I played hooky all day while she was hard at work 
Sorry ma, know it was hard and my pops was a jerk 
She packed her shit and got us out of there before it got worse 
Moved the fam to Miami in hopes of changin my ways 
A big portion of my mind still remained in a daze 
It wasn't 'til we came back my life matured 
Success would be the only thing that I was fightin for 
I was determined to get there, and keep it hot 
Since that day my only goal was to reach the top 
[Chorus: The Product G&B] 
To every little girl, on every block 
That's comin of age tryin to reach the top 
I said no matter who you are, you can reach the stars 
But never forget, how fragile you are, cause a girl is fragile 
[Angela Martinez] 
It's crazy, when I think back, sometimes I have to cry 
Cause when you young, you don't see how life can pass you by 
You don't even really care if you gon' starve or not 
This go back to ninety-three when I got the job at Hot 
I used to answer the phones for Flex, do overnight spurts 
Back then, I was like, ""Hey who knows? It might work"" 
I wasn't satisfied, but it would just begin 
Cause in ninety-five, I was every day, six to ten 
I put in a lot of work so I could bring in my listeners 
I secured a fanbase, although some of them dissed us 
I was new at my thang, but I was doin my thang 
And I would never let nobody try to ruin my thang 
But of course, there were people couldn't stand where I was 
Cause although know I'm in, I wasn't made what I was 
Through the heat, kept it movin, throw the haters a smile 
What would they do if they knew her heart was fragile? 
[Chorus] 
[The Product G&B] 
Angela.. (uh-huh) Angela.. (hahahah) 
Angela.. (wooh!) Angela.. (uhh, uhh) 
[Angie Martinez] 
Overall, it's a rough business, it could stop even you 
There's people that's gonna say things that's not even true 
Like the one about me not bein down for my women 
And I hated the lesbian rumors that went around for a minute 
How bout the one that goes, 'Yeah, she goes with him. 
He bought her the car, the ice, the clothes and rims.' 
And I'm sure you all heard she caught one dead in the face 
It'd been different if she said what she said to my face 
As for men, who knows where my story will start 
I went through a relationship that nearly tore me apart 
So I'm chillin for now, it's all about me for the moment 
cause there's things that I wouldn't allow 
But I'ma be aight though, keep comin with tight flow 
Try to stay on the low while I'm watchin your hype grow 
Playin the role like nobody can cramp your style 
But I know, like you know, that you're fragile

Let's get it on it's Angie Mar' reportin live from the streets
From Y.O. to Philly and Harlem to Q.B.

Introducing, Jadakiss and Styles P, where you at?

[The L.O.X.]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
You know we still in the hood dog, in front of the store
With the work across the street and the gun in the stall
Soon as somethin happen niggaz want to run to the law
You know the code of the streets, never run to the law
That's why I can't even run 'less I run with a four
or I walk with a three, come and talk to 'em P
You can catch me down bottom with a bird and a glock
On the block makin money where they murder a lot
Or you can catch me up top shootin dice for a yard
I'm talkin six digits, niggaz bet the house or the car
You can catch me hittin the spliff, sick in the pit
On the fiend like I'm missin my shit, they think I'm crazy
Catch me hittin your lady in my Mercedes
Bird on your baby, fuck you I'm keepin it gravy
L.O.X. hold the hammers
like we waitin for screws
With Angie Mar' BLOWIN MOTHERFUCKERS OUT OF THEY SHOES, WHAT?

[Angie Martinez]
Comin live from the streets where some died tryin to eat
From Y.O. to Philly, from Harlem to Q.B.
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, Beanie Sigel, tell me how you livin?

[Beanie Sigel]
Aiyyo, I've been kickin murder - since Adidas with thick strings
T.I. sweatsuits, Pumas with thick chains
Four finger rings, black belts with brass names
I was spittin flames since niggaz was pitchin change
I'm a hard knock kiddo, always played the middle
Threw flacks in the crack game, getchu if I can getchu
Since a buck, played the highway, dodgin the troop boys
Jumpin in and out of Coupes, wavin for Duke boys
Always chased a penny, copped quarter waters
Tried to make a dollar chased my pop's boss daughters
Tryin to make my name, global, in all four corners
Philly baller, gamin in all four quarters
Never worked, never will - all my hoes buy my clothes
I can't go broke, never will - all my bros buy my O's
I'm the best thing that linked up with New York since Sprewell
I murder, nuttin further - fill in the details

[Brett]
I'm here, it's over, fuck how why'all feel
When I drop, why'all gon' realize it's all real
Bein left for dead, tied up, smoke 'til I was dried up
So high up, seem like the sky ducked, high what?
Life was rough, but now it's nothin to hide
Used to click and be quick to put this gun to yo' side
Be like, ""That chain nice - I like that pal.
Matter fact {*click click*} I'd like that now.""
You've got game? Call the name, just spell the name right
Brett, one of the best rappers ever to touch a mic
It's prophecized I'd write, spit scriptures mind blowin
'til my coffin top close and heaven skies open
Fear no man's my slogan, I hope why'all believe
I'm just like you, fear nuttin human that bleeds
My mind breed two movies, six ab-lums, a hundred poems
Thirty R&B joints, I'm beyond the norm, why'all just mad
I'm just glad, got my time to shine
why'all the type to hit three hundred bars and run out of rhymes

[Angie Martinez]
Brett, from my ByStorm family, with Angie
Come live from the streets, from Harlem to Q.B.
And when it drops, game over, you'll see
Introducin, finally, the legendary cool G.

[Kool G. Rap]
It's B.G.S. kid so what you facin? Caps racin
Decapitation twenty buck-fifties and lacerations
Guerilla fam' camouflaged out in the grass waitin
to blass your nation slash like Jason and bash your face in
We ass lacin top bodies and half in the basement
Our style, cast you so bad you'll need plastic replacement
When gats is raised in, fascination blastin and blazin
Evacuation for your whole staff there's gas in the tank and
Gets back abrasions from cap grazin, defy gravitation
Pull my shit back squeeze bust it like masturbation
Hold fort, hold the blow torch, leave your soul scorched
with no remorse, the state of New York, get your shit caught
When niggaz hawk, let the fifth talk
So tell me who's the next man to flip?
I stop the beef shit, with rubber handled grips
Your candle get lit, guerilla shit feed us banana clips
The hammers hit, anything in our range we dismantle it

Born and bred in the streets of New York, New York

Stop in Sicily and tell 'em they pizza fake
And I keep the faith in the Knicks, them fuckers
And I'm quick to get slick with the lip and word to mother

from growin up too fast, I'm a rude ass bitch when I need to be
But I'm cool as shit if you real with me, you feelin me?

Pulled up with a group of trucks, everybody knew who he was 
I ain't playin the boy was cute, and I'm sayin 
we only danced one song but the whole night I was swayin 
Mesmorized by his style, could tell he was wild 
but he had a touch of class and a million buck smile 
Got a thing for a thug and he fit the profile 
Thug love, think I'm buggin brother let me know now

Yo.. yeah, uhh 
Yo, yo.. 
What's his name, what's the color of his Range, what's his game? 
Was he kickin it like he love his train, full of octane? 
Stop playin, know you ain't fall for that 
(Yo he's pagin me) Ang' don't even think of callin back 
Man I know those cats, him and his click be flowin crack

I just can't explain why women are attracted to danger 
A thug and a player look the same in linen but one's packin a banger 
I guess it's the anger that be in they eyes 
mixed together with a pinch of they sensual side that gets me energized 
Fly and confidant, respected and highly dominant 
Got me on the rise every time he draw me with compliments 
Joey I'm fallin for a thug, should I sacrifice 
or let it go brother you never gave me bad advice 
[Fat Joe] 
It's only right that I let you know which route to go 
No doubt fo' sho', once he hits it, he's out the do' 
Know I seem like a cock-blocker, but he's not proper 
Besides you're my little sis, I gotta watch ya 
Gotta stop you from dealin with snakes 
You're sealin your fate let alone I feel it's your wake 
Eliminate all the wrongs in your life 
Don't you fall for them guys, like Pun says, it's all in the eyes 
[Interlude + hook] 
[Fat Joe] 
I only speak on what I know, he cheats, he gotta go 
You think he ain't gon' creep (not at all) 
That's a damn shame, I see you fallin for this man's game 
The truth is even if he want it man he can't change 
That's the life of a player livin lies like the mayor 
Hittin them thighs, be wise and beware 
But don't be surprised, one day you'll find a decent guy 
Someone that cares and provides a piece of mind 
[Angie] 
I know you right, but I'm torn inside 
I got a jonz for a boy that was born to ride 
My only vice(?), saw the guy, leave my momma mortified 
It's no surprise, it happens all the time 
Got me stressin and I'm comin back for me 
Got me, checkin my messages expectin him to call 
I need to, let it go need to stay focused 
But can't, forget him yo so I remain hopeless

Welcome to ""Animal House"" 
The animals are in the building
It's a new day

[Verse: Angie]
Angela... Better known as Angie
We are animals... Animal House... wut we are... animals
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh uh yeah uh uh
All I could do is give you me if you choose to believe it's on you
I live in peace I could sleep but I don't choose I'ma animal the promos
The station, the movies rap Rebecca Lobo
I run elbows with people you couldn't a ""Hello"" from
With a mask and a gun you don't gotta ask how come or where I'm at
I work! I want to make that clear to cats
Nuttin's free and no you can't run to me
I'm ten years deep you to young for me
You could sleep while I drop album number three and 
Yeah you could hate but somebody lovin' me
Evidently number one at 3 with videos on MTV 
You could learn from me then it's back to the streets can't be serious
Haha that isn't funny album still sold can't be curious

[Chorus]
Animals that's how it is that's how we are
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we
Animals-straight beasts 18 hours a day work no sleep 
We are animals that's how it is that's what we are we are animals
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we animals- straight beasts
18 hours a day work no sleep

[Verse: Sacario]
You ain't know em like the highway patrol
I stay on a roll like Joe Smooth on your back I got creative control
A vocal coach shows singas how to flow
When our engineers songs we verb highs and lows if the shit ain't clear
This year I hope you chose to retire or expire 'cause what I propose is a resonation 
'cause the animals is aqua now and all your deticated fans is rolling with me now
I gotta lock to the 5 0 1 n 3 now you gotta watch you can rhyme doin them freestyles 
I rather not just do it I make records and write sixteen bars in 500 seconds 
It's Sacario AKA Mr. Guntalo BDS news track
My spins is a problem so BMI throw me parties
My publicin is lots a dough we animals get me and ""ang"" espacio

[Chorus]
[Verse: Angie]
Look I'ma professional (I'ma professional)
I'm not stressing you I do what's best for me
You do what's best for you (best for you)
I'm not concerned with the bullshit 
Never was (never was) I'm wouldn't check that respect that
I meant 'cause bloods, kings, nietas, and zulus (zulus)
All over this world most who do you
I put in work interviews, shows, promos, rehearsals, reverse moves
All of that shows back to interviews
No time for self, none nigga drive-through diner
No time for my health I'm dyin' hehe
I wonder how I'm surviving myself
Angie OG baby got the title in belt
Queen (quueeeeeeeeeeeeeeen) of hip-hop radio
through the many years blood sweatin tears
Be clear happy to be here on the sequel I'm still workin

[Lil' Mo] If I can go, with you
[Angie M] Yo, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

[Angie+S] 
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

Go 'head

[Angie Martinez]
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

Angie Martinez,"[Intro: Girl]
And you will never break me til the day I die

[Verse: Angie]
Yo everytime I turn around they say 
How I deal with that weak shit
I told y'all of the stages I can't agree wit
We showed y'all, promoted y'all on how to freak shit
But here's a little secret...
Uh uh we still number one, blazin Hip-Hop and R&B quick
'cause it's simple and plain, now can you sit and complain quick
When we payed the way for you to get in the game chicks
Nigga's wuteva...it's only the real that they recognize by the real
And since you don't recognize you know the deal
How I feel? I don't know emotions get showed
If anything I feel violated being that we been cloned
Reporterz quit, I don't get caught up in the mix
10 years deep, I was brought up in this shit
OG , big truck series, the cars is gone
Any questions? I'll be directing your comments
To alkatron...sing that shit

[Chorus]
A primitive mind is all I, all I ever had 
And you will neva break me til the day I die

[Verse: Angie]
My reputation and my name is superb
Now add that with animal house and a flow that's like rain down a curb
'cause I, write a verse and I change a few words, edit and perfected it ..
And and... I'm still on the air about the dough
Be clear, you gotta go each year we lock and load 
Beware I'm outta control animal mode will let you know not to 
hand me no goal
Everything I write hot like my hand on a stove
The (?) know bullshit don't effect me like a ""Die Hard"" knicks fan
So no mas if's and's
I could show you how power shit get ran and I can't get budged
'cause when your best friend is the jury bottom line is you can't get judged
And that last line went over ya head so
You'll probably never know til your dead either way
What I said is real, sing!

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse: Angie]
Uh yo uh..
And I'm not bein cocky
'cause I work my way up
And even tho' it hurt never gave up 
Went from handin' out fliers to number one major.. I don't
I'm about dollars, hold your to cents saved up
Dropped my first album never rock in my life 
Did everything on mah own wrote the songs, hit the mic
Get the beats all nice stayed up got it right 
Minimal help, felt alone
Now you got a problem right?
'cause it's animal house, the team is here
It's a new day with me this year be clear, I'm focused
Best coaches, way too many peeps
Pro to machines and way to much heat
Still grounded never been way up in the sky
Workaholic still spend days inside
Angie, you could never break me, I move wise
And that's til the day I die, ohh, my, GOD

[Repeat Chorus]",Never,2002
Angie Martinez," 

[Intro: A. Martinez]
Yo, uh
The animals are here
It's a new day...yo yo uh

It's about being close to the ground
like dope fiends and not even fallin'
Some people frontin' now they keep callin'
But that's life, ain't no grudge in my heart
I could sleep mornings, that's the business
I just keep that shit apart, that's the wisdom

In my position get hard, I deal wit people from far
Very few I keep close, that's how you keep from the scars
You gotta move like a ghost, cause some people are stars
And all of a sudden.. they forgot who they are

But look at me I'm still Angie, back wit a plan be	
It's a new day you could sit down or stand me
I just try to be an example, bringin' the animal out
When everybody doubting underhand me
Its ample time, If you could not see the big picture
Cause there's plenty ladies like me I'm a big sista
Always on the grind through whatever you say
And just incase you ain't clear its okay
It's a new day!

[Chours1: 2x]
If you need it to be, (uh) Then it can be (yea)
It happen for me, It's a new day (a new day)

[Chours2: 2x]
Keep hoping, Keep focus
Approaching, up, A new day

Reaction to my first verse in a year it was clearly unexpected
Me on a record, We must yea agree it was hectic
Getting here half sleep and eating breakfast in my chair
How I feel, it's a new day now, that's for real
I was prepared to deal wit, whatever was given
People dissecting what I'm spitting on, not giving me a chance
Listen and understand, they ain't know how to react
Off my 16 bars on that track, ""She out or she back Damn""
Then came a record (""If I could go"")
I'm not saying my shits perfected
But if I could go's the beginning accept it, connected
You already know, yes is an automatic question
Automatically answered cause I'm flowing like you never heard
Why second one it can't be said in words
Except it had to be done, in other words I'm leaving on top
You mad at me huh, believe it won't stop
The love it's much stronger you can not break my hunger

[Chorus1: 2x]
[Chorus2: 2x]

See they love for you to give up, can't wait for you to slip up
As soon as you hit rock bottom, they never picking you up
Or never picking you out, they always out when you pick
But when your outfits is sick, or you got a hit
Then every other word is, ""No Doubt,
 When can we go out, When can we grab lunch,"" I only get mad once
Cause when you get mad twice you sacrifice then a punch
And then a situation jumps so I grab a blunt
Roll it and spark it cause you media targets
Pictures is blatant ya know what I'm saying
This ain't ancient this is today shit
but it's a new day shit no games get played shit
No time get wasted, I learn from the worst situations (""yep"")
And I made it, everything I had in my heart I pushed and gave it
So when I say it's a new day I mean it
Cause when it's the truth you must agree shit!

[Chorus1: 2x]
[Chorus2: 2x]
ya hear me singing

Angie Martinez,"[Angie]
He was all I wanted, late night talkin', 
On the phone till daylight often, 
At home he came through, dinner on the table, 
Plate bites lost him, the love was strong then, 
We went for walks then, then I lost him, 
I mean he's still her but I ignore him, 
'cause he's too busy for me, 
He comes around a few minutes then leave, 
Things ain't the way they used to be, 
Then I met this guy right down the street, 
And this is what he said to me

Hello good lookin', tell me how are you, 
Every time I see you baby, lookin' so 
Good,let me show you girl, I can be so good

I tried to work things out, bring things back 
Arguments started, you don't know how to act, 
Could a brought up the fact, that today I met this new dude, 
And I don't need the say it, he probably would a thought I was playin', 
And he probably would a said stop playin', 

But this bullshit I'm about to stop, takin', 
'Cause this new guy's about to drop, waitin', 
I ain't playin, he played him self, 
Need space need time, oh well, you can have all the space in the world, and 
Your man might have found a new girl

Even though you don't know me, what can I do, 
Let me see you girl, one Saturday afternoon, 
Let me show you girl, I can be so good

Every girl need's affection, not somebody who's stressin', 
Hope he learned his lesson, 'cause in one direction, 
You can't see to the left and, you're stuck wit a dumb fuck, 
Who don't understand that one truck, don't matter to you, 

No car crib either, just you and him in a two seat a, 
But they always find out when its too late, 
Tellin' me to wait, no you wait, 
Wait till you see me in his arms, 
And understand that I'm gone

Hello good lookin', tell me how are you, 
I see you girl, walkin' that avenue, 
Let me show you girl, I can be so good",So Good,2002
Angie Martinez,"I got a call from my girls around eight about that Friday spot
Round 12 hit the highway stop, I need gas
Car behind me on my ass, speed pass
Turn the radio on that's my joint got me and I need to dance

Pull up in the truck and it ain't my man's
You screaming ""hey yo"", you don't got a chance
Son, you are speaking a language I don't understand
Know the dude I hang with, I don't hold his hand

Cause, me, I'm free to choose 
It's possible to leave with you
When we get through, I drive passenger seat for you
Let's ride

At one I arrive
Walked past the line
Damn his ass is fine 
Some guy now we up in the spot

Watch
Place hot 
Couple of bottles champagne popped
And that's how we doing it now

I'm scheming while the DJ's moving the crowd

[Chorus: x2]
I was wondering if I could take you home
Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home
I was wondering if I could take you home
Would ya still love me baby, if I could take you home

It's around 2 A.M. 
The mood is trend 
The club is snug
I see him watching, love is love
Caught him when I looked up, gave him a glance
Promotion chick walked over while I'm shaking her hand
I'm looking over her
Sorry but I'm waiting for this man
Is what I told her, so she could leave
No breaking up my plans 
No time for talking about shows 
Or dates that I could host
Damn, he walking over to me, they breaking out the jokes
My girls laughing 
They see me already imagining
He whispered in my ear, would I dance with him 
I answered him
He took my hand with him 
Dancing close
I turned around and gave him my back, he passed a smoke
He put his hand on my hip, then my stomach 
He must want it 
And I was really just 'bout to leave, his clique fronted
Like they don't see 
That they man 'bout to tell 'em peace
And to think, I wasn't even gonna go out..see?

[Chorus]

All I need is my lip gloss, I.D., gum, and I'm straight
Especially if it's Envy in bungalow eight
We making it hot on the dance floor today
But my girls want to leave cause there's nothing to take
Nothing to meet 
Spot dead, nothing to see
Then we all agree that we won't leave
Cause some spots the papi's still come at three
That's when I tell the DJ to run that please
He dancing behind me 
I feel what's under his jeans
And I had one too many so I'm under his scheme
I mean I'm cool and the gang 
The music is playing
Think I found what I'm looking for, no purpose in waiting
Almost time for breakfast 
Standing by the coat checkers
Looking for my parking lot ticket, that's it
And this night just ended 
Can't say with who, what, or where but it'll definitely be remembered

[Chorus]

Would you be my boyfriend? 
Would you be my boyfriend? 
Would you be my boyfriend? 
For tonight only
Would you be my boyfriend?
Would you be my boyfriend?
Would you be my boyfriend?
For tonight only",Take You Home,2002

'Cause I got hot shit, hooks kinda' catchy
I spit so quicks no time to catch me, nah-uh don't stress me

Woke up in the spot with the shiny whips
Keep talkin' a lot - bring out the grimey chicks
Incase you forgot how the grimey get

Niggas surround this shit, let me remind you chick
How one hit can leave you all blind and shit
Have to send your little friends to come find your shit
But right now there's really no time to flip

Just bounce, get twisted, get ripped no doubt, that's

Swear ya'll never drink again, sure no doubt

Rep your city, playa it's all good

Unless you busy, you can party wit us

'Till the mornin' come, then we on the run
Then we do it again - cause that's how it is
On them ones, playa that's how it is
Talk money? it's done that, just biz

Every time I rock it's like ""that's just the kid""

I'm sitting here thinking that sound is still bangin'
As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking
Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting
So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot
Then purposely watch, we so blingin'
And the truck is bright, light up the night
Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking
That sound still drowned the air waves
The echo in my head feel like a bear cave
So I sit back to the sound of this track
Playin' on my way home, I can't forget that
That beat when you hear from the street
Make you want to get on the floor and don't even speak
Cause it don't even matter who be around
Get, and that's DJ Keith, playin' that sound (I need that)

Visions of you in my mind
Haven't thought about it for a long long time
Why you tryin' to creep back into my life
Now that I'm over you

Now you want me to be down
For lovin' you a second time
Ain't no way 'cause I'm doin' just fine
Now that I'm over you

There you go givin' me that same old vibe
You got that something something, baby
You know you rub me the right way
But we've been down this road
You took me for a ride
You left me stranded but I got over it
And got on with my life

[Chorus]

Why should I let you back in my life
'cause you'll only hurt me, hurt me baby
And I don't deserve to be treated that way
So I tell you what, what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna get the hell out of here
I'm not coming back to you, oh

So whatcha gonna do?
'cause I'm not coming back to you, babe
Whatcha gon' do?

Angie Stone,"Look at then and when you got caught up
Reminiscing 'bout the past
Driving by on easy street
Thinking 'bout that we'd be here to last a long while
And real talks, every night and then an arguement
But all in all we both knew
If nothing else, our love was heaven sent

My brother Petey would say
If you knew then like you know now
Would you get down the way you get down
Would you glorify, idolize
Find the time, mystify 'bout life
Oh, why can't we be kinder
Joy that's hard to find
Lord please give me a sign
To some of us here right now
Don't think you'd ride on this thin ice
Without goin' down
Cause time is running out 
And will you be able to reach solid ground
Can only sing the words
It's up to you to listen
Show you the path to the garden
You got to follow me in

Hey boo, here's to thanking you
For all that we've been through

Don't go working my nerve over something that you heard
Don't be dissing my name cause you slipped up on your game
Don't be making me cry, turn around and apologize
Stop pretending to be something you're not

Cause you got mad issues
And you tend to misuse
Every opportunity to right your wrong
You're causin' more problems
With no way to solve them
The time has come to leave well enough alone

You got mad issues
And you tend to abuse
Every opportunity to make it good
You're causin' more problems
With no way to solve them
Time has come, and boy I really wish you would

Don't be acting like me, you've been rich all of your life
Don't be breaking crews cause you've had it good for sometime
Use a masquerade, and stop blowing me shame
Stop pretending to be somebody you're not

And I never would of thought you was all about your game
Now you got to go to where you came
Confusing the brain, it's all from the pain
Nothing to gain, outta my rein
Too late to make a change
Don't say my name, don't no no no no

Two can be one for the righteous way to go

Looking back, reminiscing on
Caught a brother doing bad, and you put me on 
You told me not to be ashamed of what I got
Never mind them hatin' niggas up and down the block, babe 
You held it down and the bills got paid 
She said, ""Go ahead baby, do your singin' thing
And when God blesses us I want a Lexus
With a hide away mansion in the Hamptons""

Girl you must have lost your way from heaven 
Could it be for me you came so far
There is nothing like the honor of every woman
You're the very beat inside my heart
Girl your like a star I feel so high, 
Shining like a diamond in outer space
Girl your like my mother, my sister, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place

You're the blood in my veins, you're the air I breathe
On a hot summer day your like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
You're more then a woman to me

Girl if you take that back, there would be no cure
I would sail there forever, like a ship with no shore 
What makes me a man, any fool can see
You're more then a woman to me

Look at us, living luxury 
And I been thinking maybe we should start a family 
A girl for you, and a boy for me 
Matching stones separate guests, would you marry me
And if you'd have me I'd gladly give my life
Today I'd take this vow to make you my wife
Nothing temporary you know its quite contrary
Just you and me for an eternity

Shattered

Whats up?

Can't let up long enough to get over it

I tried to find a tree where we could lay happily
In the shade, gradually there were things revealed

I can't even hold down a job, tryna follow up and
Behind me
You're over-protective and you're jealous
Change when you're around the fellows

Look at you, look at you, running around like a damn
Fool
So busy accusing me, when it's your insecurity

You need an inner appeal so your anger just relieve
I never meant to cause you pain

Makin' crazy accusations, tracing all of my
Footsteps
For reactin', got me packin' tryin' to get out before you
Get back in
Look at me, look at me, I can't allow you to live

What's got you so pissed off

Took your pocket knife, carved our names on a tree

You are my focus, you're the air that I breathe
Can't imagine you with someone else other than me
You don't kiss me no more, and I need your energy
Tell me where will I fly to if you set me free

[Chorus]
Stars fell like snowflakes on my head 
Now there's emptiness in my bed
I still believe all the things you said
Though I can see the flowers are dead

But terrible lies and emptiness fills my soul
You were so warm, now you feel so cold
The last time we kissed, your eyes were open
Is this just a phase, I'm praying and hoping

(You) Failed me, I gave you the key 
To the entry in my heart, you became part of me
Told you everything, I shared all my secrets with you
And the words you fed my soul, I pray to God that you

Trampled on my heart, threw away the key
Since you went away, all I see
I can't even eat, I don't want to sleep
But I see you in my dreams
I pray that you come back 'cause I need you here
You can kiss away all my tears
Hold me in your arms, whisper in my ear
That will take away my fears

Boy, I've been trying to say.
You look so sweet,
And you're so doggone fine.
Just can't get you out of my mind.
You've become a sweet taste in my mouth.
And now I wanna be your spouse,
Oh that we can live happily, nah-nah,
In a great big ol' roomy house.
Just as long as you groove, baby.
Oh, yeah.
Make me feel good inside.
Come on and groove me, baby.
I need you to groove me darling.
Ah, yeah, make me feel good inside.

Yes, I'm good, good loving,
Plenty, plenty hugging.
Oh, you sweet little thang, you.
Boy, between you and me, nah-nah,
We don't need no company.
No other man, no other girl
Enter into our world,
Not as long as you groove, baby. Boy oh yeah yeah

Angie Stone,"[Chorus]
Like a bird flies, rising hi above the trees
It's about time to let your love run away with me,
But bring your heart.

Every body wants me to be what they want me to be.
Said it feels so good to have somebody who loves me for me.
Said I am empty no more, love is hitting me right to the core,
Here to let you know I'm feeling you for sure,
Sugar don't fret (don't do it, no).

[Chorus]

If there's a problem baby, I'll go out my way to try to fix it.
Whenever you leave to go to work by, it's your love that I'll be missing.
The kids to school fix your food; rub your back, anything else that pleases you.
I want to be your special kind of fool.

[Chorus]

(Bring your heart to me)
You can bring your heart, joy, mind, body and soul (bring it to me).
This loving won't stop, it's all that I got to have and to hold.
Seven days a week, we gone keep it street, it's sweet.
I'll be loving you, baby through and through no matter what you do, do, do, do.

[Chorus]

It's alright, it's ok, let your love run away with me.
It's alright, it's ok, let your heart run away with me.
It's alright, it's ok, let your love run away, it's free.

Nobody understands me better than you.
Everything I am and everything I ever hope to be?

I'm looking for you 
Drifting on a memory 
Ain't no place I'd rather be 
Than with you, loving you 
Day will make a way for night

Glad to be here alone

Just about all that I can do do do

And maybe we can raise a family
With all the love you give to me
Why don't you come home

Now I know this is a shock to you
You're probably questioning if it's true
But you can take the test to prove
What you and I both know is true

You should know
The day before they took you away
Results from that test I took that day
Don't deny your beautiful fate, so

Come hell or high water

Angie Stone,"Tried so many times to make some sense of it
Unsure about the people in the mix
My sacred intention
My moment to mention
Just what it is I was called here to do

Love somebody, give somebody, teach somebody, touch somebody.
And when the good gets misunderstood
The repercussions can be cruel
And that ain't cool
Karma will avenge you

I've often seen the faces of despair
And been in situations people don't care
They take advantage of your every move
That ain't cool cause I'm no fool
They monopolize your time
Try to redesign your mind
The very time they use to find
You're in this love for sharing

Love somebody, give somebody, teach somebody, touch somebody
And when the good gets misunderstood
The repercussions can be cruel
And that ain't cool
Karma will avenge you

To me the world is stingy with love
Everybody for self
And when you finally find love then people hate you to death
A constant struggle between you and your mental muscles
Emotional paranoia with feeling nobody loves ya
No one to reach to
Gravity seen you
You the one in church that the preachers will preach to
And you're prayer just for confession
More blessings
Try to get protection from manic depression and keep stepping
From mean impressions
The supper comes with dressing
Attached with life and karma and its own lessons
And that's faith and love and peace and trust
And never participate with the evil in us
And life ain't fair when you feel wear and tear
Remember God don't put more into you than you can bear
And believe that to death
A long journey don't start til the first step
And that's life

Love somebody, give somebody, teach somebody, touch somebody
And when the good gets misunderstood
The repercussions can be cruel
And that ain't cool

You know, sometimes you always feel like it's something better
Something that can make you laugh better
Something that can make you feel better
Um hmm, oh I know all about that
Tell 'em what you want, Angie

[Angie]
The kind that'll make you curl your toes
The kind that already knows
Your spots and how to hit 'em
That's the kind that I'm missing

The kind that will have you over the stove
At 2 a.m. in your robe
Cooking a late night snack
But you don't mind cause you got that kind of love

[Chorus]
I want a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Do it all, kind of love

Twenty four, three hundred sixty five
Make you cry, love
I wanna rich, poor, sickness, health
'Till death do us part
I want that kind of love

It'd be the kind of habit you don't wanna break
And aggravation you don't mind takin'
An argument or two, well and that's OK cause 
(Cause it really don't matter what he's sayin')
Cause it goes in one ear and out the other
You gon' make up anyway under the covers

But you know, but you know, but you know 'bout that, y'all

I take it anyway I can have it, y'all
Long as it's real love, ya feel me?

No amount of jewelry can amount to love
No amount of life can amount to love
No amount of nothing can amount to love, but I love

When you see my friend sittin' outside
They were there to help me pack my bag and
Tell me don't listen to ya if you're beggin'
Cause they know I comin' straight back home to you
And they know I'm a constant fool for you
So I'm puttin' my things on a U-Haul
And I'm blockin' out your number when you call

No conversation, you can keep your words
Cause ninety per cent, I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for
I'm lettin' you know, it's not exceptional

Ain't no conversation, you can save the games
And anything you say, I will remain the same
How long did you think that I would sit here for
Destroying my soul, it ain't exceptional

I can't believe you even tried to blame me
Cause you're the one that changed, I've been the same me
And I've been by your side like a two-way
And like a pager with no clamp, that's how you lose me
So my friends come, they help me get over you
Cause they're sick and tired of seein' what I go through
I put all of my things on the U-Haul
And I won't accept at all wheneever you call

I should have left you're ass long time ago
(I should have left you)
I was too scared to be out on my own
(Cause you made me feel like)
You made me feel there was no other way
(I would never find another)
That I wouldn't find love, I would be lonely
Cause you, you (made) made (me) me (feel so damn low)
So low, low low, low low, low low

Now take a look at what's happening
This is tragic like when Michael left The Jacksons
I told you, you should be careful what you're asking
You wished I would've left you with some quiet time
But now you got more time than any time
I know you never thought that I would jet out
But I left before you could tell me ""Get out""

Here's a story about a youngin' that started off strugglin'
He didn't like his life so he started off hustlin'
He was doin good in the hood with the cane
Whole hood knew his name, he had neighborhood fame
Now he stays dressed up
Just copped the fresh trucks
Stepped his rep up, plus he stepped his connect up
But guess what, he don't even mess with his old niggas
They hatin' cause he makin' more money those niggas
So one day when he was chillin on the block, dealin' rock
Tryin' to make a killin' on the block
Some dudes came, masks down, told him lay his ass down
Then they blasts rounds and started fillin' him with shots
He can't feel his legs, got grazed in his head yo
He might be paralyzed but he could've been dead though
He on his bed yo, prayin' to God
If he survives that he promise to stay on his side

Her daddy was an inmate, her mommy was a fiend
Her grandmoms old so she couldn't get control of her
It was all love 'til the drugs took a hold of her
First it was liquor then it was weed
Then next came the wet then the syrup and V's, E's
Oxy Contin, she poppin' them pills
And if you got a couple dollars she'll hop in your wheel (For real)
Until one day a nigga with paper
Took her out, got her pilled up then he raped up
Fam even had a camcorder and taped her
As soon as her high faded, shorty felt violated
So she stopped gettin' high all the damn time
Only person she could talk to was her grandmom
Now every Sunday she be goin' to church with her
She leaned on the lord, now he startin' to work with her

Here's a story about a young rapper named Cassidy
He started off at 13, I mean he actually
Signed his first deal when he was still goin' to high school
10th grade, way back then he was a fly dude
He played by the rules, determined to get cake
He started off battlin' and rippin' the mixtapes
But he didn't take the same path that the rest do
He dropped a debut that was highly successful
That's when the respect came, that's when the cheques came
He realized life is like playin' a chess game
Him and Swizz, they started makin' the next album
They say when you make more money expect problems
But the problem that he faced was unheard of
They locked him up, no bail and charged him with murder
But now he got his freedom restored
And he livin' his dream that's why he leanin' on the side of the lord

If I don't make it back alright
I want to make ya feel alright",Half a Chance,2007
Angie Stone,"Looking back on when I started
Had a lot of sun and a lot of rain
I had some joy and broken hearted
But now that doesn't mean a thing
I'm living for the joy and laughter
Longing for my befores and afters
All in all it's been cool
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
I'm so happy being me

[Chorus]
Oh
So happy being me
I'm regretting noting about me
Too busy living life, living love, freely
So happy being me

Stop reaching back from your beginnings
All those broken dreams that went down stream
As we grow, live and know
Some things were never meant to be
Just like people they come and go
Some will live forever and some will never know
That's why god gives us memories
To leave us to our victories
I'm so happy loving me

[Chorus]

All those hidden treasures
Feeling nothing but pleasure
We could never replace, is love (We can't no we can't no)
The sunlight leads us to a place and moonlight keeps us in it's grace
I'm so happy being me

Angie Stone,"Now we been traveling this road left too far
So with love, my best regards
I'm giving you the time and the space
Yes, you need just a little more faith
If you're gonna grow, then you need to know
When it's time to just let go
Cause life is too short to be pretend
We're in the beginning when it's the end

Oh oh, here we go again
Trying to make it right
When it don't make sense, no

Oh oh, here we go a-gain
Trying to make it right
When it don't make sense, no

Now we're both knowing what the problem is
Instead of letting go, trying to make it fit
Making a fool out of love
Ending up in the same predicament
If we're gonna grow, then we need to know
When it's time to just let go
Life is too short to pretend
We're in the beginning when it's the end

Oh oh, here we go a-gain
Trying to make it right
When it don't make sense, no

Oh oh, here we go a-gain
Trying to make it right
When it don't make sense, no

I trusted you with everything
Gave you my all to make you stay
You took, but never understood my pain
Now I gotta leave you
Love I'm on my way

Oh oh, here we go a-gain
Trying to make it right
When it don't make sense, no

Oh oh, here we go a-gain
Trying to make it right
When it don't make sense, no

Time to let it go now
Wherever we would go from here

My mortality I deny
Shadows of memories
Dance across my mind

Looking on life as the altar with a saddened familiarity
Only now in madness can I see the simplicity

Seven times eternity I'm sentenced this living death
Grief and agony multiply with each and every breath
Blackness of space, vast space of time
To richness of life, my heart now blind
Memories of the past now torture my mind
Suffering for eternity no rest in dying
On stone ears fall my cries
Shadows of memories dance across my mind
Now barely able to bring me to another time
A time taken as something owed
Looking back I wish I'd chosen a different road

I try to hang on but you're not there
It's just a scarecrow of emotion
Heartfelt emotion splattered on my floor
A blackened bloodied pool to drown in

A screaming silence I'm trying to fight
Living life alone in a tortured midnight

Too painfully true
As I become filled with you
My face and skull burst and bloomed
We became the nighttime sky
Flooded with millions of years of starlight
As I am without your touch
My heart falls to my feet
And drags over the ground
With every step I take
It gathers every bit of dirt
Every grain of sand
Every and that can becomes full of the flesh of my soul
This is nothing compared to the absence of you
God kissed me on my mouth
And blessed me with the tempest of you

For the birth of a king

War horns the sign of the times

Choking on tears, the prophecy fulfills
The angels arise announcing the gathering
The wages of sin are for all who live to see

War horns the sign of the times
Break through the silent cries
Visions from prophets unveiled
All burns in the lake of fire

Fire will be raining from the sky
The sun will be darkened
The moon will not give its light
The stars will fall
And the powers of heaven are shaken
That's when the son of man
Will arise in the clouds (go)

The level of my lyrics law manifesto

of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without vanilla my soliloquoy profess my ability to just

You fold like Japan's futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestrian
I crush a mountain into grands of sand

The desperado, that refuse to follow
The Fifth afficianado, break you up into parts like vibrato

Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17,

And your flesh has been my pillow

To offer up the deed with both hands

On the dirty ground

Every angle and every plane
I'm imagining your smell
The one that mingled with mine

Once upon a time thoughts of you
Are picketing my brain
They refuse to work
Such long hours without rest
In unstable conditions at best

They're out there every day
Holding up there signs
And thoughts of no other man but you
Could possibly get through
The picket lines to enter into my mind

I'm imagining your laugh again
The one you save for your family
And your very close friends
I'm imagining the way you say my name
I don't know when

I'm going to hear it again
My friends can't tell
My laughter from my cries
Someone tell this photograph of you
To let go of my eyes

I'm imagining your smell
I'm imagining your laugh again
And the way you say my name

Tightened my belt around my hips
Where your hands were missing
And stepped out into the cold 
Collar high under the slate gray sky
The air was smoking and the streets were dry
And I wasn't joking when I said good bye

And there were magazine quality men talking on the corner
French, no less much less of them then us
So why do I feel like something's been rearranged?
You know, taken out of context I must seem so strange

Killed a cockroach so big
It left a puddle of pus on the wall
You know when you and I are lying in bed
You don't seem so tall
And I'm singing now because my tear ducts are too tired
And my mind is disconnected but my heart is wired

And I make such a good statistic
Someone should study me now
Somebody's got to be interested in how I feel
Just 'cause I'm here
And I'm real

Substituting the conclusion to confrontation with a kiss
And oh, how I miss

'Cause I don't want to know why
I don't want to hear you explain
I don't want to hear you cry

I have written so much about you
So much I thought I knew
Words like water used to flow
Now what could I possibly have to say?

She is someone I don't even know
And all the things that you've given to me
I see now were simply reparations
They were gifts of your guilt

They were my preparation
I know I should be mature
Keep my feet on the floor
But for some reason

I just don't want them anymore
I know this shouldn't be important
Compared to you and I
But I can still hear my questions
And I can still hear you
I can still hear you lie

Now vicariously I have her in me
I want to peel off my skin
Let the water wash in
You always said that I was hiding
That I was hiding from you

But you are capable of things I could not do
You are capable of things I could not do
I remember how you pretended
How you pretended to touch me

I remember how I couldn't bring myself
To believe, I remember wondering
What was wrong? What was wrong?
How could I be so naive? How could I be so naive?

Alone in the city infested with faces
Immune to new friendships

Interested in places she's never seen

And nothing is green

Sixteen, seventeen years old
You can smell them getting pregnant
You can hear their rock and roll

That's America you have to be tough
Like a glad trash bag the government's an old nag
With a good pedigree but pedigree's don't help you and me
I see the precedent is gray here and nothing is green

Unless something unforeseen happens
I'm surrounded by the haves
They say I can have some too
Just because of what I do

Do they think a lot about those who have not
Or does it just distract them from what they do
Most of us have gray
Except for those who can pay for green

I'm torn, I'm torn, rejecting outfits offered me
Regretting things I've worn
When I was still playing roles to fill holes
In my conception of who I am

You know, now I understand
It's not important to be defined
It's only important to use your time well
Well, time is something nobody can buy

And nobody can sell you
So don't let anybody tell you they have the advantage
Because all the gray people can say every day
Doesn't mean anything if your mind is green

You wait til I am far along
Then run and come
And catch my arm and say you'd die

If I were gone
Yes, I'm going to turn
And walk away
You can watch me go or make me stay

Ani DiFranco,"Hello
It's me
I'm returning your call
It's Monday Wednesday Friday
Between noon and three

He says I
Usually just let the phone ring
But I've always got a minute of time
For the next big thing

And I wonder
How can he see where he's going
With those dollar signs in front of his eyes?
I say thank you

For your interest
But my thing is already
Just the right size

Hello
It's me
Yes I'll play for the door
Nothing more

On a Tuesday
He says baby
What is your name
I forgot

He says baby
Tell me again
Are you really hot

And I think
He does not hear what I'm saying
He's just looking at my eight by ten
And wondering about

The part that was left out
Does she have a body
That will really draw them in?

How much do you want
How much are you willing to do
Baby this is no business
For a sweet little girl like you

Can you play the game
Act it out
Frame for frame
Do you know your lines
Let's hear them one more time

But I'd rather pay my dues
To the six people
Sitting at the bar
Than to all those men

In their business suits

If you'll just
Get in the car",The Next Big Thing,1991
Ani DiFranco,"In a forest of stone
Underneath the corporate canopy
Where the sun
Rarely

Down

Is not so soft
Not so soft

They build buildings to house people
Making money
Or they build buildings to make money
Off of housing people
It's true
Like a lot of things are true
I am foraging for a phone booth on the forest floor
That is not so soft
I look up
It looks like the buildings are burning
But it's just the sun setting in the window
The solar system calling an end
To another business day
Eternally circling signally
The rhythmic clicking on and off
Of computers
The pulse
Of the american machine
The pulse
That draws death dancing
Out of anonymous side streets
You know
The ones that always get dumped on
And never get plowed
It draws death dancing
Out of little countries
With funny languages
Where the ground is getting harder
And it was
Not
That
Soft
Before

Those who call the shots
Are never in the line of fire

Birthright
Same thing
We bring
Ourselves to the role
We're all rehearsing for the presidency
I always wanted to be
Commander in chief
Of my one woman army

But I can envision the mediocrity
Of my finest hour
It's the failed america in me
It's the fear that lives

Ani DiFranco,"Death
Has been your lover
He has brought you
The edges of your life
And now you are looking over

It's gonna be all right

Someone holds a sign
That says I'm homeless
I'm hungry and
I have aids

How will they define our generation
In the coming decades
Who will tell the story
And what will they say?
Will they say the victims
Were thought of as criminals
While the guilty sat on high
Deciding their fate
Ticking off statistics in their spare time
Tell me,
Which is the crime?

May you never test positive
Pregnancy
HIV
May you never be the receptacle of blame
May you never be the scapegoat
For a whole
World full of shame
May you never be fighting for your life
And at the same time
Have to fight for your name

There are too few who open both eyes
We sit back in our easy chairs
And we try to sympathize
Whether from the point of a needle or
The edge of our beds
We too, like too many others,
Could be dead
Our actions
Will define us

Rockabye, the baby that is me

We were trembling dutifully
I left him too
I left parts of me

I said today I am leaving
In every sense of the word
But I'm in love with your memory already

Behind tinted windows,
They just drive by

Who are going to be killed
Aren't those who preside
On capitol hill
I told him,
Don't fill the front lines
Of their war
Those assholes aren't worth dying for

Pretend there is nothing
Outside this room
And like an idea she came to me

Or maybe too soon
I said please try not to love me
Close your eyes, I'm turning on the light
You know I have no vacancy
And it's awfully cold outside tonight

The rain stains the brick a darker red
Slowly I'm rolling out of her bed
The rain stains the streets a darker black

Because I can't go back

I feel her eyes watching me
From behind the curtain of her hair

I say I think I really have to go now
But oh baby, maybe someday
Maybe somehow.",She Says,1991
Ani DiFranco,"She was shaking and talking louder and louder
Each sentence was sifted to a very fine powder
Her face was wet and tight, her grip was cold and light
A strong wind could blow you down, I heard myself say
And she said word up, sister, a strong wind could take me away

I said how long have you been at large
They told me you were stashed last time I asked
She said I've been out now for all of three hours
I just resurfaced and here you are
I must admit that it has been hard so far

I said skeletons are fine, your closet or mine
And we took turns recounting the details of lost time
And when we had both admitted it all
We threw our heads back and laughed until we cried
We laughed because the world is absurd and beautiful and small

There we were washed up on the curb
As the rush hour traffic went out with the tide
And I was aware that with every word spoken and shared
I could see her shaking subside
I said, sister, looks to me like you're going to be fine

Touch our girl cheeks
And we can hold hands
Like paper dolls

Kiss goodnight
And we can go home wondering
What would it be like if
If I did not have a boyfriend
We could spend
The whole night

In her bed
I sing 1st avenue

Late to rise

She's fixing her hair
And I touch my head to feel
What isn't there
She's humming a melody

She's so happy

This is not cool
Cause I know the guy
She's been talking about
I have met him before
And I think
What is this beautiful beautiful woman
Settling for?

She bends her breath
When she talks to him
I can see her features begin to blur
As she pours herself
Into the mold he made for her
And for everything he does
She has a way to rationalize
She says he don't mean what he do
She tells me he called
To apologize

He says he loves her
He says he's changing
And he can keep her warm

I'll miss you

I say to the water, to the son or daughter 
I thought better of
I could fall in love with Jersey at sunset
But I leave the view to the rats

And tiptoe

Ani DiFranco,"You think you're not worthy
I'd have to say I agree
I'm not worthy of you
You're not worthy of me
Which of us is deserving
Look at the human race
The whole planet at arm's length
And we don't deserve this place

What good is a poker face
When you've got an open hand
I was supposed to be cool about this
Yeah I remember cool was the plan
Tried to keep it all under wraps
But the wraps kept going slack
I keep turning around
I keep coming back

Give me your vertical
Your horizontal line
I want to take each of them
Bend them to fit mine
The world is too good for me
I am such a naughty girl
But when we're together
We're too good for this world

You think you're not worthy
I'd have to say I agree
I'm not worthy of you
You're not worthy of me
I'm not worthy of you
You aren't worthy of me...",Worthy,1995
Ani DiFranco,"Oh, the heat is so great
It plays tricks with the eye
It turns the road into water 
Then from water to sky
And there's a crack in the concrete floor
It starts at the sink
There's a bathroom in a gas station 
And I've locked myself in it to think

Back in the city
The sun bakes the trash on the curb
The men are pissing in doorways
And the rats run in herds
And I've got a dream with your face in it
That scares me awake
I put too much on my table
And now I got too much a stake

And I might let you off easy
Yeah I might lead you on
I might wait for you to look for me
And then I might be gone
This where I come from and where I'm going 
And I'm lost in between
I might go up to that phone booth
And leave a veiled invitation on you machine

And you'll stop me, won't you
If you've heard this one before
The one where I surprise you 
By showing up at your front door
Saying ""let's not ask what's next
Or how, or why""
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy
Be shy

The door opens, the room winces
The housekeeper comes in without a warning
I squint at the muscular motel light
And say, hey good morning
As she jumps, her keys jingle
And she leaves as quickly as she came in
I roll over and taste the pillow with my grin
The sheets are twisted and damp
Well the heat is so great
And I swear I can feel the mattress
Sinking underneath your weight
Oh sleep is like a fever
And I'm glad when it ends
Oh, the road flows like a river
And pulls me around every bend

Stop me, won't you
If you've heard this one before
The one where I surprise you 
By showing up at your front door
Saying ""let's not ask what's next
Or how, or why""
I am leaving in the morning
So let's not be shy
Be shy, oh shy

Ah, the heat is so great
It plays tricks with the eye

Ani DiFranco,"I'm sorry I didn't sound more excited on the phone
I'm sorry that after all these years
I've left you feeling unrequited and alone
Brought you to tears

I guess I never loved you quite as well
As the way you loved me and
I guess I'll never really be able to tell you 
How sorry I am

'Cause I don't know what it is about you
I just know it's not what it was
I don't know why red fades before blue
It just does

And I don't know what it is about me

I keep thinking that someday I will make this all up to you and

Ani DiFranco,"Tonight you stoop to my level.
I'm your mangy little whore.
Now you're trying to find your underwear,
And your socks,

And then the door.
And you're trying to find a reason
Why you have to leave.
I know it's 'cause you think you're Adam

And you think I'm Eve.
And you rhapsodize about beauty
And my eyes glaze.
Everything I love is ugly,

I mean really 
You would be amazed.
And just do me a favor,
It's the least that you can do. 

Just um
Don't treat me like I am
Something that happened to you.
I am, I am, I am

Truly sorry,
Sorry about all this.
And you plot a tiny pin prick
In my big red balloon.

As I slowly start to exhale,
It's when you leave the room.
And I did not design this game.
I did not name the stakes.

I just happen to like apples,
And I am not afraid of snakes.
I am, I am, I am
Truly sorry about all this.

I hear you and your anger hurts 
I hear that it's with, with 
With
So I let go the ratio
Things set, things hurt.

As I leave you to your garden,
And the beauty you prefer.
I wonder whether this will have meaning
For you, when you've left it all behind.

I think I'll even wonder 
If you meant it at the time.",Adam and Eve,1996
Ani DiFranco,"Life used to be life-like
Now it's more like show biz
I wake up in the night
And I don't know where the bathroom is
And I don't know what town I'm in
Or what sky I am under
And I wake up in the darkness
I don't have the will anymore to wonder
And everyone has a skeleton
A closet to keep it in
And you're mine
Every song has a you
A you that the singer sings to
And you're it this time
Baby, you're it this time

When I need to wipe my face
I use the back of my hand
And I like to take up space
Just because I can
And I use my dress
To wipe up my drink
You know, I care less and less
What people think
And you are so lame
You always disappoint me
It's kinda like our running joke
But it's really not funny
I just want you to live up to
The image of you I create
I see you and I'm so unsatisfied
I see you and I dilate

So I'll walk the plank
Yeah, I'll jump with a smile
If I'm gonna go down
I'm gonna do it with style
And you won't see me surrender
You won't hear me confess
'Cause you've left me with nothing
But I've worked with less
And I learn every room long enough
To make it to the door
And then I hear it click shut behind me
And every key works differently
And I forget every time
And the forgetting defines me
Yeah, that's what defines me

And when I say, ""you sucked my brain out""
The english translation
Is ""I am in love with you""
And it is no fun
But I don't use words like love
'Cause words like that don't matter
But don't look so offended
You know, you should be flattered
And I wake up in the night
In some big hotel bed
My hands grope for the light
My hands grope for my head
The world is my oyster
You know, the road is my home
And I know that I'm better
I'm better, I'm better

Ani DiFranco,"You can't get through it
You can't get over it

You can't believe you're here

Ani DiFranco,"Me and all the kids from the neighborhood
We'd play out in the street all summer long.
Rule was we had to go home at night, 
When the street lights came on.
We were oblivious to the rest of the world.
And we'd hold up the cars in the street.
Yeah, we'd always play boys against girls, 
And both sides would cheat.

Strange men would stop their cars at the curb
Say: ""Hey sweetheart come here."",
And I'd go up to the window and they'd have their dick out in their hand 
With a sick little sneer.
And I'd say 
""Here we go again! Yeah, ok this time you win."" 
And I would feel dirty, I'd feel ashamed,
But I wouldn't let it stop my game.
We would play hide and go seek.
Territory would be the whole block.
Sometimes the older boys when they'd find you,
They wouldn't want to tag you, they'd just want to talk.
They'd say ""What would you do for a quarter? Come on, we don't have that much time.""
And I'd think a minute and I'd say: 
""Ok...give me the quarter first. Fine.""
This time you win.
Here we go again!
And I would feel dirty and I would feel ashamed,
But I wouldn't let it stop my game.
I remember my first trip alone on the greyhound bus,
And the man who put his hands on me to see where his knife fell 
And I remember when I left how excited I was
And I remember when I arrived I didn't feel so well.
I remember the teacher at school got me so sick and scared
I went into the bathroom and threw up in my hair
And I could go on, but you know, it just gets worse
So I think I'll stop there...

We were in the, a study room in a dormitory

At the gate in the airport, so, so we decided, well, the study room}

They had filled up the hotels, so but not the dorms! No

Of her tray around her palm 
The doorman cups his hands 
And lights his cigarette again 

And the rain marches on

And point to the top shelf

And we've moved on to the electric chair 
And I wonder who's gonna be president 
Tweedle Dumb or Tweedle Dumber? 
And who's gonna have the big Blockbuster box office this summer

Between the houses and the highway 
And then you can go your way 
And I can go my way

And all the magazines agree with all the radios

And a marshmallow in each ear

For another hum drum hit song to appear

Even when they're stranded on a small desert island 
With no place in two thousand miles to buy beer

Is he different 
Has he changed 
What he is about? 
Or is he just a liar 
With nothing to lie about?

Am I headed for the same brick wall? 
Is there anything I can do 
About anything at all?

Dig deeper this time

Beneath unknown bones 
Beneath the bedrock of the mystery 
Beneath the sewage system and the path train 
Beneath the cobblestones and the water main

Just like I've always done 
And I sat you down and offered you a beer

I fired several rounds

And you came crawling back to say 
That you wanna make good in the end

And you were never a good lay 

And you were never were a good friend 
But oh, oh what can I say, I adore you

And I'll pretend this is real

Like a stupid circus clown 
Telling us both we are the one 

And maybe you can keep me 
From ever being happy 
But you're not gonna stop me 
From having fun 

So let's go, before I change my mind 
I'll leave the luggage of all your lies behind

But be careful getting coffee

Ani DiFranco,"My name is Lisa Kalvelage, I was born in Nuremberg
And when the trials were held there nineteen years ago
It seemed to me ridiculous to hold a nation all to blame
For the horrors that the world did undergo

A short while later when I applied to be a G. I. bride
An American consular official questioned me
He refused my exit permit, said my answers did not show
I'd learned my lesson about responsibility

Thus suddenly, I was forced to start thinking on this theme
And when later I was permitted to emigrate
I must have been asked a hundred times, where I was and what I did
In those years when Hitler ruled our state

I said, I was a child or at most a teenager
But that only extended the questioning
They'd ask, where were my parents, my father, my mother
And to this I could answer not a thing

The seed planted there at Nuremberg in 1947
Started to sprout and to grow
Gradually, I understood what that verdict meant to me
When there are crimes that I can see and I can know

And now I also know what it is to be charged with mass guilt
Once in a lifetime is enough for me
No, I could not take it for a second time
And that is why I am here today

The events of May 25th, the day of our protest
Put a small balance weight on the other side
Hopefully, someday my contribution to peace
Will help just a bit to turn the tide

And perhaps I can tell my children six
And later on their own children
That at least in the future they need not be silent
When they are asked, ""Where was your mother, when?""

Holding my face over the steam

And sit there all day
Watch people reuniting, public affection so exciting
It even makes airports okay

Watching children run with their arms outstretched
Just to throw those arms around their grandpa's necks
Watching lovers plant kisses
Old men to their misses at the arrivals gate

Watching a mother with a mother's smile
Don't tell me to move, I just wanna sit here for a while
I have determined, it's a sure cure for cancer
Watching excitement turn family dogs into dancers
At the arrivals gate, at the arrivals gate
At the arrivals gate, at the arrivals gate

I got me a white bread sandwich with some shredded lettuce
And then I got me a ringside view for my quaint little fetish
I just wanna drain my little pink heart of all its malice
And kick back for the afternoon in this fluorescent palace

Everybody's in a hurry here in purgatory except for me
I'm where I need to be, except for me

Are you mad mad mad

I've been driving since midnight
And I'm driving still

Every grace every ace every near miss
Every decent kiss by a pretty girl

She looked like an angel

And all of the angels did sing
And the angels were watching
And the angels were listening
And the angels were on hand to stand in for everything

When a man pulls a rabbit out of a hat
But the reason I don't call 
Is 'cause I wonder if there isn't a better word than that

cinder blocks, flourescent light
you brought me to church 
at 7o'clock on a sunday night
and the band was rocking 
and the floors were scrubbed clean
and everybody had a tambourine

so i took a deep breath and became 
the white girl with the hair
and you sat right beside me 
while everybody stared
and through the open window 
i think the singing went outside
and floated up to tell 
all the stars not to hide
'cause by the time church let out 
the sky was much clearer 
and the moon was so beautiful, 
that the ocean held up a mirror

as we walked home we spoke slowly
we spoke slow, 
and we spoke lowly
like it was taking more time 
than usual to choose
the words to go 
with your squeaky sandle shoes
like time is not a thing 
that's ours to lose

Ani DiFranco,"In walked a man in the shape of a man
Holding a hat-shaped hat
He held up two fingers and said 'how many fingers? ""
And I said 'peace man, that's where it's at""
I said you are what you do in order to
Prevent becoming what you're busy not doing
And if you do do it truly
Then you arrive at it newly
Then in the end you are absolved
And the problem of heaven is solved

And the man broke into a smile,
Like he was breaking into a song
And he was broken and smiling
And I was singing along
And we agreed completely agreetly about most things
'til the sun set sweetly
Like it does in those paintings
The ones they hang in hotel rooms
The ones they bolt to the wall
As though anyone would want to steal them at all

We talked like children without breathing
'til I stopped this lady as she was leaving
And I said 'excuse me,
But do you know what time it would be
If we were on mars ? '
And she held up her hand
Like a crossing guard stopping the cars
And she said
Five in the morning

In the shape of a man

Ani DiFranco,"In the jukebox of her memory
The list of names flips by and stops
She closes her eyes
And smiles as the record drops

Then she drinks herself up and out
Of her kitchen chair and she dances out of time
As slow as she can sway for as long as she can say
This dance is mine, this dance is mine

Her hair bears silent witness
To the passing of time
Tattoos like mile markers
Map the distance she has gone

Winning some, losing some, she says
My sister still calls every Sunday night
After the rates go down and I can
Never manage to say anything right

My whole life blew up
And now it's all coming down

And she says leave me alone
Tonight I just wanna stay home
She fills the pot with water
She drops in the bone

She says, I've got a darkness
That I have to feed, I've got a sadness
That grows up around me like a weed
And I'm not hurting anyone

I'm just spiraling in
As she closes her eyes
And hears the song begin again

She appreciates the phone calls
The consoling cards and such
She appreciates all the people
Who come by and try to pull her back in touch

They try to hold the lid down tightly
And they try to shake well
But the oil and water
Just want to separate themselves

She drinks herself up and out of her
Kitchen chair and she dances out of time
As slow as she can sway for as long as she can say
This dance is mine, this dance is mine
This dance is mine

Ani DiFranco,"It's not so much that we got closer
It's that her face just got bigger
And by the time it was taking up my whole view
I figured my face had got bigger too

So I used it to try and sway her
Say something to her
Make my case but my face
Never had a chance

All along it was the wrong song and dance
I just stood there without even a stance
Helpless to her advance and her retreat
Backspace, delete

It wasn't so much that we fell in love
As my life just seemed to come down
To a slow walk on a straight line
Between her smile and her frown

And maybe we never were as close
As we should have been
But I didn't know what I know now then
Yeah, I didn't know what I know now then

But I didn't know what I know now then
But I didn't know what I know now then

Ani DiFranco,"You cease to smell the steel plant
After you've lived there for a while
Smoke is snow is ash are leaves that blow
Through the air aloft
All our houses dim their sliding
To the same soot gray style
And we hang our laundry out on Sundays
When they turn the furnaces off

Everybody's daddy works up on the line
The Stienbrenners and the Wilczewskis
Have been there the longest time
And everybody's mommy squints into the sun
Sunday afternoon after all the laundry's done

And sometimes a distant siren
Can set a dog to barking late at night
Then it dominoes on down
Till every dog is joining in
The first rumors of the lay offs
Sang like a distant siren might
And we all perked up our ears
And paced the fence of the ensuing din

And every night, we were glued to the TV news
At six o'clock
'cause it was hard to tell what was real
And what was talk
They explained about the cutbacks
All the earnest frowns
What they didn't say was that the plant
Was slowly shutting down

This town is not the kind of place
That money people go
They make their jokes up on the TV
About all the snow
And they're building condos downriver
From where the plant had been
But nobody really lives here
Now that the air is clean

And the president assured us
It was all gonna trickle down
Like it'd be raining so much money
That we'd be sad to see the sun
Mr. Wilczewski's brother had some business
Out in Denver, so they left Denver
Everybody knows they were the lucky ones

Spire of the steeple
But God's work isn't done by God
It's done by people

Up, up, up, up, up, up points the
Fingers of the trees
The lumberjacks with their bloody axes
Are on their knees

And just when you think that you've got enough
Enough grows
And everywhere that you go in life
Enough knows

Up, up, up, up, up, up dances
The steam from the sewer
As she rounds the corner
The brutal wind blows right through her

Up, up, up, up, up, up raises
The stakes of the game
Each day sinks its bootprints into her clay
And she's not the same

And just when you think that you've got enough
Enough grows
And everywhere that you go in life
Enough knows

Half of learning how to play
Is learning what not to play
And she's learning the spaces she leaves
Have their own things to say

Then she's trying to sing just enough
So that the air around her moves
And make music like mercy
That gives what it is and has nothing to prove

She crawls out on a limb
And begins to build her home
And it's enough just to look around
To know she's not alone

Ani DiFranco,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, ""My God, they killed them all""

Here comes the story of the hurricane
The man, the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there, does Patty see?
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it,"" he says, and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand

I saw them leavin'"" he says, and he stops
""One of us had better call up the cops""
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road

Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates""

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, ""Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, ""Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy""

Yes, here's the story of the hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

""Remember that murder that happened in a bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?""
""Don't forget that you are white""

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, ""I'm really not sure""
Cops said, ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow

You'll be doin' society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no gentleman Jim""

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way

Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum

And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

That's the story of the hurricane
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been

teenage jerk

Ani DiFranco,"The answer came
Like a shot in the back
While you were running from your lesson
Which might explain
Why years later all you could remember
Was the terror of the question
Plus, you weren't listening
You were stockpiling canned goods
Making a bomb shelter of our basement
And I can't believe you let the moral go by
While you were soaking in the product placement

Where was your conscience?
Where was your consciousness?
And where did you put all those letters
That you wrote to yourself
But could not address?

I'm a good kisser
And you're a fast learner
And that kinda thing could float us
For a pretty long time
Then one day you'd realize
You've memorized my phone number
And you'll call it and find
It's a disconnected line
'cause I got tossed out the window of love's el camino
And I shattered into a shower of sparks on the curb
You were smoking me
Weren't you?
Between your yellow fingers
You just inhaled and exhaled without saying a word

Where was your conscience?
Where was your consciousness?
And where did you put all those letters
That you wrote to yourself
But could not address?

There's a smorgasbord of unspoken poisons
A whole childhood of potions
That are all bottled up
And so one by one I am dusting off labels
I am uncorking bottles and filling up cups
So go ahead and have a taste of your own medicine
And I'll have a taste of mine
But first let's toast to the lists
That we hold in our fists
Of the things that we promise to do
Differently next time

'cause the answer came like a shot in the back
While you were running from your lesson
Which might explain
Why years later all you could remember

And I'm mired in the marrow of my (well, ain't that) funny bone

Separating east side from west

To just keep moving my feet

Serving empires of style and carbonated sugar water
And the old farm road's a four-lane that leads to the mall
And our dreams are all guillotines waiting to fall

Us people are just poems 
We're ninety percent metaphor 
With a leanness of meaning 
Approaching hyper-distillation 
And once upon a time 
We were moonshine 
Rushing down the throat of a giraffe 
Yes, rushing down the long hallway 
Despite what the p.a. announcement says 
Yes, rushing down the long hall
Down the long stairs 
In a building so tall 
That it will always be there 
Yes, it's part of a pair 
There on the bow of Noah's ark 
The most prestigious couple 
Just kickin' back parked 
Against a perfectly blue sky 
On a morning beatific 
In its Indian summer breeze 
On the day that America 
Fell to its knees 
After strutting around for a century 
Without saying thank you 
Or please 

And the shock was subsonic 
And the smoke was deafening 
Between the setup and the punch line 
Cause we were all on time for work that day 
We all boarded that plane for to fly 
And then while the fires were raging 
We all climbed up on the window sill 
And then we all held hands 
And jumped into the sky 

And every borough looked up when it heard the first blast 
And then every dumb action movie was summarily surpassed 
And the exodus uptown by foot and motorcar 
Looked more like war than anything I've seen so far 
So far 
So far 
So fierce and ingenious 
A poetic specter so far gone 
That every jackass newscaster was struck dumb and stumbling 
Over 'oh my god' and 'this is unbelievable' and on and on 
And I'll tell you what, while we're at it 
You can keep the pentagon 
Keep the propaganda 
Keep each and every tv 
That's been trying to convince me 
To participate 
In some prep school punk's plan to perpetuate retribution 
Perpetuate retribution 
Even as the blue toxic smoke of our lesson in retribution 
Is still hanging in the air 
And there's ash on our shoes 
And there's ash in our hair 
And there's a fine silt on every mantle 
From hell's kitchen to Brooklyn 
And the streets are full of stories 
Sudden twists and near misses 
And soon every open bar is crammed to the rafters 
With tales of narrowly averted disasters 
And the whiskey is flowin' 
Like never before 
As all over the country 
Folks just shake their heads 
And pour 

So here's a toast to all the folks that live in Palestine, Afghanistan, 
Iraq, El Salvador 

Here's a toast to the folks living on the pine ridge reservation 
Under the stone cold gaze of Mt. Rushmore 

Here's a toast to all those nurses and doctors 
Who daily provide women with a choice 
Who stand down a threat the size of Oklahoma City 
Just to listen to a young woman's voice 

Here's a toast to all the folks on death row right now 
Awaiting the executioner's guillotine 
Who are shackled there with dread and can only escape into their heads 
To find peace in the form of a dream, peace in the form of a dream

Cause take away our PlayStations 
And we are a third world nation 
Under the thumb of some blue blood royal son 
Who stole the oval office and that phony election 
I mean 
It don't take a weatherman 
To look around and see the weather 
Jeb said he'd deliver Florida, folks 
And boy did he ever 

And we hold these truths to be self evident: 
Number one, George W. Bush is not president 
Number two, America is not a true democracy 
Number three, the media is not fooling me 
Cause I am a poem heeding hyper-distillation 
I've got no room for a lie so verbose 
I'm looking out over my whole human family 
And I'm raising my glass in a toast 

Here's to our last drink of fossil fuels 
May we vow to get off of this sauce 
Shoo away the swarms of commuter planes 
And find that train ticket we lost 
Cause once upon a time the line followed the river 
And peeked into all the backyards 
And the laundry was waving 
The graffiti was teasing us 
From brick walls and bridges 
We were rolling over ridges 
Through valleys 
Under stars 
I dream of touring like Duke Ellington 
In my own railroad car 
I dream of waiting on the tall blond wooden benches 
In a grand station aglow with grace 
And then standing out on the platform 
And feeling the air on my face 

Give back the night its distant whistle 
Give the darkness back its soul 
Give the big oil companies the finger finally 
And relearn how to rock-n-roll 
Yes, the lessons are all around us and the truth is waiting there 
So it's time to pick through the rubble, clean the streets 
And clear the air 
Get our government to pull its big dick out of the sand 
Of someone else's desert 
Put it back in its pants 
And quit the hypocritical chants of 
Freedom forever 

Cause when one lone phone rang 
In two thousand and one 
At ten after nine 
On nine one one 
Which is the number we all called 
When that lone phone rang right off the wall 
Right off our desk and down the long hall 
Down the long stairs 
In a building so tall 
That the whole world turned 
Just to watch it fall 

And while we're at it 
Remember the first time around? 
The bomb? 
The Ryder truck? 
The parking garage? 
The princess that didn't even feel the pea? 
Remember joking around in our apartment on Avenue D? 

Can you imagine how many paper coffee cups would have to change their design 
Following a fantastical reversal of the New York skyline?! 

It was a joke 
At the time 
And that was just a few years ago 
So let the record show 
That the FBI was all over that case 
That the plot was obvious and in everybody's face 
And scoping that scene 
Religiously 
The CIA 
Or is it KGB? 
Committing countless crimes against humanity 
With this kind of eventuality 
As its excuse 
For abuse after expensive abuse 
And it didn't have a clue 
Look, another window to see through 
Way up here 
On the hundredth and fourth floor 
Look 
Another key 
Another door 
Ten percent literal 
Ninety percent metaphor 
Three thousand some poems disguised as people 
On an almost too perfect day 
Must be more than pawns 
In some asshole's passion play

And it's my job 
To make it that way 
To make sure they didn't die in vain

Mostly it's my chi

And there's this moth outside my kitchen door
She's bonkers for that bare bulb
Flying round in circles
Bashing in her exoskull
And out in the woods she navigates fine by the moon
But get her around a light bulb and she's doomed 

She is trying to evolve
She's just trying to evolve 

Now let's get talking reefer madness
Like some arrogant government can't
By any stretch of the imagination
Outlaw a plant

Is a dream
C'mon people
We've got to come clean 

'cause they are locking our sons
And our daughters in cages
They are taking by the thousands
Our lives from under us
It's a crash course in religious fundamentals
Now let's all go to war
Get some bang for our buck 

I am trying to evolve
I'm just trying to evolve 

Gunnin' for high score in the land of dreams
Morbid bluish-white consumers ogling luminous screens
On the trail of forgetting
Cruising without a care
The jet set won't abide by that pesky jet lag
And our lives boil down to an hour or two
When someone pulls a camera out of a bag 

And I am trying to evolve
I'm just trying to evolve 

So I walk like I'm on a mission
'cause that's the way I groove

I got less and less to prove

I bet you're teetering on the edge of sobriety

And once again 
It's like the first time you've felt that shock

Like a big furry rat died inside of that wall kinda smell 

Bad dreams like this roll in like a cold front 
Thunderous thunder and lightning in tow 
And your tiny little life gets even smaller

If we let our love off of its leash
Do you fear, like I fear how fierce it could be?

Your headlights sweeping across my ceiling
The breadth of my smile now, the depth of my feeling
Way down in my dark life, a shaft of your light shines through

A defacto choice of macro 
Or microcosmic melancholy 
But, baby, any way you slice it 
I'm thinkin I could just as soon use 
The time alone 

Yes, the goons have gone global 
And the C-E-O's are shredding files 
And the democrans and the republicrats 
Are flashing their toothy smiles 
And uncle tom is posing for a photo op 
With the oval office clan 
And uncle Sam is rigging cockfights 
In the promised land 
And that knife you stuck in my back is still there 
It pinches a little when I sigh and moan 
And these days I'm thinkin' I could just as soon use 
The time alone

Of suggestion 
And the freedom of the press is meaningless 
If nobody asks a question

Is to over simplify

And that's the truth

Sniping off their sharp shooter singles from their styrofoam towers 
And hip hop is tied up in the back room 
With a logo stuffed in its mouth

I'm getting away from myself

Is I get fucked up

Seems to have got the best of me 
We start out sugared up on cool-aid and manifest destiny 
And we memorize all the president's names 
Like little trained monkeys 
And then we're spit into the world 
So many spinny-eyed t.v. junkies 
Incapable of unravelling the military industrial mystery 
Preemptively pacified with history book history 
And I've bin around the world now 
And I can see this about america 
The mind control is steep here, man 
The myopia is deep here 

And behold 
Those that try to expose the reality 
Who really try to realize democracy 
Are shot with rubber bullets and gassed off the streets 
While the global power brokers are kept clean and discrete

Behind a moat

Ani DiFranco,"I love my country
By which I mean
I am indebted joyfully
To all the people throughout its history
Who have fought the government to make right
Where so many cunning sons and daughters
Our fore mothers and forefathers
Came singing through slaughter
Came through hell and high water 
So that we could stand here
And behold breathlessly the sight
How a raging river of tears
Cut a grand canyon of light

Yes, I've bin so many places
Flown through vast empty spaces
With stewardesses whose hands
Look much older than their faces
I've tossed so many napkins
Into that big hole in the sky
Bin at the bottom of the Atlantic
Seething in a two-ply
Looking up through all that water
And the fishes swimming by
And I don't always feel lucky
But I'm smart enough to try
'cause humility has buoyancy
And above us only sky
So I lean in
Breathe deeper that brutal burning smell
That surrounds the smoldering wreckage
That I've come to love so well
Yes, color me stunned and dazzled
By all the red white and blue flashing lights
In the American intersection
Where black crashed head on with white
Comes a melody
Comes a rhythm
A particular resonance
That is us and only us
Comes a screaming ambulance
A hand that you can trust 
Laid steady on your chest
Working for the better good
(which is good at its best)
And too, bearing witness
Like a woman bears a child:
With all her might

Born of the greatest pain
Into a grand canyon of light

I mean, no song has gone unsung here
And this joint is strung crazy tight
And people bin raising up their voices
Since it just ain't bin right
With all the righteous rage
And all the bitter spite
That will accompany us out
Of this long night
That will grab us by the hand
When we are ready to take flight

In the upright and locked position
Shocked to tears by each new vision

To let the truth out
Coolest f-word ever deserves a fucking shout!

Call themselves feminists?

Of the neighbor's big console t.v.
Is basking on the ceiling
Of another insomniac spree
And outside sleep's open window
Between the drops of rain

For every earthly pain

Oh to clean up the clutter of echoes
Coming in and out of focus
Words spoken
Like locusts

Or say away

Dialogues that dither down reminiscent
Of the way it likes to rain
Every screen
A smoke screen
Oh to dream
Just for a moment
The picture
Outside the frame

Then in a flash
The light blue horizon
Spanning a sudden black
Is sucked into the vanishing point
And quiet rushes back
To search for the downbeat
In a tabla symphony
To search in the darkness
For someone who looks like me

(though I'm not really who I said I was
Or who I thought I'd be)

Conversations consisting
Of the kind of marks we make

Twenty feet 
Two feet away

But your eyes were not listening
And my ears were looking around
For another song to sing
But it was you each time
It was you

The answer to each moment must be yes
And the question: can you live with that?
Becomes the test
So you weigh it against that aching in your chest
And that secretly relentless emptiness

And you talk it out and you talk it down
But your eyes are not listening
And my ears are running around
Looking for another song to sing
But it is you each time
It is you

So my heart finally broke
It was so long bent
And it broke in three places 
When it finally went
It wanted only to say what it meant
So it suffered every punishment

They were happy to pay taxes
For the schools and roads
Happy to be here

And holding to her hand was me
Cause I was just a girl in a room full of women
Licking stamps and laughing

Of democracy happening

But even though my parents were cool
I had to teach myself to see
All that stuff that got lost
On its way to church
All that stuff that got lost
On its way to school
All that stuff that got lost
On its way to the house of my family
But something was not lost on me

Teach myself to see each of us
Through the limbs of forgiveness
Like we're stuck with each other, god forbid
Teach myself to smile
And stop and talk to whole other color kids
Teach myself to be new in an instant like the truth
Is accessible at any time
Teach myself its never ever one or the other

And I remember thinking that the long hair lady
Who called herself a poet was particularly cool

And I found my path to joy through those trees
But I had to teach myself to keep coming back
To the view from a field from right in the middle of my peace

And not once do you come home
To find a man sitting in your bedroom
That is
A man you don't know
Who came a long way to deliver one very specific message:
Lock your back door, you idiot
However invincible you imagine yourself to be
You are wrong

Thirty-three years go by
And you loosen the momentum of teenage nightmares
Your breasts hang like a woman's
And you don't jump at shadows anymore
Instead you may simply pause to admire
Those that move with the grace of trees
Dancing past streetlights
And you walk through your house without turning on lamps
Sure of the angle from door to table
From table to staircase
Sure of the number of steps
Seven to the landing
Two to turn right
Then seven more
Sure you will stroll serenely on the moving walkway of memory
Across your bedroom 
And collapse with a sigh onto your bed
Shoes falling
Thunk thunk
Onto the floor
And there will be no strange man
Suddenly all that time sitting there
Sitting there on what must be the prize chair
In your collection of uncomfortable chairs
With a wild look in his eyes
And hands that you cannot see
Holding what?
You do not know

So sure are you of the endless drumming rhythm of your isolation
That you are painfully slow to adjust
If only because 
Yours is not that genre of story
Still and again, life cannot muster the stuff of movies
No bullets shattering glass
Instead fear sits patiently
Fear almost smiles when you finally see him
Though you have kept him waiting for thirty-three years
And now he has let himself in
And he has brought you fistfuls of teenage nightmares
Though you think you see, in your naivete
That he is empty handed
And this brings you great relief 
At the time

New as you are, really, to the idea that
Even after you've long since gotten used to the parameters
They can all change
While you're out one night having a drink with a friend
Some big hand may be turning a big dial
Switching channels on your dreams
Until you find yourself lost in them
And watching your daily life with the sound off
And of course having cautiously turned down the flame under your eyes
There are more shadows around everything
Your vision a dim flashlight that you have to shake all the way to the outhouse
Your solitude elevating itself like the spirit of the dead
Presiding over your supposed repose
Not really sleep at all 
Just a sleeping position and a series of suspicious sounds
A clanking pipe
A creaking branch 
The footfalls of a cat
All of this and maybe 
The swish of the soft leather of your intruder's coat
As you walk him step by step back to the door
Having talked him down off the ledge of a very bad idea
Soft leather, big feet, almond eyes

And his pistol

Against the world

Play out the hands they were dealt

I know more about how my father must have felt

I just want you to understand
That I know what all the fighting was for
And I just want you to understand
That I'm not angry anymore
I'm not angry anymore

And I start slipping away
I was taught to zip it
If I got nothing nice to say

And down in the Texas of my heart
Driving a really big truck
Headed down a dirt road

The really big eyes, big lips, big nose

Just show me a moment that is mine
Its beauty blinding and unsurpassed
Make me forget every moment that went by
And left me so half-hearted
'cause I felt it so half-assed

You are an unruly, translucent
A dirty windshield with a shifting view
So many cunning running landscapes
For my dented door to open into

I just wanna tune out all the billboards
Weld myself a mental shield
I just wanna put down all the pressures
And feel how I really feel

Just show me a moment that is mine
Its beauty blinding and unsurpassed
Make me forget every moment that went by
And left me so half-hearted
'cause I felt it so half-assed

Spring is super in the supermarkets
And the strawberries prance and glow
Never mind that they're all kinda tart
And tasteless as strawberries go

Meanwhile, wild things are not for sale
Anymore than they are for show
So I'll be outside
In love with the kind of beauty
It takes more than eyes to know

In which I could say only hello
And thank you very much, but you

And you were no picnic
You were no prize
But you had just enough pathos 
To keep me hypnotized, hypnotized
Hypnotized, hypnotized
Hypnotized

And the map led to an island
In a sea of store-bought dreams
Where soulless singers sang
Over beats built by machines

Above my head like gulls with their
Long slender necks and their delicate skulls

I was no prize

Through the eyes of a stray dog
From an alley across the street
And my whole mission just seems so finite
My whole saga just seems so cheap

I mean I know that now is all there is
And love just makes you cry
So I live for the sight of a rare bird
Suddenly flying by

Through the eyes of a stray dog

Like the women who are
Surrounded by children in a car
Surrounded by cars

Or Manhattan was a project
That projected the worst of mankind
First, one and then the other
Has made its mark on my mind

It's sixty years later
Near the hypo-center of the A-bomb
I'm in the middle of Hiroshima
Watching a twisted old Eucalyptus tree wave

One of the very few lives
That survived and lives on
Remembering the day it was suddenly
Thousands of degrees in the shade

And what all of nature gave birth to
Terror took in a blinding ray
With the kind of pain
It would take cancer so many years just to say

Oh, to grow up gagged and blindfolded
A man's world in your little girl's head
The voice of the great Mother drowned out
In the constant honking
Haunting the car crash up ahead

Oh, to grow up hypnotized
And then try to shake yourself awake
'cause you can sense what has been lost
'cause you can sense what is at stake

Yeah, so it took me a few years to catch on
That those days I catch everyone's eye
Correspond with those nights of the month
When the moon gleams like an egg in the sky

And men are using a sense
They don't even know they have
Just to watch me walk by
And me, I'm supposed to be sensible
Leave my animal outside to cry

But when all of nature conspires
To make me her glorious whore
It's 'cause in my body, I hold the secret recipe
Of precisely what life is for

And the patriarchy that looks to shame me for it
Is the same one making war
And I've said too much already
But I'll tell you something more

To split yourself in two
Is just the most radical thing you can do
So girl, if that shit ain't up to you
Then you simply are not free

'cause from the sunlight on my hair
To which eggs I grow to term
To the expression that I wear
All I really own is me

Yes, to split yourself in two
Is just the most radical thing you can do
Goddess forbid, that little atom
Should grow so jealous of Eve

And in the face of the great farce
Of the nuclear age

It's about reprieve

Go forth naked from its doors
'cause women should be allies
Not competitors

And I had to leave the house of God
'cause Cross replaced the wheel
And the goddesses were out in the garden
With the plants that nourish and heal

I had to leave the house of privilege
Spend Christmas homeless and feeling bad
To learn that privilege is a headache
That you don't know, that you don't have

And I had to leave the house of television
To start noticing the clouds
It's amazing the stuff you see
When you finally shed that shroud

I had to leave the house of conformity
In order to make art
I had to be more or less true
To learn to tell the two apart

And I had to leave the house of fear
Just about as soon as I could crawl
Ignore my face on the 'Wanted' posters
Stuck to the post office wall

I had to leave the house of self-importance
To doodle my first tattoo
Realize a tattoo is no more permanent
Than I am

And who ever said that life is suffering
I think they had their finger on the pulse of joy
Ain't the power of transcendence
The greatest one we can employ?

You can hear it in what we say
You can see it in what we do
We negotiate with chaos
For some sense of satisfaction
If you won't give it to me
At least give me a better view

[Chorus]

I build each one of my songs
Out of glass
So you can see me inside of them
I suppose
Or you could just leave the image of me
In the background, I guess
And watch your own reflection superimposed

I build each one of my days out of hope
And I give that hope your name
And I don't know you that well
But it don't take much to tell
Either you don't have the balls
Or you don't feel the same

[Chorus]

I search your profile for a translation
I study the conversation like a map
'cause I know there is strength
In the differences between us
And I know there is comfort
Where we overlap",Overlap [New Version],2007

I cannot explain this

I guess I'd fear this 
I guess I'd keep it down

This is the skin it's in
That is according to light
And gravity
I'll take off my disguise
The mask you met me in
'Cause I got something 
For you to see
Just gimme your skeleton
Give me the skin it's in
Yeah baby, this is you
According to me
I never avert my eyes
I never compromise
So never never mind
The poetry

I gotta cover my butt 'cause I covet
Another man's wife 
I gotta divide my emotions
Into wrong and right
Then I get to see how close I can get to it
Without giving in
Then I get to rub up against it
Till I break the skin
Rub up against it
Till I break the skin

Thy're gonna be mad at me and you
Thy're gonna be mad at us

Of reagan and bush

I am HIV
And I'm down at the blue jesus
Blue cross hospital
Just lookin' up from my pillow
Feeling blessed

And the mighty multinationals

So it's as easy as breathing
For us all to participate

Off shares of air
And you know it's all around you
But it's hard to point and say ""there""
So you just sit on your hands
And quietly contemplate

Your next bold move
The next thing you're gonna need to prove
To yourself

What a waste of thumbs that are opposable
To make machines that are disposable
And sell them to seagulls flying in circles
Around one big right wing

Yes, the left wing was broken long ago
By the slingshot of cointelpro
And now it's so hard to have faith in
Anything

Especially your next bold move
Or the next thing you're gonna need to prove
To yourself

You want to track each trickle
Back to its source
And then scream up the faucet
'til your face is hoarse
'cause you're surrounded by a world's worth
Of things you just can't excuse

But you've got the hard cough of a chain smoker
And you're at the arctic circle playing strip poker
And it's getting colder and colder
Everytime you lose

Well directed, brilliantly casted
Riding a Greyhound down to the city
With her fake I.D. and a hell of a little hand basket

Little game of seesaw, then he came to claim her
And then a sordid line formed behind him
Reproductive system newly activated
She participated in nature's plan, she participated

And I can't say I envy her, I don't think I miss it
Wrought iron cobwebbing over thin windowpanes
The city seducing you on tiptoe to kiss it
Don't think twice, just roll the dice, roll the dice

So she attended the dance classes and she learned the little dance
And she tried the high heels but she couldn't bring herself to prance
All the while a faint ticking in the silence between the songs
Just south of her gut two tiny time bombs

And love comes in many forms and for each she would yearn
Hungry as a student, hunger to learn
Every flavor of person, every species of intent
With the body pulsing at the center detente

But all the good graffiti got painted over in time
She watched the last faceless chain replace the last five and dime
And she wondered if the only noble thing
Ain't to just to get a big garden and plant it in the spring

Kiss the city goodbye in some big graceful gesture
And focus on the moon's groove, groove with the moon
Focus on the moon's groove and groove with the moon
Focus on the moon's groove, groove with the moon

A ticket and a mind to fly, an alarm clock still drunk and high

A compact frown projected on a retina upside down

Swooning like a boxer that is too dizzy to duck
Your decisions turn around and make you back and then you're stuck
And then good luck, good luck, good luck, good luck

A lock with a key in it that ain't turning
Smoke filling up behind a door, a fire with the purpose of being ignored
A body slipping into disease, quietly making that choice
While the joy drains out of a voice

We had an amendment
To give civil rights to women
To once and for all just
Really lay it down from
The point of view of women

I know what you’re thinking
That’s just redundant
Chicks got it good now
They can almost be president
But it's worker against worker
Time and time again
Cause the rich use certain issues as a tool
When I say we need the E.R.A ain’t cause I’m a fool
It’s cause without it nobody can get away
With anything cruel

And you don’t need to go far like
Just over to Canada
To feel the height and sense of
Live and let live
What is it about Americans
Like so many pit-bulls
Trained to attack them
To never give

We gotta put down abortion
Put it down in the books for good
As central to the civil rights
Of women
Make diversity legal
Make it finally understood
Through the civil rights of women

And if you don’t like abortion
Don’t have an abortion
And teach your children
How they can avoid them
But don’t treat all women
Like they are your children
Compassion has many faces
Many names
And if men can kill and be decorated
Instead of blamed
Then a woman called upon to mother
Can choose to refrain

And contrary to eons
Of old time religion
Your body is your only
True dominion
Nature is not here to serve you
Or at any cause to preserve you
That’s just some preacher man’s
Old time opinion

Life is sacred
Life is also profane
A woman’s life
It must be hers to name
Let out an amendment
Put this brutal game to rest
Trust, women will still take you
To their breast
Trust, women will always
Do their best
Trust, our differences make us stronger
Not less

In this amendment shall be
Family structure shall be free
We’ll have the right to civil our unions
With equal rights and
Equal protection
Intolerance finally
Ruined

And then there’s the kids rights
They’ll naturally be on board
The funnel through which
Women’s lives are poured
Our family is so big
And we’re all so very small
Let a web of relationship
Be laid over it all

Over the strutter of power piled up to the sky
Over the illusion of autonomy on which it relies
Over any absolute that nature does not supply

And the birthing woman shall regain her place
In a circle of women, in a sacred space
Turn off the machines, put away the knifes
This amendment shall deliver from bondage midwives",Amendment,2012

And baby tell me, tell me
Tell me with your eyes
Tell me in a glance of a hand
Let me know I still can

Blowin’ its horn that way
But it don’t really matter
I wasn’t sleeping anyway
I got precious little time
Before that rooster starts
Just trying to calm my mind
Just trying to still my heart

The more I get
My focus right
The more I see
How one could lose sight
The many things that don’t suck
Rival the things that do
And we all live in the house
Of what we pay attention to

I’m really not that bad
Once you get use to me
Might even make you glad

Just trying to walk that line
Just trying to do my part

Trying to still my heart",Still My Heart,2014

Beneath our feet
And an unexplored hemisphere
Lying underneath

Fresh from their long sleep

We get so off track sometimes
We get so off track sometimes

I mean what the hell?
Raise your hand if you’re at peace right now
In fact just stand up and take a bow
Everywhere you look just see damaged goods

Got my sense of humor
And my appetite
Got my Joie De Vivre
And my yeah yr right

Don’t need a sleep number
To help me sleep
Don’t need to rush on home
To my TV
Don’t need a chocolate bar
Or a new hairdo
I’m so into you
I’m into me too

Yeah we could make the scene
We could spiff and primp
I could be your wife
You could be my pimp
Or we could get up in the daytime
And raise a kid

I so would be glad if we did",Yeah Yr Right,2014
Ania,"Si l'bonheur a pris mon phone, frère, qu'il m'appelle
La musique adoucit les moeurs, boy, qu'elle m'apaise
Ce qu'on veut c'est la paix, frère, dans nos terres, pas leurs guerres
Du coup nos adversaires veulent qu'on se taise
L'ange de la mort, lui, ne passe pas de coups de fils
Pour être rongé par les vers, akhi, y a pas de profil
C'est bientôt la fin donc je me fais pas trop de films
J'veux pas griller comme les cigares que les patrons fument
Y'a des orphelins, des veuves pour des histoires de frontière
C'est avec des missiles que les chefs d'état font taire
Les prières des victimes qu'elles prononcent une fois le front à terre
Sachant que la patience et la réussite font pair

J'me fais chier comme un gosse dans une galerie d'art
Et j'ai l'impression qu'on me l'a mise comme un afro-cainri d'Harlem
Je mettrais bien la boulette comme devant un feu orange
Je gagnerais bien quelques sous histoire de faire plaiz' un peu aux rent-p's
Des fois, j'aimerais être quelqu'un d'autre
J'aimerais être un pieux qui se contente d'eau et quelques dattes (Je te jure)
Ma vie m'fait peur, j'sais ce qu'il y a après la mort
J'veux pas m'faire défoncer comme les cain-ris à Pearl Harbor
Ici c'est pas les chats qui te-mon sur les gouttières
Mais les petits cambrioleurs, j'les entends rire d'leur coup d'hier
Je les ai même vus ser-po dans le Noctant
Petite bouteille en plastique mais crois même pas que c'est de l'eau dedans
Et ça c'est rien, y'a bien pire chez les filles du seize
Certaines ont plus de conquêtes que les femmes qui vivent du sexe
Il se passe trop de choses, heureusement je sais pas tout
Mais je serais pas dans la merde si le Diable n'avait pas chié partout

J'ai peur que mes actions soient celles des gens de l'enfer
La clef du paradis se trouve pas dans un sac Lancel
Lointaine est l'époque où les homos se maquaient en scred'
Maintenant se galochent en ville avec des sappes arc-en-ciel
Mais vas-y, bouge (Vas-y bouge), toutes ces pratiques ne sont pas saines
Nos corps seront qu'un tas de cendres, la mort sera qu'un passerelle
Ma mémoire s'est fait plomber par une armée de gros bédos
Sans son stard-co, Sarko ressemble à un camé de Soweto
J'ai la dalle d'un Haïtien qui cherche à se barrer de son ghetto
Mais trouve aucune issue à part qu'il a raison d'être pauvre
Car ceux qui se trouvent dans des palaces remercient peu, ne rendent pas grâce
À leur Seigneur, sont des sales races, ils font tout pour que les liasses s'amassent
Changer le monde est impossible comme taper le foot les os rompus
Je désespère encore plus quand je vois que les frères sont corrompus
Les tentations sont nocives mais on fait semblant de pas le savoir
Quand l'Homme bâtit sa maison sur ses passions que sur son savoir

Si l'bonheur a pris mon phone, frère, qu'il m'appelle
La musique adoucit les moeurs, boy, qu'elle m'apaise
Ce qu'on veut c'est la paix, frère, dans nos terres, pas leurs guerres
Du coup nos adversaires veulent qu'on se taise

J'veux pas griller comme les cigares que les patrons fument

C'est avec des missiles que les chefs d'état font taire
Les prières des victimes qu'elles prononcent une fois le front à terre
Sachant que la patience et la réussite font pair

A mon avis, je serai pas trop regretté quand je m'en irai
Tout comme les violeurs à la Guy-Georges ou Fourniret
Poto, ça part en litres, dans le ghetto les parents flippent
Les parrains se tuent pour le titre, moi j'vadrouille sur quelques sites
Hé, ça c'est du lourd, ça ressemble à oim et mon petit reuf
Bientôt, je serai banalisé comme les tournois de la Coupe d'Europe
Renoi, on nous a dit ""Demeurez dans ces taudis
Où la lumière a dormi"", l'obscurité nous a tout dit
Tendu quand on avance pour rentrer, c'est sous défonce
Go quer-ni le voisin d'en face pour éviter les dé-con ou quoi
Je m'ennuie dans ce monde, je me rabats ça fait des semaines
Qu'on en parle, ça fait des oi-ms, viens pas me voir quand je suis dans ce mode
Putain, à part les vrais, les Marega, les reufrès
H24, ça roule sans freins, quelquefois j'ai des regrets
Akhi, un passé d'esclave avec un futur d'athlète
Ma life c'est descente aux Enfers avec un bobsleigh

que el agua blanda
Era más fresca que el río,

calle perdida,
dejó un pedazo de vida

después amar, después partir

tu casa, tu vereda y el zanjon
y un perfume de yuyos y de alfalfa
que me llena de nuevo el corazón.

Sur... paredón y después...
Sur... una luz de almacen...
Ya nunca me veras como me vieras,
recostado en la vidriera
y esperandote,
ya nunca alumbrare con las estrellas

por las noches de Pompeya.
Las calles y las lunas suburbanas
y mi amor en tu ventana
todo ha muerto, ya lo se.

Pompeya y, al llegar al terraplen,
tus veinte años temblando de cariño
bajo el beso que entonces te robe.

pesadumbre del barrio que ha cambiado
y amargura del sueño que murio.

tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna

Hablando con su amor

Gimiendo en lánguido lamento

De un monótono acordeón.

And how did you lose it before

About the way you carry yourself
Carry yourself

In these walls I am lost in defeat
All my life I will be on the street
It may not be right but it might not be wrong for me
In these walls I've been counting the years
All my life I've been crazy
I may hold the answer a thousand times through
Its my law

I was thinking of yesterday
Of God in his culture
He wraps Himself in glory
And punches out the holes in your life
Has everyone been sleeping
Has the twisted tormentor been found
His laugh would house a million or terrified sould
His cry would stump the earth
His recklessness been told

[Chorus]

And I once tried a moondance in the rain
And I once caught the sunshine in the rain
And God in his cultures in the rain (feeling like hell)
And I once caught the sunshine in the rain

[Chorus]",God in His Culture,2002
Anika Moa,"Sometimes sad times
Surrender my soul
Fly away through the sky
Abandoned proposal
I don't know you
Cover the full view

[Chorus]
I'll say goodbye with no reason why
I'm colder than life and it's hurting inside
No one can say that I went away without a confrontment
Be safer to say
I'm heading on my way

I remember a time
When nothing was beautiful
Separated confused mind
My life is still beautiful
With good in my head to help me on my way
I know if I tried I could stand up and say

[Chorus]

I opened my eyes that exposed to me
Believed I could fly far away
With good in my head to help me on my way
I know if I tried I could stand up and say
It's just another ordinary day

With good in my head, good in my head, good in my head",Good in My Head,2002
Anika Moa,"She got home on the last boat from Devonport
She's been smiling all the way
Moving mountains with her fingers
And laughing at me

I'm so sick
I've been on the road for days
And I left
A thousand stories for them to hear

I don't mind losing everything
Don't make me shiver in this place
It's been a long time since I talked to you

In Tracey's eyes
You do your worst and still she cares
And when you cry
You soon forget or be afraid
And you wonder how you ever lived a day
In your whole life
With a precious soul to lean on

I don't mind losing everything
Don't make me shiver in this place
It's been a long time since I talked to you

I don't mind losing everything
I don't mind losing everything
I don't mind losing everything
I don't mind losing everything
I don't mind
I don't mind
Losing everything
I don't mind
I don't mind

No no, no

I don't mind
Losing everything",I Talked to You,2002
