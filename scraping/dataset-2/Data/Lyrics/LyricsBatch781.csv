Nicholas Folwell,"J'irai par la mer, j'irai tranquille
Cherchant tes yeux verts
Vers vers vers l'exil
Dans mon cœur marine j'emporterai ta flamme

J'irai par les airs, j'irai tranquille
Cherchant ton souffle doux
Doux doux doux fragile
Légère face au vent, plus libre qu'avant

Quelle que soit la voie
Où que tu sois
Qu'importe la manière
J'irai jusqu'à toi

J'irai par le feu, j'irai sans doute
Cherchant l'étincelle elle elle elle
Qui envoûte
Renaître à nouveau comme une goutte d'eau

Quelle que soit la voie
Où que tu sois
Qu'importe la manière
J'irai jusqu'à toi

J'irai par la terre, j'irai sans doute
Cherchant ton mystère erre erre erre
Sur la route
Et si je me perds j'irai par les airs

Quelle que soit la voie
Où que tu sois
Qu'importe la manière
J'irai jusqu'à toi
Quelle que soit la voie
Où que tu sois
Qu'importe la manière
J'irai jusqu'à toi",J Irai Tranquille,1994
Nicholas Folwell,"Regarde la sphère elle tournera
Sans qu´on soit là
Dis toi ça et tu verras

Le grand manège, c´est fait pour ça
Pour que la neige fonde au soleil tu verras

Même quand les arbres n´ont plus de branches
Quand sous la tempête ils penchent
Ils restent forts ils restent droits

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter

Regarde moi et sourie moi
Bientôt crois moi, bientôt la roue tournera
C´est toi qui me consolerais
C´est toi qui me diras ne t´en fait pas
Car l´essentiel tu l´as au fond de toi

Même quand les arbres n´ont plus de branches
Quand sous la tempête ils penchent
Ils restent forts ils restent droits

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter

Laisse pleurer les nuages sur ton visage
Laisse le vent te caresser
Laisse passer les images passer l´orage
Laisse le temps tout emporter",Laisse Pleurer les Nuages,1994
Nicholas Folwell,"Dans mon jardin secret y a des fleurs immortelles
Des soucis des pensées des racines éternelles
Y a des arbres écorchés par des serments gravés
Et deux trois réverbères qui m´éclairent sur hier

L´allée de mon immeuble qui voulait voir le jour
Le couloir vers ma chambre trop étroit pour danser
L´église au toit pointu qui orientait ma vue
Vers un tout p´tit bout de ciel qui me tendait ses ailes

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

Encrés dans mon cahier, je les revoie encore
Les bateaux qui partaient, me laissant sur le port
Le vieux tutu froissé, que j´ai envoyé valser
Le lipstick rougissant de mes premiers baisers

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Les images danseront resteront à jamais
Au plus profond de moi, un élixir de paix

Au plus profond de moi je les emporterai
Ces parfums d´autrefois que je garde en secret
Avant qu´ils s´évaporent je veux qu´ils brûlent encore
Chaque jour chaque nuit comme l´essence de ma vie",Les Parfums D Autrefois,1994
Nicholas Folwell,"Les p´tites notes que l´on sème
Comme des cailloux des graines
C´est pour qu´on se souvienne
De nos joies de nos peines

Les paroles qui s´envolent
Comme des plumes des lucioles
C´est pour qu´on les retienne
Ces doux rêves qu´on cageole

Un p´tit air qui flotte dans l´univers
Un p´tit air qui rime avec les Airs

On n´sait pas d´où elles viennent
Ces ballades ces rengaines
Qui s´écoulent dans nos veines
Comme du sang de bohème

Un p´tit air qui flotte dans l´univers
Un p´tit air qui rime avec les Airs

Les p´tites notes que l´on sème
Comme des cailloux des graines
Sur les routes sur les scènes
C´est à vous qu´elles reviennent",Les Petites Notes,1994
Nicholas Folwell,"Sans rien dire les pensées se lisent
Sans rien dire les yeux poétisent
Comme des miroirs le reflet de nos histoires

Sans rien dire souvent s'improvise
Le désir lorsque l'on s'enlise
Dans un regard en faisant mine de se voir

Nous on se reconnaîtra n'importe où
On s'enverra toujours des yeux doux
Pas besoin de message entre nous
Nous on a besoin que nos cœurs se nouent
Que nos sangs se métissent et s'avouent
On se reconnaîtra n'importe où

Et qu'importe la couleur des masques que l'on porte
Puisqu'on frappe ensemble à la même porte
Laissons le rideau tomber

Et qu'importe puisque les sentiments nous transportent
Laissons-les chanter pour ouvrir les portes
Et laissons les clés tomber

Nous on se reconnaîtra n'importe où
On s'enverra toujours des yeux doux
Pas besoin de message entre nous
Nous on a besoin que nos cœurs se nouent
Que nos sangs se métissent et s'avouent
On se reconnaîtra n'importe où

Nous on se reconnaîtra n'importe où
On s'enverra toujours des yeux doux
Pas besoin de message entre nous
Nous on a besoin que nos cœurs se nouent
Que nos sangs se métissent et s'avouent
On se reconnaîtra n'importe où",Les Yeux Doux,1994
Nicholas Folwell,"A l'heure où la nuit s'éveille
Quand la lune change de quartier
Dans sa robe vermeille
Elle nous glisse des mots de passe à l'oreille

Ailleurs au fin fond du sommeil
On aperçoit des trésors démons et des merveilles
Il en faudra des efforts pour percer le mystère qui dort
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris

Plonger sans bruit et traverser des chemins interdits
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris
Se souvenir au petit matin blême
Des solutions données à nos problèmes

Ailleurs les dunes de sel
Et les plages de sucre roux brûlantes au soleil
Et les traces que je suis pas à pas
Pour sortir du tunnel

J'entends une douce voix qui m'appelle
Qui ne parle que de toi, et toi qui m'ensorcelle
Et qui revient chaque lune comme une dose d'amour nocturne
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris

Plonger sans bruit et traverser des chemins interdits
Voler la nuit des rêves fous des rêves gris
Se souvenir au petit matin blême
Des solutions données à nos problèmes",Voler la Nuit,1994
Nicholas Folwell,"Et si demain tout s´arrêtait
Il serait trop tard pour les regrets
Nos rêves et nos désirs sont forts
Laissons-les se réaliser
Sans perdre un seul instant
Il nous suffit de protéger

Ces petits riens ces petits tout
Qui font de nous des gens debout
Cherchant un idéal envers et contre tout
Ces petits riens ces petits tout
Ceux qu´on attend qui rendent fou
Au rythme du destin si l´on veut on obtient
Presque tout

Et si d´aventure on se trouvait
En face de l´amour le plus parfait
Un geste un sourire un endroit
Quelque chose qui n´existait pas
Et vivre intensément ici et maintenant

Ces petits riens ces petits tout
Qui font de nous des gens debout
Cherchant un idéal envers et contre tout
Ces petits riens ces petits tout
Ceux qu´on attend qui rendent fou
Au rythme du destin si l´on veut on obtient
Presque tout",Ces Petits Riens,2001
Nicholas Folwell,"On pourrait dire les mots
Tout simplement
Ceux qui nous aident
À devenir grand
On se cache
On se ment souvent

On pourrait tendre
L'oreille, s'intéresser
À ce que l'autre
Peut nous apporter
On se gâche
On se fâche souvent
Nous on se raconte
Tous des histoires
Ça peut paraître dérisoire
Être vrai

Nous on parle trop souvent
D'espoir
Ou d'amour quand
Il est trop tard
Être vrai, être vrai

Pourquoi suivre les foules
Qui se déchaînent
Les idées ou les choix
Qu'on ne partage pas
Sûrement dignement rester soi
On pourrait sublimer
Nos différences
Ignorer les p'tites choses
Sans importance
On oublie d'être heureux
Souvent",Etre Vrai,2001
Nicholas Folwell,"J´voudrais voir des signes dans des carreaux cassés
J´ai du mal à m´suivre dans c´vieux décor
Qu´est-ce que j´fait ici qu´est-ce que j´ferai dehors
Faut qu´j'aille voir la nuit passer

J´voudrais voir des signes dans les cartes et l´café
Compter les étoiles au plafond d´ce bar
J´vois qu´une boule
Une boule et des miroirs

Tu sais tout c´qui roule roule me fait partir
Où les trains m´emmènent j´veux pas l´savoir
Une chanson qui traîne, un tempo qui part
Ça suffit pour mon plaisir

J´voudrais voir mes signes mes S.O.S courir
Dans c´bateau qui coule mon sel espoir
C´est une boule une boule et des miroirs

Et comme tout c´qui tourne pas rond
Ça tourne court ces p´tites loupiotes
Quand elles me tournent autour
Elles m´font tourner la tête
Quand elles s´arrêtent
Toujours autant besoin d´amour

Dans ce train qui roule vers le soleil couchant
Sans mes satellites j´me sens bizarre
J´vois mes jours s´enfuir sur mes joues sans fard
J´me prépare au pire mais qu´est-ce que j´attends
J´attends juste un signe avec un peu d´courant
Un rideau qui s´lève et tout repart
C´est une boule une boule et des miroirs",Toujours Autant Besoin d'Amour,2001
Nicholas Folwell,"On se déchire pour un avenir
Dont on connaît même
Pas la fin
On se bouscule on s´aime
On se brûle
On refait le monde pour un rien
Pour un rien
On a besoin de vivre ensemble
Pour être sur qu´on se ressemble
On se trahie
On se déteste
Mais c´est le temps
Qui fait le reste
Tout le reste

Aussi fou que les rêves
Qu´on peut faire
Aussi fort que l´écho des prières
On a tous une place sur terre
Quelque chose à faire ou à refaire

On fait semblant le masque en avant
D´aimer les gens infiniment
On se libère on croit surtout
Que le meilleur est en nous
Rien qu´en nous",Une Place Sur Terre,2001

Nicholas Hammond,"There´s a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall
And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say ""cuckoo""

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Regretfully they tell us Cuckoo, cuckoo
But firmly they compel us Cuckoo, cuckoo
To say goodbye

Cuckoo!

To you

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I´d like to stay and taste my first champagne

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye
Goodbye!
I´m glad to go, I cannot tell a lie
I flit, I float, I fleetly flee, I fly
The sun has gone to bed and so must I

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye!","So Long, Farewell",1965
Nicholas Hammond,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I´ve heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I´ll sing once more",The Sound of Music,1965
Nicholas Hammond,"Edelweiss, edelweiss
Every morning you greet me

Small and white
Clean and bright
You look happy to meet me

Blossom of snow
May you bloom and grow
Bloom and grow forever

Edelweiss, edelweiss
Bless my home-land forever",Edelweiss,1990
Nicholas Hammond,"Let´s start at the very beginning
A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-be-see
When you sing you begin with do-re-mi

Do-re-mi, do-re-mi
The first three notes just happen to be
Do-re-mi, do-re-mi

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Let´s see if I can make it easy

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do (oh-oh-oh)

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
So-do!

Now children, do-re-mi-fa-so and so on
are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads
you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up
Like this

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re

Can you do that?

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Now, put it all together

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re, So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Good!

But it doesn´t mean anything

So we put in words
One word for every note
Like this

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Together!

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do

It's a shockin' world, could be what's so great about 
It's a rockin' world, there ain't nothing fake about it 

Whoa whoa, now welcome to this Earth bro 
Whoa whoa, we're tryin' to find an answer 
Whoa whoa, we got a surface module and a belly-dancer 
On the sidewalk's earth 
A boy is tryin' to show a girl what he is worth 
Poke on the cash flow, but he's still gonna 
Go right up and ask her

Why is it kinetic is it asyphysiological?

And he took the cynic way

Not a shred of money just a lazy buzzin' hum 
He takes all our honey and for God's sake people have got to pay, that's who 

Well we go, back to base 
Can't make no error in tale of this place 
But home we're returnin' back to base, ase

Doesn't sell the bite when the in the initial phase

Nicholas Hexum,"Sitting at the edge of the bed 
One million thoughts as I reflect. 
Tease me just a little I'm not hard to persuade 
fully aware for this that I might pay. 
Not too much that can be said 
Thinking about the bad things in my head, 
Always wondering if what they said was true 
Now I'm in the bed with... 
Even though she was no stranger, 
Chose the one keep me out of danger. 
No song and dance just jump right in. 

Fought the urge to do it skin to skin 
What the hell here I go jump right in 

Standing in the doorway of distress 
Ask MD, for ways out of this mess, 
A wave of panic every time I lose a hair 
I believe I'm falling apart but not quite despair. 
Turns into this one thing I just can't ignore 
Don't know what I am feeling anymore 
I guess it's time to end this affair 
Like I don't care I don't care. 

Fought the urge to do it skin to skin 
What the hell here I go jump right in 

Even though she was no stranger 
Chose the one keep me out of danger 
No song and dance I took my chances with her 
No time to waste. 
Just jump right in I said to her 
Stand in the doorway of distress

So you drink ten beers 'cause you don't wanna hear about
Fight all day but the feelings only stay
But there's nothing you can do 'cause she doesn't like you
Just when you get warm she pulls off the covers
And she leaves and goes straight for her mothers
That's when you wanna look her right in the eye and you hear her say goodbye

These words lie inside they hurt me so

Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

You'd be so nice by the fire
While the breeze on high, sang a lullaby

Nicholas Hoffman,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,2000

But never seems as good enough
Lighting candles in the rain
You keep going back again
When you're lying on your bed
And everything you said, comes back at you

What's a bullets through your heart

In the shadow

To be crying now
What can I do to make you smile?

If every single cell in you
Is screaming out to say it's not okay
Let the blood rush through your veins
This is momentary pain
And as the feeling starts to bite
A tear drop will ignite a spark in you
You've been hiding it too long
Don't you know the nightmare's gone

I'm more than some pretty face beside a train

I may be disturbed but won’t you concede

És muy bonita, és muy bonita
Pa' que no se me acabara
Fuera bendita, fuera bendita
Pa' poder vivir cerquita
De las cosas que mas quiero
Que no me pusiera viejo
Pa' estar siempre jovencito

A la edad de quince años
Ya yo cantaba, ya yo cantaba
Y a los veintidós cumplidos
Ya yo grababa, ya yo grababa
Ya la gente comenzaba
A valorizar mi canto
Y al lado del gran Colacho
Me llené de requisitos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

He vivido todo el tiempo
Enamorado de una morena
La que meritoriamente
Hizo que fuera yo el dueño de ella
La pobre ha salio tan buena
Pero casi vive sola
Porque salgo a toda hora
A cumplir mis compromisos
Cantando, cantando, cantando versos bonitos

Vivo muy agradecido
De aquella gente que me acompaña
A donde quiera que voy

Yo no sé cómo se paga
Ese gesto tan bonito
Quiero repartir mi alma

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,1997
Nicholas Payton,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997

It's weird how this enclosed space makes me think so clearly...so free! 
I wish 
all hours were so relaxing. 
Thinking of the next noise... making up the 
next noise. Scream loud, loud, loud, loud. Static intoxication, sing 
this lovely violin song. Beat this bottle on a wall. Scream, scream, 
scream. The baby cries. Record the noise. It all makes sense...we're 
capable of beauty. Through sounds which make one cringe. The dogs only 
hear us now. For the first time tears came to my eyes while I was 
listening. Noise brings so many things...make my tingling skin freeze. 
Turn me on, make me laugh, shoot the can, shut the door, pour your glass, 
rape scene scream, car crash bash, black cat splat. 
A silent death, a silent scream...You can't follow me, you sing along to 
nothing.",Ad A Dglgmut,2011
Nicholas Shawn Fletcher,"Decrease the light, increase the smiles...a familiar heat is swarming the 
air. Soothing movements that help the evening come to a halt. Lifetime 
achievement... the looks on their faces make it worthwhile. The swaying 
of the ocean, to the swaying of your hips...shivering as your lover's 
caress touches your lips. Perfect world and perfect lives, we have the 
soundtrack for their futures. The seawater smell in the cold outside 
world seems to be enchanting the room. The chatter of riches keeping the 
beat, as the sea seems to freeze. The brisk air seems to make our hearts 
colder. The dimming smiles seem to have halted with a silent scream. We 
must play on. The perfect life torn apart in a matter of seconds...I hear 
their streams and cries...I know now that I'm the only one who possesses 
true happiness. We must play on. The perfect life torn apart in a matter 
of seconds...I hear their screams and cries...I know now that I'm the only

Nicholas Shawn Fletcher,"[Day one] Asleep mid-sentence- the words fell apart. No one is listening 
anyway. This day will soon turn black and my ""wants and needs"" will spill 
on my burning ashes. I learned to be selfish today...I learned to be 
alive. These things I care for are for my personal gain and my person 
happiness only. Why should I sit in your chairs and satisfy your 
standards. I've done it all before and I've confused myself a thousand 
times. The tragic day that I call morality just doesn't do it for me 
anymore. No more choices, just standing in the cold. The day will turn 
black and I will have either lived or died. Asleep mid-sentence- my words 
fall to the ground. Swept into this dreamland. Economic satisfaction, 
never succeed. But happiness has its place. Justice will not lie in your 
corner. New day towards death, only compassion for my own needs make my 
need necessary.
[Day two] Throw myself in the corner; I have nothing to complain about
here. A tragic day seems too peaceful to most, spoiled ambitious turned 
my heart to black. I'm figuring out this realization process- the process 
to never look upon bitter ground. Living dreams, loving dreams, awakening 
to what I've always dreamt of. The familiar sound of lovely love from the 
love of my life will keep the notes coming. From the reciting of the 
show, from the plip and the shevanel, from the grind that annoys, and the
season they hate...forever I worship. I'll kill, love, and hate for all of you. 
Thank you for the best part of my life.",Mordecai,2011

Nicholas Tremulis,"We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
""You haven't done nothing""!
It's not too cool to be ridiculed 
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else
And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
""You haven't done nothing""!

Doo doo wop - naw naw naw
Doo doo wop - bum bum bum 
Doo doo wop
We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life
But when mislead who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice un hum
Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
""You haven't done nothing""!
Yeah
Jackson 5 sing along again say
Doo doo wop

Nicholas Tremulis,"I've dragged my feet
Across the seat
And jumped out the passenger side
The only thing worth looking for
Is what you find inside
But that had not yet appeared
Lost, invisible, here

Taroudant and Olomouc
Before I learned to see

I looked for you and everywhere

There is a calm I haven't come to yet
I spend half my life figuring what comes next
I telescoped in
I'll finally win
I'll finally win the prize
That now my eyes see
A comic's perfect timing squeezed
I'm headfirst fighting everything
The crushed force of memory
Erasing all I've been
The vanishing point appears

I looked for you and everywhere
I looked for you and everywhere
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear

Look at this face
Can you believe it?
Am I living in a beautiful vacuum
Because I can't see it

Writing letters to you girl but I throw them all away
Because I, I wanna show you what I feel for you
But these words and this paper just ain't good enough for you
How can I prove to you that girl you live inside my mind
And I could see your pretty face every time I close my eyes
Something about the way we met the day we met I cant forget
I play this song again and again and I
I tell myself that one day you gonna be my special queen
Convince myself that you feel the same way for me
And even though we just met it feels so right

And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach 4 the sky
It's the passion inside
I'm going to reach 4 the sky

Just get your mind right
Get your sprit up and then we can do it
Keep your mind on the prize
And keep prosing

And average instruments make extraordinary sounds
If you got talent baby let it shine
Give it to the world
And let them see what's inside
You're like a treasure and you have the key
Every minute of the day is what it takes to be
The best of the best
So give it all you got
And maybe one day you'll be standing on the top
But open up your eyes and realize
No matter what you do you got to give it some time
I want to see you dance
I want to see you smile
I want to see you laugh every day of your life
I want to know that passion deep inside
You tried every day even if it makes you cry

It's the passion inside
And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach for the sky
It's the passion inside
And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach for the sky

Reach for the sky but I got to stay grounded
As long as I'm breathing my heart is still pounding
I see the vision when I close my eyes
And if I stop right now than I might as well die
Let the strength and the power you posses
Take you to the limit and beyond to express
A strong mind gets high on success
A week mind gets high on bull shit
And so I keep on rhyming
Let my music and my flow get you all so excited
Make you want to change the world today
If you still got the passion inside it's never too late
You got to move
Got to show
Got to rise
You got to let the world see through your eyes
Don't let no one tell you a lie
Today is your day and it's time to shine

Don't let nobody tell you that it's impossible
Just follow your heart and your dreams
Just follow your heart and your dreams

I told you when I met you, that I had someone in my life.
""I won't tell if you won't tell"" is what you said that night.
Do you remember it started as a game.
But when you play with fire, sometimes you can't put out the flames.
You said that you's a big gurl: undertood the circumstances.
Never took for granted- sneak away romances.
Tonight's the last night, I can't go on like this.
Got you crying on muh sleeve, trying to beg me not to leave.
Por favor no llores.
Gurl I gotta go. Estoy perdiendo, tu llanto rompe el corazon.
And if I stay 5 minutes I just might give in.
It's a battle I can't win.
More than just a sin. Made a promise to myself plus someone else.
From this day 'till the end I gotta be somebody else.
Forgive me mama if I'm making you cry.
I never meant to change your life but I gotta say good-Bye.

I should've seen this coming, but I choose to be the selfish one.

No more sneaking away to the hotel, telling these lies.
But every time we see eachother, I can't let go.
Still muh thoughts are saying you got a good gurl at home.
A good mama to the kids after she works all day.
Does she deserve to be mistreated and lied to this way? No.
But on the other hand I got you on the phone.
Telling me you can't wait to have me in your arms.
DAMN. I'm going crazy, loosing muh mind.
I shouldn't see you on the side, but it feels so right.

Before I was awakened to new life again?
How many half truths did I bear witness to

My true colors bleeding on my sleeve

Despite my resistance
You sought me anyway

Gone are the days,
Of all that I was afraid of
I've left behind the traces of who I've been

The edges of who I could be
If I chose to expose what grows deep down
Would You still desire what You see?

Is my inside Your eyes

Little Stones are smooth
Only once the water passes through
So I am a stone
Rough and grainy still
Trying to reconcile this river's chill

But when I close my eyes
And feel you rushing by
I know that time brings change
And change takes time
And when the sunset comes
My prayer would be this one
That you might pick me up 
And notice that I am
Just a little smoother in your hand

Sometimes raging wild
Sometimes swollen high
Never have I known this river dry
The deepest part of you
Is where I want to stay
And feel the sharpest edges wash away

Nichole Nordeman,"I was certain that I knew you
At the tender age of twelve
You'd so often been described by those
Who said they knew you well
Dark and rugged in your thirties
With a smile as bright as your robe

Every teacher, every preacher
With the very best intent
Found new ways to hide the mystery
Replaced by common sense
And to know you was to keep you in my pocket
So easy to hold

I know I can't explain you
I would not even try to
And yet it's clear that you are here beside me
I marvel and I wonder
So near and somehow still so far
What makes you who you are?

It is easy to insist
On what is packaged and precise
And dismiss the clear suspicion
That you're bigger than we'd like
It is tempting to regard you as familiar
In so many ways

I know I can't explain you
I would not even try to
And still it's clear that you are here beside me
I marvel and I wonder
So near and somehow still so far
What makes you who you are?

I've tried to draw these lines around you
A definition or an absolute
But I could not be satisfied with black or white
There is so much more
There is so much you

I know I can't explain you
I would not even try to
And still it's clear that you are here beside me
I marvel and I wonder
So near and somehow still so far

Nichole Nordeman,"When I met him on a sidewalk
He was preaching to a mailbox
Down on 16th Avenue
And he told me he was Jesus
Sent from Jupiter to free us
With a bottle of tequila and one shoe

He raged about repentance
He finished every sentence
With a promise that the end was close at hand
I didn't even try to understand

He left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions
So I turned and walked away
And laughed at what he had to say
Then casually dismissed him as a fraud
I forgot he was created in the image of my God

When I met her in a bookstore
She was browsing on the first floor
Through a yoga magazine
And she told me in her past life
She was some plantation slave's wife
She had to figure out what that might mean

She believes the healing powers of her crystals
Can bring balance and new purpose to her life
Sounds nice

She left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions
So I turned and walked away
And laughed at what she had to say
Then casually dismissed her as a fraud
I forgot she was created in the image of my God

Not so long ago, a man from Galilee
Fed thousands with His bread and His theology
And the truth He spoke, quickly became the joke of educated
Self-inflated Pharisees like me

And they were wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
They were tongue tied, drawn by their conclusions
Would I have turned and walked away
And laughed at what He had to say
And casually dismissed Him as a fraud
Unaware that I was staring at the image of my God
",Wide Eyed,1998
Nichole Nordeman,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2000
Nichole Nordeman,"There are times when faith and common sense do not align,
when hard core evidence of you is hard to find,
and I am silenced in the face of argumenative debate, and
it's a long hill it's a lonely climb.  Cause they want proof, 
They want proof of all these mysteries I claim.  Cause only 
fools would want to chant a      man's name.  
Maybe it's true, yeah but....

Chorus:

I would be a fool for You, all because You asked me to.
A simpleton who's seemingly naive,
I do believe, You came and made Yourself a fool for me.

I admit that in my darkest hours I've asked what if,
What if we created some kind of man made faith like this,
Out of good intention or emotional invention,
and after life is through there will be no You.
Cause they want proof of all these miracles I claim,
Cause only fools believe that men can walk on waves.
Maybe it's true, yeah but...

(Repeat Chorus)

Unaware of popularity,
and unconcerned with dignity,
You made me free.
That's proof enough for me.

(music break)

I would be a fool for You(fool for you)
Only if You asked me to,
A simpleton who's only thinkin' of
your cause of love.

I will speak Jesus' name(fool for you).
If that makes me crazy,
they can call me crazed,
I'm happy to be seemingly naive,
I do believe, You came and made Yourself a fool for me.

A fool for you.",Fool for You,2000
Nichole Nordeman,"The bright are the stars that shine
In somebody else's sky
Green is the grass that grows some place different

More possibilities
More than You offered me
More than I care to see from a distance

I was certain that the truth would be
In a place that kept eluding me
But every stone turned and unturned again
Would only serve to prove
That I never had to move to find You

And You will always be
The only love I'll ever know, home
And You have made for me
The only place I'll ever go, home, home

God, for the shameless pride
The times when I rolled my eyes
To laugh at simplicity, show me mercy

Knowing what I know now
It's hard to imagine how
I could feel anything but unworthy

And the mystery of Your love for me
Is not as hidden as it seemed to be
Should have known then when You said to me
""Seek and you will find""
It was right here all the time

And You will always be
The only love I'll ever know, home
And You have made for me
The only place I'll ever go, home, home

I believe in the quest and the journey
I believe that the answers come in time
Where we begin is where we arrive

And You will always be
The only love I'll ever know, home
And You have made for me
The only place I'll ever go, home

You will be and You will always be
The only love I'll ever know, home
And You have made for me
The only place I'll ever go, home, home

Nichole Nordeman,"Have I come too casually? because it seems to me there's something I've neglected how does one approach a deity with informality and still protect the sacred?

Cause you came and chose to wear the skin of all of us and it's easty to forget you left a throne, and the line get's blurry all the time between daily and divine and it's hard to know the difference. 

Oh let me not forget to tremble oh let me not forget to tremble face down on the ground do I dare to take the liberty to stare at you oh let me not forget to tremble

What a shame to think that I'd appear even slightly cavalier in the matter of salvation do I claim this gift you freely gave as if it were mine to take with such little hesitation? 
Cause you came and stood among the very least of us and it's easy to forget you left a throne,

Oh let me not forget to tremble oh let me not forget to tremble face down on the ground do I dare to take the liberty to stare at you oh let me not forget to tremble

The cradle and the grave could not contain your divinity neither can I oversimplify this love

Nichole Nordeman,"We rode into town the other day 
Just me and my Daddy 
He said I'd finally reached that age 
And I could ride next to him on a horse 
That of course was not quite as wide

We heard a crowd of people shouting 
And so we stopped to find out why 
And there was that man 
That my dad said he loved 
But today there was fear in his eyes

So I said ""Daddy, why are they screaming? 
Why are the faces of some of them beaming? 
Why is He dressed in that bright purple robe? 
I'll bet that crown hurts Him more than He shows 
Daddy, please can't you do something? 
He looks as though He's gonna cry 
you said he was stronger than all of those guys 
Daddy, please tell me why 
Why does everyone want him to die?""

Later that day the sky grew cloudy 
And Daddy said I should go inside 
Somehow he knew things would get stormy 
Boy was he right 
But I could not keep from wondering 
If there was something he had to hide

So after he left I had to find out 
I was not afraid of getting lost 
So I followed the crowds 
To a hill where I knew men had been killed 
And I heard a voice come from the cross

And it said, ""Father, why are they screaming? 
Why are the faces of some of them beaming? 
Why are they casting their lots for My robe? 
This crown of thorns hurts Me more than it shows 
Father, please can't You do something? 
I know that You must hear My cry 
I thought I could handle the cross of this size 
Father, remind Me why 
Why does everyone want Me to die? 
When will I understand why?""

""My precious Son, I hear them screaming 
I'm watching the face of the enemy beaming 
But soon I will clothe You in robes of My own 
Jesus, this hurts Me much more than You know 
But this dark hour I must do nothing 
Though I've heard Your unbearable cry 
The power in Your blood destroys all of the lies 
Soon You'll see past their unmerciful eyes 
Look there below, see the child 
Trembling by her father's side 
Now I can tell You why 
She is why You must die""",Why [Live][*],2000

Flashback to warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after

You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, go slow, I fall behind

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

If you're lost you can look and you will find me

If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

Watching through windows you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

Every missing tooth 
Every bedtime story 
Here’s to Barbie cars, light saber wars

Before you walked 
Before you ran 
Before I knew it 
You were teaching me 
The only thing love can 
Hold hands through it 
When it’s scary, you’ve got me

I hope you know I am 
But do you think you can somehow 
Slow down

Please don’t roll your eyes at me 
I know I’m embarrassing 
But someday you’ll understand 
You’ll hold a little hand 
Ask them if they can 

Whoah
'Cause it's all too far
Whoah

I am your biggest fan 
I hope you know I am 
But do you think you can 
Somehow

Put your finger on the places, show me where you've been
Is that California, where your teardrops dried?
You drew a circle around Georgia, can you tell me why?

Written all over your face (your face, your face)
Wrong turns and bridges burned

Snapshots of your old self, in a better light
Ghosts and regrets back again, I can see it in your eyes
Send them home, let 'em go

Nichole Nordeman,"In my younger years
I found You beneath the steeple
In the faces of Your people
Could hear You in the hymns
In my younger years
Then later on
I met You on a road, once winding
Seeking but not always finding
With the building gone
You still loved me later on

Anywhere You are is sanctuary
Everywhere You are is where I'm free

You're here, You're here
The only invitation that You need
Is the very air I breathe, yeah, yeah
You're here, You're here
I will never be alone
You will be always be my home
'Cause You're here

In the same small room
Staring at the life I've chosen
Hoping that the door's still open
To give my heart to You
In this same small room
What could separate
Me from all the ways You love me?
Nothing below or above me
Could get in the way
This is what You say

Anywhere You are is sanctuary
Everywhere You are is where I'm free

'Cause You're here, You're here
The only invitation that You need
Is the very air I breathe, yeah, yeah
You're here, You're here
I will never be alone
You will be always be my home

You were at the altar, preacher's hand upon my head
You were in the water, when I came up clean instead
You're still in my story, when my tears fall on the dirt
You're there in the morning, wrapping grace around what hurts
You were in the questions, in the silence on the phone
You were paying cab fare, making sure I made it home
I believed in too far, I believed in my worst fear
But You were never moving closer, You were only always here

You will always be my home

Nichols,"Rhymes faster than a speeding bullet
Has more rhymes than a train has tracks
Able to leap sucker MC's in a single rhyme
Look, at the jam, on the mike
(It's a bird!)
(It's a plane!)
No
I'm Su...Su...Super Rhymes
(Rhymes)
(Rhymes)
(Rhymes)...

It's the new thing, makes you want to swing
While us MC's rap, doin' our thing
It's not singin', like it used to be
No, it's rappin' to the rhythm of the sure shot beat
It goes one for the money, two for the show
You got my beat, now here I go
You see, this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hiddip, the hop, ya just don't stop
You rock to the beat till it makes you drop

Yes, I'm one of a kind, I'm Super Rhymes
And I'd like to say hello
And since I'm on the mic and I'm ready to rock
This is how it goes
Yes, I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-a-dang
Baby, I'll ring your bell
Yes, I'm Super Rhymes, I'm 22
I'm gonna be 100 before I'm through

Because no, I didn't come from the planet Earth
Planet Rhymeon is my place of birth
From the day I came out my mother's womb
I found myself in the operating room
Then the doctor spanked me on my behind
I didn't cry, the kid started to rhyme
My mother said, ""Son, that's the way it should be
Your name is Super Rhymes, you'll be an MC""
So then my father put me on a meteorite
Sent me to Earth to rock the mike
I got to Earth and started layin' it down
At the jam, on the mike, I could be found

While I was at the jam this one time
Rockin' to the beat, said I'm feelin' fine
Just freakin' out on a freak's behind
I looked in the face of Frankenstein
I said, ""No, no, she's not mine""
Because my woman is fine as wine
And she goes by the name of Louis Line
But she didn't come here with me this time
I'm feeling real sad, but not that bad
I'ma have to run away from this crowdad
I ran to the deejay to rock the mike
He said, ""Super Rhymes, take it, do what you like""
So I rocked the party viciously

This guy I didn't know, walked up to me
But the closer he got, the more I could tell
It was the man they call Howard Cosell
The guy you'd see on KBC
While Joe Frazier boxed Muhammad Ali
He said, ""Excuse me, sir, are you Super Rhymes?
The one with the fine woman Louis Line?""
I said, ""I am, will I be on TV?
Like to float like a butterfly stingin' Ali
He said, ""Yes, my man, if you show me you can
I was told you had the masterplan""
So I rocked the mike for Howard Cosell
To show America how I rocked so well

And while I rocked the mike, this is what I said
About Dracula, the living dead
He didn't like blood, not this vampire
The disco beat was his desire
Transylvania's where he made home
Until one day he decided to roam
And then out of the crib he did crawl
Count Dracula is what he's called
He said, ""The sun's gone down, and now it's night
I'm goin' to spread my wings and take a serious flight
I turned into a bat, I flew away

I said at the disco is where I gotta stay
Because back home, there was nothing like this
In Transylvania this is what I'd miss
They just bite necks and suck blood all day
But I know there had to be a better way
I parked my car, sun set, ""Vampires, I am leaving""
So I turned into a bat and cut out that evening
The first disco I hit was 54
They didn't even want to let me in the door
I said, ""Listen, my man, I am a real cool guy
I can turn into a bat, I can even fly""
He said, ""Dracula, you can do all of that
Then come on in and catch a neat freak attack""
So I went inside and I started to dance
And had all the ladies waitin' for their chance
They said, ""Isn't he cool with his widow's peak""
And the strange way he does the Freak
He said, ""Where I come from it's not called the 'Freak'
It's the Transylvanian Boogie, seven days a week""
I didn't get to dance with them all that night
Cause at the break of dawn I saw sunlight
I said, ""I'm sorry to say I cannot stay""
Cause us vampires must be in before it turns day
But don't forget, I'll be back

I like it when I catch a neat freak attack
And since you heard my story, it's time I be leaving
In Transylvania we say ""good evening""
Mr. Cosell said, ""Damn, that's good
You'll be on TV in every neighborhood""
He said, ""Super Rhymes, you're a real MC
We must put you on KBC""
I said, ""I'll dress to impress, won't claim I'm best
I'll come a little better than all the rest""
Because I never come with any less
Than all the rhymes that will pass the test
Because I'm cool as ice, I'm twice as nice
I never had an off-day in my life
You see, I take all your money, bust out your wife
Make you dance to my beat all your life
Cause when I get in my stuff and I start to rhyme
The sucker MC's hide every time
Because my voice is baritone
And I really don't need no microphone
But I use one anyway
To make sure the ladies hear what I say
And from here to there they hear my voice
The ladies hear me, I am their choice
Because my hair's more wavy than there's ships in the Navy
And they use a boat to stay afloat
To put hickeys all over my throat
Because I am so coooool...

Because I'm cool as snow, I'm like savoir-faire
I'm the man you can't find anywhere
Because I'm cooler than cold, I'm hotter than heat
I rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Because I got what it takes
To make everybody want to break
You see I gotta what it take
I take it, make you want to break
Breaker 1 (breaker 1) breaker 2 (breaker 2)
I say this is what I want to say to all of you
Go and telephone, or tell a friend
The man known as Super Rhymes is back again
And all you fly guys, I tell you this
I take your fly girls with one kiss
Because I take the fly girls, put em in check
I got my love potion all around they neck
They've heard my voice and they know my name
They know within me there burns a flame
That I'm MC man, headed straight for fame

I got a Coupe DeVille, diamond rings
I even got fur coats and gold plate things
Cause I'm the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
The ladies know I'm the man with the power
And now that you know a little more about me
This is how I rocked KBC
You see, deep in the desert, the city Bagdhad
Aladdin was the boy, a magic lamp he had
Aladdin was to rub it and soon find out
That the lamp had magic and a genie, no doubt
He rubbed the lamp, a genie appeared
But you really couldn't see him till the green smoke cleared
Well, the smoke was gone, and there he stood
The tallest damn cat in the neighborhood

He said, ""Where I come from I committed a crime
For every little thing you must serve time
But if my lamp was rubbed I'd be set free
But otherwise within the lamp I stay eternally
And Aladdin, I say thanks to you
You rubbed my lamp, now my sentence is through
And Aladdin, your wish is my command
I'm sorry, but you only get three, my man""
He said, ""Genie, my first wish would be
To go to the year 1980""
""Hocus pocus,"" said the genie, ""I'll do that""
Aladdin looked around, saw where he was at
He said, ""Damn, things aren't the same
I wonder if Aladdin is still my name
But it's nice to be in '80
And I gotta say thanks to you, genie""

He said, ""There's nothin' to it, I used to do it just about everyday
Until I went to court, I got put in the lamp and the judge to take the spell away
But then you came along, made right my wrong
You rubbed my lamp and you set me free""
He said, ""You used one wish, and you got two left
Aladdin, tell me what's it gonna be?""
He said, ""Genie, in this society
You must have the green stuff called money""
So ""hocus pocus"" said the genie, ""here's a million bucks
You take it all with you, here's an armored truck""
""Thanks,"" said Aladdin, ""Genie, you're a real champ
But for a little while get back in your lamp""
The genie said, ""Aladdin, yes, I'll do that
But you got another wish, now I'll be back""
So with a puff and smoke the genie was gone
Aladdin said, ""A new millionaire is born""
Well, with all that money he made more money, Aladdin was doin' swell

You see, my man Aladdin he got smart, you see, invested money into an oil well
But then one day he said, ""I'm tired of makin' the desert scene""
He said, ""I gotta get away, I gotta go to the disco, find the freak of my dream""
So he took control of his private jet
His magic lamp and money he could not forget
Yes, he got to the disco, danced and screamed
But still couldn't find the freak of his dream
But then she came, through the door
The baddest freak Aladdin said he ever saw
He said, ""Wow! I gotta get that girl!
Her love is worth everything in the world""
She was a 38-24-35

Aladdin was attracted like a bee to a hive
Aladdin walked up, said, ""Hello""
She looked him up and down and said, ""You know where you can go""
He said, ""Come on, baby, don't play no game
I'm called Aladdin, tell me what's your name?""
Well, out of all the things Aladdin tried
She said, ""Listen, sucker, take a carpet ride""
Aladdin said, ""I know what to do
I call on my genie with a spell for you
So then he rubbed the lamp, the genie came back out
The genie said, ""Aladdin, what you're fussin' about""
He said, ""Genie, I rocked, I said I'd be her man
I tried to do it to her cause I thought I can
It was then that I met this girl
Who said she wouldn't freak me for nothin' in the world""
Out of all the things that Aladdin thought
She stole him a body, just couldn't be bought
So Aladdin said 450

I know you're comin' to this bank with me
But the freak told him no
And my main man Aladdin, he told her so
He said, ""I grab my partner do-si-do
I spank her to the beat, but don't let go
Until I hear her holler 'yo, yo'""
To the beat, beat, check it out
The genie said, ""Aladdin, I agree
This freak has got a vicious body
But that wish will be your last one
After I do, my job is done""
The genie said, ""Your wish is my command
She'll be your girl, you'll be her man
So he crossed his arms, said a magic word
A 'hocus pocus' is what you heard
He said, ""Aladdin, she belongs to you
Take her home and do what you want to do
But now it's time that I leave

I pull my magic carpet down out my sleeve
I'm gonna climb aboard, I'm gonna fly away
Back to Bagdhad, that's where I'll stay""
So Aladdin looked up, said goodbye
He watched the magic carpet and the genie fly
Now this is the end of this little tale
It's time I keep rockin', the genie's out of jail
So when I say 'rock', you say 'roll'
When I say 'ice', then you say 'cold'
Then when I say 'disco', you say 'the beat'
I say 'it's like honey', then you say 'it's sweet'

I say rock - roll
Say ice - cold
Say disco - the beat
Like honey - it's sweet
Now you know my name, you know my game
Compared to me there's none the same
Because I got a funky groove, I'm gonna make your body move
Because I gotta what it take
I take it, make you want to break
Breaker 1 (breaker 1) breaker 2 (breaker 2)
I said you heard my jam, now catch the boogaloo flu
Cause I'm Super Ryhmes with disco
I rock from here to Frisco
I make you hate your video
While I rock your mind in stereo
So kick off your shoes, relax your feet
You're gonna move to my beat, it sound so sweet

Because it's all of you I do adore
And I got so much and more in store
Cause all through the day, through the night
I sit down and new rhymes I write
Because this deejay, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hiddip, the hop, you just don't stop
You bop to the beat till it makes your drop
Because I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-a-ding-dang-a-ding-ding-dong
Baby, I ring your bell
Because I ROCK and ROLL
In stere-ere-o
I rock and roll
In stere-ere-o

Like Fred Flintstone, said, a-yabadabado
You hear my jam, want to yell it too
Because I got more rhymes than a clock chimes
I got more rhymes than a monkey climbs
I got more rhymes than a lemon in limes
And I got more rhymes than a bank got dimes
So freak it to the east, freak it to the west
I freak it to the girl with the biggest chest
Freak it to the west, then you freak it to the east
But you never freak out with an ugly beast
So young ladies in the '80s
Come and ride in my Mercedes

'Cause the ladies see they all must stare
Because I got brown eyes and a wavy hair
I'm not so tall, but I'm not so short
And you young ladies are my favorite sport
So put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
You put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
Then scream: oh yeah (oh yeah) oh what? (oh yeah!)
y'all, I'm leavin' now, but I'll be back
To make the young ladies catch a neat freak attack
Yes, the time has come for me to leave the mike
But I'll be back with more of what you like
So, take a trip",Adventures of Super Rhymes,2008

Nick Brewer,"Look at myself, I see my face
In blurry visions everyday
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

I see your hidden agenda
Had to send me shit, but I'm killing the sender
Run it on my shit, then I left it to render
And nigga I'm the shit, came up quick like I'm Slender
Man, I'm on a high one
Counting all my worries (Oh no, I've got none)
Counting all my monies (Oh wait, you want some) suck one
I don't give a shit and I'm not wearing your tees
I've got my old girls down here, chilling on knees
I've got my new girls down here, willing to please
I'm on the next ting, quick thing, wired up, cheque please
Still I’m still a young thing, ain't that something?
Living life like I never thought I could
With my team here around and everything is all good
And then I

Look at myself, I see my face
In blurry visions everyday
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

I grew up poor, everyday I wore that same dirty Yankee cap
Low over my eyes, I didn't wanna talk to no-one, I was angry fast
Forward to a month ago I was in the New Era office
And they let me take what I like imagine that
I guess things do change, couldn't afford family holidays
Growing up, but today I've been on two planes
Never begged it, why you have to go making a scene
My bars go over heads like Michelangelo painting a ceiling
Life's like a motion picture, we’re blinded by Smoke ‘n’ Mirrors
And lies that were told to give a desire to go and buy
All the things we that can't afford, we're convinced that we need
I just want to be happy and not live in the street
They fucking with my chakra, I'm just tryna do me
You idolizing guys that lie and hide behind their jewelry
Their heart is empty and their soul is hollow
Living like there's no tomorrow, I know every moment's borrowed
Like a walls of sorrow (Smoke 'n' mirrors)

Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

I don't wanna get lost on this long road
I've been looking for something hoping it unfolds
But I see a lot of smoke in the air
And I've been looking in the mirror but the reflection is unknown
Am I going mad, losing my mind?
I tell myself I'm doing just fine too many times
But man are dead weight, my boy said, ""Get your head straight""
I'm like ""Brothe', you can say that again""
But I never would've imagined this chain of events
I remember when I just wanted some fame in the ends
Trying to do it all the same as my friends
And it's funny how it switched up, maybe sing your next song
Why we tryna see clear? Looking through the mist, but
I don't wanna be here, when I get a glimpse up

Look at myself I see my face
In blurry visions everyday

Blind me from the way",Smoke 'N' Mirrors,2016

Better run when you hear the sirens coming

Line my street, knocking at my door
Twelve black boots on my bedroom floor
What they want with rascal I'm not sure
Took me to the station 8:30
For a fight that I had recently
Say they got me on CCTV
And the black boys told on me
Can't understand why these boys keep snitching
Can't understand why these boys keep bitching
Now I'm hot tempered feel like switching
Can't stand still trigger finger itching

Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall

Yo, let's take it back to that old school story telling shit
Get me!
One day I was with my bredwin 'A dot' roaming the streets
On the main road hungry looking for something to eat
Not no burger and no chips that's easily digested
That shit that if your caught, you'll be easing arrested
We was on the robin street I forgot to mention Kate
There was this Breda rolling with us he was scared it was blait,
And he was high
But, back to the story 'A dot' spotted the man
Straight ahead of us in the distance with his wifey holding hands
So we followed him through this little alleyway into the flats
And we thought the time was perfect so we crept up and we attacked
I took the first swing unexpected causing panic
We was ruthless causing agony in public it was tragic
Me and 'A dot' lost the plot, acting like we were from hell
Beat this Breda to the floor beat his wifey up as well
Clayton stood back shaking, wishing that he never came
When from out of nowhere there was Alisha screaming my name
She went my school
She saw it all

To make it worse I'm hearing sirens, I ain't even trying handle

See me on the tele but I ain't no actor
Running through the streets brave face it's a jack one
Real day light no shame like a lunatic
Rain, hell, sleet or snow I ain't new to it
Show me what you got betta give it up quickly
Lay them on their back if they try and fight swiftly
Better mind out when they come through the manner man
Keep em on their toes like hammer man
It's no joke man woman and child I'm seeking
See no skets no age I'm creeping
Anything through the door cold on the wheelers

At the foot of the bed
Anything that i needed was there
You get it prepared (yea) (you did it for me)
Held it down when my pops and moms ain't
Repay you in a way
That stocks and bonds caint
Jus think
Its that same little boy that used to break rules
Spill cool-aid on the floor
You was my father and my mother
The mother of my father
Known as my grandmother
I reffer to you as mama
no one calmer or conciderit
As you my dear
Love my parents just as much
But lets get one thing clear
You raised me by choice and you didn't have to (mama)
Showed me where to go when i had to use the bathroom
Nasty that's true classy that's you (mama)
Id give you my last breath if i had to

Independent women you the queen of my throne

Long as you was there i was never alone
Though we had our ups and downs
Its all up now
You used to wear small frowns
Tear them all up now (How?)
Did you imagine ma
That your son would grow up to be this handsome huh?
No I'm playn I'm sayn you the reason i exist
And for this mess you deserve pure bliss

Lord, heavenly father
I praise your soul
Learned to love you for myself when i was eight years old
Before then i didn't about your grace and mercy
I just knew my pops was preaching
While i played in the nursery
Then he taught me that you so loved us all
That you sent your only son to die on a cross
I once was lost but you keep finding me
I always fall but you keep reminding me
Verse john 1:9 that I'm right you see
And it'll be just fine you took a liking to me
Gotta let'em all know
You can still have fun

Blocked bullets when they blast
That night at the party
Know they got the homie
No you got him surely

that i can't get away from a lot of stress i just want to erase em you da reason why i'm hard at work you think my job is
chasin baller skirts i ain't got to search baby doll you're first see you got this touch that revolve to earth i know you
sweat when i'm out on tour i was max and maturable and adorable for a lot of balls to step from my hotel door couldn't even
recall what i go there for but i was much younger much dumber out of touch so i bring my less on the summer crazy amazingly
you forgave me turn around and say to me

Whenever you need me babe just call my name no matter whatever you done you know that i'll be there i'm down for you
whatever you're goin through whenever you need me babe you know that i'll be there

[Verse 2 (Nick Cannon)]
yo every man needs a rider beside her my rider to is clinon was to pick em up off the bottom whatever he need she got em
and vise versa even though his style might hurt her a phone call is a phone call to a fella but to women it falls under the
same umbrella it's trust plus honesty respect gotta jugle em all try not to neglect 'cause if something go wrong it be hard to
correct they forgive but never forget no matter how many diamonds you sit on they neck you look at invisible set they be
they be invisible next that's why i hold my home team down no matter how much of this world i'm going around i'm gonna treat
you da right way it always feel good when you say...

now as soon as the media get a hold of the vocal they gonna try figure the motive the reason i wrote who da girl on my arm
at the movie premiere who da one in the drop with the wind in her hair poparatzzi
watch but to see pops don't like me and that's wherever i might be so i need a girl to stand and to understand and stand
next to cannon 'cause i got a plan and i ain't tryin put no weight on ya girl but it's hard to have alove affair in front of
the world everytime you move every step you make bein watched possibly videotaped that's why i need a place where i can
escape from and another soul and which my soul can relate and i probably make a lot of mistakes but i still need to hear

We hit the 6 in the mornin like we just don't care
Girl, who you rollin to the club with {you}
Girl, who you turnin all them bottles with {you}
Girl, who you rollin on them dubs with {you}
Girl, who you freakin in the tub with {you}

Girl, Broken glass everywhere
We hit the 6 in the mornin like we just don't care
Girl, who you tryna get smart with {you}
Girl, who you rollin them eyes at {you}
Girl, who your girl tryna holla at {you}
Girl, who y'all leavin the club with {you}

[Verse 1]
Yo shorty watchu want to do
A stars up in front of you
All tall lookin wonderful
Carja I gotta few
I gotta few ounce up in Malibu
You would come back the same shade of them things that's around you
All up in the club with thugs like we bad
Addicted to them chicks should be up in rehab
And the ice got em stuck freeze tag
Yo man the myth the Nick Cannon he's bad
But I ain't never seen a chick work it out like you
And I ain't never seen a chick wear a blouse like you
And I ain't never seen a chick wail out like you
The way you pop it drop it mama I think I like you
So come uptown Malibu where the soups hot and blue
I want to see you move and get a smile outta you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
All up into woman keep layin next to me
Cannon the kid that make skinny sexy
Sexes hefty and ma's with lefty
Saw a puerto rican mami and she want to bless me
A chick named Leslie others connected me
He gave her the two-way and she keep on textin me
I'm from Texas named Lexas
Shorty only want me couse she like my necklace
But when I'm in town its bed and breakfast
I thought you knew there's a few on my checklist
Girl in the photo-booth with a gold tooth
Danes the truth said her name was Ruth
So I pondered to what she often do
Says she like Proton Boots and Ajam Maju
Respect this don't get it to wreckless
cause you could be the next chick on the checklist

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm up in the V.I.P. just thuggin it out
Flashin like a star you know shinin her mouth
The boys over there tryna figure me out
If they call security they gon get a kick in the mouth
Got hundreds in my hair Jacob on the other
Party's almost over but we can hit another
Tell the Valley to pull up the truck
Shorty such-n-such lets keep in touch
Saw the sun comin up hit the beach or what?
We can eat some brunch mama get in the front
Got your girls in the back but they ain't tryna get nasty
They can get the tax if you ask me

[Chorus]",You,2003
Nick Cannon,"It's like me and you
Me and my mans and your girlfriends too
After tonight I'ma only visit you when the moon is blue
Is that your man right there? What he doin' with you?

Sayin' talk to the hands, is that still cute?
Jimmy Choo boots, that's real cute
Only chick in the place with style and grace
And like, 5'8"" with a tropical face

And like, expensive taste, spotted my chain, that's right
Get on my game, gotta see well hear that
Is that a weave can't believe that I said that
I don't know what possessed you to wear that

Girl, you out of tap? Girl, wear that
Wait to be not, make it hot, man, you feel that?
Smashin' all across the states
And I stays iced out like frosted flakes

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm with that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

I don't know you
My name's not important, I'm as big as Elvis
You think you're so cute
Keep it real ma, you don't know me like that dance

But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy, girl
Cause I kinda like your attitude

I done been to every club in the world
I seen them hot chicks and they blockin' and ugly home girls
And ninety nine percent of the time
It be hits like this brain washin' your mind

Yo, you lookin' at my watch, just watchin' the time
You think I'm gonna stop you must be out of your mind
If you ain't V.I.P, then get out of the line
Think I woke up one day and just decided to rhyme, nah

I ain't got no problems with ya'll
We all ken I'm tryin' to find a Barbie doll
So I could get a phone number, call her tomorrow
Ask her, how her night went with a superstar
Yeah, that's what I was shootin' for

I'm one hundred percent over the fence
You like a mad mechanic throw in a wrench
And my game mad 'cause you playin' the bench

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm with that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

I don't know you
My names not important, I'm as big as Elvis
You think you're so cute
Keep it real ma, you don't know me like that dance

But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy, girl
Cause I kinda like your attitude

It's your attitude that got me whipped in my whip
Like whips you [Incomprehensible] I can't be mad at you
Lookin' good, you remind me of my Benz
When I'm pushin' through the hood
Twenty four inch rims steerin' wheel all good
Envision the bigger picture for real it's all good

Wouldn't ya'll do it if ya'll could?
If ya'll could, wouldn't ya'll do it?
But ya'll ain't for stardom
On the road from autumn to autumn
From Cali to Atlanta to Atlanta to Harlem
You don't need Burt Reynolds for the Cannonball run

Anythin' you really wanna do, I'm with that
Only wanna kick it with you, I'm With that
Meet me in the parkin' lot at two, I'm with that
But you gotta quit that attitude and get back to me

I don't know you
My names not important, I'm as big as Elvis
You think you're so cute
Keep it real ma, you don't know me like that dance

But I don't want to
Believe me I don't give up that easy, girl
Cause I kinda like your attitude

Jam on it, jam on it

Get out of your seats and dance to ghetto beat
Girl, don't be shy, just flaunt it

Just blink your self away
Just just wait just pause for a second

And having me that will ruin everything, huh
It's a lot of angels waiting on they wings
You see me in your sleep so you can't kill your dreams
Three hundred dollars that's the price of living, what?
Mommy I don't like this clinic
Hopefully you'll make the right decision
And don't go through with the knife decision
But it's hard to make the right move
When you in high school
How you gotta work all day and take night school
Hopping off the bus when the rain is pouring
What you want:
Morning sickness or the sickness of mourning?

Chorus:

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul Know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live? Can I live?

I'll always be a part of you
Trust your soul Know it's always true
If I could talk I'd say to you
Can I live? Can I live?

Verse 2:

I'm a child of the king
Ain't no need to go fear me
And I see them flowing tears so I know that you hear me
When I move in your womb that's me being scary
Cause who knows what my future holds
Yo the truth be told you ain't told a soul
Yo you ain't even showing I'm just 2 months old
Through your clothes try to hide me deny me
Went up 3 sizes
Your pride got you lying saying ain't nothing but a migraine
It ain't surprising you not trying to be in WIC food lines
Your friends will look at you funny but look at you mommy
That's a life inside take a look at your tummy
What is becoming ma I'm Oprah bound
You can tell he's a star from the ultrasound
Our spirits connected doors open now
Nothing but love and respect 
Thanks for holding me down 
She let me live 

(Chorus)

It's uplifting fo'real y'all
I ain't passing no judgement
Ain't making no decisions
I am just telling ya'll my story
I love life
I love my mother for giving me life
We all need to appreciate life
A strong woman that had to make a sacrifice
Thanks for listening
Thanks for listening
Mama thanks for listening",Can I Live?,2005

Nick Carrafa,"We starve, look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives
I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

I wish I could define all the thoughts that cross my mind,
this angel begged for me to choose.
I don't even know which ones to lose
when I've fallen down so far
I think I'll never see your light, oh bouncin' off of me shinin' down here from you eyes.

(chorus)
Help me make the right decisions between right and wrong, weak or strong, day and night, where I belong.
Help me make the right decisions, know which way to turn, Lessons to learn and just what my purpose is here.

(Verse 2)
Its like I got the signals crossed with messages I can't decode.
Half asleep, never wide awake ya' know.
Complete overload and I got so much information here and nothing I can really grasp.  I should know the truth but I'm too afraid so I have to ask.
 (Chorus)

(Bridge)
Oh want to know you and more than anything,
I need you in every dream you're there for me. You love me for who I am. No Angel, just an ordinary man.

 (Verse 3)
Help me figure out why I'm stuck in the middel trying to understand why I can't. Why's it such a riddle.  Got my eyes crossed. Thinking so hard but I know I'm missing the mark. Can you help me sort out all the information?  I'm just wrecking my brain, paying attention but I'm still lost and at all cost I...I...I gotta know...gotta know!

And its cold but I am walking
To the place where all roads meet
And its just the past and me
A tattoo and a scar
And the man in the tv

Every time I walk away I see a picture of a face
It's a photograph that makes me wonder why
Now I stand here on my own
And I'm finally letting go
Its time to say goodbye

So down this road I travel now
Pass broken buildings where I look for truth, were they true to me, no
Every step is stepped with doubt
But still I walk here trying to find some peace
Will I find peace?

Every time I walk away I see a picture of a face
It's a photograph that makes me wonder why
Now I stand here on my own

Nick Carter,"She makes me wanna fly, with both feet on the ground
Takes me to this phase I don't wanna come down
Gives me something fresh, some one …real
Separate from the rest makes me wanna feel
I've got the perfect invitation to a world that's full of smiles
With our spirits free and wild
But it's a bittersweet sensation
'Cause I'll never have her heart

No matter how I try, she's always on my mind
I, every day and with every breathe I take, on the way
She'll make the good man cry but, look deep into her eyes
Outrageous, make you crazy, it's amazing,

She's special, she's special, so special
She's special, she's special, she's special, yeah, yeah

Underneath the moon walking hand in hand
A shadow by my side, wishing you were mine

Just a stranger to love without you I'm missin that familiar face

So don't leave me waiting don't leave me waiting all alone
Can somebody save me I need you to take me take me take me take me home
Take me home to the place I know take me home

I believe there's a light at the end of my dreams
Every rope every path in between leads me right back to your eyes

Nick Cave,"Ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
You know, she lives in apt. 29
Why? That's the one right up top a mine
I start to cry, I start to cry
Oh, I hear her walkin'
Walkin' barefoot cross the floor-boards
All through this lonesome night
And I hear her crying too
Hot-tears come splashin' on down
Leaking through the cracks
Down upon my face
I catch 'em in my mouth
Walk and cry, walk and cry

From her to eternity
From her to eternity
From her to eternity

I read her diary on her sheets
Scrutinizing every little piece of dirt
Tore out a page and stuffed it inside my shirt
Fled outta the window
And shinning it down the vine
Outta her nightmare
And back into mine
Mine! O Mine!

From her to eternity
From her to eternity
From her to eternity
Cry! Cry! Cry!

She's wearing them bloo-stockens, I bet
And standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling
Listen I know it must sound absurd
But I can hear the most melancholy sound I ever heard
Walk and cry, kneel and cry

From her to eternity
From her to eternity

Oh tell me why? Why? Why?
Why the ceiling still shakes?
Why the fixtures turn to serpents snakes?
This desire to possess her is a wound
And it's naggin' at me like a shrew
But I know, that to possess her
Is, therefore, not to desire her

O o o then ya know
That lil girl would just have to go
Go! Go!
From her to eternity",From Her to Eternity,
Nick Cave,"I stood in the water
In the middle month of winter
My camel skin was torture
I was in a state of nature
The wind, sir, it was wicked
I was so alone
Just as I predicted
My followers were gone

And I cried `Mercy'
Have mercy upon me
And I got down on my knees

Thrown into a dungeon
Bread and water was my portion
Faith - my only weapon
To rest the devil's legion
The speak-hole would slide open
A viper's voice would plead
Thick with innuendo
Syphilis and Greed

And she cried `Mercy'
Have mercy upon me
And I told her to get down on her knees

In a garden full of roses
My hands, tied behind me
My cousin was working miracles
I wondered if he'd find me
The moon was turned toward me
Like a platter made of gold
My death, it almost bored me
So often was it told

And I cried `Mercy'
I cried mercy on me
Cryind `Mercy'
Have mercy on me",Mercy,
Nick Cave,"It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a Colt forty-five and a deck of cards
Stagger Lee 

He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat
Had a '28 Ford, had payments on that
Stagger Lee 

His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, ""Never ever come back no more.""
Stagger Lee 

So he walked through the rain, and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
Stagger Lee 

He said ""Mr. Motherfucker, you know who I am?""
The barkeeper said, ""No, and I don't give a good goddamn.""
To Stagger Lee 

He said, ""Well, bartender, it's plain to see
I'm that bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee.""
Mr. Stagger Lee 

Barkeep said, ""Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day.""
Mr Stagger Lee 

Well, those were the last words that the barkeep said
'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head 

Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town 

She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she starts to flirt
With Stagger Lee 

She saw the barkeep, said, ""O God, he can't be dead!""
Stag said, ""Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head."" 

She said, ""You ain't look like you scored in quite a time.
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime.""
Mr. Stagger Lee 

""But there's something I have to say before you begin
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in,
Mr. Stagger Lee."" 

""I'll stay here till Billy comes in, till time comes to pass
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy in his motherfucking ass.""
Said Stagger Lee 

""I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know?
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one fat boy's asshole,""
Said Stagger Lee 

Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, ""You must be
That bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee.""
Stagger Lee 

""Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee, and you better get down on your knees
And suck my dick because if you don't, you're gonna be dead,""
Said Stagger Lee 

Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head
And Stag filled him full of lead

Into gullies damned with clover

On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing that you can do

He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
Is a red right hand

You don't have no money?
He'll get you some
You don't have no car?
He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect
You feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy
'Cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio
And the Bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
Red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares
You'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
He ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head
On the TV screen
Hey buddy, I'm warning
You to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god
He's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
In his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
His red right hand",Red Right Hand,1997
Nick Cave,"See the shark with teeth like razors
And he wears them in his face
And Macheath has got a knife
But not in such an obvious place

Now see the shark, how red his fins are
As he slashes at his prey
Mack the Knife wears fancy gloves
Which gives a minimum away

By the Thames' turbid waters
Men abruptly tumble down
Well is it plague, or is it cholera
Or because Macky's in town?

And the child bride, in her nighty
Whose assailant's still at large
Violated in her slumbers
Macky how much did you charge?

In the ghastly fire in Soho
Seven children had a go
In the crowd stands Mack the Knife
But he isn't asked and he don't know

Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
Watching that clock till you return
And lighting that torch and watching it burn

Now it begins, day after day
This is my life ticking away
Waiting to hear footsteps that say
Love will appear and this time will stay

Each time you go
I try to pretend
It's over at last
This time the big hurt will end

I wonder when, oh when will it end?

Today the streets are empty
And the crowds have all gone home

I pass a million houses

Was song after song after song

And when I am but dust and clay

And the heights I did aspire
Or will they tear out the pages of the book, 
To light a fire

He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is whining low:
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long,
When time goes crawling by.
The moon just went behind a cloud,
To hide its face and cry.

Did you ever see a Robin weep,
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost his will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

Lights up a purple sky.
And as I wonder where you are,

I'd watched the rain claw at the glass 
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast 
I should have taken it as a warning 
As a warning As a warning 
As a warning 

I'd given my nurse the weekend off 
My meals were ill prepared 
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb 
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room 
With all its teeth bared 
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared 
All its teeth bared. 

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

I left my house without my coat 
Something my nurse would not have allowed 
And I took the small roads out of town 
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown 
And my pajamas clung to me like a shroud 
Like a shroud Like a shroud 
Like a shroud 

There rose before me a little house 
With all hope and dreams kept within 
A woman's voice close to my ear 
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?"" 
""You looked soaked to the skin"" 
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin 
Soaked to the skin 

Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 

I turned to the woman and the woman was young 
I extended a hearty salutation 
But I knew if my nurse had been here 
She would never in a thousand years 
Permit me to accept that invitation 
Invitation That invitation 
That invitation 

Now, you might think it wise to risk it all 
Throw caution to the reckless wind 
But with her hot cocoa and her medication 
My nurse had been my one salvation 
So I turned back home 
I turned back home I turned back home

""The Bad Seeds performed Cindy regularly in their live sets in 1990,and indeed on a TV appearance as well. I have a version of Elvis Presly doing this song, but I think it's a traditional, also known as 'I Wish I Was An Apple', or as 'Sydney'. I think The Bad Seeds often sang 'Come on home, Sydney Cindy' -Maurice

Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree
Every time you'd pass me by you'd take a bite of me
I wish I was a bluebird I'd never fly away
I'd sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me


I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee
Told them that I love you, they all know its true
Say it till the cows come home until it gets to you


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me


Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot
Need you in the evening when supper time is through
What I'm really tryin' to say is I can't get enough of you


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me


If I were a musician I'd harp on just one thing
You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string
If only you would love me say it and tell me so
I need two charms about me baby to have the whole world
Know


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me


Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me

Across mountains all in flames
Through howling winds and driving rains

And all the earthly things they stop to play

Hey little train, we're jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train, it ain't even left the station

Hey, little train, wait for me
I once was blind but now I see
Have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?

Hey, little train, wait for me
I was held in chains but now I'm free
I'm hanging in there, don't you see
In this process of elimination

Hey little train, we're jumping on 
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
It's beyond my wildest expectation (children)

Nick Cave,"As so with that, I thought I'd take a final walk
The tide of public opinion had started to abate
The neighbors, bless them, had turned out to be all talk
I could see their frightened faces 
Peering at me through the gate

I was looking for an end to this, for some kind of closure
Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope of keeping track of it
I thought of my friends who had died of exposure
And I remembered other ones who had died from the lack of it

And in my best shoes I started falling forward down the street
I stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd
And love followed just behind me, panting at my feet
As the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud

Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God
I searched through the pictures in a leather-bound book
I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman's hook

Babe
It seems so long
Since you've been gone away
And I 
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day

Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun
It was a Good day and an Evil day and all was bright and new
And it seemed to me that most destruction was being done
By those who could not choose between the two

Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboys, clones
The streets groan with little Caesars, Napoleons and cunts
With their building blocks and their tiny plastic phones
Counting on their fingers, with crumbs down their fronts

I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers
The Magnolias, Camellias and Azaleas so sweet
And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns
People carry on regardless, listening to their hands
Great cracks appear in the pavement, the earth yawns
Bored and disgusted, to do us down

Babe
It seems so long
Since you've been gone
And I 
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day

These streets are frozen now. I come and go
Full of a longing for something I do not know
My father sits slumped in the deepening snow
As I search, in and out, above, about, below

Babe
It seems so long
Since you went away
And I
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day",Darker With the Day,2004

Nick Cave,"I met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every Sunday evening
In her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
""Oh willy, dear, don't kill me yet
I'm unprepared to die""
She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curls
And I dragged her 'round and 'round
Throwing her into the river
That flows from Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
With your dark and roving eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
You can never be my bride

I started back to Knoxville
Got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried
She woke up in a fright
Saying, ""dear son, what have you done
To bloody up your clothes?""
I told my anxious mother
That I was bleeding in my nose

I called for me a candle
And I called for me a bed
And I called for me a handkerchief
To bind my aching head
I rolled and thrashed the whole night through
All horrors I did see
The devil stood at the foot of my bed
Pointing his finger at me

They carried me down to Knoxville
And put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out
But none could grow my bail
I'm here to waste my life away
Down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl
The girl I loved so well",Knoxville Girl,2005
Nick Cave,"Take a little walk to the edge of town
And go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms
Like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back

Past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms,
Tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams
It took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole
Heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing that you can do

He's a god, he's a man
He's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat

He'll get you some
You don't have no car?

You'll see him in your dreams

So afraid, that he might show

Yeah, running scared, what would I do

Just running scared, feeling low
Running scared that you love him so

Just running scared, afraid to lose
If he came back, which one would you choose?

So sure of himself, his head in the air
While my heart was breaking, which one would it be?

Nick Cave,"We were called to the forest
And we went down
A wind wind blew warm and eloquent

We were searching for the secrets of the universe
We rounded up demons and forced them
To tell us what it all meant

We tied them to trees
And broke them down, one by one
On a scrap of paper they wrote these words

(And as we read them, the sun broke
Through the trees)

Dread the passage of jesus, for he will not return
Then we headed back to our world
And left the forest behind
Our hearts singing with all the knowledge of love

But somewhere, somehow, we lost the message
Along the way
And when we got home, we bought ourselves a house

And we bought a car that we did not use
And we bought a cage,and two singing birds
And at night we'd sit and listen to the canary song

For we'd both run right out of words
Now the stars they are all angled wrong
And the sun and the moon refuse to burn

But I remember a message
In a demon's hand

Dread the passage of jesus, for he does not return
He does not return
He does not return",Time Jesum Transeuntum et Non Riverentum,2005

I ache in the places I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on

Leonard Cohen hasn't answered me yet
But I can hear him coughing all night long,
A million floors above me in the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born like this, with a golden voice
Twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond,
Well they tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song

You can stick your needles in a voodoo doll
I'm sorry baby, but it don't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
They don't let a woman kill you in the Tower of Song

I've grown bitter, bitter, of this you may be sure:
The rich, the rich have got channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgement but it won't be long, but I may be wrong

The guitar, the bass, the drums, so nice every hour in the Tower of Song

But I feel so close to everything that we lost
But I'll never have to lose you again, Tower of Song

I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'm back

To watch the news on TV
I saw some ordinary slaughter
I saw some routine atrocity
My father said, don't look away
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now
He said, that in the end it is beauty
That is going to save the world, now

And she moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze

Up against the pink and purple wisteria

With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak,
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts
That were not in my best interests to mention

And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
She moves among the shadows
She moves me with just one little look

You took me back to your place
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag
And I stood at full salute
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
And made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion,
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek

She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
and through the years

Years passed by, we were walking by the sea
Half delirious
You smiled at me and said, Babe
I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down
It was then that you lifted me up again

And she walks across the sea
She moves among the flowers

So completely filled with light she was

Nick Cave,"Hey everybody, I'm doing alright
I'm driving around in the middle of the night on a silver cloud
You can touch me if you want, it's obligatory, it's allowed

Hey, get in 'cause all we do around here
Is win, win, win, win, swimming and winning

A motel in Memphis, see the King of the Blues
A South Dakota trail among the buffalo and Sioux
You can touch me if you want, c'mon get in
Win, win, win in my silver cloud
You can touch me if you want, it's statutory, it's allowed
I'd keep the windows rolled up if I was you
What, with all the buffalo and Sioux
And the lock's all down in the middle of the night in my silver cloud
Think there's a swimming pool smells like bleach
The driver has dropped something down the back of his seat
No one has driven this car for years
You can touch me if you want but I've not been sheared

I'm not human, you, man? I'm not human, you, man?

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,"I set out on Monday
The night was cold and vast
My brother slept
I left quite quietly
My father raged and raged
My mother wept

My life was like a river
All sucked into the ground
And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down

Many miles did I roam
Through the ice and through the snow
My horse died on the seventh day
I stumbled into a city
Where the people tried to kill me
And I ran in shame

Then I came upon a river
And I laid my saddle down
And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down

It knocked me to the ground
And I said, ""Please, please
Take me back to my home ground""
Lord, the hammer came down

Now I've been made weak by visions
For many visions did I see
All through the night
On the seventh hour an angel came
With many snakes in all his hands
And I fled in fright

I pushed off into the river
And the waters came around
And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down

It did not make a sound
And I said, ""Please, please
Take me back to my home ground""
Lord, the hammer came down

I was stuffed into the river
And the waters spelled around
And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down

It did not make a sound
And I said, ""Please, please
Take me back to my home ground""
Lord, the hammer came down

It drove me around the ground
And I said, ""Please, please
Take me back to my home town""
Lord, the hammer came down

And knocked him to the ground
And I got down on my knees
And I said, ""Please, please
Take me back to my home town""
Lord, the hammer came down

It did not make a sound
And I said, ""Please, please

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,"I met a little girl in Knoxville
A town we all know well
And every Sunday evening
Out in her home I'd dwell

We went to take an evening walk
About a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground
And I knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees
For mercy she did cry
""Oh Willy, dear, don't kill me yet
I'm unprepared to die""

She never spoke another word
I only beat her more
Until the ground around me
With her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curls
And I dragged her 'round and 'round
Throwing her into the river
That flows from Knoxville town

Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
With your dark and roving eyes
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl
You can never be my bride

I started back to Knoxville
Got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried
And woke up in a fright

Saying, ""Dear son, what have you done
To bloody up your clothes?""
I told my anxious mother
Was bleeding in my nose

I called for me a candle
And I called for me a bed
And I called for me a handkerchief
To bind my aching head

I rolled and thrashed the whole night through
All horrors I did see
The devil stood at the foot of my bed
Pointing his finger at me

They carried me down to Knoxville
And put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out
But none could grow my bail

I'm here to waste my life away
Down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl
Girl I loved so well

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,"People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just ain't no good

We were married under cherry trees
Under blossom we made our vows
All the blossoms come sailing down
Through the streets and through the playgrounds

The sun would stream on the sheets
Awoken by the morning bird
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers
And never read a single word

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good

Seasons came, seasons went
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking its fists in the air
The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veils

People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good
People they ain't no good at all

To our love send a dozen white lilies
To our love send a coffin of wood
To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo
That people they just ain't no good

To our love send back all the letters
To our love a valentine of blood
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry
That people they just ain't no good

It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when you're ill of health
They bury you when you go and die

It ain't that in their hearts they're bad
They'd stick by you if they could
But that's just bullshit baby

And go across the tracks

Where secrets lie in the border fires
In the humming wires
Hey man, you know
You're never coming back

Past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, past the stacks

A tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
A red right hand

You'll see him in your dreams

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,"As so with that, I thought I'd take a final walk
The tide of public opinion had started to abate
The neighbors, bless them, had turned out to be all talk
I could see their frightened faces 
Peering at me through the gate

I was looking for an end to this, for some kind of closure
Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope of keeping track of it
I thought of my friends who had died of exposure
And I remembered other ones who had died from the lack of it

And in my best shoes I started falling forward down the street
I stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd
And love followed just behind me, panting at my feet
As the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud

Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God
I searched through the pictures in a leather-bound book
I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman's hook

Babe
It seems so long
Since you've been gone away
And I 
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day

Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun
It was a Good day and an Evil day and all was bright and new
And it seemed to me that most destruction was being done
By those who could not choose between the two

Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboys, clones
The streets groan with little Caesars, Napoleons and cunts
With their building blocks and their tiny plastic phones
Counting on their fingers, with crumbs down their fronts

I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers
The Magnolias, Camellias and Azaleas so sweet
And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns
People carry on regardless, listening to their hands
Great cracks appear in the pavement, the earth yawns
Bored and disgusted, to do us down

Babe
It seems so long
Since you've been gone
And I 
Just got to say
That it grows darker with the day

These streets are frozen now. I come and go
Full of a longing for something I do not know
My father sits slumped in the deepening snow
As I search, in and out, above, about, below

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,"On the first day of May I took to the road
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning
As a warning As a warning
As a warning

I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared.

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud
Like a shroud Like a shroud
Like a shroud

There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman's voice close to my ear
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?""
""You looked soaked to the skin""
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I turned to the woman and the woman was young
I extended a hearty salutation
But I knew if my nurse had been here
She would never in a thousand years
Permit me to accept that invitation
Invitation That invitation
That invitation

Now, you might think it wise to risk it all
Throw caution to the reckless wind
But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation
So I turned back home
I turned back home I turned back home
Singing my song

Hallelujah
The tears are welling in my eyes again
Hallelujah
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
Hallelujah
And twenty pretty girls to carry
Them down

And twenty deep holes to bury them in

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,"We were called to the forest
And we went down
A wind wind blew warm and eloquent

We were searching for the secrets of the universe
We rounded up demons and forced them
To tell us what it all meant

We tied them to trees
And broke them down, one by one
On a scrap of paper they wrote these words

(And as we read them, the sun broke
Through the trees)

Dread the passage of jesus, for he will not return
Then we headed back to our world
And left the forest behind
Our hearts singing with all the knowledge of love

But somewhere, somehow, we lost the message
Along the way
And when we got home, we bought ourselves a house

And we bought a car that we did not use
And we bought a cage,and two singing birds
And at night we'd sit and listen to the canary song

For we'd both run right out of words
Now the stars they are all angled wrong
And the sun and the moon refuse to burn

And glide up and down the waters

I'll glide up and down the waters
Then I'll walk upon the land
And call 'em out
The ones who doubt

And I don't know what to do
It's early in the morning
And I can't believe its true

Well, I called you once, I called you twice
Ain't I your midnight man

Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,"I was just a boy when I sat down
To watch the news on TV
I saw some ordinary slaughter
I saw some routine atrocity
My father said, don't look away
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now
He said, that in the end it is beauty
That is going to save the world, now

And she moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
She moves something deep inside of me

I was walking around the flower show like a leper
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair
Up against the pink and purple wisteria
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me
With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak,
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts
That were not in my best interests to mention

And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
She moves among the shadows
She moves me with just one little look

You took me back to your place
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag
And I stood at full salute
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
And made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion,
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek

She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
and through the years

Years passed by, we were walking by the sea
Half delirious
You smiled at me and said, Babe
I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down
It was then that you lifted me up again

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same

So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest

Winding your hair
With a face of an angel
I can't help but stare

We're getting closer everyday
No more boundaries on our way
Just you and me together 
As one we will stay

We are joined at the heart
All alone in the dark
As the midnight turns to blue
I'll be meltin' into you
Meltin' into you

I walk the streets on the city
People hustling by
I've got a smile on my face
And a gleam in mine

'Cause when is crazy day's true
I'll be coming home to you
And I know you'll be there waiting for me
With a love so true

We are joined at the heart
All alone in the dark
As the midnight turns to blue
I'll be meltin' into you

Can't seem to get you off my mind
Love like all just what to find
Just wanna run and split to you
Soon I'll be walking through that door
And I'll be meltin' into you
Only you
Say that you love me too

Now I know where I'm going
'Cause my heart's in control
We are one spirit
Body and soul

Every night and every day
I close my eyes and pray
That this will last forever
And we'll always feel this way

We are joined at the heart
All alone in the dark
As the midnight turns to blue
I'll be meltin'
Meltin' into you

I know that you love me too

Nick Drake,"Strange face, with your eyes
So pale and sincere
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud",Cello Song,1969

They were really too good in their way

Kick your feet

Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again.

And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armor down.

Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbors only.
The games you play

Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far

On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place.

And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place

Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for.

The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose

If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.

About the change

Keep it by your side.

You fly to the city walls

So far away, so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand

As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand eyes
I called her my princess of the sand

She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess of the sand

One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone of her presence, there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand

Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, hope to find
That strange young dream, close behind
I'll call her my princess of the sand

About the plan
For lilac time.

For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay

There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence.

Do you feel like a remnant
Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move.

Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.
So try to be true,
Even if it's only in your hazey way.

Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.
Is it all so confusing,
Is it hard to believe

So crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning.

With the teeth that bite so sharp when you're not looking in the evening.

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind they kept you safe
And so secure amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime.

What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window

Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair.
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eye shade
Start over again.

Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear.
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round.

Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time.

About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime.

Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure.

For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain

Falling from the trees
Thoughts of hovering tree tops
Leading to the sea

This was our season, no lies and no pretend
But my love left with the rain

Thoughts of springtime rainfall
Touching flowers that bend
Thoughts of wind in willows
Days that never end

This was our season and we said it couldn't end

Rain's the way you move now
Sun the way you seem
Flowers the, leaves the way you wonder

So pale and sincere
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear

For the dreams that came
To you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight

But while the earth
Sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song

And if one day you should see me
In the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud

Take them for the ride,
Let them feel the energy you can provide.
Roll it through the times,

Can't stop asking why.
Running with the changes, I'm a social institution.
Don't stop driving them wild, wild, wild.

Nick Grant,"You never met a nigga this cold
Somebody tell them boys class never gets old
The more success they hate me, that’s the way this shit goes
Married to the money that relationship goals
Never will I fold, pay me what you owe
It ain’t a cougar trine holla when I wave the 44
Money don’t change niggas it only amplifies, who they really are
The sold you a bag of lies, this the land of the wise
All the lamb are disguise, I’ll never lose my cool but not a fan of your vibes
Okay I’m from the dirty, need to be sanitized
Product of ghetto teaching this ain’t that class at DeVry
Moving that cocaina they call it that Spanish bride
I love her I fantasize I’m just staying alive
Food for the soul, stuck with a can of pride
You niggas can’t see me, fuck it I’m camera shy
You better eat your Wheaties, I park it where I can see
Shit will get hot and shaky like Parkinson’s with the fever
This ain’t checkers its chess, all I see is the cleavage
Butting heads with the best, it ain’t nothing to Beavis
I’m the meanest boy, I got it zipped up thriller jacket I mean it
Bad bitch from Ibiza, she brought a friend like a feature
She got that good grade A head I had to repeat it
Six ring flow, leave it after the beep then
I’m from the bottom where half these cats are deceitful
Where niggas drive by and double back like the sequel
Lethal, I’m the goat, rappers should take some notes
All you niggas is pussy, don’t drop the soap
Puffy dancin’ on the money hoe
Peep how my hunger grows, life is a fat bitch, I love her money rolls
They wake up on my dick, go eat your Honey combs
Go where they money go, location undisclosed
Tell her the check don’t bounce, tell her my tongue can roll
I pull up in a drop then peel off like under clothes
Picture life being perfect, man I struck a pose
Man I’m too down to earth for these stuck up hoes
In the A, I diddy bop, she got her titties propped up
Ass fat and she let me lick the clitty pop
With a dark brown sis like she dipped in Willy Wonk
Niggas lost the noodle thinking I ain’t really dripping sauce
Poppin, check the skillet, nothing I’m just chillin’
Pussy niggas got that virus, hope my sisters catch no feelings
Keep them niggas out your business, help your niggas run a business
These niggas swear they gods but know nothing ‘bout forgiveness
The world showed you moguls are just crooked politicians
Spending hundreds since they had they baby face like Kenneth
I’d rather be a goofy then a Mickey stop the snitching
Internet thuggin, hashtag killers

This is pimpin', I should slap a nigga open-handed
High off life, I told a model she needs lower standards
Asked her if she had a twin, I feel like Joey Tanner
Big spender, Kris Jenner, I promote the family
Car dashin', see the Benzo, she like ""Oh, it's happening""
Think she call me daddy cause she never knew her daddy
And my shooters all black, Rhythm Nation Janet
Boy don't make me jack son, robbery, uh, bodily harm
Was underground, now she topping me off, slob on my knob
Niggas fronting like I ride with the mob
Why shouldn't I charge, me, myself, and I, ménage à trois
Play the odds, a yes-man is just a bobble-head doll
Holla them all, a nigga strutting like Pac at the court
Hop out the Porsche
Shake that ass, got that pussy on menus the a la carte
Boy I had to make my point bout this wave, watch for the sharks
Bounce

Yo, hold the fuck up! 
You dusty feet ass bitches running here fucking these niggas for free
Worrying about how your bills gon' get paid
Bitch, if you knew better, you'll do better
And you niggas 'round here working another nigga bomb
And you ain't become no boss yet, get you some money!

Ok, I had to chef it up, I'm talking Cuban links
Tell her ain't no weak link in my Cuban link
Only like my cougars at a youthful age
Nigga, we was gangnin' since the platinum Fubu days
I got dreams of being Hova, I should move in yay
Listen bae, this shit so good you'll think I'm cool with Ye
Ok, my diamonds dancing I could bag a LisaRaye
Life is hard, but it's easy being truthful, baby
This shit dope for real, overload the scales
This pimpin' like I got coke in my pinky nail
Get the money baby, we don't fuck with ain't ours
Bet it back, I bet I match it like the same style
Chopsticks for beef from shutting P.F. Chang's down
I gave you prophecy my first one and you lamed out
Luckily, sold dope, but it wasn't for me

I want you to teach me to love you
The missing piece to the puzzle

Mother nature gave me life that's how they best describe it
The light of my life
But still we are forever blinded

We more concerned with diamonds and rhymes about who the flyest
Here's my lecture to recognize the timeless
Why do they hate her?
From Nina Simone, to Angela Davis
Hung up my jersey from modern-day playa
Know a single woman, who struggles
Working double, but still
Could never do her no favors
Know a single woman
Who fucking ball players for paper
Training the adolescent mind as celebrator
If no you, there is no me
How could I fault you for this?
You like the closest thing to God
Still we call you a bitch
Black woman

Uh, I swear your hair is like the thickest cotton pickens
Headed for temptations, but that's not an option listed
And as i browse your mind I'm learning that your optimistic
Could probably vision us together but that's not realistic
I heard rumors twice over and they sound horrific
But I knows better
Searching for your mouth to kiss in
And when I pray I tell my God that you're his best invention
And when I'm done touching your mind here's my next intention
A blessing isn't it?
A stand up nigga
Never poured me a four up
She wants the real me
And I ain't hesitate when I showed her
This ain't checkers its chess
Start our journey through flesh
Who the fuck are they kidding?
You nurtured men through your breast
I bet he's awesome protection
You point the finger at fault
Was handed nothing, you vanishing

Heart on my sleeve, was barely five and watched my momma cry
You blacked her eye cause you was snaking, had her wrapped in lies
All I could think about was rapid fire, blasting nines
Go ask for God, I pray the pastor got some slacks your size
So asinine, my be-ginning's no different, we were you and living poor
Used to beat my brother cause you said the nigga wasn't yours

Sipping empty 20/20, put some hair up on your balls lil nigga

I'm on the rise, just know your son is raising himself

That's fucked up, my shoes scuffed up
Wish I could say I followed your steps, but never that, the hood judged us

Sorry I made your shit hard, and all that shit you saw I did to your moms
We never found our way, it chased us at odds, these are the dangers I've caused
You kept your distance, dissed me, then placed up a wall, face it
Our love's a test and I pray I ace it tomorrow; wasted
This alcohol kicks in, I get the courage to face all the things that I resent
Wish I could try again, but she's no saint, please don't think I'm pointing fingers nigga
Cause these attempts are so genuine, I'm so anxious
And dying, your trying to make peace while I'm here
Hungry for forgiveness my nigga, don't feed me this fear
Just let me know when you get this call
Cause every second you let pass, I get closer to God

Everything is bout business I feel like Erick and Parish
Quite bored with the games, back to checking you squares
This that murda murda, aye send my best wishes 
The games a dirty hoe, a well-dressed mistress
My blood cuz said I blew up am I set tripping 
Cause when you popping, bitches talk they even text different
Such a fresh prince, Will Smith and Wesson
I’m so fucking sharp, could stick some shit to tetanus
Okay the ice on chill but shit my life is Netflix
I came and took they spot when the argued who the best was
Okay it’s Nicky baby, I park the Benz on the curb
I ain’t have no excuses I had to make that shit work
Go head and drool on it baby, I been dripping since birth
‘Cause when shit ain’t that sunny I throw that shit in reverse
I’m gone!

I just had to run it back
When I ran into the cash
Think you wanna run away
And go back to a sunny day

And I don’t want no cloudy skies 
When I look into your eyes
I see you feel the same
Let’s go back to a sunny day

Me and hit in this bitch
And my bitch got a bitch
I ain’t giving em shit, only dinner and dick 
Tatt my name on your arm
That mean you gave me your heart
This the flow of the gods
Here’s a verse from the psalms
Swimming in this paper, let’s make the world move
Expensive linen, switching women like girl groups
Don’t make me pull up on you, I did my curls too
Too many clown niggas, I let the world spoof
You, life is a motherfucker but daddy’s back
When I’m bucking get to ducking like Aflac
Man these hoes outta pocket but still can have the sack
Never indirect I’m at yo chest like the cabbage patch
King, no it ain’t a thing that we won’t do for love
Only in business I must remove the grudge
Talk bout what them do but they don’t do enough
Got you bleeding red for my green
I need a Gucci plug, HA!

I just had to run it back
When I ran into the cash
Think you wanna run away

Nick Harper,"Take a look down your highway
Tell me what d'you see
Well if you're down my way
It could well be me
Stood on your corner
I'm nearly down on one knee
Can you hear me calling for you
So damn easy to see
And it can't be forever
And it won't be for long
So don't you think that it's better
We speak the same tongue
Out here in this weather
We must surely belong
Birds of a feather
Whatever the song:
Please give me a lift man
It can't be for far
The way that you shift man
In your empty car,
I've got the highway blues
In my holy (holey, wholly) shoes
And I cannot choose
What I look like
And I got here from yesterday
On porridge and bait
Swallowing sorrow
Following fate
Poaching tomorrow
From God and the state
Of homo his shadow
The well known long haired straight
But I've got a good reason
For being this way
I'm happy for certain
And hoping to stay
Travelling trust
Across the new day
Gathering dust
Down your highway
Please give me a lift man...
It can't be for far
The way that you shift man
In your empty car
I've got the highway blues
In my holy shoes
And I cannot choose
What I look like
Out on the streets
Or where my drum beats
In between the clean sheets
Of my love life
And I need little Margaret
Out here again
Screwing some traffic
From the shaven insane
With thumbs like a dragnet
She pulls like a train
And she looks like a magnet;
And she comes like a warm rain
Please give me a lift man...",Highway Blues,1994

One million thoughts as I reflect. 
Tease me just a little I'm not hard to persuade 
fully aware for this that I might pay. 
Not too much that can be said 
Thinking about the bad things in my head, 
Always wondering if what they said was true 
Now I'm in the bed with...

Chose the one keep me out of danger. 
No song and dance just jump right in. 

Fought the urge to do it skin to skin 
What the hell here I go jump right in 

Standing in the doorway of distress 
Ask MD, for ways out of this mess, 
A wave of panic every time I lose a hair 
I believe I'm falling apart but not quite despair. 
Turns into this one thing I just can't ignore 
Don't know what I am feeling anymore 
I guess it's time to end this affair 
Like I don't care I don't care.

Makes my everything in between
Gathering sticks on Sunday
Makes me forget all I've been

But you suffer for your jealousies

The showing of both sides
Never mind this boy he's lost inside
The trouble he can't hide

Your jealousy all the work
You think of him as a fool
Because he gave you his all

No mate or buddy of mine
Is going to live to sublime
Deeper season than reason
Letting go all the time

A coward, clown and a dreamer
I find it hard to believe her
It seems that all I can do
Is tell this boy he's a fool

Making all of it up
Sending all of it up
Seems that all I can do
Is say I leaving you someday

But what is he without her?

And anyway
He always hears how much it means to people
There's a lot of forty-somethings 
Who wouldn't be in the world without it
So now he does it with this lyric in his head

Belinda, I loved you
I'm sorry that I left you
I met somebody younger on a plane
She had big breasts
A nice smile
No kids either
She gave me complimentary champagne 

No one ever wants to hear the song he wrote for Cindy
""Cindy, I love you
I need you, don't leave me""
And he can't blame them, they can tell
His heart was never in it
And Cindy never liked it but
She never much liked him

Belinda, I loved you
I'm sorry that I left you
I met somebody younger on a plane
She had big breasts
A nice smile
No kids either

So every night about this time
He feels the old self-loathing
While the old folks in the audience sing along
And he smiles and waves the mic at them
So they can do the chorus
But he's not there, he's somewhere else
He's with Belinda
In the days before he made it all go wrong

He was with Martha, she was with Tom
Neither of them really knew what was going on
A strange feeling of never, heartbeats becoming synchronized

It's been that way forever but most of the time it's just near misses
Or kisses once at a bookstore, once at a party

And it's not like they were ever

Nothing to be done about that
Rainbows, daffodils, she's not naive
Symbolism's all crap

There's a big picture window in the room on the ward
With a view over Parliament Hill
But the view offers more joy than they can afford
When there's this much pain to kill

You know what hope is
Hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you, kick its backside
Got no place in days like these

The dust, the darkness surrenders to color
As the fireworks streak the sky
And their window gives them the prettiest picture
Their useless luck makes her want to cry

Then it turns midnight
The shitty whole year's spent
Another mom deserves some sparkling wine
And she nearly gives into the moment
But he'll still be sick in two-thousand and nine

You know what hope is
Hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you, kick its backside
Got no place in days like these

And just as she's thinking
Of pulling the blind down
A rocket bursts in front of her eyes
The city lit up, London's givin' her bright crown
She tries and fails to stop
Spirits rise

As loud as a drum that is still on defeating
We live on a dream of the things we believing
Are made of blood and steel and stone

And no ones gonna hurt us now

And we fall and we crawl and we walk and we run
So we learn how to fly again
So everybody’s scream out loud

The innocence rules and hope is unbroken
Say everything that we need without choking
‘Cause know is time to let it out

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck

And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune

Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
 
Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see ev'ry part, nothing hides in the heart to hurt me
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me
For when love's gone, they'll lustre on
 
Diamonds are forever, sparkling round my little finger
Unlike men, the diamonds linger
Men are mere mortals who are not worth going to your grave for
I don't need love, for what good will love do me?

Nick Ingman & His Orchestra,"Lay a whisper on my pillow,
leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now,
it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
it's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now,
it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without.

'Cause in a crowded room Id be the only one shed sees
Shes looking bored now Im runnin' out of time
Ive only got 6 minutes if Im gonna make her mine

Another minute and she makes me feel brand new

5 minutes and shes where I want to be

This could be the end or its just the beginnin'
Shes the kinda girl that I want to know better
Reachin' for her keys so I guess its now or never

Just starin' at my feet

I'm already complete

I hope this doesn't make you cry

That I am on your mind

I'll come around in time

I'd rather hide behind this walls

Or pump your fist like you're Bruce the Boss

Strum it, drums
Slide across and runnin'
The stage is your home if you learn how to own it
Like the greats did
There's no way that you can fake it
You've gotta feel the beat before you can move
Even though you're not wearing blue suede shoes
And making mistakes
That won't matter
If you can swagger like ol' Mick Jagger

If you've got a heart and soul
You can rock n' roll
You can rock n' roll - solo

If you're live and die for the music inside
If the 1-for-5 never gets old
Then you can rock n' roll
Rock n' roll

All right, now take it low
Now I need the spotlight to hit me
Right here
As the crowd starts to cheer
I need the fan to blow right through my rock-star hair
Right here

Nick Jonas,"I'm, I'm good at wasting time
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
But I'm trying to grow a mustache

I eat cheese, but only on pizza, please
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise it smells like feet to me
And I, I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love you when you say my name

If you wanna know
Here it goes
Gonna tell you this
The part of me that shows if you're close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
My heart, will you ask for it, for your perusing?
At times confusing, slightly amusing
Introducing me

Doo doo, doo doo doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo doo doo
La da da da
La da da da da da da da, da

I never trust a dog to watch my food
And I like to use to the word ""dude""
As a noun, or an adverb, or an adjective
And I've never really been into cars
I like really cool guitars and superheroes
And checks with lots of zeros on 'em
I love the sound of violins
And making someone smile

If you wanna know
Here it goes
Gonna tell you this
The part of me that shows if you're close
Gonna let you see everything

But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
And my heart, will you ask for it, for your perusing?
At times confusing, possibly amusing

Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to
So be careful when you ask next time

So if you wanna know
Here it goes
Gonna tell you this

I've broken my heart so many times, that I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out

I thought, I thought of every possibility

And I know someday that it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work, so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing, and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and in my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And, baby, your love is gonna change me
