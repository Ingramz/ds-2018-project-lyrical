Dan Haerle,"Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
Want you to know it really is pleasin'
Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
Missing you since you went away
Singing the blues away each day
Counting the rights and waiting for you 
I'm in the mood to let you know 
I never knew I loved you so 
Please say you love me too 
When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me but please don't tease me

Dan Haerle,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laurie,2000
Dan Haerle,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean?,2005
Dan Haerle,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
",On Green Dolphin Street,2005
Dan Haerle,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",Someday My Prince Will Come,2005
Dan Haerle,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you get's me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

I can feel you breathe
Washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
I can feel you breathe, just breathe

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way",Breather,2007

Dan Hartman,"Super highways coast to coast just easy to get anywhere
On the trans continental overload; just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel when there's no destination that's too far
And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are?

Living in America, hand to hand across the nation
Living in America, got to have a celebration!
 
I live in America

But you might find it anyway

Dan Hartman,"Your eyes, your eyes are the windows of the soul
Don't you know?
And every time they look at me
It's a pleasure what they show

And do you wanna celebrate the light inside of me?
Real emotion for everyone to see
Song to sing with a sweet melody
Somethin' to believe in, tell you how I feel

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes

And darling when I hold you, you give it back to me
I can't imagine anything that I would rather see
From the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes

The touch, the touch of your hand so fundamental
In my head, in my heart, in my soul healing on so many levels
It doesn't matter what we're going through
One thing with me is that I'll always love you

And don't change a thing, that's my advice
I'm singing about the sweetness you bring into my life

Carry on that magic of the feeling you express
People will be happy if they have what you possess
It's the love in your eyes
Oh baby, it's the love in your eyes, the love in your eyes

And darling, when I hold you, you give it back to me
I can't imagine anything that I would rather see
From the love in your eyes
Baby, it's the love in your eyes
The love in your eyes, oh baby

I know this love holds many changes
Not everyday will be a day without the past
Ah, don't you worry, just give it up to heaven
If we release control love will surely last
I want the people want to show your love will last
Ooh, baby, baby, baby love will last

Dan Haseltine,"All my devotion and misguided loyalty
Swinging my sword in the garden while you pray for your enemies
All my allegiance, I loved you and you alone
But who'd believe that I could mean it now that the rooster crowed?

Now we're huddled up here, trying to swallow our fear
We still smell the bread and wine, hear your words running through our minds
Holding our breath now, for what comes next now
Holding out for some kind of sign

But there's empty cross, there's an empty tomb
Fire and wind now sweeping in this tiny upper room
There's a hungry world, there's a risen king
Unlock the doors, what reason more could we ever need?
So sing with me, I dare you to
Because there's an empty cross, there's an empty tomb

We wept from a distance, watched pieces of our dreams
Buried with You, every last wound, sealed with stone, beyond our reach
Sweet, sweet Jesus, every question, every fear
Vanishing, like vapor dreams now that you're standing here

Now the tears come easy, when you say you're leaving
We touched the place the nails went through, wanting one more day with you
But it's goodbye now, for a little while now
Believing everything you said is true

But there's empty cross, there's an empty tomb
Fire and wind now sweeping in this tiny upper room
There's a hungry world, there's a risen king
Unlock the doors, what reason more could we ever need?
So sing with me, I dare you to
Because there's an empty cross, there's an empty tomb

We will sing this song to make your name live on
Until every heart hears of the way you rescued us",Empty (Disciples),2011
Dan Haseltine,"There's a sea of lonely swimming sad
Looking just for an arm to grab
I don't need to understand
I'm just lending you the two that I have

[Chorus]
You might be drifting
And can't find the shore
So hopeless and all alone
The waves are crashing all around you
Just when you've lost the will to live
You see the sun

Can we make a searchlight
From all the bridges that we burn?
Do you see a rescue?
Or a deeper kind of hurt?

Who could love you,
Who could hold you?
I'd swim across the sea
You don't have to be alone
Where the shallow gets so deep

[Chorus]

I am hurt and nearly drown
(Open up your eyes)
I cry for help you turned around
(Open up your eyes)
Farther from the shore
Or you'll be farther from the shore

I am hurt and nearly drown
(You're not alone)
I cry for help you turned around
(I'm not letting go)
Farther from the shore
So you're not farther from the shore

Thanks, Dan
Yeah, you remind me of a girl who lives in my apartment complex (oh, yeah?)
Really, I don't know where she does her shoppin', but man, what style

She's a bit old-timey, but that's alright with me
She wears a dress of velvet that hangs below her knees, her knees
She's a bit old-fashioned, as all the world can see
The cameo she wears upon her bosom, puts me in ecstasy, ecstasy
Yes, she's her own grandmother, that's what they're telling me
But my old-timey baby is swell enough for me, you see

You see, she plays her old Victrola
The lamp is low, kerosene, you know
You know we lie, we lie upon her bed

She sews some lace or we embrace
Or when we go out strolling, the world can plainly see

Dan Hicks,"Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you their your old long lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you, nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out

Trying to sound clever, but words got in the way

Conversation wandered,
Though their eyes seldom met
They both knew what they were after
And they played it step by step

His eyes were feeling heaving
He kind of wished that he could run

As she kissed away his doubts
The night was just beginning
As his body began to melt

She watched the sunrise
While he slept in dreams unknown

Though she wasn't white sure why

It never meant to go this far
It started out to be a game
I never meant to be a star.

And everybody smiles
But their eyes stare out so empty
From a face they scrub with Dial
And the words that spill so fancy

Dear Caroline
I thought my songs would change the world
Instead of slowly getting rich
Off the emotions of young girls.

And what really makes me laugh
Is that nothing's really changed
Since that day I left you years ago

To find myself a name
And what really makes me cry
Is that it's only an illusion
And all that success means
Is just money and confusion.

I've been told you settled down
Found yourself a family

And some believe it's misplaced feelings
And me - I always change my mind
So many words have lost all meaning

And still you come for me

To know just what you see
You make me weak
You make me strong

Will you stay with me

Spinning so fast
And time was a rocket engine
With no end and no beginning
But all time stopped when she said yes

Take it if you will
Take it if you can
Or refuse it, you know I'll never ask again
It's just a ring
At best it's just a symbol of everything
If I can share my life with you
Standing naked in my fear
I could not face her
Then I broke down, my arms embraced her

Dan Hill,"Washed out in the stillness of the night
She's left searching
Once again love's promise has been broken
And he snores indifferently to the rhythm of her breathing
As she lights a cigarette and waits for morning
Light years apart, they lie both together
Like a child caught playing with matches
She's been burned again by fire
And she knows she's been betrayed by her own imagination
The cigarette keeps burning as she curses her desire.

And she thinks
She's the only one who's lonely
And she wants the world to feel sorry
And she's trapped
Within her own self pity
And she asks: will anybody love me.

And on the radio an old song sings
Suggesting that love is why we're living
As she turns the station fast.

She looks down at her lover
A friend of a friend of a stranger
As if his mouth might breathe an answer
And she knows she's getting older
The emptiness controls her
And the smoke curls round her fingertips
Like question marks in time
The sun plays with the windows
As the man wakes up beside her
Silences are awkward as he reaches for his clothes
And as he leaves
She feels suspended, invaded and rejected
The cigarette is ended
That's how her story goes

And on the radio a new song sings
Suggesting that love is why we're living
Ironically she laughs
As she turns the station fast
She's given up on giving
Washed out in the stillness of the night
She's left searching",Question Marks in Time,1976

From the clouds in your eyes

To the time that's passed us by

The harder we cry.

To some far away dreams
That binds us as one
Then divide us it seems
That the deeper our drifting
The harder we try

And life goes on I suppose
And love can fade
As fast as it grows
Times they may shake us
But nothing can break us
You now.

The water stays still
The air tastes so lonely
I fight off a chill
Let this song bid goodbye
Until we return

And boys can be so insecure

23 today and all your friends are getting married
You say they're so scared of being alone
So self righteously you march though teachers college

It slips away

Washed away

As you hide behind your barricade of words
But no one got close enough to you to have ever heard 

I met you at a party you were drunk and full of world advice
And I was getting nervous
You said you had a child who was a genius and you smiled
As the living room transformed into your circus
Someone whispered you were 39 today a face so you
Eyes so old
You collapsed into the corner
Like somebody of raw nerves you near seduced me
With your verbs
As I reached out for you
You said over and over

Shout and laugh with all their life
Shut em out fast before you think of the past

Like a thousand miles of canvas stretched flat against the sky
Freshly painted colors just waitin' to be dried by time

And do you still play hide and seek with a-all the children in the park
Fill their heads with crazy stories till the daylight is blinded by the dark
Do you still dance through a snowfall 
While the flakes perform a ballet in mid air-air-air
I can almost hear you laughin', I wish that I-I was there, to share-are

I'm still not used to havin' people pay to hear me
Guess I'm still a child tryin' so har-ard to please
Tryin' to seek approval through my songs
And do you still love me or have I been away too long

And as I look back on my roots graspin' for faith I still don't understand
My shadow of youth loosens its ho-old on me with tremblin' hands
So I carve the words I miss you out in stone, tossed it in the air
Wished I could fly-y beside it there, I'd fly to you back home
Even the strong need someone to break down with and hold

I'm till not used to havin' people pay to hear me
Guess I'm still a child tryin' so hard to please
Tryin' to seek approval through my songs
And do you still love me or have I been away too long

Dan Hill,"Every time the phone rings I pray it might be you
That you thought out all the answers
Wanna get back together again
Oh but a strangers voice rings through my ears
And though I listen you are all I hear
And girl I didn't mean to drive you away
People come and go so fast
But all I see is your face

There's an old man on the corner
Just staring at the sea
I wanna hold him like a broken doll
Ask him if he's lonely like me
The waves crash like a violent dream
The mist flies and the seagulls scream
And the old man he sees nothing just stares into space
And me all I can see is your face

Now I know there are no promises in love
You've gotta give it all you have
And hope that maybe you can share
Maybe you can share your life with someone
A Stranger touches me and all I can feel
Is your embrace
A stranger looks my way
And all I ever see is your face

I've got my songs to protect me
I've got my friends to ease the pain
They say time will heal this emptiness
Girl without you it ain't the same
I don't see any stars tonight
Just the darkness of the city lights
I close my eyes once more and try to escape
And all I can see is your face",All I See Is Your Face,1980
Dan Hill,"Wake up to the madness of the city
Say hello its a brand new day
Brush my teeth read the paper
Everything is changing so fast it stays the same
Cars attack the city street
City sidewalk, city heat
People push and people fly
No one laughs and no one cries
Someone save me.

Look up, an office building
Stares right back indignantly
Look down, my feet keep moving
Shuffling to the city's endless beat
Billboards tell me what to buy
How to dress and how to die
Traffic signals starts to change
Madness starts all over again
Someone save me.

My doctor says I need a brief vacation
Wife says its just a stage, Ill be alright
Boss says Ive got too much imagination
Papers tell me rain again tonight.

Wake up to the madness of the city
Close my eyes and fly to mars
A man jolts my arm I swing out madly
He swings back and I see stars
I curse my world beneath my breath
I curse myself I curse whats left
People push, people fly
No one laughs, no one cries
Someone save me",City Madness,1980
Dan Hill,"Ma cried like a lady
Pa cried like a man
1963 - one less kennedy
And I was too young to understand
And the years flew by in colours
Each one a little faster than before
And as the war caused some to cry
I'd identify
My tv keeping score
Growing up - in the shadow of the u.s.a.
Trying to find - the meaning of life today
America - it's a heavy kind of role you
Play
You're the hero - you're the villain
Your every move is on display

Ma cried like a lady

And I was too young to understand
We were all too young to understand
",Growing Up,1980
Dan Hill,"So you flung your fist high in the air
But the world remained the same
And all the demonstrations
Filtered out through graduation
And the times that were a changing
Never changed
Freedom takes on new meaning
When you have a family of five
And peace and revolution dissolved in its own solution
When you're fighting for your life
Just to survive

It's then you've gotta
Hold on - for what you believe in
Hold on - don't let it fade
Still you've gotta
Be strong - find yourself a reason
You never change the world
But just the same
You've gotta hold on stronger
Each and every day
When the night creeps in so hollow
When the silence makes you scream
When you're so damned scared of failure
When the world's burned out it's saviors
When you're feeling too vulnerable to dream

It's then you've gotta
Hold on - for what you believe in
Hold on - don't let it fade
Still you've gotta
Be strong - find yourself a reason
You never change the world
But just the same
You've gotta hold on stronger
Or else you'll fade
",Hold On,1980
Dan Hill,"I could spend my whole life writing love songs
If they'd help bring me closer to you
Trying to find the right words
But they all get so blurred

While expressing my feelings I get so confused
I can analyze and you can analyze
We can both analyze till we're blue
Let emotions take reign let them play their own games
Let the freedom of youth captivate you

Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away

No I know you've been hurt you've been broken
Life just ain't real without pain
And there's no guarantee that all ends happily
But when you fall you gotta rise up swinging again
And you can run away I can run away
We can both run till our lives are through
Some people hide till their hollow inside
Please don`t allow this to happen to you

Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away

I'm so damn tired of hearing songs about pain
There's so much to learn, life's too short now to spend it afraid
Let this song last forever let this song last a day
Let our love last a lifetime let our love fade away
No matter what happens if we go our own way
We'll be both walking wiser if walking away",Let the Song Last Forever,1980
Dan Hill,"Phone broke the silence of the night
I'd been sleeping
And a voice said, how you doing Dan
Thought I'd call you for no reason.
And my mind flashed back two years
Since the last time I'd see her
When the love we'd shared had died

And she said, things are going well for you
I'm glad you still have music
I remember times you felt so damned confused
I thought you'd lose it
Do you still make crazy faces
At the mirror in the morning
How come you never said goodbye.

[Chorus]
I chose my words so carefully
But I felt my past seducing me
Slow down, she said
I just want to be your friend
I said, that's the way the whole thing started
And I just can't fall in love with you again
Knowing it'll end.

And all I heard was silence
And I wished she was beside me
Like the first time we made love
And I felt waterfalls inside me
So I tried to dial her number
But my fingers froze
And slowly, I closed my eyes",Phone Call,1980
Dan Hill,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie

And who am I to judge you
In what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance's in all strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the years security
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize-fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides",Sometimes When We Touch,1980
Dan Hill,"All I Want is You

I don't want my name in lights
You burn out so fast
You turn to smoke in the night
Baby, all I want is you

I don't want no presidential parlor
It's a little too clean in that big white tower
Baby, all I want is you

I don't wanna be born again
Rest my soul in your hands
Take my chance in the end
Baby, all I want is you

And all, all my life I've waited
For you to come along
There's been so many strangers in my life
Filled with the dark spaces of my night
But now the darkness is all gone

I don't want no social graces
Get too damn dizzy
Wearing all those different faces
Baby, all I want is you
All I want is you

All, all my life I've waited
For you to come along
There's been so many strangers in my life
Filled with the dark spaces of my night
But now the darkness is all gone

I don't want my name in lights

Dan Hill,"Woman, please don't try
Explaining how or why, I understand
Love's too beautiful to explain
And nothing can be wrong with loving him again

He really loves you
I can see him in your eyes
And like a fountain you offer no disguise
And babe, I'm glad you've never tried

And the night times that we shared
Made me gratefully aware
That I was happy, so real so undefined
And I just want you to be you
In a lifestyle undefined

You really love him
I can see you in his eyes
And like a fountain, he offers no disguise
And babe, I'm glad he's never tried

I read somewhere that grown men never cry
Their heart just freezes over for a day
So instead here's my masculine goodbye
May love be with you all the way
My guitar does all my crying anyway

There's happiness combined
With the pain within my mind
You gave me feelings
That I never knew existed

And all you'd do is laugh
And my defenses would be lifted and I love you
You're sketched so softly in my eyes
And like a fountain, I offer no disguise
And babe, I'm glad I've never tried

I read somewhere that grown men never cry
Their heart just freezes over for a day
So instead here's my masculine goodbye
May love be with you all the way

There's a shooting star that's falling
As it dwindles into floating dust

But there's something wrong, you see
I can't make it
Just with me
I'm lonely

Well I dreamt I saw your face last night
Just an image in the long
While falling through space I felt
Just you and me
And God
I just don't know if I can believe in you
The dreamer deep inside me
Surely wants me to
If only dreams come true

At times I get this feeling
That there's more to my life then greets my eyes
Just a crazy kind of feeling
Then I take a look around
This world's falling down
Only a clown could believe, believe

Well everyone's had hopes I guess
On how the world should be
Everyone's had dreams that just elude reality

Oh and god Your name's been used
For politics for power
God your name's been used
For all the love that towers
But has yet to fall - upon us all

Reading playboy magazine
Insisting that the articles
Were the only things we'd read
Thinking then that love was meant to
Conquer
And if a girl said she liked you
Then you'd bonk her
Don't try to lay that mush on me

Looking back a high school
Getting drunk for the local dance
Lonely boys - nervous girls
Grappling with romance
Thinking then that love
Meant something frightening
A sudden end as brutal
As bolts of lightening
Don't know what it was, but it scared me

From one night stands to wedding bands
To struggling to stay free
Watching time move faster
As hold on helplessly
As love smolders waiting to be tamed
We grow older staying much the same

Looking back a college life
Seemed like such a compromise
Unsure of my direction
Using brains as my disguise
Thinking then that love meant to
Remember
You only felt its warmth
When you surrendered
Don't know what it was, but it scared me

To struggling to stay free

Dan Hill,"The boy left for New York, he left the woods
And trees behind and no one knows just what's on his mind
He says he's lost, he'll pay any cost
Just to find out where he belongs

But the girl left for the country, she left those
Blaring lights behind and no one knows just what's on her mind
She says she's lost, she'll pay any cost
Just to find out where she belongs

Nobody's right, nobody's wrong
Everybody's searching
We're all searching for where we belong

The boy lives in a high rise now, he's neighbors with the sky
The mirror in the hallway keeps on asking, why?
The silence knows the change will help him grow
Help to find where he belongs

The girls lives in a cabin now, she gazes at the sky
The shooting stars keep falling, they keep on asking, why?
The silence knows the change will help her grow
Help her to find where she belongs

Nobody's right, nobody's wrong
Everybody's searching
We're all searching for where we belong

Some claim that we're weak, some say we're strong
Something says we're all searching
We're all searching for where we belong

I love I hate
I live I die
For every single day
That passes me by
But for all the pain
That meets my eyes

Just a reckless dreamer
Destined to drown
In all my feelings

Yet I keep on smiling through my tears
Juggling wonderment with tear
Just trying to find some meaning

There are times when I feel
Like giving it all up
I`ll look into myself and see a stranger
Oh and nothing can seem stranger

But I know
I`ll come around
And like the fool I am
I`ll see this world so much stronger Cause that`s the way my life lights spins

Until the day it dims
Until my life will be no longer

Has bloomed into a flower
And though it claims to set me free

Lord don't let this crazy world
Make a jukebox out of me
Let the songs keep flowing strong

The gift of music is the key
To all my tears, my laughter
And though it claims to set me free
It reigns my life as master

Lord don't let this crazy world
Make a jukebox out of me
Let the songs keep flowing strong
And naturally

And oh, let me say this peacefully
Forget the dreams, forget the fantasies
Let me make it honestly
Or not at all

And oh, let me say this forcefully
Forget the dreams, erase the fantasies
Let me make it honestly
Or not at all

Sunshine, can you spread your warmth over me?
Chase the clouds from the sky casually
Make me feel like a child once again

Sunshine, how does it feel lost in the sky?
Is it dizzy looking down from that high?
Well you know you've always got a friend

One more drink and this day will be over
I can already feel the cold, my jacket I sold
For fifteen dollars worth of booze

One more drink and I'll be off on some rainbow
Looking down at this world below I'm so high that I'm low
But this is the only life I'd choose

Sunshine, can you spread your warmth over me?
Chase the clouds from the sky casually

To share while life keeps teaching
To share while you keep reaching
But you prefer to reach out privately

She was gonna have a baby
A part of me went weightless
For the first time in my life
There was nothing I could say
It's like a miracle from the stars above
Paralyzed with fear
I was overcome with love

She said soon you'll hear the beating
Of an unborn heart
This is the answer
You've been searching for so hard
And for the first time in my life I felt
The wave of love so deep
As I listened for the unborn child's heartbeat

I said something stupid like, how are you feeling
She smiled the warmest smile I've ever seen
Oh, I guess that said it all
Now were a far cry from the storybook romance
Something in her eyes, made me crumble
I reached out for her hand

She said soon, you'll hear the beating
Of an unborn heart
This is the answer
You've been searching for so hard
And for the first time in my life I felt
The wave of love so deep
As I listened for the unborn child's heartbeat

And I lie awake at night and wonder
How a child survives
Beyond the danger in the strangers
And the inhumanity

How I wish that I could tell you, it's all in the past.
But I was never good at lying, and baby since you asked,

Behind the high school, cutting class.
Making love beneath the stars.
You were my Venus.

Where does all the time go?
Look at us now.
Caught up in our different worlds.
Though we gone our separate ways I found.

I miss you still.
It's the middle of the night and I'm calling you.
Cause I can't hold back what I feel inside.
I miss you still.
Your a piece of my heart that I can't let go.
Though it tears me apart, you should know.
That I miss you still.

You remember when.
You said I'd always be your man.
How you reached out for my hand.
Your fingers trembled.
How your daddy hated me.
How it drove him to distraction.
That was part of the attraction.
Way back when girl.
Where do the years go.
It seems like yesterday.
Well God this world seems different now.
Maybe some things, some things never change.

I miss you still.
It's the middle of the night and I'm calling you.
Cause I can't hold back what I feel inside.
I miss you still.
Cause your a piece of my heart that I can't let go.

Dan Hill,"Fourteen today, and you went dancing.
Music mixed with laughter, and boys can be so immature.
They made you drink a bit too much,
Everything's a blur to feel and touch.
Did he really like you? well, how can you be sure enough?

Twenty-three today, and all your friends are getting married.
You say they're so scared of being alone,
So self-righteously you march through teachers' college.
Still so much in life you gotta get to know,
Seems like everybody's so content to move so slow.

And when you think you've got your life so well-controlled, it slips away.
And the years, like raindrops falling from your life, are washed away,
Washed away.
And you're so brilliant, you're so gifted, so sensitive, so strong,
As you hide behind your barricade of words,
But no one got close enough to you to have ever heard.

I met you at a party.
You were drunk and full of world advice, and I was getting nervous.
And you said you had a child who was a genius,
And you smiled as the living room transformed into your circus.

Someone whispered you were 39 today,
A face so young, eyes so old. you collapsed into the corner
Like somebody up on verbs, you near seduced me with your verbs as I reached
Out for you,
You said over and over,
""oh, when you think you've got your life so well-controlled, it slips away.
And the years, like raindrops falling from your life, are washed away,
Washed away.""
And you're so brilliant, you're so gifted, so tragic and so wrong,
As you hide behind your barricade of words,
But you know, no one got close enough to you to have ever heard.

Children come home from school, shout and laugh with all their life.
Shut them out fast before you think of the past, turn out all of your lights.
Go to bed, go to sleep, don't think, don't feel as the nighttime owns a
Prayer.
But maybe somewhere deep inside there's some meaning aching to be shared.

Waiting for my daddy to come home,
And now I look into the eyes of my own son,
Wondering what he's thinking of,
Waiting at the window when I come home.
Watch his eyes fill up with joy and wonder.
He reaches out his tiny hand;
I feel the bond 'tween boy and man.

Memories of my mom cryin', my daddy gone for weeks at a time,
Not knowing how to comfort her,
Facin' my pillow, pretendin' not to hear.
Now I write this letter to my little boy.
I'm far away, not knowing really what to say
Except, ""I'm sorry, oh so sorry.""
I don't want to make these same
Mistakes my daddy made with me.
Still his voice rolls off my tongue
When I say, ""Boy, protect your mom.""

Memories of my wife cryin' on the phone
Wonderin' when I'm coming home.
My voice sounds detached and cold,
Reminds me of someone that I knew;
He had a funny attitude
When I needed him to be
All the things only a daddy could be to me.
And I don't want to make the same
Mistakes my daddy made with me.
Still his voice rolls off my tongue
When I say, ""Not now, I'm busy son.""

Memories of lying in bed with my wife and son,
Overwhelmed by so much love,
Tryin' to explain how a man can cry
Yet still be happy,
Thinking of all the dumb mistakes I've made.
Now I understand my father's pain;
He did the best with what he knew.
I love you daddy.
I watched my son fall asleep
And wonder what he'll think of me
When years from now he sees his son
Reachin' out his tiny hands for love.

Dan Hill,"You are the love of my life
You are the reason I'm alive
And baby, baby, baby
When I think of how you saved me
I go crazy

I've never known love like this
It fills me with a new tenderness
And I know, I know, I know
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You're all I can't resist

And I need to tell you
The first time I held you
I knew, you are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
Till you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know
Is I need you

You re the love of my life
All the joy and tears that I cry
And baby, baby, baby
You don't have to say a word
I see it in your eyes

As we stand here together
I promise forever
Till the day I die
You are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
Till you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know
Is I need you

You are the love of my life
You are the reason I'm alive",Love of My Life,1999
Dan Hill,"Everything you are, everything you'll be
Touches the current of love so deep in me
Every sigh in the night
Every tear that you cry seduces me

And all that I am and all that I'll be
Means nothing at all if you can't be with me
Your most innocent kiss, girl, your sweetest caress
Seduces me

I don't care about tomorrow
I've given up on yesterday
Here and now is all that matters
Right here with you is where I'll stay

Everything in this world
Every voice in the night
Every little thing of beauty
Is shining through your eyes
And all that is you
Becomes part of me too,
'Cause all that you do seduces me

And if I should die tomorrow,
I'd go down a happy man
I thank God I've ever known you
I fall down on my knees
For all the love we've had

Every sigh in the night
Every tear that you cry
Seduces me, oh, seduces me
And all that you do seduces me.",Seduces Me,1999
Dan Hill,"I see your face cloud over like a little girls
And your eyes have lost their shine
You whisper something softly
I'm not meant to hear

Baby tell me what's on your mind
I don't' care what people say
About the two of us from different worlds
I love you so much that it hurts inside

Are you listening
Please listen to me girl

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand
That it's love we're fighting for

Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride
I love you so much baby
That it tears me up inside

I hear you on the telephone
With god knows who
Spilling out your heart for free
Everyone needs someone they can talk to
Girls that someone should be me

So many times i've tried to tell you
You just turn away
My life is changing so fast now
Leaves me lonely and afraid

Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try to understand

Can't we try just a little more passion

I need you more and more each day

Can't we give just a little bit more
Can't we try just a little bit harder
Can't we give just a little bit more

Can't we try just a little more passion
Can't we try just a little less pride
Love you so much baby
Tears me up inside",Can't We Try [Single Version],2006
Dan Hill,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie

For who am I to judge you
In what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance's an honest strategy
Leaves me grappling with my pride
But through the years of maturity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize-fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides",Sometimes When We Touch [Miles Jones & Austin Dovercourt Remix],2011

Don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing Dizzee Rascal
I'm just using his beat as a single example
It was the first big hit of its kind in the pop charts
All that last shit with profit in mind, not heart

Prancing about like they're the next big thing 
'Cause their cousins got an eight track and their mate Darryl can sing

These kids getting above their stations and saying, 
There a vessel through which a higher power's conveying
""my lyrical content is a miracle, godsent""
My name is scroobius pip and I say fuck all that nonsense

Their lyrical prognosis is like spirital osmosis
In that everything they say evaporates into boasts, its a joke
Ive listened and I cant even find one quote which is
Worth using as a reference or even as a footnote

Yeah, most of these kids could get their guns out and kill me,
But how many have the skill to inspire and thrill me?
I've got a holster I keep biscuits in it, it works into
Your brain leaving big fat blisters in it.

Who am I better than, I'm better than I used to be,
I'm gonna keep on getting better so you better just get used to me

If you think that's a cop out then hear my point
Truthfully cos chances are deep down this is how you used to be

Once you finally achieved it you standards will slip

dan le sac Vs Scroobius Pip,"Hey There, how, how's it going?
Long time no see.
I know I haven't been around much lately
But, it didn't seem like you wanted me to be
The last time I sent down a message you nailed it to the cross
So I figured I'd just leave you to it, let you be your own boss

But I've been keeping an eye on you, I have, 
And it's amazing how you've grown.
With your technological advances and the problems you've overthrown, 
And all the beautiful art you've created with such grace and such finesse, 
But I admit there are a few things I'm afraid have impressed me less.

So I'm writing to apologize for all the horrors committed in my name, 
Although that was never what I intended, 
I feel I should take my share of the blame.
All the good I tried to do was corrupted
When organised religion got into full swing, 
What I thought were quite clear messages were taken to unusual extremes.
My teachings taken out of context to meet the agendas of others, 
Interpretations taken to many different ways and hidden meanings discovered

Religion became a tool, for the weak to control the strong
With all these new morals and ethics, survival of the fittest was gone
No longer could the biggest man simply take whatever he needed
'Cause damnation was the price if certain rules were not heeded
Some of the deeds committed in my name
Just made me wonder were I went wrong.
Back at the start when I created this, the foundation seemed so strong.
See all the elements were already here, long before I began, 
I just kind of put it all together
I didn't really think out a long-term plan.

I made the sun an appropriate distance and laid the stars across the sky
So you could navigate the globe or simply watch the sun rise
I covered the earth with plants and fruits, 
Some for sustenance and some for beauty
I made the sun shine and the clouds rain
So their maintenance wasn't your duty
I tried to give each creature it's own attributes
Without making them enveloped
I gave you all you all your own space to
Grow and in your own way space to develop

I didn't know such development would cause rifts and jealousy
Cause you to war against each other and leave marks on this planet indelibly
You see, I wasn't really the creater, I was just the curator of nature
I want to get something straight with homosexuals right now, I don't hate ya
I was a simple being that happened to be the first to wield such powers
I just laid the ground, it was You that built the towers

It was You that invented bombs, and the fear that comes with them
And it was You that invented money, and the corrupt economic systems
You invented terms like just-war and terms like friendly fire
And it was You that didn't know
When to stop digging deeper, when to stop building higher
It was You that exhausted the resources I carefully laid out on this earth,
And it was You that even saw these
Problems coming but accredited them little worth
It was You that used my teachings for your own personal gain
And it was You that committed such tragedies, 
Even though they were in my name

So I apologize for any mistakes I made, and when my words misconstrued
But this apology's to mother nature, cause I created you",Letter from God to Man,2008

Dan Mangan,"Used to anticipate the sign of the coming day
And all through winter's decay, you just mark the way
We worry what people'd say if we up and walked away
I swore we had a place to stay
Stay
That's what mothers say when their sons and daughters go away
They say ""stay."" my mother said go
So I wasn't there the night she fell out of her chair so frustrated that she Amputated her own legs, or rather tried to, with a steak knife
Her life leaking out on the white floor blossoming like roses in the snow
Her relationship was an anthem composed of words like ""gotta go."" so we went
And sent our regards on postcards from all the places that we'd been, with stories About all the things we'd seen
That's how it was with you and I
Why say goodbye when we could still write?
And then we took your hands
But we should've practiced our goodbyes because then I took your eyes and I was Somewhere in the middle of nowhere watching the sun rise over a stop sign faced down the center line of a highway filled with sudden turns for the worse
Coming back home cause I gotta play nurse
Gotta figure out with pill alleviates which pain, which part of your brain is being Used for a boxing bag as your body became a never-ending game of freeze tag taking Place in an empty playground
I was left looking for your limbs at a lost and found and I couldn't set you free
So we just sat there, our heads bent towards each other like flowers in the small Hours of the morning while light wandered in like a warning that time is passing and You ride a little home with it bit by bit every day
And all I could say is if I could, I would write you some way out of this but my gift Is useless and you said, no
Write me a poem to make me happy

Over the hill and gone
And I'd never been that far
Some boy along the way taught me to play guitar
And you said that you'd read to me if I fell asleep
Rock me awake again, promise me
But you make such beautiful words
I wrote ""move, pen, move
Write me a bedroom where cures make love to our cancers
But my mother just motions to a bottle full of answers and says, help me go
Now I know something of how a piano must feel when it looks at the fireplace to see Sheet music being used for kindling
Smoke signaling the end of some song that I thought it would take too long to learn
So I just sit here watching you burn away
All those notes that never had a chance to play
To hear the music of what you had to say
But I count out the pills, just to see if I can do it
And I can't even get halfway through it 
Before I turn back into your son and say stay

I need something to lean against
I think that's okay, butterflies, you read to me
They all flew away
And I'm saddened by the thought and sometimes I think too much and though I'm happy Right here, you know that I'm really not
It's distracting
I could hook up to my heart to your ears and let my tears be your morphine drip
And maybe it's easier to let you slip away than it is to say goodbye
So I hold my breath
Because in the countdown to death, the question of why melts into when?
How much time do we have left 
Because if I knew what I know now then move pen move
Write me a mountain because headstones are not big enough
None of this is
Stop it, write me a poem to make me happy
I swear write this, stay, she smiles and says gotta go
I know, goodbye
Over the years it seems that aging's just not for me
Though I ache just below the knees and it flows to my heart 
And all through the hearts I need
It's not how it ought to be
You're falling away from me
And it's just not right
Falling away from me
It's not right

That same day the mine would take him
But far freedom's fight in the H.L.I.
On a foreign field he was taken
And the pension left in his daughter's hand
Had to love and feed the children
Oh Caledonia
Caledonia
Oh Caledonia
She quartered at a Rose Street Inn
She favored the capitals gentlemen
And from shame she saved the family name
Made a husband of a lover
From their union come a rhyming man
With his band he crossed the oceon
And the pride of Caledonio
Made his name

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in the store
Morphine city slippin' dues, down to see that

We don't even care, as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it, to see

I'd make any kind of sacrifice
Just to see you, just to see you
I'd climb the mountain and I won't think twice
Just to see you, just to see you
Just to see you, just to see you

Just to see you
I'd make any kind of sacrifice
Just to see you, baby
I'd climb the mountain and I, I won't think twice
Just to see you, just to see you

Dan Navarro,"Many times I tried to tell you
Many times I cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone
Don't want to leave you really
I've invested too much time to give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind
 
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
 
Maybe it's a sign of weakness when I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?  Do we distort the facts?
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say
 
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
 
Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best to try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it, how much we really care
I hear your voice inside me, I see your face everywhere
Still you say
 
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
 
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Dan Neale,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Dan Neale,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Dan Needham,"Before the threads of time began
Was pre-ordained a mighty plan
That I should walk with Him alone
The cords of trust unbroken


But fate foresaw my wandering eye
That none could yet restrain
To violate the friendship I
Would cause Him so much pain


Chorus:
And everytime I close my eyes
I see the nails, I hear the cries
He did not keep Himself away
He was no stranger to my pain
He walked a mile in my shoes
He walked a mile


Feet so dusty cracked with heat
But carried on by love's heartbeat
A man of sorrows filled with grief
Forgiveness was His anthem


No feeble blow from tongue or pen
Could ever sway my love for Him
Across the echoed hills He trod
And reached into my world.

Dan O'Brien,"Two weeks away feels like the whole world should have changed,
But I'm home now, and things still look the same
I think I'll leave it 'til tomorrow to unpack,
Try to forget for one night that I'm back in my flat
On the road where the cars never stop going through the night,
To a life where I can't watch the sun set
I don't have time
I don't have time

I've still got sand in my shoes,
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye,
Anything else would have been confused
But I want to see you again

Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanity,
Should run a bath and then clear up the mess i made before i left here
Try to remind myself that i was happy here,
Before I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away,
From the road where the cars never stop going through the night,
To a life where I can watch the sun set,
And take my time
Take all my time

I've still got sand in my shoes,
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye,
Anything else would have been confused
But I want to see you again

Two weeks away,
All it takes,
To change and turn me around, 
I've fallen
I walked away,
And never said,
That I wanted to see you,
Again

Dan Osterman,"It's been seven years down the road
I got no more tears in me left to flow
When I did my baby wrong
She left me lonely for so long
Now I'm out here all alone
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home

[Chorus: x 2]
Lord, won't you please...bring my baby home
Lord won't you please bring my baby home

It go one for the treble
Two for the bass
Used to mess with this girl
Way back in the day

She was from the pj's
And she went both ways
Yeah, the girl was a freak
I used to call her monique

And before I even speak
About knockin' the boots
I say her name been changed to avoid lawsuits
So now we gettin' down to the nitty of the gritty

She brought her friend around
And damn she was pretty
Betty was twisted
She said her number was listed

They grabbed my love two fisted
Hugged it and kissed it
They say one in the hand
Is worth two in the bush

But when shove came to push
Yo, I had my own theories
World series of love
It's two on one

'Til I got caught with the smokin' gun
His wife came home
And she bursted in
Now I'm lookin' for my heart

Like I'm made from tin
The road that I travel
Ain't got yellow bricks
My old woman jinxed

That all men are pricks
And she flipped the script
She's puttin' lip to lip
And every time I think about it I just lose my grip

'cause I've been up
And I've been down
And I've been fast
And I've been slow
And I've been square
And I've been round
And I've been high
And I've been low
And I've been cool
And I've been calm
And I've been kind
And I've been crass

I held the whole world right in my palm
I tried to spread it around
But it sure went fast

[Chorus]

Seven years sure have flown by
I got no more tears and they are left to cry
When I did my sugar bad
I lost the best thing I ever had
And now I'm out here on my own
Lord, won't you please bring my baby home

Lose their taste for kissing?

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.

control enough people you can have a career

I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly

There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, oh

She wants to tell him not to call or come a round again,
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him.
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in,
And she don't know which way to move.

She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind,
But if she could bear to walk away
she thinks he wouldn't mind
'Cause he just keeps himself 
so apart and there's no one else in her heart,
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard.

She's determined to try
but she'll still give in when he gives her a call.
She'll ask herself why, but in the end it won't matter at all.
Sure, she could sit at home, stay inside 
and sleep alone with her pride
And as she walks out that door, she feels 
as weak as before with nothing to hide.

She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing,
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,
She knows she bounces like a yo-yo when he pulls her string,
It hurts to feel like such a fool.

Dan Seals,"Saw your picture on a poster in a cafe out in Phoenix
Guess you're still the sweetheart of the rodeo
As for me and little Casey, we still make the circuit
In a one horse trailer and a mobile home

And she still asks about you all the time
And I guess we never even cross your mind

But, oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair

And, oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me, I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold

Well, Old Red, he's getting older and last Saturday he stumbled
But you know I just can't bear to let him go
Little Casey, she's still growing and she's started asking questions
And there's certain things a man just doesn't know

Her birthday came and you never even called

And I guess that we were only in your way
But someday I'm sure you're gonna know the cost

Second time I was just holding on
Third times a charm but I got burned

You got more mature but I guess we stayed the same
But I still believe in the starry night
And I keep on a-waiting for the one that will turn out right

Leaves a peaceful feeling in my mind
Waking up in the morning with an eagle overhead
Makes me want to fly away before my time
And I think God must be a cowboy at heart
He made wide-open spaces from the start
He made grass and trees and mountains and a horse to be a friend

And trails to lead old cowboys home again

Sure makes you feel good when you're there
But the country's so pretty it goes on and on for miles

And if engines could run on desire alone 
That old yellow car would be driving me home

And where Larry and Sally could no longer wait 
There was no road too winding and nowhere too far 

With two bucks of gas and my old yellow car

Why can't we live the way we want

Is what we choose

Dan Shelton,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2002

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Dan St. Marseille,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1995

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low

Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

And when we touched, she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True, that he's no Prince Charming

Well, who'd have thought? Well, bless my soul, Well, who'd have known?

Well, who indeed? And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?

I mean I'm alive and plan to be for yet another seventy years
Time waits for no one
Not even for god
We're only immortal for a limited time
Someone said we were only born to die
Someone said there is a meaning with it all
I love the world and I barely believe that I will leave it for good one day
Someone said my religion is the way
Someone said don't try to say that you are not afraid
No!

The big sleep is the only thing that is for sure and we're all gonna face it

They mean science will finally reach its goal and offer everlasting life

I love my life and it's so hard to hear that one day all I am will disappear
I have seen grief and what it does to you
The day will come when I will lose what I was made of
I try to imagine what that would be like but the thought is so unreal so it is filtered out
I'm so afraid that I won't have the chance to tell the ones I love how I really feel inside
I hide my emotions for far too long
I am so afraid to lose you all that's the essence of this song

Am I the only one to think that hell is to be left alone
To live without that special someone
To feel like the king that lost his throne
Have you ever seen the dying
Touched the fading one
The last time I saw the Queen of nostalgia she was basically already gone
Time waits for no one
Not even for heroes

You create a hell for the ones to buy your illusion
You design a spell that you cast upon the forsaken
Hortative
You engender temptation
Re-create
Invent the latest sensation
Procreate
Produce the perfect delusion
Your god is digital

You erase the deviations
Adding beauty to the frail
Dreams contrived upon a drawing-table set the pace of the vain
Trust the vagaries of fashion
Do what all the others do
Total loss of independence
You've always wishing you were someone else

[Chorus]

You behold your victims inane
Opinions cast aside
And when they try to change
And try to find their native demeanor
They are frozen out, precluded from the coven from the mass of fools
There's a message and receivers who will see it as a rule
There's an image made to covet
Global mass-manipulation complete
High-technology will cover all the errors in the way
Can't you see that you deflower and deform the generations to come
You behold your victims inane
Opinions cast aside

I will have to confess

Is pretty damn far from the truth
In league with machines

In my room full of words
Always searching for patterns that will give life to a line
My poetry is frozen though it's beginning to melt
The solid form is changing to the liquid of thoughts written down
Sentence after sentence in a language not mine
Loss of point no direction
A jigsaw where no pieces fit
I envy the writers and the poets who know the way to the places poetry grow
There is no harvest if you never sow
So I beg, steal and borrow wherever I go
If words were like music this would be a book
But this is not even worth the time that it took
Not even a novel just a self-pity tale written by someone that always will
fail

Reality is blended with fantasies and things I have repressed
When I awake all the stories remain inside my head
Memories forgotten always reappear in the wicked sceneries
Characters that once fell into oblivion united with my recent past
Tribute to my dreaming
Hymn to the delusions that I sometimes really wish were for real
In the deepest slumber reality is twisted and staggered across the halls of
 my head
When I awake I can remember it still and it is nothing that my scenes can
Kill
And I fall through the passage of time
Then there's the nightmares
That never seen to leave my mind
I can't escape it
They're even stronger when I close my eyes
How to forget and how to erase all the wicked scenes in here
How to make them disappear and burn this patchwork of fear
How to delete
How do I stop all the sickening things I see in this spurious diary that
Wasn't made by me how to replace my artificial memories",Patchworks,1999
Dan Swanö,"Shadows capes form a web across the sky and steal the light that runs the
Engine of my heart
Deceived by clouds but I know it will soon return to watch my every move
Like an eye in the sky
Lunatic
Obsessed I am indeed
I will gain no strength this moonless night
Heavens heart or just a forgotten stone
All life lost or is it yet to come
The stars will be alone in the firmament tonight
Shadows grow stronger across the sky
The sun prepares for battle
The night is soon to die
Vicious beams will soon obscure the presence of the sun of the night
My soul despise the dawning and the light that it will bring
Doomed to be nocturnal
A creature of the night
Another dawn dilutes the dark the void where I can live
The rays of light burn my skin and ravage my desire
I close my eyes and I await the vengeance soon to come
When the dusk will bring the unlight and heal me once again
I have to return to my tower before the twilight will drain me of live
Tomorrow I need to be caressed by the moonlit sky or my soul will be
Carried away by the light
Just like the sun of the night
The moon is mine
Oh how I long to be one with the sun of the night
Oh how I long to unite with the sun of mine",Sun of the Night,1999
Dan Swanö,"A tale forgotten long ago brought to life again
Ancient wisdom ancient lies
Horrid lullabies for the earth
Time will turn my prophecies into reality and it will lead the world astray
Death found the remedy for its enemy
It's too late the seize the day
Time and my malicious spells live in harmony
They await the hour set
Rapture of all that is alive
The reaper will arrive to invert the hour glass

Oh uncreation
The evolution in reverse
Oh uncreation
The death of universe
His reflections on the end still unknown to man
Dark predictions dark clichés in this recital of doom
The world is aging backwards
The young remains the young
We all know tomorrow will be yesterday reborn
The time and space deserted will hold no life for man
We face these final hours to be buried in the past
Something is wrong with the sky tonight
The clouds are darker than ever before
There is unrest in the stars alight
As if they warned me for the distant roar
The sun is descending
Nevermore to shine
Light is lost forever
We are the last in line",Uncreation,1999
Dan Tepfer,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide
A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me

Yeah man, just left town man
I'm here, here
Had to get outta town baby
Where you standin' at?
You can pick me up at the round busstation
Or I can take a plane
Give me a sek and I'll tell you how it went down

[Kool Keith]
I stayed in New York, depressed, walkin' mad through the block
Watching brothers go down, my project friends smoking rock
My group divided and everthing was undecided
I was drinking, thinking: ""Damn and my boat is sinking""
Everybody's wack can new groups comin' back
They on Arsenio, ???? on video
Watch this clownrhyme that's payed for a primetime
Everybody's mean, they're hard, they're killing mothers
Shootin' bang bang fake man killing brothers
I had to turn off the radio from all the war???
Mickey Mouse and friends all talking pop and lippy
Girls excited for what? And old ?facturated?
People got their brain washed and folks got manipulated
They start believing Donald Duck made the earth
The industry was cursed since the Dinosaur's birth
(The industry was cursed since the Dinosaur's birth)

Flying nighttime, eating peanuts on the plane
With no moneycontrol, my stress builds on my brain
My ticket's oneway
I'm out to southern Caliway
I left behind some people that wasn't even equal
I thought back with chicks and freaks in 86'
When Marlie was in in control +the funky magic mix+
I had the limousine on hold with the real chauffeur
Ripped the ???? up with Ultra and I felt like Oprah
Girls in flocks and fans in lines from blocks
I didn't even hear a ?paperview? rappin' mister
I was your idol and probably on your older sister
Now you bad you signed stupid with a recorddeal
Your image is butt you perpertrating Shootin' Steel
Holdin' guns on albumcovers just to make funds
You the man quick fast payed out the ?anoass?
You can see I'm back and clear on stereo
with my own style, my intimite material

[Talking voice]
Ye, your style changed every year
Think about what you did
Used to dance, used to wear suits
Then you came back to wearing hip-hop clothes
Then you went back to wearing suits

It's over now

It's over now

No accounted, my lawyer keepin' checks on the low
Money, expenses for trips I didn't know
Agencies finding shows I couldn't get myself
Writing rhymes at night in the house by myself
I open mailboxes, all I see was more bills
Gettin' cold chicken, walkin' down Ryan's hills
Askin' moms for 50 cent, just to pay my rent
I had no will to ill, my mind was out to kill
I called up Kurt, got a ??? signed with Capitol
Money's flowin' now wild suckas out blowin' up
They my pupic care, and pupils still growin' up
Sucking mean while the g'ism as it hits the rhythm
They want that new style, no money it's called freestyle
Taping of the radio, smokin' from a crackvowel
They on my tip now, as always as usual
You forgot me, but I didn't forget you

[Chorus]
2x It's over now
   No problems in this world
   It's over now

Wakin in the morning I still represent the nation
When I speak of nation please don't make the deviation
Rebels of the party who create the drum sensation
Mind is a pit of different information
Microphone is on so of course communication
Bogle at the party then you got the bogle-ation
Decaptatin foes yo as if my name was Jason (come on)
Makin all the fellas at the party lose composure
Hook up the beat with the mic and it's over (original, uh!)
A Tribe Called Quest we on the run for whatever
Trials and tribulations that we have to endeavor
Brothers know my steelo it's a letter to the better
If you see a shorty that you like, then you sweat her
Silly with the microphone, in other words I'm loco
Six foot zero with my height, complexion cocoa
Representin on the mic it seems to be my daily
I can do a split and turn around like Alvin Ailey

Would have tried for singin but that stuff was not my callin

Walkin through the door and all them suckers started haulin
Talk a lot of trash but no one can seem to beat it
Pull out your microphone and watch the Phifer make you eat it
The MC's they get jealy when the girly's on my belly
Kick a slow dance like my brother R. Kelly (bust a rhyme)
Today's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uhh)
Worked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded
Steady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh)
Don't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal
Always wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right)

Please proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal
I can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (yes dread, uh)
Formulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (right)
Calm and serene like the study was Tao
Poetry machine with correct mechanisms
Immune to disease I defeat organisms
That are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters
Give your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters
Quitters turn to losers, losers are forgotten
Tangling my cord with hopes that I’ll stop rockin
Never will that happen only if it is permitted (uh)
Wait, I think somebody shitted (come on)
I guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin
I go for what I know doin a show for human beings
Always try to lead yo never will I follow
Blowin up the spot like Fred did to Rollo
And when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go",Lyrics to Go,2006
Dan the Automator,"[Intro]
His name is (Lyrics Born)
And he is, as they say, wild and crazy
As a composer, arranger, and producer
He's exploring it all
From the furthest reaches of musical outer space
To the most down to earth funk
And he sounds, well, he sounds exactly like this

[Verse 1]
Nobody 'members those
Rap City episodes from twenty years ago
When you were the guest host
Past history, let it go
Get off on a medical
Pack a duffle bag with all your wrinkled clothes and pedal home
Get a little dictaphone and sit alone
In the middle of the room and let it flow
Wouldn't it be better
If you went and chose a new career path
Like a shepherd or a flight attendant on an aircraft?
You're pitiful, a pollywog
Tiny fishy in a smaller pond
Holding barbie dolls and leftover beads from the Mardi Gras
Actin hella hard but that's just poppycock
'Cause inside you're hella soft like a Jolly Rancher lollypop
I'll give you cauliflower ears stupid
You're weird
Feelin blue
On a stool somewhere, two-fisting beers
At a Hofbrau
Moaning like a hot cow
Cryin on the shoulder of some old man you met just now

[Chorus]
I'm smarter than you
I'm harder than you
I'm better than you
I'm just raw

I'm hotter than you
More popular than you
More clever than you
And goshdarn it, people like me

I'm smarter than you
I'm harder than you
I'm better than you
I'm just raw

I'm hotter than you
More popular than you
More clever than you
And goshdarn it, people like me

[Verse 2]
Look I'm sorry, mate
This is awkward, k?
Little hard to say
So I'll just say it
Me and your mommy date
She's awfully great
She's a soft seatmate
She calls me late
Always wants to meet
On her coffee breaks
She bought me seats
To Bonnie Raitt
Now there's no concrete date
But she bought the ring
It's Marjorie May
And my stockings stink
From my foot up in your ass
'Cause you drive me absolutely batty
See I'm crabby when you get around me
Tell me who's your daddy
Call me Mister McAffee, your poop-deck pappy
Shut your trap and get back in the backseat of the Camry
Don't sass me or I'll backhand you
Smack you with an axe-handle
Burn you with a wax candle
Slap you with a sandle
I'm trying to watch the rap channel
Can't you tell we laugh about you?
Call yourself a rapper but I gives a rat's ass about you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Why do I even bother with these Hoff-brand cats
Y'all are wombats man
I'm bout to blow this pop stand
Lyrically y'all don't compare to me in any contest
Like a stealth bomber up against a Hyundai Accent
Tall-can to a shot glass
Bong-hit to a contact
Gary Coleman versus Big Boss Man
The Loch Ness Monster up against a crawdad
Talking Sly Stallone in Rocky versus Sly Stallone in Copland
Judge Judy versus Johnny Cohcran
Oh man
Nell Carter versus Karen Carpenter topless
Better yet, Broadband
Compared to a long ass
Piece of string connecting two pop cans
It's all bad
Don't quit your job at all believe me you'll be so glad back
Hold on with both hands
It's sucks washing sauce pans
I know there's an off chance that one day hip-hop heads
Will maybe feel rappers in the top-ten that crossdress

[Chorus]

Dan the Banjo Man,"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken

You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance

Better beware, be canny and careful

Eager young lads and rogues and cads
Will offer you food and wine

Totally unprepared are you

Dan Tyminski,"Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of his name never read her his word
Two non believers walking lost in this world
Took their baby with them what a sad little girl
Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs
She'd watched the TV and sit there on the couch
While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting
Just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding
Oh what a sad little life

And like it always does the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her mom and then took his life
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad
Kisses and hugs every day!

Her first day at Sunday school
The teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of him
She said I know that man
There on that cross I don't know his name
But I know he got off

Held me close to his side
As I hid there behind our couch the night my parents died",The Little Girl,2000

Ever fond in my mem'ry and sweet in my dreams.

Oh, my dear little sister, I still see her tears.
When I had to leave home in our tender years.
And my sweet gentle mother, so dear to my heart,
It grieved me sincerely when we had to part.

Said my kind-hearted father as he took my hand:
""As you go in defence of our dear native land,
""Son, be brave but show mercy whenever you can.
""Our hearts will be with you, 'til you 'turn again.""

In my bag there's a bible to show me the way,
Through my twelfth year on earth and to Heaven some day.
I will shoulder my musket and brandish my sword,
In defence of this land and the word of the Lord.

With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

While others drink wine, leaning over a bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
Is to know that your love will forever be mine

I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
To hold you closely for just a few hours
Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
Would change all the dark clouds to the bluest of blue

I don't drink their champagne and I don't drink their wine
So if you refuse me my poor heart will pine
I'll be so lonely till the day that I die
And as long as I live dear you'll still hear me cry

I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers

Dan Wilson,"It was a modern love affair
Completely cool and casual
They hardly knew each other was there
I mean Both of them had their own getting off to do
And they had to dream about their own self 

When they were through
But the modern girl was elated 
With what the revolution gave her
And since she was liberated she could have
Everything that striked her fancy

And she fancied quite a bit
I mean if it felt good she did it
And she did it every chance she could get
With her main modern man and otherwise
And her taste wasn't limited to just modern guys
Since another modern girl showed her
That modern girls know how to hold her

And after she had her eyes opened
All her old close friends started getting closer
And new friends weren't that far away
But the modern man he just wasn't so lucky
He being shook from his usual role as the heartbreaker
He was completely battered and bewildered
When he actually started in feeling something for her

And he discovered a new emotion
When they stopped ending up together as frequently
And when he finally confronted her with the question 
""had she been bedding down with others in the periphery without him?""
And she replied ""Hell yes! ain't it funny!""
So view the modern man looking, looking, looking,like a soft Picasso
He's there with his head in his hand
Repeating to himself an epigram
""live by the scam, die by the scam.""",Soft Picasso,

How we gonna end up feeling?

We'll raise our ready hands and let go for the ride
Down into unknown lands where lovers need and hide

We got these lives for free, we don't know where they've been
We don't know where they'll go when we are through with them

How we gonna end up feeling?
What you gonna spend your free life on?

With nowhere much to go and nothing much to do
But sit up in my room and let the world unfold

Why had he waited for so long
To flee his home forever shaded, where the jaded are never wrong?

He was finally gone
His hope was left strong
That a meaning would be found
That had kept him withdrawn
His stare had caught a light

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Dan Zanes,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet

Dan Zanes,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Dan Zanes,"I went to a weekend fair
Met someone while I was there
We put flowers in our hair
And rode the wonder wheel

So begins another day
Crazy stops along the way
I think of funny things to say
And ride the wonder wheel

Going 'round and around
It takes us up and it takes us down
I love the sights and I love the sounds
Riding on the wonder wheel

I looked left and I looked right
Saw her smile and it was bright
Like the sun that kind of light
We're on the wonder wheel

Never thought I'd go so high
Thought I'd laugh until I cried
I could reach and touch the sky
I'm on the wonder wheel

Going 'round and around
It takes us up and it takes us down
I love the sights and I love the sounds
Riding on the wonder wheel

Now the sun is sinking low
Lights of Coney Island glow

Are on the wonder wheel

Got into a fight

See how the mainsail sets
Send for the Captain ashore
I want to go home, O let me go home
Please let me go home
I feel so broke up - I want to go home

Well the first mate he got drunk,
Broke up the peoples trunk
constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
please leave me alone

Ate up all my grits

On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond
Where in deep purple hues
The Highland hills we viewed
And the moon coming out in the gloaming

You take the high road and I'll take the low road…
The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring
And the sunshine and the waters are sleeping
The broken heart it kens, no second Spring again
And the world does not know how we're greeting

Dopamine, dopamine
That I'm on, that I want
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Dopamine, dopamine

See dopamine is what your brain is makin' when your feelin' happy
So, if your tryna' feel what I feel then yo get at me
And me? I get me fix from all sorts of shit
Every night with a glass of milk with some Oreo's I can dip
Fresh pot of mom's sauce, macaroni, meatballs
That smell of Sour Diesel when I open up the jar
Break it up and rollin' somethin', breakin' off a ho I'm fuckin'
Pop a little ecstasy and get that serotonin pumpin'
Goin' commando in a pair of sweats
Reruns of Sopranos up on my TV set
And that dopamine be flowin' on stage
Feel it every time that shit is goin' my way
It's chillin' with your best homies
The spittin' game and it's gettin' laid and that after sex bogie
Any time you feelin' good, it's what your brain produces
So my fans will get their fix every time they bumpin' my music

Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine
If you wanna feel it too, then all you gotta do is roll with me
And everything is how it's suppose to be
And that's the shit that I'm on, that's the shit that I want
Wither I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

That bamma weed you smokin', ain't fuckin' with the OG
I hit it till I'm coughing, I hit it often
I'm like a Power Ranger the way I'm mighty morphing
Into a rocket ship, that's taking off into space as I get lost
Thanks to stimulating endorphins, brings me closer to the coffin
Walk on the edge, cuz' I'm on the ledge
Wake up, when they go to bed
Got these cowards runnin' a bounty hunter like a Boba Fett
Life is like a drug, born addicted like crack babies
Tryin' ta' get that fix, you gonna hurt your back, like the Bag Lady
Goodbye dude, I expose these niggas', I got to
These niggas' heads bigger than yakoo, it's not cool
Lyrical mournings, gettin' us gory as biblical stories, you ignoren' the allegories
Tryin' to feel good; it's Aleister Crowley
Rush of that adrenaline is my medicine
My fuel is my kerosene
You ever live the life of a heretic?
That, dopamine, from the smoke the coke the lean
Is temporary when your third eye ain't opening

I'm just tryna' get my fix

Bitch on my lap, gyratin'
Loud so loud, my lungs vibratin'
High as a bitch I'm up skyscappin'
Annihilatin' some kind of [?]
That's the feelin' I feel when I am creatin'
And the fire's escapin', though your fire escape em'
Until I lie in your basement
Arise in the pavement just to arrive from inside of a spaceship
That fix, I'm suppose to dream
I chase Hennessey with dopamine
This is dope, I mean, I ain't sober
Promethazine in my soda, I'm suppose ta lean
My momma cookin'? Encore
The family members I die for
The two beautiful kids I stay alive for
Plus Hip-Hop makes me feel alive more

Wither I get it from hittin' pussy or rippin' a bong
I'm just tryna' get my fix
Let me get that dopamine, baby give me that dopamine

Let me put you down, with some realness
You feelin' loud with me and Webby, rockin on that trill shit
Feelin' bliss, like its that fattest joint you ever hit
Higher than you've ever been, of course you know you're feelin' this
With that fellin' that you get when you open up your
Bag of weed waiting for the first hit anxiously
With the rush; when the Lakers beat the Celtics
The smile on your face when the joint lit, and ya smelt it
We the vibe at the party, when that shits about to turn up
We the ""hell ya"", ya thinkin' when the dabs about to burn up
The fist pump, bitch I'm number one, I'm the winna' by the
Toast at the table when we celebrate our [?]
Roar of the crowd when ya see something amazing
Where the thrill of victory, with the felling of elation
It's a presentation and we hope you see
You're in need of that dopamine

Yeah, Truth spit game, murda'
Shoulda' been cased on it
Causing panic, now the living shoes laced on it
Haters on dick, look like they want to face on it
Money, long slates, givin' a open chase on it
I'm fully sober, my fix is chicks and change
And ride, n' lookin' amazing, n' something so strange
I hit the hood, just to kick it with homies
No, they need it for support, everyone that promote it
I best to dodge the phoney, cuz' I don't understand them
And I ain't tryn'
I'm the truth and I don't fuck with that [mind?], stay from [?]
Hit the studio to blackout, maybe try gettin' packed out
Just like somebody wanted this as soon as I blow it back out
I might just give a laugh as I proceed to knock a track out
And burned up the speakers in trunk tryna' act out

Get [tightest?] in them [?], [?] me a drink, you bout to turn up

Learned how to master my craft and be a trendsetter
Learned how to get knocked down
Learned how to get back up
I learned how to rock these crowds
Learned to accept that what’s...

And I be roasting motherfuckers
Rest In Peace Patrice O'Neil
Roll up another blunt
Now how that Diesel feel?
Got me swerving man
Who the fuck gave me the wheel?
Who the fuck gave me these pills?
Now I'm off in another dimension
In need of an intervention
Cause these drugs are too fucking expensive
But I'm feeling terrific dude
Banging these broads with no fucking protection
Yeah, what were you saying babe?
I wasn't paying any fucking attention
Rumbling engine, rolling up in my Camaro and cruise
Living it like a pirate man
Always got me a barrel of booze
Skipping the food
Go right for the tiramisu
Sippin' and rippin' the bubbler
Puffing until I can barely move
Lay back and then stare at the moon, ooh
Bippidy bobbidy boo
Webby be rippin' it properly too
Hipping and hopping and rambling shit
Cause these pills I've been popping have got me confused
Screwed up, burn it down
Light it up, pass it around

Sticky green, sticky green
With orange hairs, like Pete and Pete
Flowing double time when I freak the beat
Holding up mine when I hit the street
Burn so much, I be high for weeks
Spit it so dirty, I need new sheets
My grinder's full, and I ain't talkin turkey, cheese
I'm talking AK47, Purple Kush and Sour D
Put it in the bowl, I'll get a dutchie rolled
Sprinkle some keef on it, and then away we go
Get in the flow, lighting up heady to dro
Partying on, got that confetti to throw
Killing the spot from the moment
That Webby'll step in the door
Hit some shit, got my pencil gripped

Used to the enemy shooting me down
But truthfully how
Could you try to stop me when truth can be found?

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you!

Dana Bryant,"Did I ever tell you about the man who changed my life?
The one I thought, oh. Lord, when I saw him walkin' back in that bar, all tall and
lean with them broad shoulders, sweet lips, I knew that I had died and gone to
Chocolate Heaven

He had a real deep voice, white pearly teeth, his shoe was always shiny.
Long slender fingers manicured perfectly.
The man wore 800-dollar Italian suit, straight from, I dunno, what would they call it,
Milan or Rome or someplace like that?

I knew it wasn't local. 
I said, I got to get next to that.
I haven't seen him in a long time. 
The man was so fine, he could get any good girl into trouble
Can you guess what his name was?
Well
'The Jackal'
'The Jackal'
Say. 
'The Jackal' 

He was fat back cat cool like a Friday afternoon martini, chillin' at a quarter after 5.
Twist of lime, Coke on the side.
The brother loved the high life. 
Had a Ph.D. in street stride.
They called him 'The Jackal'.

He was big Mack daddy super black stylin' a diamonds in the back Cadillac.
Fur-lined boards, white wall wheels, cruise control, built for speed, chrome on evray-thang.
And stereophonic speakers, though he really didn't need them.
When they called him
'The Jackal'.
Say. 
'The Jackal'.

Fly boy was in the buttermilk, hard, livin' fast, livin' large, 6 foot 4 and not an ounce of fat!
When women asked, 'is you a Cat?' He said 'I did more that that.
I'm the firmest of the firm
And in case you, hadn't known, they call me 'The Jackal'.

Served the 18-year bid First Reicker's Island then they hid him in the state
penitentiary. Said the charge was Grand Larceny.
That was 1975, and today, if he's still alive, he'd be living in the park.
Hm. The brother whose claim to fame was that they called him 'The Jackal'.

Dana Dane,"Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!""
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, ""Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits""
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said ""Step-dad, may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
""We can and you can't"" is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""

[Chorus]
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

Well I shrugged, I hissed, ""They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish""
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Hurb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle all the rest""
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was tough and on my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet there was argyle socks
And a fresh pair of Ballys from the Bally shop
I showed him my hat and don't you know
With a snap the hat became a Kangol
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a Volvo
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, ""One more thing before you leave
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self""

[Chorus]

I jumped in the Volvo, went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage the people were hyped
The princess was staring in disbelief
Reflected from her eyes were my gold teeth
She waved her hands like 'Hello! Hi!'
Then gave another gesture like 'Come here, guy'
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
Fists were swingin' from the hard rocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Ballys on one of those steps
For the Volvo I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess scream out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!""

[Chorus]

I was almost home when my luck ran out
And there went my suit, my Kangol and clothes
My fresh Volvo also went too
And there was no denyin' that my night was through
The one Bally shoe the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away still feelin' pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next morning when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers and me old housecoat
Went into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin' ""Wasn't that you?! Nah, it couldn't be""
They kept askin' me as I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock on the door
""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""The princess"", this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin' for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin' on shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
Sayin' ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, chief""
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""
Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your Kangol and slick silk suit?""
I put on the shoe, there came a flash of light
And I was tough in the gear from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the Volvo
Said to my family, ""I've got to go""
We drove up the avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me I heard my family cry

Hello, I'd like to see Dr. Slumber, please
[ doctor's assistant ]
Ah - do you have an appointment, sir?
[ Dane ]
No, I don't
But tell the Doctor it's urgent that I see her
[ doctor's assistant ]
Well - just one moment
Dr. Slumber?
Dr. Slumber, there's a young man out here named -
Excuse me, what is your name?

Oh, tell her it's Dana Dane

Hhhh... D-D-Dana D-D-DANE?!
OH NO!
OH, YOU CAN COME RIGHT IN!
COME RIGHT IN, RIGHT NOW!
COME ON IN...!
[ Dane ]
Thank you, thank you

Well, I walked into the office, what did I see?
A well-shaped body with the back to me
Sittin in her chair with an all-white gown
Said said (Dana Dane, won't you please lay down?)
She said that she wouldn't reveal her face
Till my hour was up and I was on my way
Now we got to the matter of why I came there
I said, ""Doc, I keep havin these crazy nightmares""

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)

She said, ""Relax yourself, won't you tell me one
So I can diagnose and see what must be done""
I laid back my head, start to inhale
Caught my breath, and then I said, ""Well -
Bright one morning I was late for class
Had a fresh pair of frames with Gucci on the glass
Girls they was hawking, dudes they was talkin
Saw the doggy-dogg female, I kept on walkin
She was on it hard, there was no denyin
Shoulda seen what this female was tryin
Grabbin on my shirt, tuggin on my slacks
Pullin on my zipper board, I had to hold her back
Word up, Doc, on the ultimate
Now if I never saw a creature, this girl was it
I kept on walkin, had to leave this place
But she was all up on me, breathin in my face
You may think I'm lyin though it's just a dream
This girl had the baddest breath I'd ever seen
I couldn't think straight, thought I was doomed
Heard a bling-bling-bling, it was time for homeroom
I stepped real quick, she tried to play it sassy
She almost ran me down, this nasty fatnastee
Dipped to the stairs, running blind
Get to my homeroom, ran through my mind
Got to the 4th floor, standin in the door
Girlies watchin me walk down the corridor
The guys they were jealous and gettin mad
And all the girlies wishin they had the class I had
Got to my classroom, expect to see the teacher
Who did I see? That ugly black creature
Paused for a minute standin in the door
Then I broke out when the girlie went raw
Word em up, Doc, couldn't stand the smell
Heard of 3D? Well, she was fat as hell
I ran out the school, I didn't look back
I tell you, Dr. Slumber, this girl was wack
And that's about the time when I awoke
And I smelled that awful breath that almost made me choke
Now tell me, Dr. Slumber, how can it be?
That this dream somehow became reality?
I can't go to sleep, cause I'm so damn scared
Cause I keep havin these crazy nightmares""

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)

She said, ""Listen, Dana Dane, I think I have the cure
But I have to hear one more before I'll be sure""
I laid back my head, tried to concentrate
Then I told her the nightmare 'bout the blind date
Had a blind date with this girl named Anita
The Fever's the place I'm supposed to meet her
Saw the def body with the vicious butt
How did I know she was a marvelous mutt
This lady I met was as ugly as hell
Couldn't go in the jam with this female
I was coughin hard, she started to braggin
Couldn't let them know I was here with this dragon
Grabbed her hand, dipped to Harlem World
But I left this ugly lady for another girl
Now this other female, her name was Denise
Couldn't get no rapture, there followed the beast
Everywhere I turn, everywhere I look
There was Anita the beast, she could not be shook
I dipped, I dived, I ran, I thrived
But there was no place that I could hide
Cause she was sniffin me out like a hungry blood hound
Her tail in the air, her nose to the ground
Only thing left for me to do
Was to set her up with this other dude
Now this other dude, he was real upset
Cause this ugly female he didn't want to check
He started actin wild, even called me a faggot
What could I do, he had a .22 automatic
I dipped into the crowd, made my way to the door
Bumped into this object and I hit the floor
When I looked up, what did I see?
I saw Anita the Beast lookin down at me
I couldn't try to play it, couldn't try to pretend
Like the AFTCA I had to take the dog in

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)

Now I pleaded, ""Dr. Slumber, I just can't bare
To have another one of these crazy nightmares""
Then all of a sudden she turned around
And starin at me with that all-white gown
With a Catholic smile, showin all her teeth
Was that ugly female, Anita the Beast...

[ INTRO ]
Full-circle, 360 degrees Dane
My style will live forever, my fame will be maintained
Now some can't feel this, and some feel can't that
But all can feel a track that's produced by Battlecat
So gather round and listen to my non-fiction
The picture will come clearer than a Sony television
This ain't about dissin, this is all fact
Women on my nuts cause my vocals makin cash

[ CHORUS ]
	(The Rapper Dana Dane, what time is it?)
	She's on the record's jock, she doesn't love me
	(The Great Dana Dane, what time is it?)
	She's just stressin my fame and my money

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm bustin this one for Bridget, the hoe
I met at the Emmaco pumpin the petrol into her five point o
I wanted her because she looked like Janet Jackson
Caramel complexion, sportin sexy fashion
""Hello, how you're doin?"" I said, ""they call me Dane""
""I could learn to love your flavor, hon, hey, what's your name?""
She had nothin for me, totally ignored me
High-sided, took it like she never saw me - cool
So I tried again: ""What up! How you're feelin?""
Was a hot and humid day, but I felt a cold chill
I figured, let me step before I have to diss her
That's when I overheard her girlfriend try to whisper
(Oh, I know him from somehwere - oh, that's Dana Dane!
I saw him last week, he performed on _Soul Train_)
Now honey flipped the script like Sybill
""You're not the Rapper Dana Dane with fame, is you?
Ooh, I like your records, ooh, you're the man
Ooh, you're so fine, I'm your number one fan""
Now she knows that I'm the Dane, all of a sudden I'm accepted
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Next I peeped this honey at the bar scopin the Dane hard
Loud, money proud, yo, I knew her hoe card
Native New Yorker, Brooklyn fast-talker
Big jewelry-sporter, sippin Johnny Walker
She bought me this drink, she's flashin her cash
She passin me hints like she want to give me the ass
I avoided her because I knew her man Pedro
She said (Dana, fuck him, let's talk about your stage show!)
You ??? well, there ain't no brother brother
Hands on my pants, woulda yoked it if I let her
She was gettin tippsy, dancin like a gypsy
Seen her before, but never knew she was this frisky
Tried to break lips, but she wasn't tryin to have it
Playin me close like ??? metal to a magnet
Then she shouted: ""Dane, I can't wait to get you naked!""
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now last but not least, let me tell you 'bout Judy
Baaya with the tattas, booya with the booty
A cutie with a juicy fat coochie
Felt it was my duty to make her sing like Suzy
??? 'Cha-ya-ya-ya...' - recall the flavor?
>From the first album that the Dane ever gave ya
Anyway, no more delay, she was a hard nut to crack
Kicked the rap like a mack, but she wouldn't give me jack
But still she's in my grill everytime that she sees me
Askin (When you're comin with that new fat release?)
Well, I seen her 'bout a weak about, I told her 'bout a week or so
""Wouldn't you like to be in Dana Dane's video?""
Now she started clickin, dissed her in addition
Comin to my crib for the private audition
Again the same game, just a different scenario
Ridin on my nuts to play a part in my video
Must be the music
That's makin her flip
Must be the music
Must be the music

Dana Dane,"Bedie Boo 
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Now Bedie was this girl I graduated from high school with
You know, the type of girl that everybody is real cool with
She didn't smoke or drink, in fact she never ever cursed
She wore the rosary beeds and kept a Bible in her purse
Well, one day she was aligned waiting to get in a night club
Some major group was playing, and everybody was real hyped up
Now Bedie wasn't assort to go to parties of that type
And I couldn't help but wonder why she had came here tonight
Now I didn't ask any questions, I went inside and got a drink
Someone tapped me on my shoulder (Hm, who could it be?) Now let me think
I looked around, and there was Bedie, all dressed up in lace and leather
Boy, I must admit, she really had her act together

Bedie Boo 
Used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while
Until it gets around
Oh-oh-oh Bedie Boo

(Hello, remember me?) I said, ""Oh yes, of course I do
You're the girl from science class that I used to sit next to""
She started givin hints like she wanted me to hit it
(Was you with it?) Well, you know.. (Yo, was you with it?) Yeah, I was with it!
I led her to this room, the door said 'V.I.P.'
Only for people with juice, and of course that meant me
I said, ""Gosh, how you changed, Bedie, you sure look, different""
(But you said she was religious) I can see now that she isn't
She got on her knees and started reachin for my zipper
I sang this little song right before, you know, I did her

Bedie Boo 
You used to be so cute
Now you're kinda loose
Yeah, I know the scoop
About you Bedie now
You're livin kinda foul
Been skeezin for a while

Dana Dane,"Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!""
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, ""Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits""
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said ""Step-dad, may I?""
