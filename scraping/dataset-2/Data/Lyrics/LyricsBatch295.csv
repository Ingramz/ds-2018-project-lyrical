Gene McDonald,"I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in
And let a little light from Heaven fills my soul
He bathed my heart in love, and He wrote my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole

(Now let )
Us have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us)
Tell Him all about our troubles
(He will)
Hear our fainted cry
(He will)
Answer by and by

(When you)
Feel a little prayer wheel turning
(And you)
Will know a little fire is burnin'
(You will)
Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

I may have doubts and fears, my eye be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend Who watches day and night
I go to him in prayer, He knows my every care
And just a little talk with my Jesus make it right

(Now let us)
Have a little talk with Jesus
(Let us)
Tell Him all about our troubles
(He will)
Hear our fainted cry

Feel a little prayer wheel turning

Gene McDonald,"O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!",How Great Thou Art,2011
Gene McDonald,"If you could see what I once was
If you could go with me
Back to where I started from
Then I know you would see
A miracle of love that took me in its sweet embrace
And made me what I am today
Just an old sinner saved by grace.
I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place
Now I live and breathe in freedom with each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven
Back with the living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace
How could I boast of anything I've ever seen or done?
How could I dare to claim as mine the vict'ries God has won?
Where would I be had God not brought me gently to this place?
I'm here to say I'm nothing but a sinner saved by grace
I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place
Now I live and breathe in freedom with each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven
Back with the living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace",Sinner Saved by Grace,2017

Gene Miller,"In a perfect world
One we've never known
We would never need
To face the world alone
They can have their world
We'll create our own
I may not be brave or strong or smart
But somewhere in my secret heart

I know love will find a way, anywhere I go
I'm home if you are there beside me
Like dark, turning into day
Somehow we'll come through
Now that I've found you
Love will find a way

I was so afraid
Now I realize
Love is never wrong
And so it never dies
There's a perfect world
Shining in your eyes
And if only they could feel it too
The happiness I feel with you

They'd know love will find a way

Gene Mumford,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,

But when you're crying you bring on the rain,

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When You're Smiling,2000

We know that your spirit is there

It looks so good to see us together
But I had to look after dad
Oh mama, when I passed by your coffin
I didn't want to remember you dead

They all gathered 'round, I stared at their faces
All heads were bowed mighty low
But that was one time we all had to face it
It hurt us so bad you know

Just a few of my favorite lies . . .

Lately I don't even miss her
Yes it's true, out of sight and out of mind
All my love, yesterday, it has faded away
I'd be lonely if I could find the time
Helped her open the door when she left me
All I said was good luck and goodbye
Now at last I am free like I've wanted to be
These are a few of my favorite lies

I'm surprised I'm still talking about her
For I can stop any time, and I will
But if you feel like asking me questions
Well I have more lies I'm dying to tell

To change her rags to silk and lace

Gene Pitney,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live",On the Street Where You Live,1997

If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty

My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything

So open your arms and you'll open the door
To ev'ry treasure that I'm hopin' for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine ever more

Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?

I have just lost my mind
So Mr World look after that girl
The one that I just left behind at 24 Sycamor

Where did my baby go?
Who's gonna mend my rainbow?
Who's gonna separate all the swimming around,
Back there on the ground
Flowing right under the gate of 24 Sycamor
Where did my baby go?

Windows black, watched me crying and they said
It's all over, you have lost her
Why don't you run away?
What could I say? I said,

Where's the hand that I used to hold?
Once so warm but tonight so cold
Now she's gone we both must share the pain
She gone

My life is done, it's ended
Just one more thing to
I'll take a last look and then close the book
On someone that I once knew at 24 Sycamor

Where did my baby go?
Where's the hand that I used to hold?
Once so warm but tonight so cold
Now she's gone we both must share the pain

There's a story that the padre tells
Of a gay senor and senorita

To be married early in the spring
But their folks had just made one condition
That the mission bells had to ring

And hadn't sounded for a long long time
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime

They will chime for you in all it's glory

pretending that I'm someone else?

Out of the womb ruthless, deliver with no toola
Rougher than loofas, clueless and ruthless considered nuisance
Barren and fruitless, no power, the cup juiceless

A sin higher, make profit like Jeremiah
Turn the mercury to gold to extract worth
And my circumference trying to tell me it's a flat Earth

Ballad of the bullet, immaculate conception
And the shitty slums seeking galaxy connections
Trying to follow God, hollow like a faulty log

Hyper-vigilant and militant, en garde
Unscathed, slaves free while they unchained

Competing with me is dumb, seed it deep inside the trunk

When I push up on a fool, he's stuck on freeze mode
That ain't a full quip, riding on the Jean-Paul
I ain't got no attitude, I just got a mean soul
Everybody else telling me I needed to grow
Shut your pharmaceutical ass up, and put that weed in the bowl
Got some cancer cells to kill, now the answer from hell
So pass the bill fast, 'cause I over pressurize my master seal
Don't over glamorize a man to kill

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2006
Gene Sullivan,"[Chorus]
When my blue moon turns to gold again
When the rainbow turns the clouds away
When my blue moon turns to gold again
You'll be back in my arms to stay

Memories that linger in my heart
Memories that make my heart grow cold
But someday they'll live again sweetheart
And my blue moon again will turn to gold

The lips that used to thrill me so
Your kisses were meant for only me
In my dreams they live again sweetheart
But my blue moon is just a memory

The castles we used to build together
Were the sweetest stories ever told
Maybe we will live them all again
And my blue moon again will turn to gold",When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again,1990

So she left me for a stranger I've been told
Big diamond, big blue diamonds now she'd trade them

Before I'd let this thing happen to me

Gene Taylor,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over

Recorded by Gene Vincent on Capitol Records 1958
 Song written in 1957 by Bob Kelly BMI

I've got a bone to pick with this world,
I'm not very handsome, I can't find a girl.
I ask the aid of the whole Universe.
I'm not very happy, it could be worse.

Somebody Help Me----eeee.
Somebody Help Me----eeee.
Somebody Please, Somebody Please Help Me---eeee.

I'm in luck now that I've found,
the birds and the bees are helping me round.
The birds are singin' their songs of cheer,
Love will escape me, I fear.

 =======SOLO======
Moon is a glitter from up above,
but I've yet to find me someone to love,
the breeze keeps whispering to my ear,
lonesome Baby without you here.

Stars are twinklin in the sky,
finally caught this little girls eye.
I've stopped roamin this country over,
Luck has found me, I've got a four leaf clover.

Gene Vincent,"Willie Nelson's Original Lyrics

Man, you've got to a-accen-tuate
The positive, eliminate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-Between

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale Noah in the ark
What did they do
Just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said you've got to accentuate
The positive, eliminate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mister In-Between

And latch on to the affirmative

There's so much I still have to say
Sky rips open, and I hold my heart in my hand
Like a soldier on his very last day
Cried myself to sleep that night, and I listened
As I heard the angels sing
Sha la la la Sha la la la, I'm going home.
Sha la la la Sha la la la, I'm going home.
Something inside makes me scream
How could God take you from a little boy
He'll be alright, he's by my side
He's no little boy, he's my pride and joy
Sha la la la Sha la la la, I'm going home.
Sha la la la Sha la la la, I'm going home.
Summer on the radio and the phone rings
And it was Jeanette
She said boy we had to let her go
I begged her no, no not yet
You left six of us to fend for ourselves
I guess it's part of someone's master plan
I see you laughing, you're my best friend
You're the light of the lamb, and I cried
as the angels sing
Sha la la la Sha la la la, I'm going home.

Made me a slave to my wand'ring ways

And just before the dawn was breaking

I saw you had an eye for things that shine

In a lasting kind of way
Somewhere between forever and right now
Is where I'll always stay
'Cause when she sings her songs of love
I see myself between her ever line
And her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind

Nobody seems to understand how any man can
Wear a smile all day
They ask me who was on the phone 'cause guys
Never talk to wives that way
She's got a way of sayin' things just when
I need a thought to make it rhyme
And her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind

Like, honey, I love you
And its it already seven
Just sayin' that she needs me
Takes me mighty close to Heaven
And she'll hug and chase me off to work
With a song of love that most men never find

Her body couldn't drive my love for you out of my sight
Her kisses weren't enough to make me wanna spend the night

And realized our dreams could never be

No one will ever know how much I'm pineing
Each time the past comes back to haunt me so
No one will ever see the tears I'm hiding
You've hurt me but no one will ever know

Of the things you never say

I had my size and I hit the road to freedom

To see my momma cause she must've cried for hours
I still hear her saying Gary
Get your guitar and pick The Wildwood Flower

Now Dallas it was big 
And hard to find a job and so I didn't
It was easier to hitch a ride to Houston
And it was more like living
Now I've been down every road
And I've stood on every porch where they were giving
And if they had an hour or a dime
I would pick The Wildwood Flower

It's hard to turn around
And look back down the roads that I have travelled
Cause like a neverending ball of twine
My dreams have come unravelled
And now as evening lays its shawl
Across the shoulders of my life I have defined
I couldn't tie my life together

If it wasn't so, then why, oh, why does it keep draggin' me?

I was expecting to see that same dang doe tears bounce

Every eye is on her
She is a walking, talking, little miss confident

Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
She's got my buddies in the palm of her hand
And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man

How did she go from stone cold to red hot, open tonight
All this honey she is pourin', she must have kept bottled all the time
'Cause heaven knows that I can't believe, that little devil's my used to be
This might be fair play, boys but she ain't playin' right

To party hardy, wild thing, overnight

Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman

I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four
I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of bone
Yeah I've been settlin' alone diggin' up bones

Then I went to the jewelery and I found our wedding rings
I've put mine on my finger and I gave yours a flame
I crossed this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones
Exhuming things that better left alone
I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones

And I went to the closet and I found some things in there
Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah tonight I'm settlin' alone diggin' up bones

I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones

Lay out your favorite gown all trimmed with lace
It may not cross your mind to wonder how things are without you
But if it ever does I saved your place

I hold on to how you used to touch me
When I close my eyes I see your face
It breaks my heart that someone else could make you feel more wanted
But if he lets you down I saved your place

There may come a time when this is all just some old memory
But time's not movin' very fast these days
With all you've got you may not need a fool who really loves you
But if you ever do I saved your place

Got to keep these big wheels hummin' their song

In a fountain of knowledge I'm only a drop

It's free for the listening 'cause I paid the price

So take it from me
Don't leave her alone too many nights
Take it from me
Don't be the reason she cries
At first she'll be lonely and cry for you only
And then for the lovin' she needs
She'll find somebody new
Whose sure to take her from you
As sure as you took her from me

You might say I'm crazy to give you advice
But I've already lost her, I can't lose her twice

Gene Watson,"They say that once the new wears off
The test of love begins
When the spark that lit the fire won't burn
As bright as it once did
If lovers lose that old desire
Hearts can break in two
The hard work starts when it ain't nothin' new

Chorus
It ain't nothin' new but after all this time
This love of ours still hasn't lost its shine
It's makin' up when we've been mad that I look forward to
Even though it ain't nothin' new

Now love don't come as easy as once it did and so
Sometimes we seem to say the things that cut and hurt the most
But then we pull together and somehow see it through
That's what it takes when it ain't nothin' new

This old world is dark around me
'Cause my sweet love ain't around

With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)

You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you

Marshall!

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
Come on! Now

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here

Rhythm and drums and the booming track

How children live in harmony

But... I will demand

Even on the floor and do not count 

Come to the stairs to somewhere in the sky 
Show me a star and don't ask me why 
Show me the way to a place of love 
Show me all the way to the base of love 
The base of love. The base of love
The base of love. The base of love

Do that kiss and I and G.

Cando, Dog (float on)

Who's that girl on the rome castin nude shadow
In the midnite hour
Red carpets, nothing less, boy we walked on
I wouldn't have it
It's tragic
How we make em disappear like magic
King Lu with a touch like midas
And all the kiss honeys, dem stay beside us
Girls on the left, swimmin, women on the right
Cruisin the house and ya don't want to fight
And any way it rocks, like blocks on your corner
The new world order
Slaughter
Recognize quoted
You demoted, early dismissal
That issue, soft like ass tissue
So now every interview
Music's behind me livin in a world made of money, honey
Take the bitter with the sweet
Take the bitter with the sweet

Come with me baby, to love land

Cause 1, 2, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock rock
You'll be hearin me comin round your block
Tappin the older counts
Somedays it's so thick
I can't see through the fog
I feel like digital, fightin analogue
Just another page
In the rage
Of the teenage
These tricks ain't for kids
With dresses that fit like a condom
Help me, somebody help me
Oh, how the mighty have fallin
Now you can hear your mamma callin
When the DJ display
People get down
Girls with the bodies
And my eyesight on the dance floor
It's the best type of party
Cause the beat don't stop until the break of dawn
For the people in the place that want to get their groove on
DJ's playin tracks that attract your ass crack to the dance floor

Luv hooked up the beat
To make em jump like House Of Pain

So deep, you blink, you missed it

You got the (?) askin (?)
And tonite's the night, ain't nothin phasin me
Cause on the d-low, my crews just security
Stop
Where I be is where your want to, be
Cause a I can see behind that jealousy personna
It's time to celebrate, we met the quota
We got more guests than Rolanda
Or Oprah, Geraldo, or Ricky Lake put together
It doesn't matter what weather
We rain on your parade
Then clean up like cascade
Check it, yo, we got it made in the shade

Chorus
He is my hero, my dashing darling
He is my caesar, dashing darling.
I've had no rest from forebodings
Since he went far away my darling.

Every day I am constantly sad
Weeping bitterly and shedding tears
Because our lively lad has left us
And no news from him is heard alas.

The cuckoo sings not pleasantly at noon
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-filled woods,
Nor summer morning in misty glen
Since he went away from me, my lively boy.

Noble, proud young horseman
Warrior unsaddened, of most pleasant countenace
A swift-moving hand, quick in a fight,
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.

Let a strain be played on musical harps
And let many quarts be filled
With high spirit without fault or mist
For life and health to toast my lion.

Dashing darling for a while under sorrow
And all ireland under black cloaks
Rest or pleasure I did not get
Since he went far away my dashing darling.

For a while I was a gentle maiden
And now a spent worn-out widow
My spouse ploughing the waves strongly
Over the hills and far away.

Next night you're not
It always leaves me searching for a little

Tenderness, tenderness, tenderness, where is the tenderness

Whistling in the graveyard
Calling up your girlfriend
Just trying to make her understand
You're squeezing the telephone like it was her hand
No question
So many questions
She's going to catch you out boy
It all seems so underhand
Now she's the only thing that ever made you feel like a man, man
Madman madman

Where is the tenderness, the tenderness
Where is the tenderness, the tenderness, where is it

I held your hands
Rings but none on that finger
We danced and danced
But I was scared to go much further with it
Just half a chance
Make sure that one night you're here but
Next night you're not
It always leaves me searching for a little

Tenderness, tenderness, tenderness, tenderness

""Cause it's kind of heavier than lead
And kind a dreader than dreader than dread there you know

You call me, I'm not at home, when you're alone
Sleeping in the middle of our big bed
Cuddled with you, where I should be
Try to go to sleep, you want love instead

With you tonight there's no escaping
Love's for giving, not just taking
In the middle of our big bed

Where could I be, wish you were with me,
Visions of you, rolling in our big bed
Where would I go, now that I know
What you have toy about your lover man

You will find that I'm alright now
Dreaming of you with all your clothes on
In the middle of our big bed

Emotions come like a change in the weather
But you must keep a promise to the other
That there's nothing to hide
Watch de ride

Take me inside, closing my eyes, vision of you
Taking off the covers of our big bed
Never alone, mymmind is my home
Thinking of my lover in her big bed

Instead of feeling down and blue then

Generation Unleashed,"When the day is done
And there's no one else around
While I'm lying here in bed
You're in my heart, You're in my head
You're all I need, You're all I need
There are a million voices
Calling out my name
But You're the One I want to hear
So make the others disappear

You are all I need when I'm surrounded
You are all I need if I'm by myself
You fill me when I'm empty
There is nothing else
You're all I need

When the morning comes
And Your mercy is renewed
There's a fire in my bones
I'm not afraid to go alone
You're all I need
You're all I need
The sun on my face
I hear You whisper loud
You're still the God that opens seas
Every flower, even me
You're all I need
You're all I need

I'm drawn to everything that You do
Nothing compares with You",All That I Need,2008
