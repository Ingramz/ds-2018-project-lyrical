Blue Raspberry,"It's a mystery inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinking 'bout so many ways
Of how to conquer these rainy days

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

The war is on, yo
On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Mack's milk, blast the year
That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back
Niggas want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops living gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
The fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind
Sipping on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Raining) Divine
Waiting on these royalties takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay these
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Meat heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now talk shit nigga, what??

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggas to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to 1010 WINS, Wu blends
Now I'm steering you to truth, buckle up
Now who's a legend?

It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane, insane

Word up dun
Peace to Philly, VA, these days
Word up y'all, word up
The sun moon and stars fly cars, word up y'all

No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life, street life
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know, someone I don't know
Rainy Dayz, getting through those rainy dayz
I lost him to the street life, the street life, whoa",Rainy Dayz,1995
Blue Ribbon Boys,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1992
Blue Riddim Band,"I've been crying
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (come see about me)
See about you baby (come see about me)
You know I'm so lonely (come see about me)
I love you only (come see about me)
See about your baby (come see about me)

Blue Rodeo,"Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste,
Like french cigarettes.
And these colored drinks
That you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget.

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall.
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same.
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own.

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool.

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free.
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears.

Yeah, we fight too much,
How'd we ever get so messed up?

In double-talk and lies
There's a stranger looking back
When I look in your eyes.

I just want to find a heart like mine
I just want to find a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine.

You call me a fool, 'cause I still feel the same.
You say that your love has changed,
Ah! Here we go again
Close your eyes tell me what do you see
Do you still remember me?
Like some Mexican diplomat
After the fact
Air-brushed from history
Swept under the mat.

I just want to find a heart like mine
I just want to find a heart like mine
A heart like mine, a heart like mine.

And as I walk out the door
I step into a dream.
The world's quiet and I feel free,
But things are never what they seem
But then I hear you call
And warn myself, now don't go back
But slow motion attacks

Blue Rodeo,"Here on the outskirts of life
Dreams seldom come true
Flippin' through photographs emotional holographs
Cutouts of all the figures you might've been
Reflections of a life that you once lived

As the evening descends
Your conscious of every breath
And every moment is a crisis, I guess
Starin' out the windows of your hotel room
You lit one too many fires underneath that spoon
Well I guess you deserve the chosen few
Real life, just out of view

Well that's just here,
On the outskirts
Yea, that's here,
On the outskirts of your life

And there's a picture we've all seen
It was taken in the lobby of the L.A. Ambassador Hotel
It's the silhouette of a man in another's arms
So turn off your TVs, and let that train go home
'Cause everyone warned you that California
Wasn't goin' to be the end
California wasn't gonna be the end.

And tell me where can you hide when
The whole world is ugly and strange
Yea tell me where you gonna turn when
This whole world knows your name
And these four walls are screamin'
And all your friends were so deceiving
Yea you forgot the lines of a part you rehearsed so well
Lyin' awake in the Brazilian Court Hotel

On the outskirts

On the outskirts,
Of your life",Outskirts,1987
Blue Rodeo,"Leaning over the piranha pool
You just wave your magic wand
Dangling your fingertips
Into the world of the just beyond.
Sitting ever so quietly
In your private dining room
Guiding the waves of destiny
Into the face of oblivion.

So you'd rather been an opera star
At the turn of the century.
Well you never asked for this miracle trip
A genius in the military
You're sincerely surprised with your own success
Hanging out with the judges and the corporate heads
You never anticipate the final toll
Still shining all your medals
For the final curtain call.

You're always talking 'bout the here and after
But it don't make much sense to me
Still for all the men that you condemn
Well I hope there's some kind of heaven
And there's got to be some kind of hell for you

With a girl in room five.

Blue Rodeo,"As the seconds are ticking in the corner of her eye
Nothing comes as fast as a glib reply
Like a kid who's tired of a busted old toy
The pleasure's worn thin so she makes a little extra noise

So the dime store greaser and the blond Mona Lisa
Twist on smiles just to please each other
Until one of them finds that someone new
Well the other one is just going to have to do

Sometimes you get what you want
So be careful what you ask for
Remember what you got
Tossing her pennies in the wishing well
Mona Lisa reaches over for the sleeping pills

Like a jerk that butts into the front of the line
She's got her reasons and he don't mind
Absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder
He's hoping her vacation lasts a little bit longer

And they both have their tickets for the promised land

Trading one hypnotic state for another

It's like a car burning on the side of the road

Well someone got torched for not doing what they're told

It's like yesterday's news is the same again
And again, and again.....

Again and again

The things you said we wanted together

I don't wonder what went wrong
But I wish your memory would leave me alone
Now and forever

I sit alone in this empty house
And your voice just like a ghost
It comes to me
Chill passes through me
I packed your clothes and photographs
Sent your little treasures back to where you're living

Said you were forgetting them all

And maybe then we'd get somewhere we'd never been before

Walk the streets in New Orleans, shirt soaked to my skin
Through the mess of yesterday's parade.
Thousand times a day I think of calling you again
Come to my senses instead.
And every time we walk away we lose a little time
Pretending to each other now that everything is fine.
I know whatever lies I use to get myself to sleep
I wake up to the promises I know we couldn't keep.

Maybe I could look away back to where we used to be,
One more time I wish I could.

Behind the locked door

Give back to the native
Their treaty land
What you preach you preach for others
Why don't you practice that first hand

Into my hazy soul

Who makes the flowers bloom
On the tenement windowsill

In a hotel room
A TV glows
And songs are exchanged
Drunkenly chasing the ghost
Of eternity
There's a drunk on the sidewalk
Trying to look unconcerned
And the dead eyed motel blonds
Wait in line for their turn

Who laughs
When all the other dogs snarl

And with this buzz of electricity
Still ringing in my ears

You could barely hide the satisfaction on your face
Time takes another day
Changes you in subtle ways
Lifts you up, then slowly lets you go

Sitting there across the room your smile looks like a threat
Living underneath the heel of what you might do next
Memory works in strange ways
Cuts you down then makes you pay
One day you'll be walking fine
The next day lightning hits you from behind

Close the door; shut out the rain
One more day, no damage done
My spirit's falling, sinking like the sun

Standing at your doorway I can hear your voice inside

Til I'll be on my way again
I'm sick and tired of waiting
With nothing to do
Watching the rain through a crack
In the window
It's the little things that get you through
Like the same sun rising on me
Is rising over you
 
Walking and talking
Birds in the sky
You tell your secrets
How gracefully you lie
That's the way you come to me
I'm head over heels
And I'm always gonna be
That's okay I love the way you come to me

I guess we're tempting fate
A little too long it seems
Walking in this heat
Is just like floating in a dream
I've been torn apart put back together
With a couple of pieces in wrong
I'm holding up now
But I won't be for long
 
Tossing and turning
Like waves in the sea

There is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can

With the clouds in my head
Sat down by the window
Watched the sunrise burning red
I guess I'm doing alright now
But ther's too much time to kill
I can't forget you lying there so still
Picture back to another time
I see you standing here
You said would you ever forgive me if I chose to disappear
I turned away and closed my eyes
I didn't think I could
If that's what you want I guess I would
If that's what you want I guess I would
You know I can't live like everyone else
Nothing ever seems that simple in my head
I feel myself slipping away
I don't want to wind up helpless in my bed
This time I want to get out
Walk but I think I'll fall
I can see myself in so many ways
I curse myself instead
Was there something I should have done
Something else I could have said
You know I tried to change it
But I can't forgive you still
If that's what you want I guess I will
If that's what you want I guess I will
You know I can't live like everyone else

It'll be alright

As we drove on through the Finger Lakes

Water shining at our side

I was wrestling the demons in my mind

But it seemed to me you were reaching for

Some places we?d never been

Where we?d leave the past

On some dark road behind


I will always come

If you need me

And I will never forget

The things you said

And in my hour of darkness

You will come to me

And I will raise up

My worried head


There?s a line between what might have been

And where we stand today

There are roads we both know

We can never cross

But a voice comes down from history

And whispers in my ear

Don?t waste the time

The time that isn?t lost


I will always come

If you need me

And I will never forget

The things you said

And in my hour of darkness

You will come to me

And I will raise up

My worried head


I have walked by so many rooms

And watched you brooding in the dark

I spent my youth moving round you

Like a ghost

But the years go by

And the reasons die

That kept us far apart

Now the sun coming up each day?s

What we need most


I will always come

If you need me

And I will never forget

The things you said

And in my hour of darkness

You will come to me

And I will raise up

My worried head

Need to know

Just one more time
You wish that you could leave this 
Dirty town behind
There never seems to be a way
Hold on for another day
You will find

When I close my eyes
I can still feel your embrace

Watching the world's just fall away
Wondering just how wrong
Has everything gone too far to change

Here I come
Gonna make you feel OK
This day's done
Build another in its place

Was it all just a lie
Dropped at somebody trying to play
People will criticize
It doesn't matter what they say

Here I come
Gonna make you feel OK
This day's done
Build another in its place

Nothing will last for long
Even the stars collapse in space
Maybe you'll hear this song
Letting you know I'm on my way

Here I come baby

This day's done
Build another in its place
Oh baby

It's been too long

in the club but all the pretty words they say
the parties and the pills won't be enough
Suicides they always find, pretended to have friends that they could trust
The messages they leave behind ""the loneliness just gets to be too much""

You're here and gone but you just can't stop this drug
Day and night, the feelin' keeps you high and makes you warm
You're here and gone but you just can't get enough

Valentines and vintage wines grow bitter in the 
light of noonday sun with every kiss you leave behind 
another piece of who you might become
When in time you tire and the traveler's checks and 
liars are no fun you think about the world outside
the waiters and the salesmen lift you up

You're here and gone but you just can't stop this drug
Day and night, the feelin' keeps you high and makes you warm

Ohh, I miss you so

I'm the greatest fool
To let you go

Ohh, we started in heaven
I'm waiting just for you
I thought we stay together
Just we two

Please forgive me
You are strong, when I am weak
Please forgive me
You're my heart, if I can't speak

Secret love, with no name, I feel you everyday
Loneliness, just found me, why you walk away?
Ohh, I swear you, I will love you, baby
Ohh, I need you, more and more

Ohh, I miss you so

I will be your friend

Blue System,"Blue System Magic Symphony lyrics
Breaking down the fences, breaking down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat, mystery is a fool
I talk to my dream

I hear a voice, it was calling
And I couldn't stop to steam
'Cause my wild horse was falling
Give me freedom in my dreams

Give me shelter, yes it seems
Bleeding heartaches ever cry
I wanna rock you baby 'till I die
It's a magic symphony

Baby, when you're lying next to me
I hear violins
You know what it means just for tonight
I hear a symphony of love

I see the stars, the moon above
I hear your heart, I feel your touch deep down inside
Breaking down the fences, breaking down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat, mystery is a fool

I talk in my sleep
It was a mystic tune, devotion
I hear the rhythm beat
Unknown soldiers in devotion

Give me freedom in my dreams
Give me shelter - yes it seems
Bleeding heartaches ever cry
I wanna rock you baby 'till I die",Magic Symphony,1997

Something between you and me

To the black clouds in the West

In the sky that's not the night
Hey, there's a rain cloud there
That's shutting out the light

When you run for the sun, you catch the rain

The cold wind touched the beach
The sun we left in London
Is away beyond our reach

It seems a waste of time
Hey, all I do is sit 
And drink our Spanish wine 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

Of all the tales of Granada 
They tell of Islam's run
They lived beneath the Moorish lord
Beneath a Moorish sun

Oh, how we yearned to turn 
Our faces to that glare
When down from the mountains
Came the rain to soak our hair

When you run for the sun, you catch the rain

When you run for the sun, you catch the rain",Andorra,2000

Please don't wait for me

He told me that he loved me
I put him off with lies
He could see I had no eyes
So he left me once again alone
Like a child without her playmate
I had to face the truth
I was still in love with you
But you said:

Little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come
Ooh, little girl
Please don't wait for me
Wait patiently for love
Someday will surely come

Since the day you walked out that door
You filled my life with empty space
Come back
Can't you see it's you I'm waiting for

Don't you know I'm waiting
I'm waiting for love
For you, I miss you
I'm waiting

I need you
I want you

Don't admit for a minute that you forgot where you stood
You know exactly where you are now
Don't fall into distress
Ignore the ache behind your eyelids
The swarms of your head should relent at the smoke in your hair
You know, there isn't a sting that the hours won't manage
Fall into your sleep
As if a soporific sea
The salt of the worst should dissolve in the folds of your sheet
You're afloat why hold on for dear disbelief",Where You Are,2001
Blueline Medic,"As in the final hours the priest came walking in
With beans about his hand and wine about his breath
He took the frail wrist and pulled the stool up to the bed
Have you anything to confess? Have you anything to confess?

Nothing Father, I die with no regrets
You die with no regrets? I died with no regrets
But none of us are perfect son, be not in pieces in your rest
Have you anything to confess?

If I have wronged another blameless or with intent
You can bet that I did my best

Bluenote Voices,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2006

My favorite things include hip-hop crowds that ain't biased
Seein heads participate in real rhyme cyphers
Open mics with nobody spittin a written
Original MC's that love being different

[Illogic]
My favorite things include, open minds to open mics
and when I get open from rhymes that strike
Creativity's a plus, plus an MC that can crush without a cuss
and it's nice when a DOPE chick bust

[Blueprint]
My favorite is be	-girls that pop and lock
They're able to rock the spot, passers by that stop and jock
Cats that come to a hip-hop spot
without feelin the need to cop a glock and lick shots

[Illogic]
When a true MC spits raps composed of delicate prose on tracks
and when it's felt by the masses
Platinum respect lackin blunt ashes
Battle clashes from the top to drop any approachin amateur
When a challenger's up to caliber

[Blueprint]
MC's that shine without boastin
MC's that rhyme with the motion
Elevation without the high-postin
MC's that never lose touch and do they own street promotion

[Illogic]
When an MC's spirituality is the point focal
Minds bi-coastal, expandin beyond the local
And when I'm chillin with the pen and pad, fillin the lab with vocals
of melodic tunes that, reak of the underground perfume

[Blueprint]
When somebody I don't know gives me compliments
Seeing humbleness replace overconfidence
Hearin MC's that rap about the consequence
instead of glorifyin a lifestyle that lacks any type of common sense

[Illogic]
The lack of wack rhyme writin, and rhyme bitin
The ignitin of flames that fuel innovation
Tappin into the realm of concentration
to where the listener feels he's hopped dimension
Lyrics to make aliens stop and listen

[Blueprint]
The absence of yellin on my mixtapes
Any additional loops in my milk crates
Record shops where I cop all my beat breaks
Recordin every one of my verses on the very first take

[Illogic]
When the loop speed doesn't exceed 90
And to catch a line an MC must rewind me
To know my mom's behind me
That I make this my art, my culture, my release
My outlet by means through which I reveal the beast

[Blueprint]
When my EPS doesn't overheat
Rebootin and not lose an entire beat
When somebody want to diss or underrate me
I know this sounds strange, but it motivates me

[Illogic]
Stereo-stereotypes crushed, the shatter of grey matter
Clutch the mic 'til it rust
When an +Unforeseen+ kid bust
In wild styles to thrust thoughts like rapids to rush

Simply the heat from warmer days
And when the moment tends to savor
When the song is close at hand

Letting the brightness take command... take command

Sometimes its light I barely see

Blues Traveler,"Sometimes when you worry
The tendency to hurry
Can make your vision blurry
And blind you
You might shake and you might stammer
Or dance like MC Hammer
But could that pomp and glamour
Remind you
Of who you are and where you're going
And whose mind that you're blowing
And if your car needs towing
Don't move
Then calmly call the AAA you've got nothing to prove
As in all things, it's all in the groove

All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove

Well if it's your destiny don't fight it
War between the states unite it
It might be difficult but might it
Be worthwhile?
I ain't no Solomon from Babel
But my cards are on the table
And I swear that if I'm able
I'll run that mile
So if I'm rambling ignore me
If on the money then adore me
You know the pearls are cast before me
Oh what to do?
Wish I could put it in a picture and hang it in the Louvre
But like I said before it's all in the groove
	
You could say it isn't worth it
Or maybe you could birth it
But if there's too much girth it
Won't move

All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove
All in the groove

The jam it swings and sways
As the groove funkily plays
And they say crime never pays
But this ain't no crime
It's just a life blood flowing water
That any son or daughter
Would send away for order
A celebration of time
So jam on, jam out, jam it in
Till it feels like it's a sin
And that's only when you begin
To improve
Don't mind if it's the rhythm that's just only when you've
Got to let it all be all in the groove

All in the groove
All in the groove

All in the groove

Blues Traveler,"Bagheera walked into the bar and poured himself a drink
His fur was stained with the blood of monkeys and he needed time to think
The man at the bar said, ""What are you doing here?""
Bagheera let go a low soft purr that kept the man from coming near
He said ""I'm Bagheera, the mighty panther and the jungle is my home
I'm free, free in all I see and that makes me free to roam""
Sometimes to feel the music of the jungle it can cause you pain
And the man heard Bagheera as the entire jungle joined in the big black cat's refrain

One dark night the man-cub came to the big black cat afraid
The boy cried, ""Teacher, teacher I don't, understand this ache within me""
The great cat sighed and (then softly he began)
He said, ""Indeed thou art a man's child now and the world is yours to give and take
The time has come now for your awareness to change forever and there's a choice for you to make
You may remain here in the jungle and hunt with the free people
Or if you feel the man's God calling you return to your kind in the village and worship at his steeple
The only thing you must do is what you feel in your heart is true
I will hunt now and leave you on your own to decide what to do""
The mighty panther went on his hunt
Secret Lord of the jungle beneath the night sky
And some say if you could have seen him then you'd have noticed a single tear fall from his majestic eye",Bagheera,1991
Blues Traveler,"Well what do you know here we are again
Been a long time I can't remember when
Well I wrote another one and guess who it's for
Don't mind if I'm embarrassed I can't take it anymore
You know I travel the world but I don't go no place
And I got you to blame and the smile on your face
You know I look in your eyes I see a part of me there
So excuse my directness, but I just don't care

What I think I'm talking about is a last ditch chance
Don't care about the likelihood or circumstance
It seems I am still here and I am waiting for you
And I've no reason no time and an excellent view
Of your eyes in my head and it's killing me
But the possibilities are thrilling me
So I guess I'll sit right here with nothing better to do
And to top it all of you know the best part is...

That I love you
I'm singing I love you
Please, make it the best part
Make it the best part

I'm gonna let you on in on a big surprise
My heart is where the eagle flies
Yeah I'm the master of my destiny
That's why I need you right here with me
You see I've come to learn that without you around
I might as well be standing on the ground
And with you with me and with me with you
There's not a goddamn thing that we could not do

I'm not talking about us never being alone
I'm just suggesting we make the world our home
You've got to fly free and so do I
And this way we'd never need to say good-bye
But instead things like ""see you soon""
And ""explore and play""
And ""the one you love is not far away
But safe in your heart to see you through""
And to top it all of you know the best part is that I

Love you
I'm singing I love you
Please, make it the best part
Make it the best part

I'm gonna take you take you by the hand
You know even General Custer had to make a stand
I'll drop in from the skies or I'll move in slow
But there's so damn much that I want you to know
So take a look around you tell me what do you see?
Then take those eyes and take a look at me
You know you see things that others don't
So if you think I'll go away, I won't

You see my engine's blown and it is time to punt
And there's an element of danger pulling off this stunt
But the survey says that I don't seem to mind
And you're the adventure I'm trying to find
There's a whole lot of things that other people have said
But I don't care if I'm correct or if it's all in my head
So damn the torpedoes and cock a doodle-doo!
And to top it all of you know the best part is...
That I love you

I'm singing I love you

At not much of a cost

Should never be lost

And nourish that which is hungry
Feast well avenging madness
Then call your buzzards down to clean the carcass

Well your life's not yours it's everyone's
So do the right thing and go for your guns
It's how the world was saved and how the West was won
So here he comes now you gotta stand or run

You're out to win
You know you hate him, you must know he hates you

Then there was the thirst
And a hate for the Christians

With Judea enslaved
And the Israelite nation

Killing Palestine's children

I've got a hundred million things to show you as many more to see
But only if you conquer me

Hail to all you mountain climbers all you dreamers on the run
I'm your self appointed solicitor but now I speak to only one
Whoever she is now, and whoever she'll become
I'd like to ask her to hurry please and if she's walking could she run
It's not my impatience though perhaps just there I lied
It's just I'm feeling invincible and it has me terrified
Are you safe and are you healthy, and hope you're all right
Entombed in my bravado, I was hoping soon you might

Little girl what you doing here
Don't mess with that vampire in the corner who beckons you near
Are you waiting for the band to play

It's too loud in here for words but those staring eyes have much to say
If you meet those eyes in fun
Could be trouble for you if you don't back up what you've begun
No I won't regret

The air is thick and wet
With defense & desire
Gonna run the show someday
Gonna buy this bar and everything in it and run it all my way

Talk to you about it till dawn
Tell you all my plans and twisted dreams until the blow is gone

Into this unsuspecting tavern to build and feed on your discontent

Blues Traveler,"Raise your head
Meagerest of fledglings
And breathe in deep
And cease to cry
For life it beats within you
To fix upon the sky
And fix upon=

The sky
Is beckoning your coming
Your feathered nest
Has grown too small
The wind
Is here to greet you
Spread your wings and simply fall
Spread your wings and simply fall
Spread your wings
Spread your wings and simply

Fall 
Into the rushing air
And struggle
And fight to rise above
And then surrender
To your freedoms
For these are the pains of love
And these are the many pains of love
And many, many are the pains of, love

That frightening fall has become a friend
With gravity now do you play
Inches from death and the frozen ground
And then away
The clouds separate to reveal the warmth
Of the goldenest bright shining sea
Night falls and it's gone again
But now you're free
To give it chase
And to

Soar through heaven
Mightiest of eagles
And rule your minions

Blues Traveler,"I've really got to clean up my room
You know its been so long since I've seen my floor
It's getting kind of scary in fact I suspect
That when I finally clear away I won't know her anymore
How we'll have grown so far apart
From those early days with the fresh new start
So in the end it won't matter at all
So why should I bother with the rise and the fall
So I quietly lay back down
And watch TV

But these are the things we tell ourselves
Eventual stories designed to amuse
It's a game we play and we play it well
In fact we're so damn good that we try to lose
So we can keep hiding
So we can survive
And keep on believing
Someday we'll go outside & drive
Gonna go outside & drive...

I have resolved not to leave my house
Till my floor comes back and my room is clean
So I'm really kind of glad that my TV's here
While I concoct my plan to fulfill my dream
Now won't that be wonderful when I'll finally be done
You know I just can't wait for it then I'll start to have fun
It's getting hard lately to concentrate
All my appointments cancelled cause I'm horribly late
You know I think I need a prison
In order to dream of being free

Gonna go outside & drive...

Now weeks have gone by and my room's not done
In fact I could say that it's gotten much worse
Amongst the crumpled letters the mood's quite perverse
But I got a new TV with a remote control
Styrofoam and instructions fill the hole
Where I once cleared a path where I once blazed a trail
To the bathroom, but I fear that a nail
Is buried there now so I step very rarely
And try not to get out of bed

You know tomorrow I'll get up and I'll walk out my door
And life will return to the way that it was
But I think I'm getting sick I'd better give it a day
It mustn't get a foothold, but it usually does
So I'll sit right here till I'm old and gray
I need my rest after all I'm wasting away
And I just saw a cockroach crawl out of my sneaker
I think he's biding his time till I get somewhat weaker
Things could still turn out alright
As long as I'm not dead
As long as I'm...
I'm...I'm not...
I'm not dead, no I'm not dead

I know it hurts right now but you've got to keep moving on
And I know how good it can feel when you're safe and withdrawn
But he can live in our memory and you don't yet have that choice
'Cause you're still here and to speak to me you're gonna have to use your voice

I ain't telling you what's right

I want to tell you what makes men need

I think I'm talking 'bout love & greed

'Cause you wouldn't be the first to fall to love & greed

A man in love gonna take to wanting
A greedy man gonna do the same
One is a man before congratulations
One is to make you feel the need to strain

You say ""look at him"" but look once again
When you're living on the tastes of a different man
Love and greed are one and the same

A man in love willing to walk through fire
A greedy man like a moth to a flame
A man in love willing to go half crazy
A greedy man likely to go insane

You can take it anyway but take it at your own speed
'Cause you wouldn't be the first to fall to love & greed

So the trap's been set and you've took the bait
You saw it all go down just a little too late
But now you're hooked and to your surprise
You saw how some of it was real and some was lies
But you're in too deep 'cause you care too much
And there's never been a cure for that as such
You could see prison bars or call it home sweet home
But like it or not you're no longer alone

A man in love don't know what he's doing
A greedy man always says he does
A man in love sold his soul up the river
That's where a greedy man's soul always was

""Love of my life our first night together
We sat in the rain and talked forever
Love of my life your carefree way
Showed me the potential of each and every day

In your carefree way

That my place was gone in your carefree way

A New York City prophet
They lie there all forgotten
I wonder who will hear them next

Well it won't be me it won't be you
Kind of makes you wonder who
Any sympathetic ear would do
Who's gonna hear them next

Lie prophet lie
For the sky is much too high
Keep it in your eye
And memorize the moon
Dream prophet dream
Don't you listen to them scream
We know they didn't hear you yet
But you're bound to get there soon

What do you think we'd hear them say
Would they drop down on their knees and pray
Would they tell us that it's all OK
Who do you think will ease their pain

And if we dare to listen
As the tears freeze up and glisten
With the current savior risen
Who do you think will ease their pain

Lie prophet lie
For the sky is much too high
Keep it in your eye
And memorize the moon
Dream prophet dream
Don't you listen to them scream
We know they didn't hear you yet

Blues Traveler,"Hot lights across his face
They told him he was just a disgrace
Stripped down like a frightened child
A shadow stood before him
He thought he saw a smile

Guilty of nothing more than fear
It was the dogs of war that sent him here
Caught across enemy lines
Shot in the back
Now he's running out of time

They all said they loved him
But where were they all now
Thinking about his hometown
Back in New York City

A slap across his face
Brings him back to this painful place
He would not talk God save his soul
They took him out and beat him
His mind felt cold

A change takes place
It makes you feel numb
Realizing you're just a man
Can make your soul want to run

Standing in the firing line
The smoke fills his lungs one last time
And with his last breath he cries out
""Dear God what have I done""

A shot rings out",Save His Soul,1993
Blues Traveler,"As I
Was taught to lead
I was fed well
On what had come before
Everyone
Who had ever lived
Left a lesson
Regarding what's in store

Were just like you and me
Guessing their asses off
Oh yes, they tried to guess well

It's our turn now
I hope we're forgiven
Chalk it up to knowledge and change
And life itself

And as I
Shall learn to follow
I'll feed the leaders
With everything I can
They'll
Bring revolutions
That try as I may
I just won't understand

They
Will be just like you and me
Pretending they're not guessing
As if we couldn't tell

It'll be their turn then
I hope we can forgive them
Chalk it up to knowledge and change
And life itself

It seems a cycle that we all seem to share
The passing from hand to hand of our pride and despair
Both parent and child cry apathy but everybody cares
And then we vanish in thin air
And only time is there
Time and a legacy...

History holds questions for everyone
A story that's only just begun
Blind past the goddamn horizon
Sees more than father less than son
Life and death merely pretending
We're part of the infinite ending

We
Are gonna teach and learn
We're gonna get fed well
And then we shall feed
We
We are ancient
We are brand spanking new

We shall follow and lead

Cause we

Are simply you and me
In proving our traditions
On the brink of heaven and hell

We each get a turn
And then we're forgiven
And we call it knowledge and change
And life itself
And we call it knowledge and change
And life itself
And we call it knowledge and change

And life...",Trina Magna,1993
Blues Traveler,"Have you ever seen an atom
Little bits of everything floating by
Take a good look at them
Collectively they compose all you see including your eye

Brilliant puzzle
A living Rubix Cube we think we can figure out and solve
But we're just monkeys
Scratching our heads trying to open our ears
To a chord that just won't seem to resolve

And we call it wisdom
Yes intellect in our truest sense of the word
You see for us security means a harmony
According to only what we have heard
And this alone and nothing less
Will ease our heart and our mind
In the hopes that in feeling free we'll reach paradise
On that hilltop we're still trying to find

But the possibility exists no matter how scary it may seem
That paradise was once the world and it wasn't just a dream
The earth was our heaven and we didn't know there were rules for us to break

Weighing in at almost every weight imaginable...

And in this corner
Weighing in at well, not really very much of anything;
A very sound and user friendly idea
On finally bringing that pesky mountain to Mohammed
Gentlemen at the sound of the harmonica solo you may come out fighting

Take a look at the horizon
Quiet and still
You know there used to be bison
Gentlemen you may fire at will
They say this land won't go to waste
But you gotta wonder how
You know we're chopping down the air we breathe
As fodder for the cow

That's right so we can eat well
Yes and starve to death
And say there's nothing we can do
Because we really don't want to do a goddamn thing
Look I'm shrugging and so are you
We can imagine the straightest of lines
But our fingers can't control the pen
And it's this frustration that yields relief
As we say we're just mortal men
And that means we get to torture a chimpanze
And infect him with disease
Because he screams just like a human child
While we study his desperate pleas

But the possibility exists no matter how scary it may seem
That paradise was once the world and it wasn't just a dream
The earth was our heaven and we didn't know there were rules for us to break

Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide
I'll do as I'll decide and let it ride till until I've died

Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute diddies
I wanna bust all your balloons

I wanna burn of all your cities to the ground
But I've found, I will not mess around
Unless I play then hey
I will go on all day
Hear what I say
I have a prayer to pray

Blues Traveler,"If ever you are feeling like you're tired
And all your uphill struggles leave you headed downhill
If you realize your wildest dreams can hurt you
And your appetite for pain has drinken it's fill

I ask of you a very simple question
Did you think for one minute that you are alone
And is your suffering a privilege you share only
Or did you think that everybody else feels completely at home

Just wait
Just wait
Just wait
And it will come

If you think I've given up on you you're crazy
And if you think I don't love you well then you're just wrong
In time you just might take to feeling better
Time is the beauty of the road being long

I know that now you feel no consolation
But maybe if I told you and informed you out loud
I say this without fear of hesitation
I can honestly tell you that you make me proud

Just wait
Just wait
Just wait
And it will come
Just wait
Just wait
Just wait
And it will come

If anything I might have just said has helped you
If anything I might have just said helped you just carry on
Your rise uphill may no longer seem a struggle
And your appetite for pain may all but be gone

I hope for you and cannot stop at hoping
Until that smile has once again returned to your face
There's no such thing as a failure who keeps trying
Coasting to the bottom is the only disgrace

Blues Traveler,"You'll get no answer from me
About what I want of what I get
Brave enough to speak afraid to see
Confuse the issue till you forget

And I've tried
To finally decide
Why
I'm in your face

And if you can't already tell
I am unable to let things go
I'm told I do it very well
But more important you should know

That all the same
You've got no one to blame
But yourself
If you call that a waste

'Cause it ain't me
That's been hurting you inside
And if you've learned
You'll know much more than I

That you're gonna have to go and fine it
You'll have to dig beneath the ground
You'll have to unearth every ugly stone
That kept you on your own
And simply put them down
You're gonna have to look around

You'll get no answer from me
About what I get or what I want
That was enough to make her leave
She's not the first one come and gone

And I don't care
Buyer beware
Of me
Cause it might get rough

If you want peace then live alone
If you want to hide then find a stage
Each a brief but perfect home
To accommodate your rage

And sometimes
In the midst of all my crimes
I feel lost
Or have I lost enough

Remaining friends
Remind me as they say
It's up to you
The things you throw away

And still you're gonna have to go and find it
You'll have to dig beneath the ground
You'll have to unearth every ugly stone

Hold it for a while try not to have to drop it
Men are not to cry so how am I to stop it
Keep it all inside don't show how much she rocked ya

Ooh can you feel the same
Ooh you gotta love the pain
Ooh it looks like rain again
Ooh I feel it comin' in
The mountains win again
The mountains win again

Dreams we dreamed at night were never meant to come to life
I can't understand the ease she pulled away her hand
This time in my life I was hurt enough to care
I guess from now on I'll be careful what I share

Ooh can you feel the same
Ooh ya gotta love the pain
Ooh it looks like rain again
Yeah feel it comin' in
The mountains win again

A pocket is no place for a smile anyway
Someday I will find love again will blow my mind
Maybe it will be that love that got away from me
Is there a line to write that could make you cry tonight

Yeah ya gotta love the pain

Standing here with a tale to tell 
I might as well tell to you 
Nothing near Wagnerian 
As Terminator Two 
Its an old one about a little dirt farm girl 
Who wanted to get out for good 
Shed do anything to keep that dream 
Shed do anything she could 

CHORUS: 
Who was she 
To feel so free 
With her heart on her sleeve 
She just couldnt believe... 
There was a price to pay 

Her very first chance to escape that year 
Came when the circus had come to town 
She wound up in bed and quite madly in love 
With some rubber nose juggling clown 
He promised he'd return for her come next spring 
And he swore that he wouldn't forget 
Needless to say come the following May 
More than her appetite was getting wet 
She proceeded unheeded and quite undefeated 
To the trailer behind the tents 
And her heart began to scar at his trailer door 
She was gonna go wherever he went 

CHORUS 
He arrived at last about half past 
With a girl under every arm 
But all of this in itself could have been innocent as hell 
But what began to cause her alarm 
Was when he locked the door behind him like she always bee 
She was standing alone in the dirt 
And her eyes were so dry that she began to cry 
And something began to hurt 
She wanted to tear the hair out of her head 
Yeah and she wanted to wish that she was dead 
But a voice in her just would not let her drop 
And her heart began to break but it didn't stop 

Run all you're races 
And don't you fear 
You and I 
Are getting out of here 
And well survive 
That I guarrantee 
Cause you don't need much 
When all you have is me. 

She listened to the little voice in her 
And then she hit the road 
Free at last and with just a tiny scar 
And finally on her own 
No one knows what became of her 
All we know is she got away 
And though there really ain't no guarantees down here 
I like to think she did okay 

CHORUS 

That there's a price to pay(4x)

We're not too fast and we're not too slow

I'm not yours and you're not mine

Come see what the madman sees
In escaping
The endless possibilities
Of escaping I'm escaping

When you try to look around but the walls are closing in
And you've got just enough strength to think of starting again
But you don't have the time you cannot think or hesitate
Because the bus just left and you're seven hours late
And all you can see is the sun going down
In some far away land in some far away town
And all of a sudden you find you just don't care
And you'd give everything you have if you could be over there

I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the thoughts of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies, yeah humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Well, what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up?
When all it does is slow me down

Shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch"", hey baby, let's keep in touch

But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink it and always be full, yeah I will drink it and always be full

Oh I like coffee and I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

Why you wanna give me a run-around?

Blues Traveler,"Ya know,
There's this park, you see, in New York
That's what this song is about
Where we used to grow up
And, um, hang around
And then we started moving on
And started going on the road
We weren't home that much
But, back then they had this really great idea
When we hit town
These parks were prime real estate, you see
And if we could keep them nice-looking
We could charge more rent for the places around town
Now, I know you guys have that here around Boston
But, you know, in New York
They had this great idea that there had to be a crack-down
So we could sweep the park clean of the undesirable elements
And we figured, what could we do?
Besides vote
Perhaps we could tell a song
To you
Through the musical medium
And then you'll know
So here we go
I really hope so
Well, here it is

Rich man smells smoke, he smells something burning green
Doesn't like the odor, better put some badges on the scene
Put a blue suit on everybody you see hangin' round
And if that don't work, we're gonna close that park down... 
But anyway
Yesterday a man was busted trying to walk his dog
Cop didn't like his attitude, say that he was against the law
Shoot everybody with a mutt this side of the town
And if that don't work, we're gonna close that park down... 

Preach on, my wounded Chandler

You know when you're walkin' through that park one night
Whether your skin is black or white
And you feel that particular pressure on the back of your head
And the hairs on the back of your neck start to stand up
And you hear a (police call)
Trust those hairs
Because if you're big or burly
Or even short and surly
Or if your cat's named Shirley
You could be walkin' through that park
And meet with the most undesirable disaster
Compliments of your taxes
I'm not saying its gonna happen
I'm not saying that it will definitely happen
But it could happen
Because it has happened
I mean, it could be you
Or you, or you, or you, or you

Yeah, that guy, yeah definitely
Those three, easily
Yup, you
Yup, that guy
That guy
Him
Those guys up there

Anybody
Well, enough of my yakking

What about your truth and your mother's apple pie
I guess it's all another part of your grand designing lie
Should I tell you something pretty so you don't end my way of life
Or should I come up from behind with some stolen, bloody, rusty knife
Well maybe I should sit by and watch you kill my friends
And maybe I can learn to love you and hope you never end
Perhaps I can learn to hate you but I think I already do
All I know for sure right now, it's gotta be me or you
While your uncle rolls his joints with his fifty dollar bill
I'm off in some other park, and I'm laughing at you still

Blues Traveler,"A thousand times a prophet
A New York City prophet
They lie there all forgotten
I wonder who will hear them next

Well it won't be me and it won't be you
Kind of makes you wonder who
Any sympathetic ear would do
Who's gonna hear them next

Well, lie prophet lie
For the sky is much too high
Keep it in your eye
And memorize the moon
Dream prophet dream
And don't you listen to them scream
We know they didn't hear you yet
But you're bound to get there soon

What do you think we'd hear them say
Would they drop down on their knees and pray
Would they tell us that it's all OK
Who do you think will ease their pain

And if we dare to listen
As the tears freeze up and glisten
With the current savior risen
Who do you think will ease their pain

Well lie prophet lie
For the sky is much too high
Keep it in your eye
And memorize the moon
Dream prophet dream
But don't you listen to them scream
We know they didn't hear you yet
But you're bound to get there soon

What will our mighty future be
For there ain't no prophet here to see
That narrows it down to you and me
Do you want to live or die

Well we've chosen death with its toll begun
You know I've always pictured life more fun
Too bad we couldn't ever act as one
Do you want to live or die

Well lie prophet lie
For the sky is much too high

Blues Traveler,"Well I've guessed your name and I'm sure you know mine
I'd like to discuss our mutual friend
I can't help but feel that I left him behind
Does he still stay with you or did his pain ever end

I guess
I don't deserve to know
If he ever let go
I guess
I don't really need to see
If he wound up with you or did he ever break free

When we were both young, you took us in
And taught us to play survival games
He'd lost so much that you let him win
But I had a home so it just wasn't the same

I had the strength
To look you in the eye
And say goodbye
I was lucky
And I didn't have to play
Does he still stay with you or did he get away

I used what I had and I escaped
I smelled something good and I followed its track
But all he could smell was the world that you shaped
It took all my strength and I just couldn't look back

I remember him 
Calling after me
I keep that memory
The last thing he screamed out aloud
Was ""Hey don't you leave me alone!"" 
Yeah he might live with you but he called me his home

I guessed your name and some day so will he

Who needs to humor me and tell me lies

Yeah, humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie, too, and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me

Is it a surefire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Blues Traveler,"Comes the time for Christmas
And I really have to ask
If this is feeling merry
How much longer must it last
I wish a one horse open sleigh
Would come carry me away
But I've been waiting here all day
And one just hasn't come my way
Now excuse me if I'm not being reverent
But I was hoping for a miracle to hold me, wash me
Save me from my righteous doubt as I watch helpless
And everybody sings
If it's Hanukah or Kwanzaa
Solstice, harvest or December twenty-fifth
Peace on earth to everyone
And abundance to everyone you're with
Laha da da da da da

Comes the time for Christmas
And as you raise your yuletide flask
There's like this feeling that you carry
As if from every Christmas past
It's as if each year it grows
It's like you feel it in your toes
And on and on your carol goes
Harvesting love among your woes
I want to buy into the benevolent
And I was hoping for a miracle to hold me, wash me
Make me know what it's about
As the longing in me makes me want to sing
Noel or Navidad
Season celebration or just the end of the year
Christmas can mean anything
And I mean to keep it's hope forever near
Laha da da da da da

As if a cold and frozen soul is warm to love
By loves own hand
So goes the prayer if for a day peace on earth
And good will to man
At twenty below the winter storm it billows
But the fire is so warm inside
And the children while nestled in their pillows
Dream of St. Nicholas's ride
And how the next day they'll get up and they will play
In the still falling Christmas snow
And together we'll celebrate forever
In defiance of the winds that blow
My God in heaven now I feel like I'm seven
And spirit calls to me as well
As if Christmas had made the winter warmer
Made a paradise from what was hell
As if a cold and frozen soul is warm to love
By loves own hand
So goes the prayer if for a day peace on earth
And? good will to man
At twenty below the winter storm it billows
But the fire is so warm inside

And hark the herald angels sing

Yes I am nothing

I'm the wisdom of age and the beauty of youth
I am shape substance color darkest black palest white
Speckled gold ringing mirror sharp soft and bright

Come sample all my riches I'm pure stimuli

The preceding verses are the halves of my soul
I'm just the battlefield and that is my role
There's a tug of war between what I can and can't feel
The inevitable compromise determines the real
The equation the reason for my being here
The struggle resulting in my invention of the tear

For I'm only something
Yes I'm only something
Yes I'm only something
And I can only love someone

Less than an hour to go
Six hundred miles an hour
And still it feels so slow
I'm trying to get back to Burlington
To a square in the center of town
To a spot on a wooden table
Where her feet didn't reach the ground
And when she kisses me it tasted like cinnamon
And her skin smells of cider and rose
And when she looked at me we both got quiet
And my heart beats so hard we were in so close
Once for such a beautiful while that still makes me smile

And she called me her ugly American
And I would call her my Canadian flower
And I don't think that we'll ever get there again
We had such power
And she would call me her ugly American
And I'll remember my Canadian rose
Especially when the fall comes to Burlington
We were in so close

And every single hope and dream I could ever conjure up
Passionately springs in me and things are possible
Plausible and perfectly both of ours forever after
And every day, at least it seemed that way
Once for a beautiful while that still makes me smile

I finally made it this town looks rearranged
I don't know these people anymore
But in the best ways not much else has changed
From the way it was before
And at least they still have this certain table
Where I once carved a particular name
I run my finger through the weathered carving
And I almost can feel the same
And my mouth it almost tastes just like cinnamon
As I ponder what my pilgrimage means
And I try to figure out where Vancouver is from here
And I listen to the leaves
If only for a beautiful while that still makes me smile

And she called me her ugly American
And I would call her my Canadian flower
And I don't think that we'll ever get there again

Blues Traveler,"And if my two left feet could settle down and split the difference
Tripping over myself in every way that I know how
Perhaps in time I could surpass my coy façade of vast indifference
But I've already reached the maximum of what my law allows
You tell me to relax you tell me
Not to try so hard
But in the end it only makes me want to more
To figure out some way to play some major part

So I watch her move and I watch her work
Satisfy my voyeuristic quirk
Old habits they are hard to break
Just harder than it is to take
And when she looks away I tap my feet
I try my best to be discreet
Careful so she won't find out
How much I want to shout

And show me how to do that step I never thought I could
You always move so gracefully
And I was never any good
But maybe if you'll dance with me

The momentary soaring of an eagle would be me
Come on Felicia set me free
And when you start to close your eyes
You know you move so beautifully
I want to dance with you come on and dance with me Felicia

I suppose the thing that gets me most is that if I'd bothered ever
I wouldn't feel so much like Casey who never got to bat
You cannot help but laugh at me singing better late than never
And more and more I realize I have no argument for that
I can almost work up the nerve for a declaration
I can almost hear me speak the words as I gain resolve
But then you move and you twirl and you smile at me
And my inhibition and my courage both dissolve

And so I'm standing there and I do not move
In spite of her momentous groove
And for a moment I can barely see
A glimpse of how good it could be
And then I must admit that I want to try
To look Felicia in the eye
And when the music starts to play
To smile at her and say

Come on and dance with me Felicia

And who am I to say I don't understand it
And if feeling better justifies the thrill
Who'd be stupid enough to say it doesn't have to be that way
I will

Sing a song of sixty pence
For a pocket full of rye
And kill all that he represents
To ensure that he will die
Chase him from the public square
Or hang him from a tree
And tell his kind they best beware
Because he's different from me

And who am I to say I don't understand it
And if feeling better justifies the thrill
Who'd be stupid enough to say it doesn't have to be that way

Twinkle twinkle little star
We have you in our sights
Dangerous, we come this far
The serpent giggles with delight
The pig's head on a stick does grin
As we teeter on the brink
He's singing you are all my children
My island's bigger than you think

I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
Last night I dreamed
Last night last night

Something about a big jet plane moving fast off into the sunset
Maybe a mustang moving fast up to the sky
More like a great big boat drifting off to nowhere
I know that in the end you were waiting on the other side

I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
I dreamed about you last night
Last night I dreamed
Last night last night

Blues Traveler,"When you roll down your window
And ask for directions
Can you count on the answers
That you would receive
If you've ever been taken
By that passed along pay back
Why ask in the first place you might not believe
But I won't be confined to road maps
Or let assholes decide
And I'd rather be lost
Then afraid to take a ride

And if it's a sin
No place on earth will I ever fit in
And I don't mind
Someday I pray I just may
As I make my way

Well I might have been helpful
Or a mischievous bastard
But when I'm thinking about it
I do what I can
In the infinite halfway
Where everyone always meets me
And by the laws of pure error
Do we exchange and understand
I'm yelling as loudly
As my lungs will allow
I wish I could whisper
Can you hear me now

And if it's a sin
No place on earth will I ever fit in
And I don't mind
Someday I pray I just may
As I make my way

Could be no one has the meaning
Of what anybody says
But so we don't feel so lonely
We decide that we do
Well now we might be speaking English
But what does that mean
And can you honestly tell me
What color is blue
Well you could try an explanation
Or try to wonder why
But if I'm lost in your driveway
All I really can do is try

And if it's a sin
No place on earth will I ever fit in
And I don't mind
I've looked and searched her over countless times
And I'll do it again

Blues Traveler,"When the sun and the storm refuse to yield
Each celebrating power that they wield
Their stubbornness and strength are revealed
And they combine to grow the crops in every field
And the partnership is sealed

I've come to realize they've grown me too
And there isn't much about it either can do
When dreams that you chase after shower you
While the love that you allow comes shining through
Creates a path of every hue

This path is narrow
Just wide enough to follow
I wonder where it will go
So I shall try, with my sharpest eye
To keep this rainbow in my view

(rapping)
Prepared is the way I see
Before me lies my destiny
It sprawls out to infinity
Should I choose to step upon
Always just believeable
With colors inconceivable
It forces me to see him
For what hope has now become
...what hope has now become

This path is narrow
Just wide enough to follow
I wonder where it will go
So I shall try, with my sharpest eye
To keep this rainbow in my view

So I teeter, so I sway
Eternally almost falling off, I'm on my way
The path so fragile
And the path forgives
But only he who seeks it's color truly lives

This path is narrow
Just wide enough to follow
I wonder where it will go
So I shall try, with my sharpest eye
To keep this rainbow in my view

This path is narrow
Just wide enough to follow
I wonder where it will go
So I shall try, with my sharpest eye
To keep this rainbow in my view

And the storm on the other
Only when I stand between
Do I become yet another

Always a blight on the one
While the other won't care

Waking me making me right

So you're destinationed for the outskirts
Thinks the answer lies beyond

And the mountain's gotten big
What anyone believes in
I never gave a fig

But I could never fully handle
The heart that bore the load
Something never spoken
Something forever owed

Till I can bring you home
Till I can bring you home
No, I will never really be free
While you live in my memory

In awe and almost fearful
I'll bet that you don't care
You're most likely thinking
About your brother still back there

Till I can bring him home
Till I can bring you home
I will never really be free
While you live in my memory

I can never have it taken
But I wanted you to know
That forever we're connected, you and me
It doesn't matter where it goes
There are things we simply owe

Blues Traveler,"So I thought about my lifetime
How the days, they are confused
As the moments, they do roll by
Only some will follow you

They're the same every day
Think about what we do
If you take the time to look well
Any one of them could chase you

That's how you remember it
It'll find you soon
That's how you remember it
What will be the truth

From out behind the shadows
Every moment I have known
Like catching that first firefly
In a jar when I was back home

Summer rain on a windowpane
The way she looked that night
And every second after
Going to radiate the light

That's how you remember it
It'll find you soon
That's how you remember it
What will be the truth

Looking at my photograph
Staring back 20 years ago
The man I am, the boy I was
The things I still don't know

No matter how you remember it
It'll find you soon
No matter how you remember it
That will be the truth

No matter how you remember it
It'll find you soon
No matter how you remember it
That will be the truth

Blues Traveler,"She lies out on the grass, her bellybutton fascinates me
If summer never came and went, I doubt it would ever phase me
Broken in the moment of the wanton bee to look within to see her face
My fingers reach in to taste but all I meet is my own lips

[Chorus]
Time is fleeting time's a wasting and time is bleeding, forever racing
And time is money and money is time, but love does none of these
Love does none of these

She'll twirl and spin me round and never let go the hold she has
From heaven's rafter to the ground and back and forth and twice as fast
Transit in the blink of her big brown eyes and all is right or wrong with the world
More the heart of me than as some would say just some girl

[Chorus]

But my heart beats as we say goodnight
Hoping for a kiss
Um this feeling that I get to keep
Love can most definitely do this

She's the only thing that shines among the murky gels of pink and blue
Club speakers make their noise but they can't drown out what is true
Captured in the passion of an honest smile and last call leaves us little else
I reach for her to make her turn but all I meet is my own lips

[Chorus]

Never you mind the lightning
Dawn gonna make the day warm, honey
Sun gonna make the day bring

Hold you till it comes
Just water falling down
The orange in the sun
Never makes a sound

Never you mind at the noise, honey
The man and the moon and the stars
Are putting away all their toys, honey
The lightning back in their jars

Hold you till they're done
Just water falling down
The orange in the sun
Never makes a sound
As it shines all around

Rise and awake in the morning, honey
Wash away sleep from your eye
Keep any dreams that you
Might have made, baby
Little one please don't you cry

Hold you till the dawn
Just water falling down

Never makes a sound
As it shines all around

Take away all of the darkness, honey
Remove any nightmares power
Break any curse with me, won't you honey?

Hold you till the dawn

Blues Traveler,"In the international rumble
She takes a chance and comes to me
And falling through the cracks we tumble
Not far at all but enough to see
We've come to rest our backs against the rubble
Of a future in uncertainty

And I'm so glad you're here, she said
And I hate that you're here, she said
I wish I didn't, I didn't need you so much
To be here

It's funny meeting anyone this way
But there she goes
Walking her last runway
The queen of Sarajevo

We communicate in broken English
And nervous sighs and apprehension
As fascinated we are standing witness
No alcohol could quell the tension
No clever kind of joke or small talk in this
No fate denies our soul connection

And I'm so glad you're here, she said
And I hate that you're here, she said
I wish I didn't need you so much
To be here

It's funny meeting anyone this way
But there she goes
Walking her last runway
The queen of Sarajevo

They say that in the west the blues comes easy
And the night belongs to the one who plays
But it's the ancient souls that breathe them deeply
For the bluest heart is the one who stays

It's funny meeting anyone this way
But there she goes
Watch her walk her last runway
The queen of Sarajevo

And it's so funny to be living this way
But it's time to go
Leave you standing on the runway
The queen of Sarajevo, the queen of Sarajevo

Blues Traveler,"Sway with me for one more dance
And holding me closely, meet my eyes
And I would ask for nothing more

I'm asking for another chance
To my own infinite surprise
I've never moved like this before

It only remains to say I love you
And I suppose I always will
And though I walk away as I replay my better days
I'll not betray what time can't heal or kill

A single instant of reprieve
I am no longer resembling
The man I was, I'm the man you see

Try to exhale in my relief
But I am also trembling
You brought the best hope out of me

It only remains to say I love you
And I suppose I always will
And though I walk away as I replay my better days
I'll not betray what time can't heal or kill

Gently I stumble
To the music as it strums
The heavens all crumble
'Neath this moment we've become

My heart keeps calling me
Closer and stalling me
Catch me I'm falling
Though the dancing's long since done

If I'm in trouble, if I'm alone
If I'm a runaway, don't send me home
I want to be with you

If I saw you now, would nothing change?
Tell me to grow up or act my age
Like I always do

Maybe surrender another chance
Or only give me just one more dance

It only remains to say I love you
And I suppose I always will
And though I walked away as I replay my better days
I'll not betray what time can't heal or kill

It only remains to say I love you

I don't need your blessing anyway
But I get crazy, crazy sometimes
I just wanna warn you

So get out your camera, gather ?round
Gonna get to the rhythm, gonna get on down
Bring your rock candy, bring Uncle Buck
Escape is in progress, care to try your luck?

Kick out the back door into whatever will drive
And cling to the shoulder till the night is alive
When you're lost in the wilderness you know you're there
And dust off your feet and put your hands in the air

And oh, it never rains
You and me and these two lanes
And oh, the endless skies
You and me and everything just flies

It don't mean much if it isn't fun
But since we're already on the run
It'd be crazy, crazy even if
We thought of stopping now

So settle your affairs and reap what you sow
Just reap it in the car ?cause we gots to go
Launching up the highway like a catapult
Don't you look back or you're a pillar of salt

So up jumped the devil got his hand to your ear
And he wants to say what you wanna to hear
With the pedal to the metal we're a kettle and pot
Running deep into the black ink given whatever we've got

And oh, it never rains
You and me and these two lanes
And oh, the endless skies
You and me and everything just flies

Now you can take it on faith from my boy bourgeois
Wild if it's okay
Don't you drive too fast ?cause it's against the law
Wild if it's okay

I get a little wild if it's okay
Because I can drive me one more day
Into this crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy wide open world

And oh, it never rains

And oh, the open skies

Who needs to humor me and tell me lies

Yeah, humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie, too, and say I don't mind

And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights

Hey, baby, let's keep in touch
But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me

She could make me alive
I don't think she's dead or anything, but I still feel haunted
Something in the way she said goodbye
This time

The night before
It could be me but it seemed like I needn't return
That's right little johnny gets to go and fight his war
And as he rides off in the sunset he feels the last ray's burn
And shine

The setting sun, though we ain't done
The setting sun, though we ain't done
The only one that makes me run
The setting sun, though we ain't done

What the hell did she mean
When she turned away and said ""don't you ever forget me""
And why the sad routine
The tear in her eye, and my big reply
When I said you'd never let me
Oh no, not she

I found a letter
I found it in a pocket that she must have slipped it in
It basically told me to forget her
Now I ain't no genius, but I think I could begin
To see

The setting sun, though we ain't done
The setting sun, though we ain't done
The only one that makes me run
The setting sun, though we ain't done

With the sun obscured from view
And none but the night left to keep me warm
Is it me my darling, there's nothing left to do
But surrender to the coming storm
Where I am born

With nothing to lose, and freedom to gain
I rode west at nightfall through freezing rain
Relying on luck, and the wit of my brain
Visions of plunder and endless campaign
Numb the pain

There is comfort in the sun
And the earth is good and soft
Now my sail catch the wind send my chariot aloft
I am rounding all the parapets
As another city burns
Harvest all creation for it's ominous return
And then well before dawn
In cover we've gone

Moving on to the next after killing my prey
Growing steadily easier each one I'd slay
By blood and by battle, making my way
Onto the breach and into the fray
When I play

There is comfort in the sun
And the earth is good and soft
Now my sail catch the wind send my chariot aloft
I am rounding all the parapets
As another city burns
Harvest all creation for it's ominous return
And then well before dawn
In cover we've gone

Storm bring your flood waters, turn desert to sea
Destroy all my obstacles, whatever they be
Extinguish all light and fell every tree
Set me free!

A sudden tempest blows
She dwindles and dims against the cold, cold winds
And oh¡­oh¡­oh¡­
And then she grows, she keeps growin and growin and growin
Somehow, I gotta come and see
Some way, she's familiar to me
Gently, she'd try and try and try
It amazes me
And I gotta find out why

Nothing for me to do, with or for or to
But oh¡­oh¡­oh¡­
I just love to watch her go
Said I love to watch her go
Gonna watch her go

I am the river that bends the branch
I am the tempest that dwindles the flame
No one can stand the avalanche
The beast can be bargained but he can't be tamed
Balance and equilibrium lost
No one can hold me or alter my fate
The die casts love before the Rubicon crossed
Trying not to move, but momentum won't wait
It's too late

Une insomnie qui tourne au cauchemar

Un genre gangster vient m'accoster 
Joue le mystère pour m'épater
Là sous la pluie il veut bavarder
Ses p'tits ennuis me donnent la nausée

Don't be afraid, 
Wipe the sleep from your eyes, gotta stay awake.
It's, only a day away, 
At the same time it's like a year ? away.
It's another maze, would they have it anyway, it's another case.
Face it, another page, price you gotta pay, pay. 
Done the first few, now it's another stage.

This is my side of the story, 
This is my blood, sweat, tears and glory.
? them blood and it really gets ? no lie ?.
Deal with the pressure, comes with the pain, 
So cruel, friends won't look at me the same.
It's a clown with a smile like it doesn't mean a thing, 
But my heart burns with pain.
Tomorrow is the day, so I'm counting
Down the hours until the plain's landing.

You've made me break a many true vow

Blumentopf,"Niemals wird es wieder so werden wie es war
und deshalb nehm' ich meinen Stift und markier' mir dieses Jahr
in meinem Tagebuch mit einem schwarzen Rand.
Alles begann damit, dass Take That aus den Bravo-Charts verschwand.
Einfach abgelöst von einem Dancefloor-Act.
Ich wurde damals Zeuge wie so manche Fans vor Schreck i
Ihren Piercing-Ring verschluckten und den Teddy fallen ließen
denn Howard und Jason und wie sie alle hießen
die gehörten ganz nach vorne und nicht in den Hintergrund.
Meine Schwester wählte sich für den TED die Finger wund
denn für ihre Stars hätte sie alles unternommen.
Doch damit nicht genug, es sollte noch viel dicker kommen.
Take That war ihr einziges Hobby.
Es war schon verdammt schwer für sie als sich Robbie
vom Rest der Band trennte - das war nicht ihr Glückstag
Doch dass sie sich dann ganz auflösten brach ihr das Rückgrat.

Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen.
Weißt du nicht, dass sowas Scheiße ist?

Es ist schon wirklich seltsam, wie die Dinge gehen.
Ich schaue mir die Welt an, kann sie manchmal
einfach nicht verstehen.
Ich weiß, das Leben ist nicht immer fair, 
Doch die Erde dreht sich weiter, als ob nichts gewesen wär'.

Wir wussten damals nicht, wir krank sie war
versuchten es mit BSB, dem Methadon für Junkies dieser Art,
kauften alle Poster, Weihnachts- und Osterausgaben
von Bravo-Girl und Mädchen, wollten bloß darauf warten
dass sie die Jungs vergaß, doch sie aß kaum einen Bissen,
wollte nichts von Backstreet Boys und Bed'n'Breakfast wissen
und so blieb das Kopfkissen in ihrem Bettchen nass
und eines Tages kam der letzte Auftritt bei Wetten dass?
Unvorstellbar, diese Massenhysterie.
Ich verstehe nicht, wieso sich die Verfassungsschützer nie
mit Take That beschäftigt haben, denn sowas
gab's nicht einmal bei Scientology oder den Zeugen Jehovas.
Und Thomas Gottschalks Spott half auch nicht
um die Fans zu beruhigen, es war einfach unglaublich:
weibliche Tränen, unbeschreibliche Szenen
und meine Schwester beschloss, das Zeitliche zu segnen.

Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen.
Weißt du nicht, dass sowas Scheiße ist?

Es ist schon wirklich seltsam, wie die Dinge gehen.
Ich schaue mir die Welt an, kann sie manchmal einfach nicht verstehen.
Ich weiß, das Leben ist nicht immer fair,
doch die Erde dreht sich weiter, als ob nichts gewesen wär'.

Dann nach dem letzten Lied kam's zur Eskalation.
Es war während der Werbung, als der Rest der Nation
sich 'n neues Bier aufmachte dachte keiner daran,
daß meine Schwester grad eben aus dem Fenster sprang.
Wir fanden sie im Garten, neben dem Hibiskus.
Ein weiteres Opfer von Boygroup-Fanatismus.
Wann ist Schluß mit dieser Scheiße, 
Wie viele Teenies müssen noch ins Gras beißen!?
Der CD-Player lief noch, ich hörte es deutlich
""How deep is your love""
es waren sechs Meter neunzig.

Da steigen einem die Tränen in die Augen.
Weißt du nicht, dass sowas Scheiße ist?",6 Meter 90,1997
Blumentopf,"Kennst du das Gefühl, wenn du dich anstrengst, 
Und alles, was du kriegst, 
Sind nur Tritte in den Arsch, wie die Römer bei Asterix. 
Ich weiß nicht, was verflixt nochmal mit mir los ist, in letzter Zeit, 
Da fühl' ich mich, als hätte ich ein riesen großes 
Schild auf meiner Stirn eintätowiert auf dem steht
„Behandelt mich wie Scheiße. 
„Irgendetwas geht hier nicht mit rechten Dingen zu, 
Kannst du mir erklären, was ich für schlechte 
Dinge tu, dass du so tust, als wär' 
Ich gar nicht da, du nimmst mich gar nicht wahr, 
Ist dir denn gar nicht klar, du bist der Star in meinem Film, 
Doch du machst dich rar. 
Was bringt es, wenn ich abends auf die Piste geh, 
Nur um zu sehen, dass ich nicht auf deiner Gästeliste steh? 
Mir ist es eh klar, du bist unerreichbar für mich, und könnt ich dich vergessen, wäre alles leichter, doch das schaff ich nicht. 
Und genau das ist das Verrückte, mein Leben kommt mir vor, wie ein Sprung von einer Brücke ohne Bungee- Seil und ich fühl' mich alles andere als funky, weil ich weiß, dass du mich nicht unten auffängst,
Dich wahrscheinlich lieber aufhängst, als mit mir was anzufangen und ich denke, das ist der Anfang vom Ende.

Und ob ihr's glaubt oder nicht, mir geht es echt beschissen.
Und ob ihr's glaubt oder nicht, mir geht es echt beschissen.

Ich öffne eine Flasche Bier, 
Doch das ist nicht die erste, denn was mir heut' passiert ist, 
War vermutlich der schwerste Schlag ins Gesicht seit langer Zeit. 
Und alles, was mir jetzt noch bleibt, ist die Erinnerung an die Vergangenheit. 
Ich hatte Hoffnung, und dacht' es würde klappen. 
Und jedes Mal, wenn ich sie traf,
konnt' ich mich dabei ertappen, 
Wie ich nervös wurde, mein Bauch drehte sich, sie kam zu mir rüber und dann redete ich mit ihr. Wobei mein Blick nicht aus ihren Augen wich, irgendetwas an ihr verzaubert mich. Ist der zarte Klang ihrer Stimme, die tief braunen Augen oder was auch immer es ist. Ich kann's nicht sagen, ich kann nur sagen, sie gefällt mir, nein, es ist mehr und gerade diese Sache stellt mir ein Bein. 
Doch jetzt kann ich so schnell nicht mehr aufstehen, 
Ich weiß noch den Tag, da wollte sie mit mir ausgehen. 
Ich dachte, es wär' ein Anfang, coh ich weiß seit heute
Für sie bin ich nicht mehr als ein ganz normaler Freund. 
Ich schließ' die Augen und steck' den Kopf in meine Hände. Das ist der Anfang vom Ende.

Ja beim Hiphopen bin ich schon ewig dabei,
Als ich angefangen hab erstma' überlegen,
Da war ich etwa drei, Jahre jünger als heute,
Und das breaken in der Fußgängerzone
War gar nicht ohne aber ohne mich also verschone mich
Mit dem Geschwätz, und wenn ich manchmal
Von Raps zu viel hab dann versetz' ich mich
Ein Stück zurück als ich noch klein war
Ich klaute Lollies vom Spar, Captain Future ware mein Star
Schlich mich dann raus auf leiser Sohle
Und machte gleich was auf dem Fahrrad mit der Spritzpistole
Ich war, schlau wie Howie, aus Colt für alle Fälle,
Doch ich kickte keine Reime, nein ich kickte Bälle,
Direkt ins Tor statt ins Ohr,
Und als ich dann traf kam ich mir wie ein Prinz vor,
Ich war der Pimpf des Jahres, der kleine drei Käsehoch,
Steckte schon damals, meine Nase nicht mehr in mein Lesebuch.

Als ich klein war, waren alle Mädchen für mich Luder,
Meine bester Spielkamerad hieß Computer,
Doch keiner kam zu kurz, ich hackte auf beiden rum,
Warum, ich war 'n Hacker und die Mädchen konnt' ich,
Nicht leiden drum hielt ich auch, nicht sehr viel von Frauen,
Nur die Hand meiner Mutter um mir Spielzeug anzuschauen,
Ich waren Spätzünder doch die Bombe tickte und ging hoch wie die
Hoch wie, ihr wisst es die Bombe von Tobi,
Denn ich wurde älter und packte es kaum,
Meine Gedanken drehten sich nur noch um nackte Frauen,
Teenies in, Bikinis und in, schicken Tops, bekamen schon damals,
Von mir die dicken Props, denn die Liebe zu den Frauen,
Oder auch nur die Freundschaft, ham' uns so den Kopf verdreht
Wie es nicht mal ein Joint schaft,
Und weil sich meine Begeisterung jetzt kaum noch im Rahmen hält,
Widme ich diese Strophe nur der Damenwelt.

Gern erinner' ich mich an die Zeit,
Als ich noch ein vierzehn Jahre alter Schreihals war,
Mit schulterlangem Haar,
Ich hörte Trash und Death-Metal,
Kein Gedanke an 'ne Jam oder 'n Rap-Battle,
Bei Guns 'n Roses konnt' ich jeden Text von der Platte und hatte,
Zwei Aufnäher von Slayer auf meiner Bomberjacke,
Mein Vater sagte, was du braucht ist mal 'n Arschtritt,
Neue Klamotten, und 'n vernünftigen Haarschnitt,
Stress mit den Eltern, und mit den Mädchen,
Das lag an meiner Haut denn von einem Tag zum nächsten,
Wurdes immer schlimmer, die Pickel wurden sichtbar und ihr wisst ja,
Man ist echt gearscht mit 'nem Gesicht wie 'ner Pizza,
So dachte ich ich träum' meine Leben lang nur vom Sex und krieg,
Eher 'n Komplex, als 'ne Frau ins Bett doch jetzt,
Wo jeder Kopf zum Blumentopf-Demo wippt,
Stoppt mich niemand auf meinem Egotrip.

Ich weiß noch genau, wie das alles begann

In ein paar Jahren da sitz' ich sicher schon im Altenheim,
Wie 'ne Platte voller ? wird mein Gesicht dann voller Falten sein,
Und statt Respekt, bekom' ich dann Rente,
Es ist noch gar nicht lange als ich meine Haare kämmte,
Doch jetzt hab ich 'ne Platte auf dem Teller einen Radi,
Kahl bin ich auf meinem Kopf geworden,
Denn ich sah die Haare ausfallen, wie damals die Ducks,
Auf den Konzerten und zur Geschwindigkeit des Takts,
Meines Herzschrittmachers wippt mein Kopf,
Und schlägt mein Herz noch für den Topf
Für meine alten Freunde, als einen Scherz betrachtete
Ich früher die old-schools, doch heute seh' ich sie
In einem Spiegel vorn am Rollstuhllauf,
Ich bin alt, und kann ich mal allein auf den Lokus,
Und alles was ich hab Sinn noch ein paar alte Fotos,
Von damals, denn eh du es merkst ist dein Frühling zu Ende,
Und es ist Herbst.

Blumentopf,"Ich hab eine Crew, und die heißt Blumentopf. 
Drum höre mir zu und gib uns die Props. 
Denn wir haben den Funk und den Flow, 
Und wir sind im Haus, stehlen wir die Show.

Mikrofon-Check und schon rap' ich das Mic 
In der Hand und schon steck' ich dich an wie ein Virus mit Flavour und Funk. 
Denn der Style, den ich zeig' der ist krank wie multiple Sklerose. 
Wo ich bin, gibt es die größte Verwirrung, denn jedermann fragt sich
„Wer ist denn er?“ Ich verrat's nicht, 
Denn ich komm immer inkognito, niemals allein und drum rock' ich so ab, wie Naomi am Laufsteg. Überall dort wo ich auftret', 
Stellen andre MC's sich die Frage „Was hat er, das ich nicht habe?“

Ich hab eine Crew, und die heißt Blumentopf. 
Drum höre mir zu und gib uns die Props. 
Denn wir haben den Funk und den Flow, 
Und wir sind im Haus, stehlen wir die Show.

Ich hab das Mic also komm ich, denn es gibt nichts wovon 
Ich keinen Plan hätt, denn der 3
4 Takt zu dem ich rappe, ist ein Versuch, 
Das ist der, was? Groove. Du sagst das stimmt nicht, 
Doch das bringt mich nicht aus dem Takt. 
Denn ich hab ein Metronom. 
Kennst du denn mein Demo schon? 
Wenn nicht, tut es mir leid. 
Wir waren schon immer der Zeit voraus, 
Mit Beats von Morgen bringen wir den Funk aus dem Norden. 
Wohin denn? Überall hin! Klar, dass wir die coolsten sind.

Ich hab eine Crew, die Blumentopf heißt 
Und die ist so cool, dass sie Eiswürfel scheißt. 
Denn wir ham' den Groove, und auch den Flibo, 
Und sind wir im Haus, stehlen wir dir die Show, Baby!",Ich Habe eine Crew,1997
Blumentopf,"Ich bin in der Muffathalle, so wie jeden Donnerstag, und seh' ein
Mädchen, sie hat'nen perfekten Körperbau und trägt eines dieser
Knappen Kleider, die ich besonders mag, und seit dem Augenblick
Als ich ihr Lächeln sah gehört der Frau mein Interesse. Doch ich steh
Allein in der Ecke, denn nur mit 'nem Mikro in der Hand hab' ich 'ne
Groß' Fresse und bin selbstbewusst. Ansonsten bin ich eher
Schüchtern, doch der Abend war lang und ich bin nicht mehr ganz
Nüchtern also geh ich auf sie zu, hoff' das sie es nicht merkt, ich hab
Was großes in der Hose und es ist mein Herz. Trotzdem sag ich: Du
Kennst mich Kung Schu vom Topf, für meinen Flow und den Funk
Aus München Nord krieg ich die Props. Sie war kein Hip Hop Fan
Wie Anna, sie lacht mich aus und sagt
Meine Mama hat mir gesagt
Ich soll nie mit Fremden sprechen und ich glaub ich wär' schon lange
Nackt wenn deine Augen Hände hätten! Außerdem steh ich nicht auf Typen
Bei denen die Brustwarzen näher zusammenstehen als die Augen! Doch ich
Steck' nicht gleich meinen Kopf in den Gasherd, es gibt noch tausend
Andere und einen Versuch war es wert. Man kann nicht immer gewinnen,
Manchmal versagt man kläglich aber wer sich selbst nicht bewegt der
Bewegt nichts.

Strikt nach dem Motto jeden Tag ne gute tat, dies war nie
Das was zählt, aber ich lebe danach. Denn die Welt wird
Nicht besser, solang keiner Gutes tut, drum helf ich denen, die
Sich selber nicht helfen können. Mir tut es gut, wenn ich am Abend
Sagen kann „Heute war ein guter Tag!“ Drum plan' ich meine gute Tat
Und mach mich auf zum Supermarkt, denn die Regale sind voll von
Sklaverei und Unterdrückung. Ich geh zum Tiefkühlfach und besorg'
Mir hundert Stück von Käpten Iglos feinsten Fischstäbchen
Erster Klasse. Ich kauf hier gerne ein, wegen dem Mädchen an der
Kasse, aber heute geht's um mehr, eine Mission ist zu erfüllen.
Ich fahr zum Hauptbahnhof und nehm' den ICE nach Sylt. Ich geh
Zum Strand und seh' das Ende meines langen Weg, es ist die
Vorderste Planke an dem großen Landesteg. Ich setz' mich an
Die Kante und hör' ein leises Raschecken neben mir, und ich öffne
Meine große Reisetasche. Hört ihr den Ruf der Wildnis? Hört ihr
Das Meeresrauschen? Ich schließ' die Augen, träum' davon mit euch
Zu tauschen, reiß' die Packungen auf und zähle leise bis
Drei, schwimmt nach hause, ihr seid frei.

Ich dacht' mal alles wird gut, doch das ist lange her. Ich mach
Die Augen auf und wünschte, dass alles anders wär', denn wohin ich
Auch schau ich seh' das Elend dieser Welt, Umweltkatastrophen,
Hungersnot und wieder stellt sich mir die Frage, warum unternimmt
Denn keiner was dagegen? Ich forsche nach und suche nach dem
Ursprung allen Elends. Und plötzlich komm ich drauf woher der Wind
Weht, denn die Welt wird nicht besser, nur weil sie sich dreht.
Also weiss ich jetzt genau, was ich tun muss, Ich nehm' 'nen Hammer,
'Nen Holzpflock und ein langes Seil und zum Schluss noch unsern
Wellensittich Julius Cäsar aus dem Käfig pack alles in meinen
Rucksack, und geh zu Fuß zum Sportplatz, der bei mir ganz in der
Nähe ist. Dort angekommen nehm' ich erst mal den Hammer und klopf
Damit solange auf den Pflock bis ein langer teil tief in der Erde
Steckt, und bind daran das Seil an einem Ende fest. An das andere
Den Vogel mit 'nem kleinen Knoten, ich nehm' ihn sanft in die Hand
Und Schleuder ihn nach oben, direkt meinem Problem entgegen, der
Erdrotation. Ich ruf ihm nach „Julius, du schaffst das schon!“
Flieg nur der Sonne entgegen, die schon tief im Westen steht.
""Ich seh', wie das Seil sich spannt und ich weiß, dass es geht.
Ich fühl' mich wirklich gut während ich nach Hause wander', die
Menschheit ist uns jetzt bestimmt auf ewig dankbar. Morgen früh
Steht die Erde still, und dann wird alles gut. Es war schon
Lange an der Zeit, dass jemand etwas tut.",Mach Was!,1997
Blumentopf,"Ich will morgens in den Spiegel schauen ohne zu erschrecken
'nen Fernsehsender den ich anschauen kann ohne zu zappen

ich will genug Gras und wenn nicht,dass du noch 'nen Zug hast für mich
ich will im Walkman jeden Tag 'nen neuen Mix neue Tricks stehen mit meinem Skateboard
will die New York Nicks sehen in den Playoffs
prall gefüllt wie bei Baywatch die Badeanzüge will ich mein Portemonnaie
auf jedem fest wen treffen mit dem ich mich sofort versteh

Nebendran will ich 'nen tauben Nachbarn ich will auch mal meine Hits

und 'nen Pizzaservice der noch schneller ist als Mario
beim Kartfahren nur überrundete von hinten sehen müssen
auf jedem Sitzklo will ich im stehen pissen ich will Freunde
die für mich da sind wenn ich sie brauch ich will ich auch

Ich weiß man kann nicht immer alles haben wir haben es nicht
in der Hand doch ich bin erst zufrieden wenn alle kriegen
was sie auch verdienen ist denn das zuviel verlangt 2 mal

Ich will bezahlbaren eintritt und 'n Publikum das mitdenkt mehr
Lieder mit Sinn der tiefer geht als mein schritt hängt will den
Schlüssel am Bund mit dem man jedes Herz aufmacht und das ganze
Geld zurück das ich verraucht hab will jemand haben der auf mich
aufpasst wenn ich es nicht tu und an jedem Wochenende will ich
ein neues Rendezvous mit einem Publikum und einem instrumental
jedes Mal will ich schwitzen wenn ich rap' und manchmal will ich weg
um die Scheiße nicht riechen zu müssen in der ich steck'
ich will in meinem Zimmer 'nen Videobeamer anstelle von Tapete und
mal 'n Date mit 'ner Frau wo ich mich nicht verspäte
ich will endlich mal von Columbo die Frau sehen ich will das mir die
rettenden Ideen niemals ausgehen nie aufstehen ohne zu wissen
wofür und nur dem Respekt zollen dem auch Respekt gebührt

Augenblick in meinen leben bereuen und niemals aufwachen müssen

schwer ist ich will' n Kasten haben der nie leer ist das wär' es
ich will in meinem Walkman immer volle Batterien und auch auf die

selbst und mein Ding durchziehen egal was du davon hältst ich

Mike Specht komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf
Ich weiß es gibt Props

Ich hab genug von dem Geschwätz
Und ich brauch für gute Raps
Keinen Text über Breakdance oder Fatcaps
HipHop Tracks sind mehr als das
Wer's nicht glaubt auf den scheiß' ich
Täglich reiß ich mir meinen Arsch auf
(Und wofür) Weiß nich'!
Nicht mal zum grillen reicht die Kohle die ich krieg
Doch wenn ich rap' brennt mein Herz und das ist mir wichtig
Und ich richt' mich immer nur nach meinem Kopf
(Geh ans Mic, kick den Scheiß für den Topf)
Du willst 'n Battle gegen mich, eins gegen eins,
Komm doch her wenn du dich traust, und bring deins gegen meins
Die Waffen, zwei Mics, geschossen wird mit Styles
Den Ring in dem wir kämpfen müssen, klatschender Kreis
Was jeder weiß (Nur wer rockt kriegt die props)
Doch nur am Kindergeburtstag schlägt man den Topf
Ein Diss geht an all diejenigen die dachten wir schaffen's nicht
Wer phat ist, wird auch phat, echte Kiffer paffen nicht

Holundermann komm' und kick' deinen Scheiß für den Topf
Ich weiß' es gibt Props
Holundermann komm und kick' deinen Scheiß für den Topf

Ich hinterlasse Spuren in deinem Kopf
Wie ein Freerider im Tiefschnee
Und wenn mein Rap zu diesem Beat leider schiefgeht,
Dann ist es scheißegal, ich weiß ich krieg Props
(Kick den Scheiß für den Topf)
OK ich versuch's
Ich hinterlasse Spuren in deinem Kopf
Wie 'n Hund der an nen Baum pisst
Ich rock' das Haus, und morgen schon dein Raumschiff
Denn ich bin der Captain Future unter den MC's
An all die rappenden Lutscher, hier ist euer Diss
(Ihr seid mies)
Denn euer Flow ist sonderbar, wären Raps Titten
Bräuchtet ihr 'nen Wonderbra,
Spiel den Partyclown oder mach auf hart
In deinen Timberlands, scheißegal
Ab in den Sandkasten, mit Kinderbands wie deiner,
Tausch das Mikro ein gegen Förmchen und Eimer,
Ein Vergleich zwischen dir und mir ist wie Mutter Beimar
Auf dem Laufsteg neben Claudia Schiffer
Paff deine Tüten und verkauf dich als Kiffer
Wenn du glaubst du hast es nötig
Aber miss dich nicht mit München
Kauf' dir Maggi-Fix denn dein Flow hat lauter Klümpchen

Goetheplatz Mentality
Rock die Party, bin kein König mit Thron
Bin gegen Monarchie
Habe Kraft wie Kräftige, missbrauch' sie nicht wie Mächtige
Geht's um mächtige Raps bin ich der übliche Verdächtige
Ich wachs' nach oben will nach unten
Durch meine Roots gebunden für nur 48 Stunden
Verstummten jene Runden von Fachkundigen
Tief in meinen Tracks versunken
Wie deine Fans über deinem Text in der Bunten
Hast dein Publikum gefunden
Als superfetter, superhohler, Deutschrapper, Mikrophon-Schwarzennegger
Der Mund ist groß, dein Hirn jedoch ein Mikrochip
Dein Auftritt war ein Ausblick auf dein dein wahres ich, ein
Egotrip
Ich lebe in der heiligen Stadt David's, nicht in Bethlehem
Vertrete den Mob mit den Jungs die die Drähte ziehen
Die Positionen sind besetzt
Geht S1? auf die Beats, 58 auf die Raps

Master P komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf

Master P komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf

Alles klar ich fang' an denn keiner kann's erwarten
Ich bring den coolen Flow und da gehen alle anderen baden
Aber nicht weil ich spucke, meine Reime fließen von Natur aus
Doch nicht nur aus diesem Grund gibt's die Props
Ich hab die Skills von denen alle Rapper träumen
Sie heulen denn jeden Tag burn' ich mit was neuem
Irgendwie lieb ich das, selbst wenn es mir beschissen geht
Häng' ich ab, während sich das Rad der Zeit dreht
Ich kick den Scheiß für den Topf den sich alle reinziehen
Drum fragt mich keiner mehr nach meinem Namen (jeder weiß ihn)
Es ist der Fame der mich verfolgt
Gebt mir nur einen Beat, ein Mikrophon und meine Crew,
Dann kriegt ihr was ihr wollt,
Die fetten Tracks, und die kommen aus der Stadt die so verträumt
Ist,
München, burn' dich alle 97

Kung Schu komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf

Kung Schu komm und kick deinen Scheiß für den Topf

Ich steh im Rampenlicht, alle sehen mich, und fragen sich,
Was macht diesen kleinen Scheißer so verdammt frisch
Kommen nach der Show, wollen wissen wie Freestyle rappen geht,
Was man als erfahrener Rapper abends macht oder trägt
Ich trag' mein kleines schwarzes Reimbuch immer mit mir
Und Freestyle Rappen klappt nur wenn ich mich konzentrier
Alle verstanden - Hör zu - weil es jetz langsam Zeit wird
Für meinen legendären Style des Rap
Ich bring geile Tracks mit Gefühl auf Vinyl
Ich bin der gegen-den-Strom-Schwimmer
Und sah leider schon manchen meiner Helden aus den alten Zeiten
Mit dem Kopf nach unten an mir vorbei treiben
Dein zwischen alten Idealen und neuen Maxis
Liegt der feine Unterschied zwischen Theorie und Praxis
Falls auch wir nicht so viel kriegen wie wir geben
Will ich die Straße auf die ich heute stolz bin
Später mal nicht fegen
Drum geh ich immer wieder auf Arbeitsamt
Und danach komm ich mir vor wie ein Fußballspieler der im
Abseits stand
Umsonst gerannt, haa, denn in Wahrheit fand ich dort,
Nur Alternativen zu Alternativen zu Alternativen
Irgendwas find' ich schon, und das wann und wo das wie lang und
Wovon
Ist für mich gar nicht so wichtig,
Weil ich weiß wofür dieser Ton in deinem Ohr
Ist mein Fuß in deiner Tür (lass mich rein)
Durch die Ohren in den Kopf in dein Gehirn
Und ich rocks, ah, PROPS",Props,1997
Blumentopf,"Ich rap' für Talkshowgäste und Moderatoren,
Für Besserwisser, Labersäcke, alle, die meine Ohren
Strapazieren, denn euch allein verdank' ich dieses Lied,
Weil ich weiß, dass jeder von euch sein bestes gibt,
Um jedem zu zeigen, das Reden Schweigen ist,
Wenn man nichts zu sagen hat, das man ehrlich meint.
Ich hab' es satt, auf euer Geschwätz geb' ich soviel
Wie in 'ne Sammelbox der Kelly-Family, und zwar keine
Fünf Pfennig! Und dabei bleib' ich, lebenslänglich,
Denn viel zu viele Leute haben keinen Plan, aber
Reden ständig! Die Welt ist voller Fakes,
Fünfzigjährige auf Rollerblades
Hängen ihrer Jugend nach, um sich vor ihrem Alter zu verstecken
Und auf den Straßen demonstrieren die politisch Korrekten,
Die mit dir Gotcha spielen und schreien, dass Soldaten Mörder sind,
Die morgens Müsli essen und abends bei Burger King.
Körner in der Schüssel und BSE im Schnitzel,
Bungeejump im Cyberspace für Kids als Nervenkitzel.
Alles stürmt nach vorne, aber keiner hat 'n Ziel,
Manchmal hab' ich das Gefühl, die Welt ist nur 'n Schattenspiel,
Bei dem jeder blufft, aber keiner auf's Ganze geht.
Der Schein trügt, denn wenn man näher an der Lampe steht,
Macht sich mancher kleine Zwerg zum Riesen.
Es gibt so viele schwache Sprüche, aber bitte merk' dir diesen:

Reden ist Schweigen, und Silber ist Gold,
Also glaube nicht dem Schein, wenn dich der Schatten verfolgt.
Reden ist Schweigen, und Silber ist Gold,
Also glaube nicht dem Schein, wenn dich der Schatten verfolgt.

Silber ist Gold, ich meine,
Die Dinge sind nicht immer so, wie sie auf den ersten Blick erscheinen.
Manchmal schließ' ich meine Augen, um klarer zu sehen
Und halt mir beide Ohren zu, um besser zu verstehen.
Schwätzer! Sag mir bitte nicht, was falsch und was richtig
Ist, denn ich weiß es eh. Ist es nicht alles nur
Erstunken und erlogen, wo nichts dahintersteckt
Außer Mundgeruch. Wo ist denn da der Sinn und Zweck?
Ich weiß, ihr könnt nur labern und schwätzen,
Doch was ihr heut' versprecht, habt ihr morgen doch schon längst vergessen!
Mehrere Versprechen halten wollen. 
Klar, dass das nicht klappt!
Ständig nur Ausreden bringen. Klar, dass das nicht klappt!
Silber als Gold verkaufen wollen. Klar, dass das nicht klappt!
Gestern wart ihr Mittelpunkt und heute seit ihr alle Spacks!
Wer nie die Wahrheit sagt, der kommt nicht weiter, das steht fest!
Und Lügen haben kurze, ihr kennt den Rest!
Ich hab' es satt, weil für mich fast nichts so schlimm ist,
Wie jemand mit'm falschen Image, will ich mich niemals
Im Spiegel anschauen und mir dabei denken
Ich bin's nicht. Mach keinem was vor und schon gar keinem was nach,
Denn ich weiß, in den meisten Wolfspelzen steckt 'n Schaf.
Zu viele sagen, was sie machen, kaum einer macht, was er sagt.

Viel zu viele Worte fallen so sinnlos wie Soldaten,
Drum haß' ich es zu reden, ohne wirklich was zu sagen.
Okay, ich gebe zu ein Joint ist meist der Grund, weshalb
In meinem Freundeskreis nicht viel geredet wird, doch ich weiß:
Wenn es still ist, trennt sich dir Spreu vom Weizen,
Denn ich kann mit allen Menschen reden, aber nicht mit jedem schweigen.
Alle zeigen, was sie können, kaum einer kann, was er zeigt.
Ist ja auch egal, wenn man nur laut genug schreit.
Zu viele Menschen vergeuden ihre Zeit, wollen mehr aus sich machen
Als sie sind, doch es ist nicht alles Gold, was glänzt,
Und wenn du vor dir selbst davonläufst, ist es ganz egal, wie weit
Du damit kommst, weil du in die falsche Richtung rennst.
Denn es ist nicht wichtig, wer du gern wärst,
Es ist wichtig, wer du bist, ist das richtig?
Und drum verzicht ich, bis zu dem Tag an dem mein Vater mal
Bekifft ist, darauf, und wenn du willst, geb' ich's dir schriftlich,
Jemand zu spielen, der ich eigentlich gar nicht bin,
Und wenn ich so nicht weit komm: mehr war halt nicht drin.

Was ich hab', hab' ich, was ich sag', sag' ich,
Was ich frag', frag' ich, und ich frage mich,
Was ich hab', hab' ich, was ich mag, mag ich,
Was ich sag', sag' ich, doch ich sage nichts.",Reden Ist Schweigen,1997
Blumentopf,"Verdammt nochmal macht den Weg frei, weg da!
Macht endlich mal Platz für ,n richtigen Rapstar,
Den Exmetaler. Props gehen Waisbrohd und Texta.
Und jetzt ist der Specht da,
Unschlagbar wie beim Würfeln die Sechser.
Ich bin extrafrisch wie ein Doublemint,
Und mein Flow so locker das er schwimmt.
Stimmt! Ein schlechter MC ist alles, wovor ich Angst hab?,
Denn es ist verdammt hart
Für mich, wenn jemand rappt, der keinen Funk hat.
Und keine fetten Beats, keinen Respekt, denn
Denn dies sind die MC?s, die ich fresse wie Pacman.
Du fragst dich sicherlich, woher ich meine coolen Raps hab?,
Denn von mir gab es doch bisher noch nie ein Textblatt.
Ich krieg mein Text auf kein Papier, denn es ist so
Er würde mir davon fließen wegen meinem Flow.

Ich habe keine Kohle, fahre keinen BMW,
Ich geh auf keine Party weil ich nur daneben steh?
Hab kein Joint in meiner Hand, weil ich gar nicht rauch?,
Und ich hab? auch keine Freundin, obwohl ich eine brauch?,
Doch ich hab? Skills, uh Baby ich hab? Skills.
Gib mir das Mic, einen Beat und ich zeig? dir meine fetten Skills.
Ich dominier? den Rap wie MIke Tyson das Boxen,
Schlachte mehr MC?s ohne Flow als die Engländer Ochsen
Wegen BSE, denn Rinderwahn und Schweinepest
Sind nur Kinderkram gegen die Art und Weise wie ich meine reime test'?
Weil mein Style sogar die Toten weckt,
Ich hör? keinen Idiotenrap sondern nur den rohen Dreck.
Aus München-Nord bringen wir den Groove aus dem Süden,
Ein Diss an all die Sonntagsrapper, die unter der Dusche üben.
Denn sogar unter Wasser kommt Holunder krasser
Als der ganze Rest, die sind erbärmlich.
Es gibt kaum einen der mich nicht kennt, ich bin berühmt,
Ich bin ein Star, und wenn ich die Bühne betret'? schreien alle Mädchen.
Ich komm? nie allein nur in Begleitung,
Alles was ich heute mach? steht morgen in der Zeitung.
Das ist auch klar, denn ich hebe mich vom Rest ab,
Hab ich das Mic geht auch im Altenheim ein Fest ab.
Denn meine Show ist gigantisch,
Rock? ich das ganze Haus rockst du gerade mal deinen Stammtisch.

Mein Rap bekommt Respekt, deiner leider nur Mitleid,
Nur die Zeit ist reif für uns, und, Jungs, wenn ihr nicht fit seid,
Dann übt nochmal daheim in eurem Hobbyraum,
Denn eure Crews sind Peanuts wie Cartoons mit Charlie Brown.
Also verdammt noch mal leg? dich nicht an mit dem Topf,
Das ist kein Spiel mit dem Feuer sondern mit Sprengstoff.
Jeder Rapper wär? froh wenn er in unserer Posse wär?,
Doch die meisten sind schlecht wie die Witze von Fossybär.
Die Zunge ist zu langsam, und der Flow hört sich krank an
Und der Style ist unfrisch wie die Klamotten von Punkern.
Wir sind dir so weit voraus, dass du nicht mehr zu starten brauchst,
Mir fallen schneller Reime ein, als dir dein Kartenhaus.
Ich hab? mehr Reime als du
Freunde, denn mein Reim kommt nie alleine wie du,
Und ?abhängen? hat mehr bpm als ihr IQ",Schreit Nach Neid,1997
Blumentopf,"Es dreht sich alles nur um Autos und Frauen,
Zusammen Kaugummi kauen auf'm Rücksitz
Es dreht sich alles nur um Autos und Frauen,
Denn Autos und Frauen machen uns glücklich

Schon beim ersten hinschauen war klar, da saß die Frau meines Lebens,
Neben mir im Stau zwischen Lindau und pretz'
Ich kurbelte die Scheibe ganz hinunter und ich sagte leise
Kurven so wie deine gibt's auf keiner Bundesstraße,
Nich' im Stuttgarter hügel-set und nich' in Leverkusen,
Grade richtig, weder Bügelbrett noch Megabusen,
Bei dir hat Gott die Größe seiner Handwerkskunst verewigt,
Denn du suchst deinesgleichen zwischen Bamberg und Venedig,
Gäb's dein lächeln auf CD bräuchte das Volk keine Platten mehr
Von Garmisch-Patenkirchen bis zum Holsteiner Wattenmeer
Bist du die Nummer eins von oder-neiße bis zur Ems
Und nicht mal Feuerbach hat so 'ne heiße braut, du brennst
Von Travemünde bis zum Karmener Kreuz
Beging ich hier und da 'ne Sünde hab die Damen nie enttäuscht
Hatte Phasen, da wollt' ich mit jeder schlafen,
Doch ab heute fährt mein kiel nur noch in deinen Bremer Hafen.
Wenn du auf Luxus stehst, schaff ich dir Porzellan aus Meisen an
Und werde Porsche fahren auch wenn ich's mir nicht leisten kann
Von Oberstauffen bis Flensburg werd' ich wie Lola laufen
Mit 'nem Endspurt knapp hinter oberhausen,
Weil nirgendwo da draußen noch eine deinen natürlichen Charme hat
Weder nördlich noch südlich der Linie Thüringen-Darmstadt,
Vergiß, wo Osten ist, wo du bist, geht die sonne auf!
Doch schneller als erwartet kam das ende von dem stau
Und plötzlich war sie vorn und ich im Pulk weiter hinten
Und ich sah nur noch langsam ihre schönen Schultern verschwinden
Mit dem wohl süßesten Muttermal der Menschheit
Glück und Schmerz liegen nah beisammen wie Wuppertal und Remscheidt

Es dreht sich alles nur um Autos und Frauen,
Zusammen Kaugummi kauen auf'm Rücksitz
Es dreht sich alles nur um Autos und Frauen,
Denn Autos und Frauen machen uns glücklich

Als wir uns trafen, da war klar, mit uns beiden, da wird's nicht ewig dauern
Wir saßen in 'nem Ort und rasten durch 'nen Regenschauern und lauschten
Ganz falsch angefangen, wart mal
Als wir uns trafen, da war klar, das mit uns beiden wird nicht ewig dauern
Wir saßen da und rauschten mit dem Auto durch 'nen dicken Regenschauer,

Lauschten dem prasseln der tropfen und kauten schweigend Kaugummi,
Uns beiden ging's genauso wie den Scheibenwischern
Stets in die gleiche Richtung unterwegs, doch immer trennte uns n kleines Stückchen voneinander
Auch runter geht's meist n bisschen schneller als bergauf
Ich, du und Seifenkisten oder 2 CV's
Wo bleibt die zeit, wenn man sie am meisten braucht?
Wir ritten auf der grünen welle und weit und breit nicht der kleinste Stau
Keine Sau auf der Straße außer ich neben dem schönsten aller Mädels in 'nem beigen Mercedes
Ja es war alles längst geregelt genau wie ihr Kat
Noch hundert Meter dann setzt sie mich vor der Haustüre ab
Sie war 'ne Frau, die immer wusste, wo's lang ging
So gut wie gar nichts konnt' sie aus der bahn bringen (Damn, sie war der Wahnsinn)
Und als wir ankamen, parkte sie ihren wagen und sagte zu mir, Zeit ist Geld
Und sie könnte nicht lange warten
Ich hätt' sie so gern in den arm genommen und geküsst

Doch alles was ich rausbrachte war mich, danke fürs fahren und tschüss!
Und als sie wegfuhr', war das einzige, was mir von ihr blieb
Als Erinnerung die Taxi-Quittung, die sie mir schrieb

Es dreht sich alles nur um Autos und Frauen,
Zusammen Kaugummi kauen auf'm Rücksitz
Es dreht sich alles nur um Autos und Frauen,
Denn Autos und Frauen machen uns glücklich",Autos und Frauen,1999
Blumentopf,"Trifft mein Stift auf Papier feiern alter Freunde Wiedersehenund wenn es dunkel wird, hörst do sie leise erzählen.Wenn die beiden sich zuprosten,tauschen sie zu vorgerückter Stunde Anekdoten ausund lauschen Fußnoten:?Hast do den Buntstift gesehen?Der war ja Spitz wie Nachbars Lumpi,und der hat nicht mal 'nen Radierer,do, der machts es ohne Gummi.Ach übrigens, 'nen schönen Gruß vom Briefkopf,und hab ich schon erzählt,ich hab 'n Date mit einer Seite von Notizblock;hab I'm Daumenkino Karten für heut' Abend bestelltund mit'n Anzug gekauft, 'nen echten Faber-Castell.So 'nen schicken schwarzen, mit Goldbuchstaben eingraviert,ich hoffe, ich gefalle ihr und sie ist nicht so kleinkariert.Na ja, ich muß jetzt los, wir beide sehen uns morgen.Ich wünsch' Dir Hals- und Minenbruch.? ??Und ich Dir Eselsohren.?So hörte ich jahrelang zu,fasziniert von den zwei,und der Stift blieb unberührt und das Papier noch immer weiß.
Chorus
Doch eines Abends hörte ich die Seite heulen:?Bleistift, ich bin so einsam, dass ich schon von Schreibschrift träum'.Gestern sah ich I'm Spiegel, dass ich allmählich vergilbe,als unbeschriebenes Blatt, mit keiner einzigen Silbe.??Hör auf zu jammern,? sagte der Bleistift.?Denk nur, was aus uns beiden alles werden kann,solange do noch weiß bist.Wenn wir es richtig anfangen machen wir Karriere;ein Blatt, richtig beschriftet, macht aus Pennern Millionäre.Die Menschen glauben an uns,mit dem richtigen Stempel tanzen sie heut' nach unser Pfeife,und morgen ihre Enkel.Und bitte, was ist denn der Menschheit größtes Erbe?Die Skizzen Picassos, die Bibel, Goethes Werke?Ob Einsteins Theorien oder Beethovens Neunte,die wirklichen Schöpfer waren doch stets unsere Freunde.Jungs wie do und ich sind Meisterwerke in Spe,egal ob chlorfrei gebleicht, mittelweich oder 6B?Da fing ich an zu schreiben, denn sie wurden übermütig,und ein paar Stunden später war vom Bleistift nichts mehr übrig.Und auch das Blatt Papier hatte jetzt andere Sorgen,denn hörst do diesen Text, dann weißt do,mehr ist aus ihm nicht geworden.?Dann gib mich wenigstens ins Altpapier.?murmelte das Blatt am Ende meiner letzten Strophe beleidigt.?Ich glaube nicht an Reinkarnation?,hab ich ihm entgegnet, und es danach I'm Ofen beseitigt.

",Block und Bleistift,1999
Blumentopf,"Wenn ich im Haus bin, dann wird dein Gehörgang zum Tanzboden,
Der Bücherwurm zum Tanzbären und Tonleitern zu Banknoten.
Denn wenn wir Platten rausbringen werden Getränkemarken zu Barschecks,
Nonsense zum Klartext, denn wenn ich Parts rap' 
Wird jede unsrer acht Spuren zum Charttrack. 
Roughnecks bekommen Halsschmerzen vom Mitnicken, 
Denn wenn wir unsern Shit kicken, will nicht nur Vestax mitmischen,
Weil unsre Texte haften bleiben, als schreiben wir sie mit Prittstiften.
Bei diesem Part wird der Krisenstab zum Joystick, 
Der Teufelskreis zum Riesenrad,Dunkelziffern zur Leuchtschrift.
Umzugskartons werden zu Beziehungskisten, 
Grade Lebenswege zu Buckelpisten und Junkies drücken im Kreuzstich.
Und nicht nur '99 wird zu unserem Jahr, ich bin draußen und verbeug' mich, 
Den Rest macht Holunder klar. 
Wenn wir Lastwagenweise unsere Platten verschicken werden 
Aus Sattelschleppern manchmal Hoffnungsträger,denn wenn wir euch das Gefühl, 
Das wir beim Rappen hatten, vermitteln, 
Werden aus Käufern Künstler und aus Opfern Täter. 
Greif' ich zum Papier werden aus Bleistiftminen Goldadern, 
Und auch die höchsten Bühnen werden zu einfachen Holzlagern.
Denn wenn ich rappe werden Vorbilder zur optischen Täuschung und mancher kleine Schleichweg zur vielbefahrenen Kreuzung. Ich nehm' blinden Aktionisten den Schwung weg und nutze auch die schlimmsten Abschusslisten als Sprungbrett.
Wo wir aufkreuzen werden Erfolgsleitern zum Fahrstuhl, und wenn Ihr ein Stück mit uns fahren würdet, wär' das arschcool,denn

Wenn ihr dabei seid, 
Dann gibt's ein Highlight,
Wir backen Fensterplätzchen bis zur nächsten Eiszeit
Wenn ihr dabei seid, kriegt ihr ein Highlight, bei uns
Gibt's Fensterplätzchen bis zur nächsten Eiszeit.

Wenn wir mal wieder aus dem Vollen schöpfen gibt's 'ne Flut von Schallwellen,
Doch eh' es losgeht solltet ihr die Aircondition kalt stellen.
Zieht die Jacke aus, holt was Kühles von der Hausbar,
Denn wenn wir rappen mache wir aus jedem Club 'ne Sauna.Wenn wir Mics auf Parties checken, wird der alte Butterkeks zum neuen Arbeitsplätzchen.
Stopp' ich eines Tages das Rappen, hört sogar Mona Lisa auf zu lächeln, das ist die Wahrheit Schätzchen, darauf kannst du Dein' Arsch verwetten.
Sogar der Papst verliert sein' Glauben, wenn ich rap.
I'm harder than the hardest, hardest heart can get
Hier kommen die Großreinemacher des HipHops, die auch mal zu dick auftragen,
Wie Schreinemakers Lidschatten und Lipgloss.
Denn unser Sprechgesang ist das Sprachrohr von Jungs,
Die mehr Connections haben als Mannesmann-Arcor,
Mit Videokonsole aber ohne regelmäßiges Sexleben,
Die wenn's nach ihnen ginge den ganzen Tag nur im Bett lägen,
Nicht wissen, was sie wollen, und nicht merken,
Wann sie stören, und nichts zu sagen haben,
Doch wenigstens das soll jeder hören.
Wir liefern Taktlosen die Beats und Wortlosen die Raps,
Die Dich bei Kälte wärmen könn' 
Wie Cordhosen und Caps,unsre Tracks verwandeln Buchstaben in Reizwörter
Und machen Deine Hifi-Anlage zum Heizkörper,und

Wenn ihr dabei seid, 
Dann gibt's ein Highlight,
Wir backen Fensterplätzchen bis zur nächsten Eiszeit
Wenn ihr dabei seid, kriegt ihr ein Highlight, bei uns
Gibt's Fensterplätzchen bis zur nächsten Eiszeit.

Wenn ich rap' dann werden Fahndungsbilder zu Urlaubsphotosund 
Aus 'nem Messer ein leckerer Schokoriegel mit Kokos.
Alle finden meine Texte super, und wenn ich einen bring',
Dann wird der kleine Sesselpupser zum Reimeking.
Wenn der Beat mein Herz erfreut wie 'n lächelndes Mädchen,
Kick' ich Flows, die komplizierter sind als essen mit Stäbchen.
Wir sind die besten im Ständchen, 
Und wenn wir's verlassen packen wir ein paar heiße Sachen in unsere großen Reisetaschen.Brauchst den Sound nicht leiser machen, 
Wenn das Lied dir taugt Steck' 'n Tape ins Tapedeck, 
Drück Rec und zieh's dir drauf. 
Wenn von den Wänden der Schweiß tropft,
Wisst ihr, wer das Mic rockt, und wenn ich dabei Gas geb',
Gibt das Publikum mir Treibstoff,
Obwohl ich meine Vorräte noch lange nicht verbraucht hab'.
Wir sind am Start und Ihr sollt wissen, wir sind laufstark. 
Wenn der Club heut' länger auf hat, nehm' ich das auf meine Kappe 
Und schätze nicht, dass ich mir damit Feinde mache.
Denn wenn wir Parties rocken werden Riesenprobleme zur Kleinigkeit,
Aus jedem Handwerk wird 'ne Beinarbeit,denn wenn ich rap', 
Dann wird der Ausfallschritt zum Einkehrschwung und jeder Track, 
Den ihr von uns bekommt ist 'ne Bereicherung.

Wenn ihr dabei seid, 
Dann gibt's ein Highlight,
Wir backen Fensterplätzchen bis zur nächsten Eiszeit
Wenn ihr dabei seid, kriegt ihr ein Highlight, bei uns
Gibt's Fensterplätzchen bis zur nächsten Eiszeit.",Fensterplatz,1999
Blumentopf,"Chorus
Fifty ? Fifty, gut ? böse, ja ? nein, an ? aus,
Kopf oder Zahl, Mann oder Maus
>Ich spiel mal Loser mal Gewinner,mal spiel ich den Normalen und dann den Spinner,
Doch ich selbst bleib' ich immer.Und ich frag' mich manchmalUnd ich fürchte das bin ich",Mann Oder Maus,1999
Blumentopf,"Meine Raps bitter wie Wodka und voller süßem Schmerz,
Wie'n kleines Lebewohl bring' ich sie alle übers Herz.
Ich bin heiß auf unsere nächste Show, wie n verliebter auf'n Kuss
Am Mic geh' ich tiefer als die Nautilus
Auf Platten die du kaufen musst, wie Manni sich n Fuchsschwanz
Und 'nen Breitreifen, der ganze Club tanzt,
Wenn wir zum Mic greifen und wie Tränen auf Heimreisen fließen,
Riesenpech für alle, die daheimbleiben.

Wir verteilen Mitbringsel an jedermann der eintritt,
Von der Hitsingle bis zum Insider-Geheimtip,
Für nen' Abend mit dicken Tracks und voll genialen Clubhits
Von denen du träumst wie von Tittenmags mit Tatjana Pattitz.
Doch wenn der Topf in deiner Stadt ist
Regnet es flows bis n Loch in deinem Dach ist
Rap ist meine Schwäche,
Ich kann nicht nein sagen wenn die Leute uns einladen
Zu Showeinlagen an freien Tagen
Mieten wir 'nen Kleinwagen
Nur um festzustellen, ob der Rest der Welt verstanden hat
Was wir gemeint haben
Und so rappen wir für Peanuts
Über Beats, hart und trocken wie die mitgebrachten Zwiebacks,
Übernachten in Biwaks zu fünft im Doppelzimmer, doch egal wie schlecht wir schlafen,
Wir rocken immer

Leg das Tape ein wie sich ein Techno-Kid 'nen Trip,
Dann gibt's 'nen frischen Hit und alle in der Runde nicken mit.
So als wollten sie zu jedem Takt ""ja"" sagen
Auch wenn wir nicht gefragt haben
Ob wir n dickes Ding am Start haben.
Wir kicken es jeden Abend in allen Lebenslagen
Und wenn wir noch nicht in deiner Gegend waren
Kommen wir in den nächsten Tagen
Und rocken Mic's das keine Frage offen bleibt.
Wart' auf den Zeitpunkt bis ich durch die Boxen steig
Dann rollen alle durch die Disco
Wir liefern euch ein Kraftpaket,
Bringen Massen in Bewegung wie die Love-Parade
Und feiern Parties, bei denen man auf das Ende länger warten kann,
Als auf dicke Zinsen von der Samenbank.
Weil hinter unseren Liveshows mehr als nur ein Hobby steckt
Also sicher dir 'ne Karte wie ein Fußballer mit 'nem Bodycheck

Willkommen bei meiner Spielshow heut' verlosen wir
'n Päckchen lange Blättchen, ne Palette Dosenbier
Und als Hauptgewinn 'nen Photoapparat mit Weitwinkel,
Dass du's festhalten kannst, wenn ich in deinen Teich pinkel'

Wir kommen vielseitiger als 'n Big Punisher Star-Schnitt
Denn der Topf hat den Shit zu dem jeder Kopf im Takt nickt
Mach ich Battletracks, will der Teufel persönlich ne Abschrift
Blumentopf - Wir pressen Leben in Plastik.
Pass auf, denn wenn ich Parts kick, bin ich schwerer aufzuhalten
Als Augen nach Schlafmitteln
Fazit, Klappt nicht
Denn Fakt ist, dass mein Rap wie Scharfschützen Dein' Geschmack trifft
Fakt ist,
Dass mein Text sogar für Q-Tip zu abstrakt ist,
Fakt ist,
Dass nicht jeder, der sein letztes Hemd gab nackt ist,
Fakt ist,
Dass man bei uns biten kann bis man satt ist
Weil sogar Obelix nach dem zweiten Gang geplatzt ist,
Von insgesamt 7000000380
Und das noch ohne Nachtisch
Ja wir servieren es knackfrisch
Unsern Stuff nicht zu mögen ist theoretisch nicht möglich
Und geht auch nicht praktisch
Mein gut gemeinter Rat ist:
Verpass' nie die Party, wenn der Topf in deiner Stadt ist

Sag' Witt und Heppner Bescheid, dass die Flut kommt
Wenn 'n dicker Rapper am Mic wie ich zum Zug kommt
Und wie 'n Pizzabäcker den Teig die Beats belegt,
Brauch nur bis zum siebten Take,
Bis jeder sich zum Beat bewegt.
Das hier wird Dein Lieblingstape,
Zeig's deinem Bekanntenkreis,
Nicht nur bisschen was von allem
Mann wir ham den ganzen Scheiss
Dieses Band ist heiß, denn von uns hat jeder Skills
Die deinen Sony burnen, bis der Tonabnehmer schmilzt

Sag' hast du genug?
Eigentlich Nein
Ja dann komm ich zum Zug ganz ohne Heiligenschein
Du willst wissen, was ich mein',
Schenk' dir reinen Wein ein
Denn Manuva ist so fies, ich stell mir meinen eigenen Reim.
Kaleidoskop-Clique
Vom Geheimtip zum Hit wie Manifesto
Freising ist das Nest wo es würzig wird wie Mamma's Pesto
Halbrohe Beats kein Zufall
Nur Mittel zum Zweck
Deine sind doppelt so voll,
Doch nur ein drittel so fett
Baby, das leben ist ein Chanson
So viele sagen am Mic „whutt, whutt“,
Ich sag „eins, zwo“  .
Drum vervielfältige ich Flows und Flyer im Copyshop
Und tanz' den Bodyrock auch in deinem Bodyshop",Quintessenz (Featuring Manuva),1999
Blumentopf,"In knappen Shorts und nassen Khaki ?Hemd durch den Dschungel der Großstadt,fern von Basiscamp, kommt die Partyband,die für Dich rockt, auch wenn do Dein Haar nie kämmstund'nen Kürbis poppst. Ich schmeiß' die Tür ins Schloss,beb' Mutti'n Kuss, I'm Frühling hock' ich mich oft mit nem Fuffi in' Busch,oder auf'ne grüne Wiese, wenn das Wetter mich lässt,fang' ich mir'ne süße Biene mit'nem Schmetterlingsnetz.Hey, der rapt ja nicht schlecht!Ich reite nie auf Modewellen,hab' nur Schwachsinn unter meinem Tropenhelm.Meine Strophen stellen Deine Platten in den Schatten,und wenn do mal wegwillst, helfen sie Dir packen.Bevor es losgeht, erstmal Gurts checken,wir fegen mit 106 bpm auf Eselsbrücken über Durststrecken,und nicht mal Grizmnek oder Jacques Cousteau sahen irgenwo'nLebewesen mitÄnem krasserem Flow.Ich wer' die ganze Nacht durchrappen,und wenn ich'n Mic hab', starte ich die Party ?Animal Treibjagd, mit dem Scheiss, der den Dancefloor so heiss macht,dass do Schwein hast, wenn do nicht Brandblasen bis hoch zum Bein hast.Angsthasen haben keinen Platz in unserm Jeep;bring Deine Kumpels mit, und Weed,fein wie der Unterschied, und wir geben Gas,>bis die Karre Funken sprüht>bis die Karre Funke sprüht",Safari,1999
Blumentopf,"Und als der Rest der Partyleute wie gebannt ins Strobo schaute,
Lag ich draußen mit dem Rücken gemütlich auf 'ner Motorhaube.
Auf einmal stand sie da, mit Puppis, groß wie 'ne Nickelbrille 
Und hauchte mit ins Ohr
„Schluck nur diese bittre Pille, und ich versprech' dir hoch und heilig,
du wirst alles besser blicken, doch um Gottes Willen beeil' dich,
Weil die Cops verdeckt ermitteln!“
Mein kleines Schwesterherz war ausnahmsweise nicht dabei,
Und es war ein Samstag, Alter, drum nahm ich gleich drei.
Eine Stunde später hatte ich meine letzte Mark versoffen
Und mein Hirn war 'ne Schüssel voll aufgeweichter Haferflocken.
Ich verließ' den Laden, zog alleine durch die Stadt
Das „heut' scheiß' ich auf alles“ Fieber hatte mich gepackt.
Ich trug mein neues Samstag Abend Ausgeh-Superheldendress,
Mit dem roten Umhang, grünen Schuhen,
Dem gelben Cap und 'nem großen goldenen D für Discoroller auf der Brust.
Am Gürtel hing 'ne Flasche Weißwein mit Schraubverschluss.
So ging ich in 'ne Straße', aus der viele Leute kamen
Und aus der Ferne sah ich unwahrscheinlich bunte Leuchtreklamen.
Ich ging näher ran, hörte coole Partymucke und ein Mädchen,
Das so aussah wie 'ne Barbiepuppe rief mir zu:
„Hey, du bist cool, denn deinen Umhang find' ich witzig!“
Da dachte ich bei mir „Flo, hier bist du richtig!“

Von Disco zu Disco 
Von Disco zu Disco
Von Disco zu Disco
Bis die Sonne aufgeht!

Ich ging weiter, und langsam wurde ein kleiner Club erkennbar,
Davor standen hunderte von Leuten am Geländer.
Ich schubste sie beiseite mit 'nem Lächeln,
Denn ein echter Partylöwe lässt sich niemals von 'ner Warteschlange fressen.
Der Türsteher, der mich um 'nen Kopf überragte,
Versperrte mir den Weg, lachte laut und sagte
""Wenn du die Partycrew suchst, Junge hier ist ihr Hauptquartier.
Doch heut' kommt da kein anderer mehr rein, außer dir!
Das wird der derbste Abend deines Lebens, du hast das große Los gezogen!""
Dann hat er mich vom Boden hochgehoben und auf seinen Schultern in den Club getragen.
Ich verteilte meinen Weißwein und Taschentücher für die Schnupfernasen.
Alle lachten, und schrien, dass ich das super mach',
Und dann trank einer nach dem anderen mit mir Bruderschaft.
Wir stießen an ""Auf das wir heut 'nen schönen Abend haben!"",
Und drehten sich im Kreis als wir uns in den Armen lagen,
Der DJ legte die ganze Zeit nur Klassiker auf,
Die Tanzfläche war voll, ich passte fast nicht mehr drauf.
Und jetzt kommt das derbste Alter, auch wenn du's nicht verstehen kannst,
Ich tanzte erst den Walzer und dann den Regantanz.
Die Pirouetten, die ich drehte, waren lupenrein
Und ich begrüßte jedes neue Lied mit lauten Jubelschreien!
Ich spürte, dass diese Nacht was ganz besonderes war,
Um das zu feiern holte ich mir erstmal 'nen Drink von der Bar.
Und als ich mich mit meinem Glas auf einen Hocker setzte
Sprach das kleine bunte Schirmchen, das in meinem Cocktail steckte:
„Sieh' da, ein neues Gesicht, dich hab' ich hier noch nie gesehen,
Und ich geb' Dir den guten Rat, du solltest lieber gehen.
Die Stimmung ist zwar super und die Mädchen fast splitternackt,
Doch um Himmels Willen verlasse diesen Club vor Mitternacht!“

Von Disco zu Disco
Von Disco zu Disco 
Von Disco zu Disco
Bis die Sonne aufgeht!

Ich ging erstmal aufs Klo, so wie immer einen kiffen
Und lud' meine Kumpels ein, die vor Freude in ihre Trillerpfeifen Pfiffen.
Ich rief nach der Kellnerin, dass sie mir nochmal einschenkt,
Wer hört schon auf 'nen Knirps in so 'nem albernen Hawaii-Hemd?
Vielleicht weißt du ja nicht, wovon die Rede ist,
Aber ich fühlte mich als ob mir ein Engel an die Seele pisst.
Ich drehte mich wie ein Kreisel um mich selbst,
Auf einmal warf sich ein Mädchen vor mir auf den Rücken wie der Benz vorm Elch und rief
„Es ist soweit, wir haben es gepackt altes Haus,
Ich sehe was, was du nicht siehst, und das haut dir den Schalter raus!“
Und dann gab es ein Blitzlichtgewitter,
Das grelle Licht schmerzte in meinen Augen wie tausend mickrige Splitter!
Sie brüllte mir ins Ohr, „Endlich kann ich ich selber sein!“
Und dann schossen aus ihrem Mund literweise gelber Schleim.
Ich sah ihr ins Gesicht und bekam 'nen üblen Schrecken,
Denn es war übersäht mit vielen großen grünen Flecken!
Ein Blick in ihre leeren, toten Augen lähmte.
Sie kam näher und zeigte mit die spitzen, faulen Zähne.
Und wahrscheinlich denkt ihr jetzt ich hab 'nen heftigen Schatten,
Doch ich schwör' ich war umkreist von diesen hässlichen Fratzen!
Es war 'ne Monsterparty, ich das kleine Häppchen,
Mit messerscharfen Krallen zerfetzten sie mein gelbes Käppchen!
Sie wollten mich, O.K. aber niemals ohne Kampf!
Deshalb schlug ich wild um mich und schrie dabei in Todesangst
""Es ist aus, kein Zufall, war meine letzte Platte!“
Doch dann hörte ich eine Stimme, die ich schon längst vergessen hatte
""Es ist doch immer das gleicht, aber auf mich hört ja keiner,
Und jetzt steckste mächtig in der Scheiße, Kleiner,
Aber halt dich einfach an mir fest, denn ich regle das schon!
""Und ich spannte das Cocktailschirmchen auf und schwebte davon.

nehm' ich ‘n halbvolles Glas von der Bar und rempel Dich an.

das war mein brandneuer Drink und der war voll bis zum Rand!
Dass do mir den ersetzt ist Dir doch hoffentlich klar!”
und ich bestell zeig auf Dich und sag: “Der Trottel bezahlt.”
Dann nehme ich mein Glas und trink auf meine miese Moral,
denn wenn es leer ist spielen wir das Spielchen nochmal.

do kannst natürlich immer gern mit Dein' Problemen zu mir kommen
und schon am nächsten Tag weiß in der Stadt dann jeder davon.
do schaust mich an und meinst: “Was soll denn der verdammte Scheiß?”
Hey Junge sei doch froh, geteiltes Leid ist halbes Leid.
do solltest dankbar sein, denn der Stress mit Deinem Mädel
zwecks der Eifersucht und so hat sich auf ewig erledigt.
Ich schwör ich hab's geregelt, ja alles lief super:
Alle denken jetzt do wärst vom anderen Ufer.

Die Parklücke vor dem Club ist wie immer zu klein,
doch ich sag: “Alter, kein Problem, ey ich wink' Dich da rein!”
Dann steig' ich aus, werf' die Tür zu, klemm' Deinen Finger mit ein,
geh' direkt in den Club und nehm' den ersten Drink schon allein.
'Ne halbe Stunde später musst do mir schon dringend was leihen,
und weil ich seh', do hast drei Fuffziger, link' ich Dir zwei.
Wenn do sie suchst sag' ich, “na weit kann das Ding ja nicht sein”,
bück' mich, geb' Dir einen zurück und forder' Finderlohn ein.
Und wenn ich seh', trotzdem beginnt der Abend Dir zu gefallen
sag' ich: “Ey ich bin am Ende Alter, bring' mich jetzt heim.”

Ey yo, do kennst mich vom Sehen und denkst: “Der ist aber freundlich drauf!”
Doch vielleicht spann' ich Dir schon morgen Deine Freundin aus.
Mann, hör' zu heulen auf, das würd' ich Dir nie antun,
Ich würd' Deine Freundin doch nicht anfassen, nicht mal mit Handschuhen.
Mann, word' nicht aggressiv, ich mach's wieder gut,

lösch' ich als erstes aus Versehen Deine Memorycard,

Ey yo, das ganze Musik-Biz is 'n gottloses Geschäft
Denn du wirst ausgebeutet und verheizt wie Bro'Sis und Echt
Alle sind furchtbar nett und versprechen einem das Beste
Doch was sie wollen sind deine Urheber- und Leistungsschutzrechte
Ja, sie reden von Lizenzen und sagen das du Punkte kriegst
Und geben dir n dicken Vorschuss gleich nach deiner Unterschrift
Doch wann du das nächste mal Kohle siehst ist ungewiss
Weil jetzt alles verrechnet wird solange bis du verhungert bist
Und während du selbst dich fragst woher das Geld für Miete nehmen
Stehst du am Set für den hunderttausend euro Videodreh
Es ist n Haifischbecken, überall lauern Fallen
Doch mir kann nichts passieren ich hab den besten Anwalt von allen

Blumentopf,"Mir war von Anfang an klar 
Möchtest Du hier überleben
Musst Du besser als der Rest sein es kann nur einen geben
Meine Chancen standen bei eins zu einer Million
Doch ich hab' an mich geglaubt und es hat sich gelohnt
Jetzt hab ich lang genug gewartet, meine Zeit ist gekommen
Dieser Platz wird zum Gefängnis, ich befrei' mich davon
Ich spür' den Luftstrom beim ersten Atemzug in meiner Lunge
Hör' wie jemand sagt
Glückwunsch, ein kerngesunder Junge
Die Wärme meiner Mutter wirkt beruhigend auf meine Nerven
Ich öffne meine Augen um 'nen Blick nach draußen zu werfen
Alles ist neu für mich, doch ich bin neugierig
Und ich greif' nach allem, was ich in die Fäuste krieg
Hier gibt's so viel zu entdecken zu tasten, riechen und schmecken
Ist das weich? Was passiert, wenn man es runterwirft? 
Kann man das essen?
Mama schau, ich lauf', ich hab's schon bis zum Schrank geschafft
Und Papa ist so stolz auf meinen ersten ganzen Satz
Ich kann schon über die Tischkante gucken, Mensch, jetzt bin ich groß
Nur dass Papa immer arbeiten gehen muss find' ich doof
Aber am Samstag füllt er das Planschbecken mit Wasser auf
Und dann kommt Marie, das Mädchen aus dem Nachbarhaus
Wir spielen Vater, Mutter, Kind, später werd' ich sie mal heiraten
Zum Geburtstag will ich den großen Polizeiwagen
Meine Mama sagt, ich soll die Zeit noch genießen
Bald musst Du zur Schule, dann ist es vorbei mit dem Spielen

Ich hab 'ne Bande mit meinen Freunden und ich find Mädchen echt ätzend
Kauf' Panini-Bilder, doch bald sind sie verklebt und vergessen
Und mittlerweile muss ich literweise 
Clearasil zwecks Akne nehmen
Und es steigen Parties mit Schiebertanzen und Flaschendrehen
Mein Sohn, 
Du bist heute Abend wieder da Punkt zehn
Ja, mal sehen, wartet nicht auf mich, ihr könnt ruhig schlafen gehen
Ehrlich, von meinen Eltern lass' ich mir nix mehr sagen
Genau wie von Lehrern, ey fuck, die woll'n sich alle eh nur wichtig machen
Nach meinem Zeugnis fragt mich doch später keine Sau mehr
Man, ich hab'n Traum, ich geh nach Lanzarote und werd' Tauchlehrer
Parties werden härter so wie die Alkoholika
Es sind Drogen da, und ich hab mein erstes Mal mit Monika
Das ist ein großes Jahr und nichts wird mehr wie früher sein
Hab' ständig Liebeskummer und den lang ersehnten Führerschein
Auch die Schule lass' ich halbwegs erfolgreich hinter mir
Aber Ausbildung? Nein danke, es ist das Leben das mich interessiert

Ich wohn' jetzt in 'ner eigenen Wohnung und bin weg von zu Haus
Wohn' in 'nem Wohnblock in der Stadt und mach' das Beste daraus;
Ich träum von 'nem großen Garten und 'ner Dachterrasse
Doch leider bin ich stets im Minus bei der Stadtsparkasse
Keine Mama ist mehr da, die mir mein Essen kocht
Und wenn ich an die Schule denk', dann denk' ich bloß Ach hätt' ich doch!
Ich find' keinen festen Job, les' in der Zeitung nur den Stellenmarkt
Und Moni zu verlassen, das war keine Heldentat
Und dann am selben Tag noch ins Bett mit Marie
Wann ich das Inge erzähl? Na besser nie
An der Bar 'n Bier bestellt, im Club am Klo 'n Näschen gezogen
Dann von den Bullen erwischt, die Taschen voller chemischer Drogen
Drum hab ich den Job verlor'n, der ganz in Ordnung war
Und wer zur Hölle erklärt mir bloß mein Steuerformular?
Ich sag, Ich bin nicht wie die andern, und merk selbst, wie seltsam es klingt
Hey kann es sein, dass ich im Club wirklich der Älteste bin?
Freunde überholen mich im Porsche auf der Autobahn
Meine Zukunft hat schon längst begonnen, verdammt, ich brauch 'n Plan!
Doch ich feier lieber Parties und hau mir die Birne weg
Und dann am Telefon Inges Vater, der Firmenchef
Redet irgendwas vom Geld verdienen bei ihm mit Internet
Weil er gern etwas solideres für seine Inge hätt'
Nur wegen ihr macht er mir 'n paar Angebote
Gut, arbeite ich halt bei ihm und tauch' später auf Lanzarote

Inge zeigt mir 'n positiven Schwangerschaftstest
Ich weiss zwar nicht so recht, doch lach' sie an und halt' sie ganz fest
Inge will heiraten, ich kann nicht neinsagen
Also Ringe kaufen, Aufgebot bestellen, Freunde plus Familien einladen
Flitterwochen wie versprochen in Venedig
Kurz darauf im Sommer kommt das Baby unser Glück auf ewig
David, vom Papa die Nase, Mama die Haare
Die strahlend blauen Augen von Opa - was für ein Knabe!
Das Leben macht Spaß und die Beförderung kommt
Der Mercedes ist schwarz, die Sekretärinnen blond
Und die Nachbarn sind neidisch auf 'ne Familie wie uns
Das Kind und wir sind gesund, und alle lieben den Jungen
Wir ziehen um in das große Haus am Stadtrand
Das Inges Eltern gehört, wo wir alle endlich Platz ham
David spielt im Garten, ich schau' vom Fenster aus mit Inge zu
Die Ehe läuft harmonisch, ja fast so wie im Bilderbuch

Neulich kam nach all den Jahren wieder 'ne Postkarte von Monika
Aus Lanzarote, und sie schreibt, sie wohnt jetzt da
Es ist doch komisch, ha? Man sitzt in seinem Mercedes
Rast an allem vorbei und merkt es erst dann wenn es zu spät ist
Jetzt ist mein Leben doch schon aus mit sechsundvierzig
Ist doch kein Wunder dass man dauernd deprimiert ist
Meine Frau meint, ich soll zum Therapeuten, doch ich brauch kein'
Nicht so einen, mein Seelenklemptner bleibt 'n guter Rotwein
Mit Inge läufts auch nicht mehr so wie in den besten Tagen
Denn seit den Wechseljahren ist sie kaum noch für Sex zu haben
David bleibt meine einzige Motivation
In dieses doofe Büro geh' ich doch bloß für meinen Sohn
Wir tun doch alles für ihn, ham uns den Arsch aufgerissen
Und er hat den Tauchkurs schon nach vierzehn Tagen geschmissen
Manchmal glaub' ich, wir lassen ihm zu viel Freiheit;
David, vergiss nicht, um zehn musst Du daheim sein!

Jetzt bin ich dreißsig Jahre in der Firma und das feiern wir
Mein Chef überreicht mir 'ne Münze mit dem Firmenlogo eingraviert
Und bei den meisten zähl' ich hier bereits zum alten Eisen
Aber den Youngsters kann ich immer noch das Wasser reichen
Ich werd' es allen zeigen, dass ich noch was beweg'
Auch wenn sie meinen, meine Programmiersprachen sind nicht mehr up to date
Na gut, ich hab vielleicht paar graue Haare
Doch das soll nicht heißen, dass ich nichts mehr an Energie und Power habe
Nur die Familie macht mir grade bisschen Sorgen
Ich will, dass David studiert, nur daraus ist bisher noch nichts geworden
Er sagt zu mir immer nur
Live your dreams!
Doch ohne Ausbildung wird das nicht geh'n, denn dann wird er mal nix verdienen
Und Inge wird nicht grade attraktiver mit den Jahren
Drum geh' ich aus und entdeck' den Reiz, für Liebe zu bezahlen
Ich ruf' sie an und sage
Schatz, heut' komm' ich später heim
Hab' da 'n Projekt, das muss bis morgen früh erledigt sein.
Und mit meinen Inlineskates halt' ich mich fit und gesund
Und auch wenn ich bald sechzig bin fühl ich mich immer noch jung
Doch dann kommt die Überraschung, David kriegt 'nen Sohn von seiner Mona
Den kleinen Lothar, verdammt jetzt bin ich Opa

Es hieß, ich sei ein Teil der Firma, daran ändert sich nichts
Denn in der Abteilung sei noch keiner länger als ich;
Sie sagten, sie bräuchten wirklich mehr Männer wie mich
Dann ham sie mir die Hand gedrückt und mich in Rente geschickt
Und jetzt sitzt auf meinem Stuhl ein andrer hinterm Schreibtisch
Und ich lös' die Kreuzworträtsel in der Fernsehzeitschrift
Denn ich langweil' mich so ohne Beruf
Und bin nur glücklich wenn mich mal der kleine Lothar besucht
Ja ich brauche was zu tun, und deshalb geh' ich in den Garten
Ich stutz' die Hecken, jäte Unkraut und mäh' den Rasen
Und im Winter sind wir wirklich niemals eingeschneit
Denn dann steh ich um sechs Uhr auf und räum' die Einfahrt frei
Und auch wenn ich von meinen Freunden schon die Namen vergess'
Und mein Mercedes eigentlich kaum noch die Garage verlässt
Weil immer wenn ich im Schritttempo durch die Straßen schleich
Gleich alle hupen und brüllen, Ey jetzt fahr' schon, Du Tattergreis
Will ich kein Leben auf dem Abstellgleis, weil ich noch Power hab'
Nur in letzter Zeit bin ich bei meinem Arzt 'n Dauergast
Denn laufend hab ich irgendwelche Wehwehchen
Und sind die einen vorbei, dann kommen die nächsten
Meine Augen werden schlechter und mein Kopf wird kahl
Ich krieg 'ne dicke Brille und 'ne große Prostata;
Ich bin so schwach, dass ich im Winter nicht mehr schneeräumen kann
Und meine Hose fühlt sich oft wie'n feuchter Teebeutel an

Ich hab mein Leben lang gebuckelt, und was hab ich davon?
'Ne Minirente und 'nen Sohn, der jedes Jahr einmal kommt
Und ich bin so froh, dass es Inge gibt
Denn ohne ihre Hilfe ging es nicht
Und wenn ich aufsteh' wird mir schwindelig
Und deshalb lieg' ich eigentlich bloß noch in meinem Bett herum
Und statt Auf Wiedersehen hör' ich nur Gute Besserung
Inge sagt, ich werd schon wieder kerngesund
Wenn ich nur immer brav meine Pillen nehm
Doch ich kenn sie zu gut, und ich spür wenn sie lügt
Und ich fühl genau, dass alle wissen, was hier geschieht
Ich hab kein' Bock mehr, die blöden Medikamente zu nehm'
Seh zu den alten Photos rüber, die am Fensterbrett stehen
Ich mit Inge frischverliebt am Markusplatz
Die Einschulung von David, das Bild von ihm zum Vatertag
Die Firmenurkunde, die ich zur Rente bekam
Und ich vorm Weihnachtsbaum mit meinem Enkel im Arm
Vor meinen Augen zieht nochmal mein ganzes Leben vorbei
Ich wollte so vieles machen und hatte so wenig Zeit
David lächelt mich an, Inge hält meine Hand
Und ich will nur noch schlafen

Meine Wohnung ist im ersten Stock
In dem Block mit der Schneiderei im Erdgeschoss
Wo man mich nicht grüsst sondern gegen Wände klopft
Wo keinem was entgeht, weil jeder aus dem Fenster glotzt
Wo Gerüchte sich verbreiten wie ein Kettenbrief
Und man sich den Kopf zerbricht wie ich mein Geld verdien'
Wo man selten jemand lächeln sieht und es im Treppenhaus nach Essen riecht
Wo's kein Mensch interessiert wenn Du einmal Hilfe brauchst
Sogar der Hausmeister macht Dir hier die Tür' nicht auf
Hauptsache ist Du rückst die Miete raus, wo Du Schiss hast wenn Du Tüten rauchst
Oder dass die Oma neben Dir das Gas vergisst
Wo Künstler noch 'n Schimpfwort und keine Arbeit ist
Wo man es hasst wenn Du 'ne Party gibst, weil das ganze Haus am schlafen ist
Wo du an 'nem Dienstag nicht lange schläfst
Weil die Müllabfuhr direkt vor der Garage steht
Wo der Nachbar gerne Rasen mäht, wo man Treppen putzt und Straßen fegt

Wo man kein Garten braucht, weil man hier die Isar hat

Meine Wohnung liegt im dritten Stock
In dem Block mit der Näherei im Erdgeschoss und wenn ich aus dem Fenster glotz
Seh ich statt Sonne nichts als Sichtbeton
Denn meine Wohnung liegt im Rückgebäude mit Blick auf den Hinterhof
Dort wird nur Müll geholt, und Kinder spiel'n da nicht
Und wenn Oktober ist dann riecht man es
Denn dann wird in den Hof gepisst, weil gleich nebenan die Wiesn ist
Und wenn es dunkel wird und Du gehst abends aus'm Haus
Triffst Du oft auf Typen, die Dir nicht in die Augen schauen
Auf wen, der Deinem Blick ausweicht, weil es ihm peinlich ist
Und auch wenn Du nicht schaust wo er klingeln wird, dann weisst Du es
Denn die Damen erwarten ihn
Und er hofft, Du denkst, er hat sowas wie 'n Arzttermin
Doch allen ist klar was geht
Hinter der Tür im Erdgeschoss auf der Massage steht
Die meisten Mieter im Haus bleiben nur 'n halbes Jahr
Dann ziehn sie wieder aus, und Du vergisst schon bald die Namen
Und deshalb kenn' ich meine Nachbarn nicht
Außer der Frau neben mir, die schon einundachtzig ist
Die nie von ihren Kindern erzählt, aber dafür wissen will, wie man ins Internet geht
Und ich teil meine Zeitung mit ihr
Und deshalb find' ich manchmal Süssigkeiten vor der Tür
Und dann ist es fast 'n bisschen so als ob Du noch `ne Oma hättest
Und Du weisst, dass Du eigentlich nicht aus Deiner Wohnung wegwillst
Denn Du würdest Deine Straße vermissen
In der Türken den italienischen Laden besitzen
Wo ein Import/Export-Shop neben dem anderen liegt
Und Du das Gefühl nicht loswirst, alles was es dort gibt
Kann da nur gelandet sein weil es vom Lastwagen fiel
Wo Du nachts mit Skateboard heimfährst und mit dem Lärm die Nachbarn weckst
Und jede Dachrinne verwendet wird als schwarzes Brett
Ich wohn' direkt zwischen der Wiesn und dem Hauptbahnhof
Ohne Garten und Balkon, aber hey, wer braucht das schon?
Es ist direkt in Münchens Innenstadt
Wo Du kein Auto kaufst, weil Du hier die Trambahn hast
Und Leute wisst ihr was? Ich mag die Stadt

gemeinsam eine Welt erfindet (vielleicht Liebe)
und wer das nutzt macht sich verdächtig

Plötzlich ist Platzangst bei Dir
und do glaubst ihr
wenn sie Dich fragt, ob do wüßtest wo do hinwillst
ist alles was do weißt, daß do bloß weg willst
weil do nicht sagen kannst, daß do's nicht wüßtest
aber irgendwas Dir befiehlt, daß do's wüßtest
sagst Du: ich möchte Teil einer Jugendbewegung sein
und denkst, daß do die Angst so überlistet
und nicht daran was do von Anfang an vermißtest
vielleicht ein Feld für eine Möglichkeit von Dir
die Dich einfach nur sagen ließe: 'ich bin hier'
kann gut sein, daß ich mich täusche
so ist das jedenfalls bei mir
Und die Angst die do fühlst
ist das Geld das Dir fehlt
für den Preis den do zahlst
für etwas, das für Dich zählt
und Dich sicher sein läßt,
daß do da (wo do hingehörst) bist.
Ware Kunst ist ein Produkt der Phantasie

do you think I'll be different when you're through
Nein, platzt der Staat aus allen Nähten
eine Zerstreuung aus unzähligen Teilchen
die wie die Splitter eines Spiegels das ganze Bild bewahren
und die Mauer in den Köpfen sollte weichen
Lucky ohne. für Kontrolle I'm Problemfeld sollte reichen
dafür setzen die Experten neue Zeichen und Akzente:

Der Staat I'm Staat in der ersten Person

""Stimmt genau,"" sag ich
""dir sind so wie ich selber bin.""
Ein Wind um nichts

kommt wie ein Wirbel, wind of change

Als der Strom weg war

die neuen Lieder, die do spielst
die haben kaum noch was zu tun mit mir.""
""Wem sagst do das
die sind wie ich
und davon handeln wir.""
Um andre Töne nicht zu hören
ist meine Stimme unaufhörlich
und schlägt als Sprachfluß gleicher Strom
von innen und gegen mich
ob ich Dich mehr als sie vermisse
nicht daß ich wüßte
Als der Strom weg war
bliebst do bei mir
und sagtest nichts mehr
als wärst do in mir
eingesogen
vom Angelpunkt verschlungen
als hätt' ich mir die Haut vom Körper abgezogen
nichts außer mir
und in Gedanken ging ich zu Dir
und ich sagte: bitte hilf mir
vergiß die Lieder die ich spiel

durch's Ozonloch, über den Ozean hinausgeschossen
hinter das Licht, mein eigener Schatten

wo ich ihn wann verloren hatte, ausgeschlossen
Die Worte sind von sich so schwer
daß ich sie nicht mehr singen kann so wie bisher
jede Sekunde durch dir Zeilen überholen
bis hin zum Tod und ihm mit ""ich will sterben"" beizuwohnen

aus der Erfindung, wegzukommen von sich selbst
in die Erfahrung. Ein freies Bild
wieder bei Null, ein Weiß mit Kreis
Fast so wie ich
um von Begreifbarem zu sprechen.
ich muß gestehen, ich fühle mich.
um ein Begreifendes nicht zu erschaffen
vielmehr vorstellbar zu machen
dreh ich mich mit der Musik
mit allem was ich an mir hab
mir zur Verfügung steht um Dich
Und doch kann hier kaum von Dir die Rede sein
ich kann nichts wirklich von Dir sagen
soviel ist klar wir sind nicht neu
schon lange hier sind wie wie Risse in der Schöpfung
Mag sein die Tage sind gezählt
die Augenblicke sind es nicht. Für alle Zeiten
keine Geschichte zum erzählen, meine ich
und auch nicht zum in Stücke schreiben
und do schaust in mein Gesicht (bei mir statt Ausblick ein Gedächnis)
und sagst: ""das wird sich zeigen""
Ich bin die Angst, die Angst vor mir
wenn do Dich fürchtest bin ich bei Dir
randvoll Fakten und keine Menschenseele
nicht ganz beitrost leg ich mich nieder zu den Akten

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May,1995

Down to earth where the money always comes first

'Cause men in yellow jackets putting adverts inside my dreams

Fallen under the spell of the distance between us when we communicate
Still picking up shortwave

Doing one eighty still standing at last call

You feel so lost and you feel alone
You're looking for a change in your life

You hate to feel a human feeling
You hate to be so sick and weak
You don't deserve a life like this

You're so much better and you're so different
You don't believe in what they do

We are the angels of the dark
We're everything you ever need
We have the darkness on our side

You will find a better life
In our world without sacrifice",Angels of the Dark,2005

Burning feathers, burning souls
Only thrills and no desires
Who are the creatures black as coal
Splitted tongues unmask a liar
Her wings of steel, her eyes so cold
Hate's the last empires

There's no hope in this cold world
Your teardrops freeze, you don't wonder why
Doomed to fall and doomed to die

Bore into your fragile heart
Leaving untold thousand scars
Your wings of steel, your eyes so cold

Come come to your brother (thou shall not die)
Unchain me sister (thou shall not fear)

Please no--let me die!

And everything seems to fail
Just confide in your dreams
We won't let you down

We are the keepers of the stars
We light up the sky
When darkness falls in to your life
We will always be there
We will hold you when you fall
We light up your life
When you can't find the way back to yourself

We are the keepers of the stars
We light up the sky
When darkness falls in to your life
We will always be there
We will hold you when you fall
We light up your life
When you can't find the way back to yourself",Star Keeper [Album Version] [Version],2016
Blutengel,"Alone in the dark I'm longing for you
But all I can do is pray
That you will be by my side
I'm searching for you
Will I find you some day?
Please don't leave me this way
Hold me tight
But there is nothing left to stay

Give me hope, give me time, give me love
Save my heart from the storm
Give me hope, give me time, give me love
I won't cry ever again
Save me from the depth of my darkest dreams
Give me hope, give me time, give me love
'Cause I'll die without you tonight

I'm looking at you
And I'm waiting for your embrace
But all I can see
Is a fire in your unholy eyes
Why you can't remember the time
That we've shared?
All these beautiful moments are gone
And there's nothing left to say",Give Me,2017

Ich halte dich fest, ich bin bei dir
Auf deinem letzten Weg
Werde ich an deiner Seite stehen

Und der Regen fällt auf leere Straßen, ohne dich
Es ist kalt und leer in unserer Welt

Ganz tief in mir, weiß ich,
Es gibt ein Leben ohne dich
Doch es tut so weh, es tut so weh

Und der Regen fällt auf leere Straßen - ohne dich

Went completely wrong

Save us from ourselves
Deliver us from the life we live
And forgive us all our sins

Save us, save us from the evil

Deliver us from the life we live
And forgive us all our sins

And some of us know life's a gift
And they start to pray",Save Us,2017
Blutengel,"Love is violent, love is pure
Love is the answer,
Love is the cure
But love can kill you, 
If you lose someone
Nothing lasts forever,
Love's a loaded gun

For all the friends you used to trust
Sing, for all the dreams you left behind
Sing, for all the people that you've lost,
For all the friends you used to trust
Sing, for all the dreams you left behind

The more you love,
The more you will suffer from pain
You're afraid of losing it all
Love's a cruel, cruel game
And the devil will smile,
When he takes your love away
No reason to fight and no reason to pray",Sing,2017

Like the doors and this president.  (Dead presidents.) 

[Chorus]

[El-P] 
I'm gettin' fresh for my freeform .
All hold heart rocks down when I'm turnin' veterans to greenhorn.
Beat it; make a bee-line; be lax or you'll be outed.
Spit words that's really cold, pinchin' lymph nodes, El.
The inconvenience to your master plan fell; your shit's abyssmal.
Decimal point zero for the judge burnin' rhyme books.
Fuck basic, iambic pentameter just dissolves,
So I'll say fuck you; suck your marrow like a chicken wing from pluck you.
Location I'll rock like Zeke, calamity.
What's your composure?  Shoot sex like Vanity; it's over.
Done it again; brainstorm slice in your direction.
Cut the belly of your block; open over to C-Section.
Death callin' one for the dysfunctional son.
Trapped in my digital domain... (The El to the P.) 
Yo, fuck rappers that freak a fable; phony will make them fall out.
Frequencies painful; run 'em as sonar; CoFlow's the callout.
You're misaligned, I turn benign breaks into malignant.
Knock 'em out the box; capture they flag and kick they can in.
Badlands live one down the information highway.
Write a rhyme in braille; send a fuckin' battle to your e-mail.
Yes, once again empty MC's we have had here; for those
Fortunate enough to feel this; blessed number one, ichiban,
Numero uno crew; track runner, stun gunner, plus vocal.
Freak show performance.
Company Flow rockin' shit from the intro to the outro.
Nevertheless I must digress for the master;
The walking FreshFest MC's pure when in soil,
Yet shallow when the bank roll.
The independent representation of what MC's can and should be.
Judge, prosecution, defendant, and jury.

A devil and a savior, all in one
Her eyes can heal me or they can make me bleed
Her lips have me addicted to the poetry

And I confess that I don't mind at all
'Cause I would trade the world away to stay inside this dream
I'll never find a better place to fall, no, no

She's got a magic of another world
And every time that I think of her, I'm on fire, fire

Making me dizzy like a vertigo
Her cinnamon kisses melt my soul like fire, yeah

I get a strong vibration
When she just says my name
And it drives me crazy
'Cause I don't know if she feels the same

But she likes to breathe some mystery in all she does
She laughs and says that I'm under her spell
Now I won't lie, I enjoy the ride and pray it never ends
I feel her deeper than anything I've felt

Like a drowning man that's praying for the rain
And how she worked her way inside, I'll never understand
She's too beautiful to ever take the blame
But she'll always fan the flame

So don't blow it

[Chorus]
Tell me what we got
Tell me it's a lot
Tell me it's the real thing
Tell me not to change
And always be the same
Tell me that's a good thing
It's a good thing
Tell me not to lie
Tell me not to wait
Tell me that you want 
The same things as me
Tell me that it's fate
Driving me insane
Tell me it's the real thing
That keeps me hanging on

I can read the signs between us
And I feel it's inside when you come nearer
There's a stillness in the air
Like no one else is there
And every moment stays in the moment

[Chorus]

Sometimes it hurts to watch you leave 
It feels like you're taking a part of me with you 
I never know how it'll be I guess it's just a mystery 
But is it the real thing (that keeps me hangin' on)

Until I made you cry

It feels like agony
I want you here 'cause the thought of you with someone else is hell on earth
I can't breathe
Knowing that you don't believe
In all that we had
So all that I ask

Is remember me

All those endless nights
We didn't want to sleep
Oh, remember me
And how I made you laugh
Until I made you cry
We had everything
Oh, but don't you ever forget

Oh how I want you here right now
It gets so lonely
I need you to hold me

I knew I should have listened when they said stay away from you
I made my decision, I didn’t care about the consequence
The pain, the lies, you hurt my pride, I wonder where my money went

You do what you do just to get at me
If it makes you feel good go ahead and try
I’ll take anything you throw at me
It might hurt but I ain’t gonna die, no, no, no

Well you wouldn’t know a good thing if it looked you in the face
If you’d pay attention instead of getting off into my space
You’d see a new way that wasn’t there the day before
One more try, if not goodbye, go ahead and close the door

Wake up in a strange place, angels over my head
One of them is shouting clear
Thousand bolts of lightning bring me back to life
And it's a miracle that I'm still here
As I'm coming to, I'm screaming out, I need you by my side
And I'm alive

Bo Burnham,"So here's a song that takes 
Something that's not so fun, math, 
And makes it offensive

What's a pirate minus the ship?
Just a creative homeless guy
And an anteater plus a large hungry mutant ant?
An ironic way to die

And what's domain, domain, range
A kid with too much in his pants
And two balls minus one?
Seven titles at the Tour de France

Split a decision with long division,
Take the circumference of your circumcision
Live like your data and when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever you get

It's new math

What's a bag of chips divided by five,
Well that's a Nike workers' meal
And Santa clause multiplied by I?
Well I guess that makes him real

And the square root of the NBA?
Is Africa in a box
How do you trace a scatter plot?
Give the pencil to Michael J Fox

Take the approximate moral proportion
Of the probable problem of a pro-life abortion
Live like your data, and when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever you get

It's new, it's new, it's new, it's new
It's new math

And if you made a factor tree
Of the factors that caused my girl to leave me
You'd have a tree
Full of Asian porn

See A-L, see you later (C-A-L-C-U-LATOR)
Mathematical minds make industrial smog
And what's the opposite of natural logarithm
Dura flame, the unnatural log


Support the farmers with a pro-tractor,
Link Kennedy and Lincoln with a common factor
Live like your data, and when you're all set
Put it all together and whatever you get

Yeah it's new, it's new, it's new, 
It's new, it's new math
Word problems

If there's a fat guy in a pastry shop
With a twenty dollar bill and he's ready to buy,
In order to predict his volume change
You'll need to know the value of pi

And there's a metal train that's a mile long
And at the very back end a lightning bolt struck her,
How long 'til it reaches and kills the driver,
Provided that he's a good conductor,

And if ten percent of men are gay
And twenty percent of men are Chinese,
What are the odds that a man chosen at random
Spends his free time at mealtime while on his knees

And if Kim is half as old as Bobby
Who is two years older than twelve year old Tori,
For how many more thirty day months
Will their threesomes be considered statutory rape

Because math can be sexy

Cause having sex is like quadratic expansion
If it can't be split then it's time to stop,
And having sex is like doing fractions,
It's improper for the larger one to be on top,

And having sex is like math homework,
I do it best when I'm alone in my bed.
And squaring numbers are just like women,
If they're under thirteen just do them in your head

I'm an internet provider, came from the web like a horny spider,
Fucked a girl in an apple orchard, then came in cider (inside her)

I spit gold bars cause I was molested by my uncle Midas
Gay dads blow pops, another sucker,
Oedipus was the first motherfucker.

Does my nephew's scent still linger?

I want you to listen to me, I got something to tell
You.

He heard about Chicago.
He worked hard over here, made all of that money, 800
Dollars.
After caring for his crop, he called his cousin in
Chicago, 
And he said, ""Cousin, I'm on my way"".
He picked all of that cotton.
I said this is about a country boy like myself, B.B.
King you know.
So when he get to Chicago, his cousin meet him and
Bring him out to the club.
He said, ""Set him up!"", cous's payin' for.
Had all the go-go girls set up, waitin' up.
They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the
Pleasure hotels.
They brought him back out and said, ""Set him up!"", 
Cous's payin' for.
His money got a little lighter, they lured him out from
The Lute and brought him down to Robert's.
And then he said, ""Set him up!"", cous's payin' for.
And then the 800 dollars, bein' more money then my man
Had ever had, began to run out.
Then they moved him out and put him down with the... 
And then, ladies and gentlemen, the go-go girls would
Get fewer.
His friends was fewer.
All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other
Side of the street.
And then it happened all his buddies were gone.
And my man knew only one thing to do, it was getting
Cold there, like it is today, 
You know what I'm talking about.
He went down to the railroad yard, 
And one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent
His money, came by to see him.
And she said ""You fool!, you fool!"", I wouldn't have
Spend your money, but the rest of them was spending
Your money so I decided to spend my portion too, you
Know.

But love is blind and you soon will find 
You're just a boy again 

When you want her lips, you get her cheek 
Makes you wonder where you are 
If you want some more then she's fast asleep 
You're just twinkling with the stars. 
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say 
You'll have to learn, just like me 
And that's the hardest way,

Her daddy don't have to scold her, her mother can't hardly hold her
She never gets any older, sweet little rock and roller

And the famous singers sang and barred away
When the stars performed, she screamed and yelled ""Hooray!""

Five thousand tongues were screaming ""More! More!""
