#Tocoparavos,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo Figaro, magnifico

I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go (never)
Never, never, never, never, never let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows",more »,2001

You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus

You're a monster, Mr. Grinch!

""Stink, stank, stunk!""

You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch!
You're the king of sinful sots!

Splotched with moldy, purple spots

Overflowing with the most disgraceful 
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable

#Tocoparavos,"Just the other night a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

#Tocoparavos,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

And tenement halls""

Mais l'appel de l'aventure les fait quand même dévier

Qui t'a dit que j'étais un mec qui vit sa vie de baisé
Remplie de zizanies citadines que les filles faciles préfèrent
Mais tout ça c'est faux, en vrai
J'assiste au kidnapping de mes rêves
Tout ces minables s'imaginent
Qu'leurs lois tyranniques m'effraient
J'ai des prémonitions, j'vois mon avenir en démolition
Tout ce que j'entends c'est des maudits cons
Se mettre au chichon pour planer, putain, c'est chaud, fiston
Décapotable, cheveux aux vents, musique à fond
J'ai troqué ma routine contre une vie d'action
Je rêve d'escapades vers la plage sans laisser de cadavre
Et ne plus gamberger de ma life, sans état d'âme, j'vais m'nachave
J'en suis capable, on va s'enfuir d'Paname
Et pour l'affaire Washington? Classée sans suite, madame

J'aimerais m'en aller, traverser le mur du ons
Quand je veux planer, y'a toujours des turbulences
Et plus j'y repense, plus le présent est une urgence
C'est grâce à lui qu'le passé et le futur changent
L'aéroplane fait sa chorée là-haut, le Soleil apparaît
Il pique comme un toréador les eaux évaporées
Afin de dorer la forêt d'à-coté pour redécorer la colline
Tandis qu'les paumés à bord osent déshonorer la mort
On est tous passagers de la Terre Mère dans la voie lactée
On épouse la sagesse cela permet
De ne pas lâcher mais le mal achève
Et si le vent m'appelle pour m'en aller autre part
Mon aéroplane file comme un aigle

Aéroplane, aéroplane, aéroplane, aéroplane
Aéroplane, aéroplane, aéroplane, aéroplane

J'veux sentir les nuages sur mon visage
Et tranquille à la vitesse du son zizaguer
J'veux planer quand le Soleil du bled s'élève
J'ferai pas comme Icare, je n'veux pas me brûler les ailes
Je veux survoler toutes les plages paradisiaques
Ainsi que toutes les montagnes des Alpes, j'trinque à ma vie d'roi
Pas d'intérêt à c'que je redescende sur Terre
J'suis bien dans les nuages, loin de ce stress sans succès
Tel un rapace, là, je fly j'ai quitté Paname
Pour des vacs y'a pas de maille, laisse-moi kiffer ma life
En aéroplane, loin d'ces années trop sales
Là où ça tabassait trop de bails, en finesse ça plane

J'veux planer dans les airs et m'fumer un gros teh
Y'a ma latte dans le ciel, j'veux m'envoler comme un aigle royal
Nager dans les mers d'Hawaii, aller dans mes rêves
Ou m'en aller, juste sans faire d'voyage, jamais dans le stress
Aller, aller sur le sommet des Alpes où l'Soleil éclate
D'une montée d'adrénaline, à sauter d'là-haut
M'apporter de l'audace, j'ai trop fait d'croche-pattes
J'veux foncer en Ferrari sous l'tonnerre, l'orage
Nous, on est carrés au mic, la musique m'amène autre part
Et si un jour j'arrête, c'est qu'un gars m'achève au sabre
Moi, j'ai trop ramé au taff, j'suis Iron Man, le regard léopard
Je peux rester courbé quand j'suis assis dans mon aéroplane

Une case dont la cassure peut causer l’hécatombe
C'est pas les infos du JT ou celle de la commère du coin
Un C.R.S excité peut gouter la colère du poing, écoute bien
Un gémissement innocent, une naissance, un père hésitant
Une étrange farce de l'existence, des parents qui paraissent distants
Au fond d'la classe, il a huit ans, les yeux cernés, l'air réticent
A l'évidence faut se fermer pour repérer les médisants
Une femme seule au regard dur, en veut aux Noirs et aux Barbus
Se croit pure et se rassure, pleine de droiture, manque de naturel
Dans la plus belle des ruelles, un homme hurle: ""Ça peut plus durer!""
Purée sanglante dans la cuvette, cruelle sentence de l’adultère
Et les enfants sont battus, ils servent d'entente pour la thune
Errent de centre en centre en manque d'air couverts d'ombres tentaculaires
Plonge en enfer, transperce les ronces que l'donjon renferme
Et de temps en temps, sans penser, coupe les ponts sans assumer

C'est la folie qui fait que je bosse mes textes
Quand je vois une jolie minette, j'veux lui mordre les fesses
Fuck les mecs, qui se faufilent direct
Dans nos vies discrètes
Fidèle au poste on est timbré, et il faut vite s'y faire
Salut 2-Zer c'est ta conscience
L'abus de sexe n'est pas bon j'pense
La rue se sert de ta confiance
Car t'as plus de frère, va comprendre
Fuis avant que la vie te casse tes guiboles
J'te suis plus dans ta folie, vieux, adieu je démissionne
Mais non attends, reviens, y'a des circonstances, j'ai pas 1000 consciences
Marie-Jeanne n'est pas la fille qu'on pense
Et je suis victime d'une maladie gonflante
Mais 2-Zer tu n'as pas pris le bon sens
Tu peux pas me mentir, comme quand on analyse ton sang
Putain

Tu peux te faire sauter, le secteur est miné
Sur une dizaine d'hectares, chacun sa quête, la mienne
C'est l'rap. Et là, je suis dans la filière, billets et liasses
Yes, hier hélas, j'ai tej' des MC's du 6ème étage
Pour qu'il y en ai plein de moins, je viens
Sur eux à la vitesse des balles, j'les envois loin
Joindre Big L et Pac
J'écoute leurs bails et me mets à bailler
Balles dans le barillet
Leurs flingues sont légers comme Keira Knightley
Via le gros pilons, nos folies sont décuplées
Tu me verras pas sniffer ou déguster du saucisson
Ils s'trompent sur le Phaal
J'garde mes positions, j'm'entraîne pas à rapper
J'fais juste des pompes sur le majeur

J'suis devenu fou, que des mecs de l'ombre, Paris
M'a rendu sombre, accro du son mais quand j'affronte, high kick
Pour les keufs, le pompe sera vide
Fonce dans les catacombes quand les matons rappliquent
Et c'est mes péripéties, j'excite les filles en passant
Appelle-moi l'ennemi des flics, j'aiguise des rimes, j'prend l'argent
Pire qu'une épidémie, j'vesqui les schmits, l'équipe est vif
Terrible, et oui, j'débite des lignes d'épileptique, j'tente ma chance
Et y'a pas d'autotune, que des phases qui claquent ton gros cul
Tu cherches un endroit où me taper? Va sur Youtube
On débarque, on est 4, on t'épate, faut des liasses
Qu'on démarrent des gamos Lotus

J'commence agressif, ouais j'ai un gros appétit, frère
J'crois que je suis schizophrène, ou qu'j'ai un jumeau maléfique, mec
Chassé par les flics et notre vécu est loin d'une vie de rêve
Et on nettoie les types qui nous négligent, ce sont des petites merdes
J'vais déballer ma rage là, je suis détraqué? Vas savoir
T'as une dent contre moi, parce que je t'ai éclaté la mâchoire
J'taffe pas à l'abattoir, mais j'ai enchaîné des cochonnes
J'viens en trancher des gros porcs
J'ai le même regard qu'un chat noir, hey
Marche pour les sages, coeur de pierre
C'est pour ça que mon rap est calibré
Braque tous les (?), j'casse des fachos, ça c'est les bails, on va insisté

Fidèle au poste, j'apporte trop d'flows qui sentent la maille
J'dis des gros mots car y'a trop d'choses quand j'chante ma life
Allez, j'squatte les palais, fuck les gens d'la hype
Et fallait, pas m'faire déballer c'que ces vantards braillent
Mais allez, j'suis inégalé par les gens d'leur taille
Ils jouent à cache-cache et perdent leurs squelettes dans l'card-pla à balais
Le poids des années te rend souvent seul, t'es rieur
Oui, mais d'vant la foule, tu refoules tes souffrances intérieures
Hier, j'aimais pas les corvées mais j'y allais quand maman m'disait

17 ans, j'étais un SDF, moi qui pourtant détestais perdre
J'ai eu de l'aide et j'oublie pas les gestes des frères

Tu recevras l'baiser d'la Mort, donc surtout tends pas ta joue
Pour les jaloux, ce jour là sera sacré
Ouais, le peu-ra ça crée l'envie, d'se massacrer
Si j'te fais du mal c'est pas gratuit car j'suis un gentil mec
La richesse est loin mais pour l'succès, manque plus qu'un centimètre
Étrangement, pas de coups d'main, que des étranglements
J'préfère, être le mec demandé, ouais, qu'être en demande
Posé, sur les strapontins, j'me dis, qu'j'suis déjà contraint
On fait des débats, dont plein provoquent des dégâts qu'on craint
J'me sens comme un graffeur qui n'a pas gué-ta l'bon train
J'te jure que j'irai mieux quand mon papa verra l'compte plein
L'amour c'est dur, mais être seul, ça l'est dix fois plus

Écoute! S-Crew, les matricules de ma team
J'étais crade la semaine, et pas bien sapé
J'dors peu, trop d’orgueil et d'fierté mal placés
Ma vie c'est garre-ba, gard'av et les bâtards tardent pas
À t'mettre des hasbas, s'déclarent pas et te traquent chaque soir
Mais quand j'étais gamin, j'connaissais pas l'vice
Dix ans après, des vrais amis vont pas t'aider, crois-moi
Certains empestent la tise, et tu prêteras l'biff à ces bouffons
Tu veux m'checker? Enlève tes sales mains
Ma grand-mère, m'a élevé, malgré le fait, que j'sois dur
Jamais d'""je t'aime"", n'est sorti de ma bouche
Grand-père est mort, ça m'a touché, devenu fou, mec
Depuis cœur de pierre, je nique l'amour

J'commence, cordon ombilical, jeune byl-ka
Peur de personne donc j'me faufile, je tape
Un cœur en pleine forme, depuis môme j'suis comme ça
Ça traîne en bande, ouais
Capuche sur la tête, on fout le grabuge sur la sphère
Avec des armes russes sous la veste
C'est à Grigny que j'débute ma life
La famille rentrait du travail, des engueulades
Une vie paisible, des idées fixes, les temps du ""j'rentre pas tard""
J'ai vu qu'un sou c'est un sou, qu'l'amour c'est trop flou
Qu'il y'avait mes couilles et c'est tout
J'déambule dans Paname
Où le S-Crew se forge, balaye tout dehors

Jamais d'la vie moi j'abandonne
J'dirais qu'ma vie est assez louche
Des fois ça brille, des fois je crie ma rage m'étouffe

J'mets des baffes lyriques et les wacks militent

Tous les jours fuir la mort de peu, rester fort, faire renaître le bien
J'vois les corps des pauvres dehors, j'ressors la fumée de mes yeux, un
Joint pour sécher mes larmes, un point d'vue qui frappe l'audition
J'étais un moins qu'rien, j'ai cherché mes talents

J'aime pas les night clubs, au secours, les gens sont abusifs
J'suis comme un iPod, je me secoue pour changer la musique
Avoue, t'as jamais vu mieux, les jaloux sont furieux

Tu pourrais baiser tes semblables pour porter des grandes marques
Fuck la mode, quand j'montre ma bite elles n'apparaissent pas
Et si t'as mal parlé de moi, mes vandales te canent sans faire de scandale
J'excite les mulheres, pour les riches et les bougzers
Réussir c'est tout bête, faut juste que j'vide mes poubelles
Que des équipes de Paname devant les basanés, t'es mal barré
Frangin, effrite le charas pendant que j'évite les macchabées
Notre mode de vie te fascine, biatch! Tu veux nous côtoyer
Tu n'as pas d'autonomie, quoi qu'est-ce qu'il y a? On va pas trop parler
Ici y'a pas de soleil mais t'as des rougeurs, j'mets des tas d'fessées

J'aime cette musique, come on, ça s'passe par ici à l'aube
Je me balade, c'est l'embarras quand t'es pas là, je m'ennuie, oh no
C'est mes racines, une partie de ma vie, au top
Ça fume de la weed, encore le Panasonic m'emporte
Et quand t'es là, tu sais, pas d'problème
Pas d'coke et pas d'poèmes
Juste un pack de bières qui me tabasse l'abdomen
Moi, je fais qu’assommer ma pauvre tête
Apporter ma prose fraîche, saboter l'atmosphère
Pas d'monnaie, pas d'sommeil
Juste toi qui m'lève et me fracasse chaque oreille
Rap, Rap, Rap, Rap
Tu m'as fais graver sur des papiers, t'es
La seule qui m'fait gratter mes devoirs sur mes cahiers d'texte

Personne ne peut aimer le Rap plus que moi je l'aime
Il a flagellé mon âme lors des abus de ma jeunesse
Il m'a ramené dans l'art, il m'a rappelé au calme
Immature, témoin des images dures de l'armée démoniaque
Et peut-être que l'Rap certains l'font pour rire
Mais moi j'cautionne pas
Est-ce que quelque part dans ce monde pourri
Des gens pensent comme moi?
J'entends les foules hurler, jamais j'ferai le vendu
J'fous le boucan, je vous l'ai juré
Faites péter du Group Home, jure pas sur ta maman!
Sur la tête de ma mère... J'aimerais mettre une couronne
J'suis qu'un serviteur des notes, pas le plus sérieux des hommes
Un périlleux désordre déforme mes terribles révoltes
Et comme les rimes récoltées, c'est ça qui m'fait vivre
Des phrasés asymétriques, t'en verras pas d'si maîtrisés

Musique, je t'ai pas choisi pour me dégoter d'la thune
Tu m'as soutenu quand la déprime voulait dérober ma plume
Quand un frérot fait la une, c'est un exemple d'amour
Et même en plein jour j'pourrais te décrocher la lune
Musique, t'es incendiaire depuis que je t'ai déclaré ma flamme
On est des gars pas très banals
Qui pourraient dévaster Paname avec des phases
Et je sais que t'étais là quand j'ai squatté l'asphalte
J'ai failli déraper mais j'ai taffé pour ne pas rater ma life

Toi et moi on s'entend bien
J'ai besoin de toi autant que t'as besoin de moi
Quand je rentrais dans l'Rap, c'était pas sans lendemain
Et j'le savais re-fré, et ouais j'taffais le verbe
Surtout pas zapper le thème, en grattant sans fin
T'étais toujours là avant mes embrouilles
J’avançais dans le brouillard, sah, mais jamais dans le doute
J'ai pensé sans le vouloir, qu'tu me mettais tant de coups bas
Quand j'étais dans c'trou noir et que j'partais en couille
Mais c'est fini cette époque, j'fais d'la zik auprès d'mes potes
Moi, j'suis sélectif quand j'déteste des types, moi, j'me téléporte
Moi, j'suis le maître au mic et je baise des miss
Sur tes mélodies, moi, je t'aime très fort

Personne, non personne, ne t'aimera plus que moi
Dois-je encore te le redire, musique, quand voudras-tu me croire?
C'est pour toi que j'suis devenu maître de cérémonie, merde
Faut qu'les jolies fesses bougent sur nos chroniques, mec
L'usine, grâce à toi nous est pas destinée
Shoot dans cette fourmilière, nique tous ces pourris d'traîtres
Oui oui, tu m'as fait quitter l'école

Réussite du 15 comme Alphonse Aréola
Tu prends un aller simple, on a les armes
Faut ber-bar mais pas les shabs
Les excuses n'excusent pas les actes
Nous on séduit vite, tu gères rien du tout
T'es comme Cell, les meufs fuient ta queue comme C-18
T'as pas d'départ, t'as trop d'humeurs
T'as plus d'déclin de vœux, ta foi est triste
J'ai pas d'DA, pas d'producteur
J'emprunte les chemins que j'veux, la voie est libre

Le peuple est endetté mais ceux qui gèrent les banques y s'font
Des couilles en or sur ta tête pendant que la banquise fond
Éparpillés sur l'avenue, ça y est on y est parvenus
Bienvenu aux nouveaux venus mais les groupies c'est farfelu
Tous ces clones, écartez-les, surtout quand ça parle de rap
Faut arracher l'cro-mi des faux chroniqueurs télé
T'as vu l'atmosphère qu'on s'prend? Obsédés par les morts
C'est comme si on parlait morse vu qu'on tape pour s'faire comprendre
Sur l'amour tire un trait, j'te fais pas de dessin
Mon cœur, pas facile d'y rentrer, surtout qu'en bas y'a les zins
La vie, un voyage compliqué, pourtant y'a qu'un aller simple
C'est pas net, j'me sens comme un humain sur la Planète des singes

On fait de belles rencontres, évidemment j'ai gardé l'espoir qu'on peut faire mieux
Mais la vie c'est pas un film, tu t'es fait niquer par cette fille
Pourtant t'as tout donné pour elle, teubé t'as pas d'quoi t'étonner
Qui dit tempête dit tonnerre, et toi ta tête est bétonnée
Mais tout en bas de ta tourelle, t'entendras des tourterelles
Tout en bas de ta tourelle, t'entendras des tourterelles
Rien à péter d'être honnête, tes dettes ont détournées ton être
Et ton corps détouré de craie, quand ils t'ont retrouvé tout raide
Tout en bas de ta tourelle, t'entendais des tourterelles

Devant la bosse sur le manteau qui planque le pull qui planque la crosse

Priant le Christ que mes pêchés m'écrasent pas malgré mes crasses
Quand on devait du fric: qui pouvait protéger mes gars?
Les pneus qui crissent en bas de chez moi, la couleur grise du bâtiment
J'vais pas tir-men, j'étais en panique quand j'complotais chez Mekra
J'fais pas le voyou, je serais pas crédible

La came part en fumée, dans nos caves ou dans celle des stups
Ce qui nous arrive c'est l'destin, on laisse les salles en feu, ouais
Certains vivent dans le passé, d'autres veulent vivre dans le futur
On vit l'instant présent, tous aux Zéniths pour le Feu Tour
Ma vie je la chante et le peuple la vit comme il l'entend
Si t'attends ta chance c'est sûrement qu'la peur sommeille en toi
Pourquoi mon cœur a-t-il sombré?
Quand je leur pose la question
C'est juste pour savoir si ils sont vrais

Tu bois depuis que t'as raté, car la vie joue sur ton caractère
On a du resserrer pour pas faire de grosses erreurs

La voie que j'ai prise est à sens unique, ouais j'peux pas faire demi-tour

To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays

Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall off the ledge
and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

[Shorty]
God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy
Now we soon to be, one in unity
One two three I'm a G
But the God inside is that G I chose to be
The world is a stage and everybody plays a part
I'm not considered, the one with a sensitive heart
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO

[Chorus]

Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me

Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God

Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible

With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day

If you’re alive and you’re on the planet, and other civilizations, even the Draconian races, they take care of their own! They don’t sell out each other like we do here. They don’t throw somebody in the street because they don’t have a paper, which is really what it is. The only value on it is what we believe it is. They just don’t have that. You know. They don’t let children starve. They don’t feed grain to cattle that feed twenty percent of the population and let the other twenty-five percent that need the grain starve. It’s unconscionable!

'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal

When he came upon this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped
Up on a hickory stump
And said, ""boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it 
But I'm a fiddle player too 
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you 

Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy

And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet
And you're gonna regret

'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards 
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold 
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case
And he said, ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow

Then he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this

When the devil finished
Johnny said, ""well, you're pretty good, old son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done""

I done told you once you son of a bitch

I never believed that golden slippers could ever find the perfect foot.
I never believed in magic, or that wishes could come true,

To tell you everything
That I was feeling deep inside

Cause I'm thinking 'bout you day and night
And I just can't get you off my mind
When you get a minute
Baby I was thinking we could hook up
It's just the two of us 
The two of us 
Cause in a room full of people 
You're the only one around
And nothing in this world
Could ever bring us down
Baby I'll be there
Telling you I care
This I swear
Girl it's just the two of us

Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do
I wonder if you're going 
Through the things I'm going through
I send you flowers on a Saturday
Inside's a letter 
With a message and no name
See I just love the feeling
Knowing I can make you smile
And I haven't felt that way
About someone in quite awhile

You know the place we go The music's John blaze hot
and everybody was feeling the DJ
The smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady
The lights were low and the disco ball came down
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
The girl was fine, and she knew she had game
What more do I have to say

[Chorus]
She took my hand and never said a word at all
she starting grinding shorty had me up against the wall 
I see you bouncing now you know that I don't care at all 
she took me hand now she had me up against the wall
We don't, we don't care at all

It's almost two o'clock, it's time to make my move 
The after-hour spot is where I'm going to
'cause I gotta have some more, looking for 
Somebody to hit the dance floor
And lucky for me I see a fine young lady's eying me
The lights are low, and her friends are all around
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now
She turned around, and she worked it the worst way
What more do I have to say

I see him Killa blast on 'em, never yo

I got the drop on you, don't flinch
Pop niggaz like John Lynch
Leave niggaz in they own stench
I'mma light drinker, heavy smoker
Known for duckin' show promoters
Pass the money, over, my whole crew is ex-cons
Be alarmed, when you hear the err-urrrrr
It's on, Silverback niggaz under the stairs
When we link up, we travel in pairs
Ya'll niggaz best to beware of the most thoroughest
Cover all aspects, four corners
You can't creep up on us
I'm takin' one for the team, deal me in
And when the smoke clears, do it again
This ain't a side show, you can die slow
There's no I in team, we all ride yo!
The Masta brought the ceremony, this is my testament
Homicide Housing, that's what I represent

Criminal gun play, chemical dream to P.J.'s
Last raid, another fed paid, bed rum: Sunday
The world dyin' for the love of money
Expensive chains, intensive pain from that cocaine
Condition the brain, children in strain, as I look back
Memory lane, civil and plain, it be in fame
A major part of the game, chemistry grain
Foolish kids ran when I came
Forty acres, five percent of terrain
Spark right through my vein tunnel, aim through this jungle of rain
A lot of haters wanna see us hang
But watch me bang as in Eagle/Crane
Step back, shatter your frame
Another victim in the system where he barely sustained
Forkin' in, I sold a million way, his first campaign
Sippin' rosemary cherry champagne, nigga
The young and the dangerous, water on the wrist, ice cryst'
Talk with a lisp, then I be top of your list

We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever, yeah, yeah
We all in this together, forever and ever
Down for whatever, whenever

Check the Words from the Genius, that was written in pen
Murder gloves, hide the fingerprint, but never the sin
Ghetto prophet that's born to quote
Got the crimies, behind me, with the face on stroke
Don't provoke, trust son, that thing bust, and we roll dangerous
Who can handle us, when we rush the clubs on thrust
Yo, don't miss the lead vocalist, terrorist
Wu-Tang, a pure danger, the God hold a fort
Teach law, universal, beat down, my stomping ground
We hold courts in the streets of New York
Snort the gun powder, eyes stay red like fire
Cut the mic wire, hit a love ballad note
Pen stroke, beautiful quote, for you to deep throat
Ghetto life had to rough up in the housing
They only make 'em us, every twenty five thousand

[scarface]
Retaliation is a must
Leavin' opposition in the dust
In mob we trust, fuckin' with us gon' get your bust
It's a - suicide, it's a suicide
You will die, nigga, you will die
Just like your homeboy did
When we teed off on him
And since you want drama, we fend the weed off the corner
And when I ride
All these niggas better ride
So if you hoes got pride
Then bring your asses outside
And let me say your bad side
But don't you never let me see you sweat
I'm leaving motherfuckers silhouettes - wet
And you can take that as a treath
But I'ma make the promise
These nigga here is comin'
Sick enough to let to make a maggot vomit
With the intentions to retaliate
Illuminatin', then evacuate
Fuck the tear drops on the casket tops
Just open up with shots from the plastic glock
That leave your ass get got
It's all about gettin' even
Get them muthafuckas when you see 'em
Stop em from breathin

Retaliation
Look at all the heat that you're facing
15 niggas agg in your living room waiting
Passin out shit, bags
Click clacks - toe tags
We came and we kicked that ass
Who run this? double-o-seven
Out of 17 and guaranteed to get eleven
I guess you think you're safe
Sorry that you did it
Hoe, it's too late
Bitch, you shouldn'ta did it
One by one niggas get they ass done
Pussy make me laugh, nigga, money make me come
Nigga set for life
All on this in pay-per-view
? callin? shots make you call yo' whole fuckin' crew
We gotcha

[madd dogg]
I ain't playin with this one, pass the pistol
Warriors come out the play when we whistle
What's that sound? is that them - in the background?
I let the mac clown and shut this whole set down
Rap-a-lot mafia's murderous circle
We kill em done, go get your guns
None survive when I scream the die-die
It's the mister from the free time the dumb-dumb
Retaliation is a must
Who in the fuck gave you muthafuckas the nuts
To try to buck
Wanna bust? nigga what? !
It's dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, in the back is where the pistols pump
I lift em up, gives a fuck
I'm quick to bust
Hit 'em up, get 'em up
Once I send 'em up
Now ? ? ? get enough of my gangsta stuff
Retaliation is a muthafuckin' must

[k.b.]
I stumbled out the club ? ? ? ?
Drunk as fuck
And plus my visions is blurry
My face swoll' the fuck up
Clothes all muddy
It was buddy
From last week who I got into that argument
With - came back with his click
Muthafuckas in some deep shit
And so they asses got to pay
Make my way to a pay phone and hit j.
""hey, I just got jumped on
I'm over here at ? ? ?
It's the mob that ? ? to the brain to the gathor
A few minutes later
I saw the muthafuckin' hummer
Here comes big chief
Mac-11, ready to bomb a
Cock suckers

Was gonna touch 'em
Muthafuck' the law
They ass went up, my nigga bust 'em
This is my biz
Kill 'em all

Had to fry they ass like bacon

Or the fucked up rental, or a hot two seater
As long as the love with me
Hoods will never forget me 
I could put raps in them, and shine up the city
Like elected Frank Nitty, jot a Big Poppa
For reasons of, we run up in a big truck and pop ya
Midnight opera
Over the wheels, slug body marks, and pop up

Stand up niggas will have you sitting in chairs with wheels on them
And that murder shit, I'm still on it
Murder for life
Give a fuck if you a accept it
You better respect it, unless it's, one of my fam' members
Leave whoever into this involvement in legal tendency
Laying where the dirt be
You dig this
Better recover with some big shit
Or duck when this fifth spit
  
Another question: Is you willing to die 
Just as much as you want to kill?
  
I went from handcuff recovering 
Blowing up from bubbling
Shot muscling

Fuck tussling
Word to God
Got a hundred men, with guns and tems
And we love Mack-10's
Since the sex, got a nigga blushed with me
Got a nigga wet
Dropped the lex 
Copped the tech

We out to get the decimals
Don't know about the rest of you
You fucking with professionals
Murderers, that will split your juggle up
Motherfucker I'll cut ya
And you think Tah touch ya
Then we flip shit with bitches that ride all day
And niggas that get head, on the highway
And niggas hating 
To see Satin
Or be played
I'm gon' tell yo' hoe, you in hell waiting
While niggas on Earth
Flossed like they first
For what it's worth
Murderers blast first

It's the streets
Nobody's dancing in the streets
Huh, the streets is ours man, murder

Fuck you, then rob you nigga
A grimy braud, that will set you and wet you
Leave you for my dogs to fetch you
Tie you up and wet you
Unless you, talking pacos again
It don't matter
The longer we spend, the longer we win
And Gotti, showed me how to work these niggas
??? these niggas
And hurt these niggas
And I'll be there, when my niggas need bail
Catch a body, take the stand, and won't tell
T-tale, I flip wholesale retail
Cheap, so you can get deep into this female
  
Gangstas and hoes are together
Don't let nobody tell you no different, man
It's the beginning of time
I love my bitches
  
Motherfucker it's on one
When I come through, niggas run
Niggas know
Equipped with guns, ya heard so
You get plugged up and gutted out
Found dead with a gun in your mouth
Now what you talking about?
Scold on these streets
I'm involved with thugs, who carry heat
To lift you off your feet

But when it's time to eat, the guns come

My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

1-O.A.K.,"Heart bring terror, what the era is
Never needed a shrink, I use my music as my therapist
Tryna to follow the path of the greats minus mistakes
‘Cause in life, you only get one take, you heard me
Game over, lights off, hang up your jersey
Beat the odds like magic ‘cause I’m so James worthy
Tangled in this web called fame
In this pursuit, break free, break free, it’s so dangerous to do, but it’s worth it
The feeling when words can’t break you
The feeling when you’re actually everything you say you are
Own songs, same swan songs, daddy hit mommy, mommy left daddy, so long
Granddaddy passed, I’m hugging on granny, hold on
I ain’t seen nobody cry in so long
I sit back and wonder how everybody is so strong
‘Cause I just don’t wanna be forgotten
I just wanna stack my dough and split the profits with my partners
This rap’s become monotonous, going in circles
So it forces me to go in early as my curfew in high school
Yeah, I was the butt of some jokes
Roll my stress up, let it simmer down in the smoke
In a war against whack shit, I’m on the front line
Now I’m in front of the line, they can’t front on mine
Everything’s by design, everything’s for a reason
Now we’re in the stand, there’s ain’t the slightest chance of leaving",Sincerely Yours,2014

You made me cry
Be proud that I
Remember

My chin is sore
The bruise is gone
But the spot is tender

Gave my hand a sister coy
To Cotton Alley where
You did enjoy
Your wicked games
You curious boy

Tied my laces up together
When I fell
You laughed
Until your belly was sore

In the brick laid aisle behind
The five and dime store

That's how
I made you blush
But doubt if you
Remember

Were my tears genuine
Or those of a skilled
Pretender

Nothing precious
Plain to see
Don't make a fuss over me
Not loud
Not soft
But somewhere in between
Say sorry
Let it be
The word you mean

Never took a hint
Could never
Take a hint

In a door
Tossed my coloring book in a
Rusty barrel

Pulled spiders from my hair

Stained on the back
Running from a berry war

Venus rise overwhelmingly beautiful
He sighs the look of love was in her eyes
Puts his hand upon her leg
Looking closer his lust begins to fade

"10,000 Maniacs","These are days

These are days you'll remember
Never before and never since
I promise
Will the whole world be warm as this
And as you feel it
You'll know it's true 
That you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you 
Are touched by something 
That will grow in you, in you

These are days you'll remember 
When May is rushing over you with desire
To be part of the miracles you see in every hour
You'll know it's true that you are blessed and lucky
It's true that you 
Are touched by something 
That will grow and bloom in you 

These are days

These are the days you might fill with laughter until you break 
These days you might feel a shaft of light 
Make its way across your face
And when you do you'll know how it was meant to be
See the signs and know their meaning
It's true
You'll know how it was meant to be
Hear the signs and know they're speaking to you, to you",These Are Days [From Bringing out the Dead],2006
10-Feet,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain

Every beat of my heart, we got something going on
A tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
Rely on each other, oh ohh
Makin love with each other, oh ohh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
When we rely on each other, oh ohh

From one lover to another, oh ohh
I can live without you when your love is gone
Everything is nothing when you got no woman
You just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

That won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing, yeahhh

No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We started in love forever
We rely on each other, oh ohh
Makin love with each other, oh ohh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me, to another world
When we rely on each other, oh ohh",Islands in the Stream,2000

目覚めて間もなく
思い出させる吸い殻の数
窓の隙間から覗く朝
朝霧で顔を洗う 赤く腫れた目蓋を
いつになく 絶え間なく
覇気もなく
鼻ズルズルいわして泣く
全部投げ出したい すぐ辞めたい
他人のせいにして逃げ出したい
ただ一つ
気になる夢が夢であり続ける
しかし未来のオレがオレに言う
このオレの夢叶えたのは YOU!
ああ 叶わなかった夢
ああ 変わらなかった夢
ああ 叶いきった夢
ああ 変わりきった夢
つたい落ちた数これから微笑む

思い出させる吸い殻の数
窓の隙間から覗く朝
朝霧で顔を洗う 赤く腫れた目蓋を
独りになって思い出す日々
世が世ならオレも社会人
あの瞬間に直感で行動 状況
変化 現在限界で咆哮!
なに一つ 変わらない
頼り無い 凝りない面々
オヤジになったオレが言う
このオレの夢叶えたのは YOU!

ああ 変わりきった夢

切なさと悔しさが時折

100,"I need your love so badly
I love you oh so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I found you

But other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
If you'd surrender
Just for a tender

Kiss or two
You might discover
That I'm the lover
Meant for you

And I'd be true
But what's the good of scheming
I'm dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

'Cause I don't stand
A ghost of a chance
With you",Don't,2006
100 Demons,"I don't drink to forget
I drink so I can suffer twice as much
'Cause in this world of pain
Nothing breaks the memory of your touch
What was I thinking
I should have kept drinking
To flood you face from my mind
But now it's over and I'm sober enough
To know you fucked my mind
Love can seem like slow death
If it's not returned
You will feel your body and soul
Start to burn with desire
And unrelenting pain
The tears they cloud my eyes
I bite my tongue till I taste my blood
So you won't hear my cries
Hiding in my private darkness
I put you out of my mind
My fear of death being overcome
By my hatred for this life",Infected,2000
100 Demons,"Can't live without you you're my saving grace
You helped me keep my sanity
When I was struggling you were by my side
You helped me face reality
The lust I had for you nearly drove me insane
I managed to walk away but doubt I'll ever be the same
You are my one true love for now and forever
And when I have you in my arms can't feel the pain I'm still bitter
I feel so alone, you've sucked the life out of me
I'm already dead I just don't know it yet
Because you stole my heart a love I can't forget
Slowly dying when will I go
I wish I was dead I feel so alone
Your just a memory a twist of fate from god above
When I lie awake at night it's you I crave, it's you I love
The pain it burns inside I suffer everyday
Still alive wishing I was dead like christ at the stake",So Alone,2000
100 Fires,"Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",Eleanor Rigby,2001
