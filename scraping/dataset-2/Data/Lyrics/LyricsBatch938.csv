"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","It's a busted old town on the plains of West Texas.
The drugstore's closed down, and the river's run dry.
The semis roll through like stainless steel stallions
Goin' hard, goin' fast, goin' wild
Rollin' hard, rollin' fast, rollin' by.

And the mission still stands at the edge of the plateau.
A stone marks the graves where the old cowboys lie.
Asleep in a time, in a town just a youngster
Goin' hard, goin' fast, goin' wild
Rollin' hard, rollin' fast, rollin' by.

And the drive-in don't play no Friday night picture.
No big silver screen to light up the sky.
Gone are the days of post-war-time lovers
Goin' hard, goin' fast, goin' wild
Rollin' hard, rollin' fast, rollin' by.

And me I stand here at the last fillin' station
Where the wind moans a dirge to the coyote's cry.
I jump in my car, I'm back out on the highway
Goin' hard, goin' fast, goin' wild
Rollin' hard, rollin' fast, rollin' by
Goin' hard, goin' fast, goin' wild
Rollin' hard, rollin' fast, rollin' by.",Rolling By,1984
"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Kathy there was time when I thought 
Of no one else but me and myself 
Being on my own.

And how can I start to apologize for 
Not being there to dry your eyes when
You were all alone

Flesh and blood Kathy, 
Eye to Eye,
You're my friend and family,
You've been good Kathy, 
To me and I know that, 
That's as good as good can be

Kathy do you remember when I,
Fell in love with one of your friends and,
We left you by yourself.
Your were all torn up inside but,
For my sake you tried to hide the,
Hurtin' that you felt.

Flesh and blood Kathy, 
Eye to Eye,
You're my friend and family,
You've been good Kathy, 
To me and I know that, 
That's as good as good can be

Kathy all grown up now with,
Pretty eyes and mountain flower, 
Coming into bloom.
And sometimes you know the words aren't there to,
Say the things you need to hear,
So I wrote this song for you.

Flesh and blood Kathy, 
Eye to Eye,
You're my friend and family,
You've been good Kathy, 
To me and I know that, 
That's as good as good can be.
You've been good Kathy,
To me and I know that,
You're as good as good can be.",Song for Kathy [#],1984
"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing
'Cause sometimes all my days are filled with rain
As I travel down life's higway, things ain't going my way
'Cause there's always someone swervin' in my lane
You keep a swervin' in my lane and it's causing' lots of danger
I'm a honkin' on my horn, I'm a shooting you the finger
I keep a switchin' on my bright lights, but your just too dim to know
When your swervin' on life's highway, your running someone off the road

The day you drove away I thought I never
Could love another. How else could I feel?
But now when you run into me, I cain't believe I could not see
Your all tanked up, but no ones at the wheel

You keep a swervin' in my lane and it's causin' lots of danger
I'm a cussin' out your name, I'm a shooting you the finger
I keep a switchin' on my bright lights, but your just too dimm to know
When your swervin' on life's highway, your running someone off the road

When and if I ever finally pass you
Oh when I do and if I'm still alive
I want never see you, cause I'm ripping out my rear view
And I'm shifting it on in to overdrive

But your still swervin' in my lane and it's causin' lots of danger
I'm a stompin' on the foot feed, I'm a shooting you the finger
I keep a switchin' on my bright lights, but your just too dimm to know
When your swervin' on life's highway, your running someone off the road",Swervin' in My Lane,1984
"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","It's been five years come this autumn, she remembers well the day
The day the fever got him, and took him far away
Far away from always knowing that the love they shared was true
Far away the fiddler's bowing, the grass forever blue
It was in the dead of winter when her man first caught the chill
And he said he heard the angels singing 'Cabin on the Hill'
Through the springtime he was groaning 'The good times are past and gone'
By the summer she was moaning 'Old lover please come home'
[Chorus:]
Now she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow
She prays to Carter Stanley 'Won't you please tell Bill Monroe
Rather be in some dark hollow or some dark deep shady grove
Than to be a bluegrass widow'
Spoken word break:
I started listening to bluegrass music in Bryan Duckworth's rust red 1970 Ford Maverick. 
Had an eight track tape deck and an eight track tape of Bill Monroe's Greatest Hits. 
We used to skip second period chemistry and go over to the Shamrock station across the street from the high school and get a case of Texas Pride beer. 
Charge it on my dad's credit card and get 'em to write it up as oil so dad never knew the difference. 
Then we'd ride around and drink Texas Pride, listen to Bill Monroe. 
Soon we got to be bluegrass experts. 
And we'd stop in another Shamrock station and get another Texas Pride case, 
Drink that and listen to the Stanley Brothers and then we'd go get a tape of Jim and Jesse and it was on to the Kentucky Colonels and Mack Wiseman and the New Grass Revival, Peter Rowan, and finally I got the brilliant idea one day to take all the greatest bluegrass song titles in the world and string 'em together to make this song right here,
The Bluegrass Widow. Quite possibly the worst bluegrass song ever written. 
I did this in tribute to the Front Porch Boys, which was a bluegrass band I was in in College Station, Texas. 
We were a little four piece band, we played weddings and parties and out on the porch and beer joints and one weekend on a handful of cheap amphetamines, we decided to go to Crockett, Texas. 
We entered the International Bluegrass Band Competition and took second place. 
We could play faster than anybody in the competition. 
The other two bands took first and third, respectively. 
I met some friends and went off into the night separated from the Front Porch Boys and met back up with them in the cold, gray light of dawn, as the bluegrass songs say. 
They were standing underneath a giant pine tree there in Crockett singing the rudest, most grotesque, nastiest bluegrass songs you've ever heard in your life. 
I'm talking about the kind of song where not only is the character in the song dead by the end of the song, but he's been dismembered as well. 
And the Front Porch Boys stopped and looked up at me just long enough to say, 'We're taking bluegrass music where it's never been before. 
And we're not taking you with us ''cause you don't have that high and lonesome sound that bluegrass music requires.' Well, I'm not one to fight failure. 
I packed up my stuff and left. 
The Front Porch Boys broke up three days later when they realized I owned the PA system.
'Will you miss me when I'm gone?' were his final words to her
'Darlin' think of what you've done,' then replied his Knoxville girl
And the leaves had started turning when his mind began to fail
Then he broke down in a breakdown, now she wears a long black veil.
And she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow
She prays to Carter Stanley 'Won't you please tell Bill Monroe
Rather be in some dark hollow or some dark deep shady grove
Than to be a bluegrass widow'
And she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow
She prays to Carter Stanley 'Won't you please tell Bill Monroe

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Now i went out last Sunday with my little Mary Anne
She said please stay 'till Monday and she grabbed me by the can
She laid a big one on me- surprised me with her tongue
But her surprise was waitin' there between my cheek and gum

Copenhagen, what a wad of flavor
Copenhagen, you can see it in my smile
Copenhagen, do yourself a favor chew
Copenhagen, drivin' pretty girls wild

So I went to the movies with my little Peggy Sue
I had my dip there in my lip just like I always do
She didn't know I's spittin in my Coca Cola cup
She took a great big swaller and then threw her popcorn up, Whoa!

Copenhagen, what a wad of flavor
Copenhagen, you can see it in my smile
Copenhagen, do yourself a favor chew
Copenhagen, drivin' pretty girls wild

The moral of this story is so very sad but true
If you stay 'till breakfast friend, they'll want to marry you
So try my little method and I promise you no doubt
Dip some Copenhagen if you want to snuff 'em out

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","I left Houston, Texas on a Gulf Coast Hurricane
I was blown down by tornadoes, washed up by the rain
Well my pappy wasn't happy with me, he told me to go
So I stole my daddy's Cadillac, and I headed down the road
I had a grin from ear to ear with each and every mile
I'm headed for the border man, I'm goin' down in style.
Well I hit Corpus Christi, and the wind was at my back
I drove them women crazy in my daddy's Cadillac
I'd cruse them down the boulevard, treated them like queens
I took them all the places that they wanted to been seen
And when I had to leave them, I'd tell them with a smile
I'm headed for the border, man I'm goin' down in style
Well, you've got to take your chances if they ever come along
Close your eyes and listen to that great big engine wind
And it down really matter, whether you are right or wrong
Cause when you cross the border yeah you leave this world behind
I stomped down on the pedal, I set the cruise control
Five hundred raging horses blew on by the state patrol
Yeah, there sirens were screaming, Lord the lights were flashing red
A dozen more were waiting at the road block up ahead
I scattered them like chickens, I heard one of them cry 
""He's headin' for the border man, he's goin' down in style.""
Yeah when you cross the border you ain't ever coming back
And there ain't no redemption when the cops are on your tail
The closest thing to heaven, is the great big Cadillac
The city lights of Houston, or the fiery gates of hell
They nabbed me on the hill that overlooks the Rio Grande
I'm feeling just like Moses looking at the promise land
They hauled me back to Houston, they threw me into jail
My momma started crying when my daddy paid the bail
I'm sorry I'm not there to hear the outcome of my trial
I'm headed for the border man, I'm goin' down in style",Goin' Down in Style,1988
"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Have you got a minute
A little time that we can spend?
Open up and let me in
And share some memories

People in a hurry
Every day goes by so fast
No one takes the time to ask
How it used to be

[Chorus:]
I wanna know
Did you father own an automobile
Or two-horse carriage with wood spoke wheels?
I hear you used to walk to school seven miles a day
Did you ever ride a railroad train
And the very first time you saw a plane
Did you think the world had gone insane?
Tell me what you got to say
I want to know

Words can paint a picture
Sharper than a photograph
I know that you can take me back
To times I've never seen
Got a lot of questions
There's so much I want to learn
You can make the pages turn
Living history

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","You never liked this place where we've been livin' all along
So you packed up your things and bought a one-way ticket home
Leavin' never hurts as much as bein' left behind

[Chorus]
I would change my life
I would make it right
I would change my life
If you would only change your mind

I have spent my hours on some misbegotten dreams
And I have spent my money on some foolish-hearted things
And I have spent my memories on old and bitter wine

[Chorus]

Birds are flying south to spend the wintertime
Skies are turning blue to gray
The fire we started here will soon be burning down
And it gets colder every day

I wish that I could find the words to make you come back home
I wish I could say the things you needed for so long
I wish you could see me now
Baby, then you'd find

[Chorus:Repeat x2]",I Would Change My Life,1988
"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","I've got clothes in my closet and new shoes to wear
And all that I wanted are more than my share
And the woman who loves me she's more than a dream
So why am I feeling so low down and mean?
Well I gave up on smokin' two years ago
And I ain't been drinkin' for a month now or so
And I tell everybody that I've nothin' to hide
While I keep the devil locked deep down inside

[Chorus:] 
And tonight I'll be out there a runnin' around
Tonight by the light of the moon on the ground
Tonight while the neighbors are sleepin' so sound
Tonight I'll slip off and I'll go on downtown
We used to get crazy and jump in our cars
We'd burn up the highways and we'd close down the bars
But now we're all married and some moved away
And we get together there's nothing to say

[Chorus:] 

The lights are all down and the moon's hangin' high
And the stars are all shining way up in the sky
And if anyone's askin' where I'll be found
It's home in the mornin' but tonight I'm downtown

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","If I were the king of this old crazy world
I'm telling you there'd be some changes made
In my golden crown, I'd lead the big parade
If I were king, there'd be some changes made
I'd take you from your prison, and set you on a throne
Instead of threads of linen, you'd wear a satin gown
Upon my throne so safe and sound, you'd never be afraid

I'd take you from your prison, and set you on a throne

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","There's a big race down in Dallas
Don't you wish that you were there?
You could bet your bottom dollar
On that iron gray mare

Had a black horse named Delilah
And I raised her on the farm
There was thunder, there was lightning
On the day Stewball was born

Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win
Bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win

So I sold off my possessions
And I headed for the town
I brought Stewball here to Dallas
And I laid my money down

Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win
Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win

And the women, they a cryin'
All the men folk are a hollerin'

I chanced to discover an old memory
Three for a quarter, a black and white portrait
Taken of Jennifer Johnson and me

I'm in the corner, my shirt collar open
Like some Latin lover, on late night TV
Smiling right there with her head on my shoulder
It's Jennifer Johnson, and she's lookin' at me

On the Corpus Christi Bay

I lived in Corpus with my brother
We were always on the run
We were bad for one another
But we were good at having fun
We got stoned along the seawall
We got drunk and rolled a car

Had a tab at every bar

If I could live my life all over
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause I never could stay sober

My brother had a wife and family
You know, he gave them a good home
But his wife thought we were crazy
And one day we found her gone
We threw her clothes into the car trunk
Her photographs, her rosary
We went to the pier and got drunk
And threw it all into the sea

Now my brother lives in Houston
He married for the second time
He got a job with the union
And it's keeping him in line

At midnight in New Mexico
It's a small colored light
That shines from your car radio
It's the old motel owner
Who sleeps on a cot
And gives you the very last cup from his pot

It's a lonely feeling, it's what you've got
It's a lonely feeling, like it or not

Right next to a pay telephone
It's someone's recorder

To do what you please

And they're stuck up in east Oregon

It's a lonely feeling, that runs through the land

Who sees you and wishes you well
You try to breakthrough 
But you run out of stories to tell
So you bid him goodbye and you step into space
There are so many questions that you cannot face

It's fright and rejected
Neglected, and blind, deaf and dumb

And you're still hanging in

Some where between snow and  rain

Now he thinks of her each night and in the morning
He laces his coffee cup with whiskey instead of cream

Cause I'm coming in with someone else

But his pain won't go a way
So for  better or worse he's going down
To meet the Lynnville train

He blew a tire on the road to the station
He jacked it up and thought out loud, 
""She never should have let me down.""

Now she's coming home with a stranger
To settle down in Lynnville town

He reaches in his coat, his had is shaking

In the city of the soldier, in the time of war
There I met my Angelina, I was 24

We fought them through the emerald valley
To the sacred hill

I took to hiding in the mountains, through the wintertime
In the spring I rode to safety across the borderline
I sent word to Angelina, soon I will return
With the full moon in the window, let your lamplight burn

From the bluff above her village
My hope has turned to fright
Only darkness in the windows
Not a single light

Fists at Him above
Twice forsaken, once in war

Stricken by my loss
I vowed to leave my lifeless body
Upon His Holy Cross

Across the face of Angelina

Little girl, think it over one time

Before you break in your walking shoes.

I am just what I am, I won't apologize

So if you go or if you stay you know I'll keep on loving you.

He cuts and trims the grass for me he makes the flowers bloom
He says that he comes from a place not far from Guanajuato
That's two days on a bus from here, a lifetime from this room.

I fix his meals and talk to him in my old broken spanish
He points at things and tells me names of things I can't recall
Sometimes I just can't but help but wonder who this man is
And if when he is gone will he'll remember me at all

I watch him close he works just like a piston in an engine
He only stops to take a drink and smoke a cigarette
When the day is ended, I look outside my window
There on the horizon, Mariano's silhouette

I know my charts I know that he is thinking of his home
I've never been the sort to say I'm in to intuition
But I swear I see the faces of the ones he calls his own

Their skin is brown as potters clay, their eyes void of expression
Their hair is black as widow's dreams, their dreams are all but gone
They're ancient as a vision of a sacrificial virgin
Innocent as crying from a baby being born

They hover around a dying flame and pray for his protection
Their prayers are all but answered by his letters in the mail
He sends them colored figures that he cuts from strips of paper
And all his weekly wages, saving nothing for himself

It's been a while since I have seen the face of Mariano
The border guards they came one day and took him far away
I hope that he is safe down there at home in Guanajuato
I worry though I read there's revolution every day",Mariano,1996

At our Christmas party
We were drinkin' champagne punch and homemade eggnog

He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him

Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife Lynn
And the two identical twins
From his second wife Mary Nell
Of course he brought his new wife, Kay

He threw the breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night, oh Silent Night

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Sherry was a waitress at the only joint in town
She had a reputation as a girl who'd been around
Down Main Street after midnight with a brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hangin' from her lips and a beer between her legs
She'd ride down to the river and meet with all her friends
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Sonny was a loner he was older than the rest
He was going into the Navy but he couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town he sold a little pot
The law caught wind of Sonny and one day he got caught
But he was back in business when they set him free again
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Sonny's playin' 8-ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunken outta towner put his hand up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue laid the drunk out on the floor
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar and walked on out the door
She's runnin' right behind him reachin' for his hand 
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They jumped into his pickup Sonny jammed her down in gear
Sonny looked at Sherry and said lets get on outta here
The stars were high above them and the moon was in the east
The sun was settin' on them when they reached Miami Beach
They got a hotel by the water and a quart of Bombay gin
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They soon ran out of money but Sonny knew a man
Who knew some Cuban refugees that delt in contraband
Sonny met the Cubans in a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot
The cards were on the table when the law came bustin' in
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

The Cubans grabbed the goodies and Sonny grabbed the Jack
He broke a bathroom window and climbed on out the back
Sherry drove the pickup through the alley on the side
Where a lawman tackled Sonny and was reading him his rights
She stepped into the alley with a single shot .410
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They left the lawman lyin' and they made their getaway
They got back to the motel just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money and he blew her a little kiss
If they ask you how this happened say I forced you into this
She watched him as his taillights disappeared around the bend
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Its Main Street after midnight just like it was before
21 months later at the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper and a cold 6-pack of beer
The headlines read that Sonny is goin' to the chair
She pulls back onto Main Street in her new Mercedes Benz

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Me and the boy's we cinched up our saddles and rode to sonora last night
Gun's hanging proud, daring out loud for any one looking to fight
Card cheats and rustlers would run for their holes when the boys from the old broken O
Rode up and reined on the street that they named Sonora's death row

Mescal is free at Amanda's saloon for the boy's from the old broken O
Saturday nights in the town of Sonora are the best in all Mexico
They've got guitars and trumpets and sweet senoritas who won't want to let you go
You'd never believe such a gay happy time on the street called Sonora's death row

Inside Amanda's we was a dancin' with all of Amanda's gals
I won some silver at seven card stud so I was out doin' my pals
But the whiskey and mescal, peso cigars drove me outside for some air
Somebody whispered ""Your life or your money"", I reached but my gun wasn't there

I woke up face down in Amanda's back alley aware of the fool I had been
Rushed to my pony, grabbed my Winchester and entered Amanda's again
Where I saw my partners twirling my pistols and throwing my money around
Blinded by anger, I jacked the lever and one of them fell to the ground
Amanda's got silent like night in the desert, my friends stared in pure disbelief

Amanda was kneeling beside the dead cowboy plainly expressing her grief
And as I bowed my head a trembled shot through me my six-gun was still at my side
I felt my pockets, there was my money, I fell to my knees and I cried
A nightmare of mescal is all that it was for no one had robbed me at all
I wish I was dreaming the sound of the gallows they're testing just outside
The wall

The mescal's still free at Amanda's saloon for the boy's from the old Broken O

It makes no difference now let's chalk it all up to the blues.

I am just what I am, I won't apologize

Love don't walk away, only people do
So if you go or if you stay you know I'll keep on loving you.

We've made the hard time sing, we've made the miles roll by,
We've broken both our wings and still we've had the will to fly.

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Flatter than a tabletop
Makes you wonder why they stopped here
Wagon must have lost a wheel
Or they lacked ambition one

On the great migration west
Separated from the rest
Though they might have tried their best
They never caught the sun

So they sunk some roots down in the dirt
To keep from blowin' off the earth
Built a town around here

And when the dust had all but cleared
They called it Levelland
The pride of man in Levelland

Granddad grew the dry land wheat
Stood on his own two feet
His mind got incomplete
And they put in the home

Daddy's cotton grows so high
Sucks the water table dry
But rolling sprinklers circle round
Bleedin' it to the bone

And I won't be here when it comes a day
It all dries up and blows away
I'd hang around just to see

But they never had much
Use for me in Levelland
They don't understand me
Out in Levelland

And I watch those jet trails
Carving up that big blue sky
Coast to coasters watch 'em go

And I never would blame 'em one damn bit
If they never looked down on this
Not much here they'd wanna know

Just Levelland
Far as you can point your hand
Nothin' but Levelland

Mama used to roll her hair
Back before the central air
We'd sit outside
And watch the stars at night

She'd tell me to make a wish
I'd wish we both could fly
Don't think she's seen the sky
Since we got the satellite dish

And I can hear the marching band
Doin' the best they can, they're playing
""Smoke on the Water"", ""Joy to the World""

I've paid off all my debts
Got some change left over yet
And I'm gettin' on a whisper jet

I'm gonna fly as far as I can get from
Levelland, doin' the best I can
Out in Levelland, imagine that

Bob was a raving maniac, crazy in the head

For pushin' over port-a-cans at the 4-H rodeo
Since then they've done their little dance

Held tight when a black man in a

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","I climbed the mountains and I swept the plains
I crossed the border and I broke my chains
I walked the back roads 'til my shoes wore through
I'm still without you without you

I lie awake at night and say your name
I paint your picture in a starlit frame
I try imagining a rendezvous
I'm still without you.... without you

Chorus:
L thought I'd find
You would leave my mind
But my dreams they just don't know
They can't seem to let you go
I'm so sad I don't know what to do
Without you

I often wonder how it came to this
If I could travel back to our last kiss
If I had a different point of view
I'm still without you.... without you
The moon is sitting just beyond the hill
The wind is resting but my heart won't still
It happens every night right on cue
I'm still without you.... without you

Knew or you cared
He asks you where you live

I hate like hell when there ain't nothing left to do 
But stand beneath the river bridge and listen for the train 
It's been a long hot summer, not a drop of rain 
I broke down in December and headed for the coast 
I thought the wind and water would elevate my mind 
I surfaced in the springtime feeling like a ghost 
Missing more than ever the things I left behind 
Now I'm standing on this river bank and still cannot explain 
It's been a long hot summer, not a drop of rain 
My bag is full of letters unopened and unread 
I'm sure they tell the story of worry and reform 
My heart is beating heavy with all we left unsaid 
I swear to you I never meant you any harm 
But sacrifice and compromise could never stand the strain 
It's been a long hot summer, not a drop of rain 
Tonight I close my eyes again and try to see your face 
Listen for your voice to tell me it's all right to sleep 
Convince myself I'll wake up in another time and place 
Knowing all the while it's a promise I can't keep 
A string of broken promises another link of chain 
It's been a long hot summer, not a drop of rain 
The children on the playground, the lovers in the shade 
Remind me of a life and time that feels more like a dream 
When the sound of love and laughter was the music that we played 
As we lay beside the waters of the never ending stream 
Now the stream's gone into hiding, the dream lives on in vain 
It's been a long hot summer, not a drop of rain 
The clouds are building slowly on the skyline to the east 
The wind and dust are dancing like the devil 'cross the lake 
I could try and find a bottle or try and find a breeze 
Salvation won't be traveling either road I take 
So I turn my collar to the wind that echoes this refrain 
It's been a long, hot summer, not a drop of rain",Not a Drop of Rain [DVD],2004
"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","We made Oklahoma a little after 3
Randy, his brother Bob and my old GMC
We had some moonshine whisky
And some of Bob's homegrown 

We were so messed up we didn't know 
If we were drunk or stoned
Randy was a sad-sack, tall kinda frail
Bob was a raving maniac, crazy in the head

They been kicked out of high school several years ago
For pushin over port-a-cans at the 4-H rodeo
Since then they've done their little dance 
Right outside the law

Popped twice in Oklahoma, once in Arkansas
And I don't know what possessed me 
To want to tag along
'Cause I was raised a Christian

And I knew right from wrong

Cross the line your gonna pay
In the dawn before the light
Live and die by the shades of gray

We stole two Charolais heifers from 
Randy's sweetheart's paw
Sold them at the livestock sale
Outside of Wichita

We got $900 and never did suspect
The world of hurt we'd be in once 
We cashed that check
Next day we heard the story

On the local radio
Made our plans that very night 
To go to Mexico
I swear we would have made it

If it wasn't for that shine
I got sick about the time we crossed 
That Kansas line

[Chorus]

I was layin' in the bar ditch
Prayin' I would die
When a light come on above us
And a voice come from the sky

A half a dozen unmarked cars
Came screeching to a halt
They grabbed bob, he started screamin'
It was all my fault

There were men and dogs 
And helicopter buzzin' all around
They had the brothers on the
Pickup hood and me down on the ground

Bob flew all to pieces but randy he
Held tight when a black man in a
Suit and tie stepped out into the light
He told his men to turn us loose

They put down their guns
He said these are just some 
Sorry kids, they ain't the ones

[Chorus]

They left us by the roadside
Down hearted and alone
Randy got behind the wheel
Said boys I'm going home

Downhearted but alive on that

Gun's hanging proud, daring out loud for any one looking to fight
Card cheats and rustlers would run for their holes when the boys from the old broken O
Rode up and reined on the street that they named Sonora's death row

Mescal is free at Amanda's saloon for the boy's from the old broken O
Saturday nights in the town of Sonora are the best in all Mexico
They've got guitars and trumpets and sweet senoritas who won't want to let you go
You'd never believe such a gay happy time on the street called Sonora's death row

Inside Amanda's we was a dancin' with all of Amanda's gals
I won some silver at seven card stud so I was out doin' my pals
But the whiskey and mescal, peso cigars drove me outside for some air
Somebody whispered Your life or your money, I reached but my gun wasn't there

I woke up face down in Amanda's back alley aware of the fool I had been
Rushed to my pony, grabbed my Winchester and entered Amanda's again
Where I saw my partners twirling my pistols and throwing my money around
Blinded by anger, I jacked the lever and one of them fell to the ground

Amanda's got silent like night in the desert, my friends stared in pure disbelief
Amanda was kneeling beside the dead cowboy plainly expressing her grief
And as I bowed my head a trembled shot through me my six-gun was still at my side
I felt my pockets, there was my money, I fell to my knees and I cried

A nightmare of mescal is all that it was for no one had robbed me at all

For everything that went wrong
Now there's an ugly little pistol on the table
And a letter in your hand

It won't come up again

'Cause when you love somebody
Like you loved that girl
And she breaks your heart

Tell you how the story ends

"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","Then there was the time
I saw the great Hank Williams singing on the stage in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania and he was all dressed up in drag
From his rose red lips to his rhinestone hips he belted
Out song after song as he drank from a brown paper bag
And the songs he sang of love and pain,
So pure perfect reflections of human imperfections,
It damn near choked me up
But the rest of the show, was kind of slow
And then someone woke me up

Later on the Astros were silently beating the living crap
Out of Cincinnati on the TV above
And a little to the left of the great Hank Williams' head
As a busty suicide blonde waitress poured him a double shot of 'whatever you got'
And laughingly said ""I thought you were dead""
The pool balls cracked as he tilted his head back
And told her how he had been a big star but now country music was full of freaks
He sat there, in the TV glare
Mascara streaked his cheeks

When I was only sixteen years old I went from Houston to Abilene
With a spunky stunningly handsome woman in a Volkswagen Bug
She was grown with some kids all her own,
A commitment-free divorcee, and I was a man in love
We had only one 8-track tape but it was of the late great
Hank Williams and we sang in two-part harmony
""Hey good lookin', how's about cookin'
Something up with me""

Back at the bar they were calling last call
So I gave the barmaid a credit card to pay up my tab
The TV was turned off and the stage was dark
And the great Hank Williams was gone so I asked her to call me a cab
She said if you like I can give you a ride,
So there we were out the door and into the city of brotherly love
Into the night, out of sight
In a VW Bug

Moon shining bright as the dawn
I saw a man come-a-walkin'
He had a long chain on

I heard his chain a clankin'
It made a mournful sound
Welded around his body
Dragging along on the ground

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

He came up to my window
He looked at me and he said
""I am so tired and hungry
Give me a bite of your bread""

He did not look like a robber
He didn't look like a thief
His face was all covered in sadness
He had a voice full of sorrow and grief

He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on

I went into my kitchen
Got him a bowl full of meat
A drink and a pan of cold biscuits
That's all I had for him to eat

And though he was tired and hungry
A bright light came over his face
He bowed his head on his bosom
He made a beautiful grace

(Long chain, long chain, long chain)
(He had a long chain on)

Offered to set him free
He shook his head and said sadly
Guess we had best let it be

He thanked me again and again
And though it's been years since I saw him
I still hear the rattle of his chain

""Gonna buy me a ticket to the end of the line
Wanna feel the air, breathe the countryside
As long as those wheels keep rollin', I'll be satisfied

He was moppin' up gettin' ready to close
He sat down and poured me one last brew

From a place unknown
I travel on the mountain roads
Looking for someone

Sewn inside my vest, a letter
Tells me where and when
In my purse a sacred dagger
On my horse I run

Restless girl beside the water
Tending to a fire
Kissed a boy and then another
Suiting up for war

Heard a broken band of gypsies
Singing ancient songs
Gave all my silver to a beggar
Still he wanted more

Oh the town of stone and timber
Celebration reigned
No one there seems to remember
Why they carry on

Crowded 'round a man of marble
Speaking foreign tongues
There the stone began to crumble
And the crowd did moan

In the unforgiving morning
Caravans of shame
Turn south to the dry land highway
I turn to the sea

Like a snake so quick and deadly
Sleepless, coiled and cool
The one I seek is making ready
Waiting patiently

Pity not the weary traveler
He lives in his mind
He is friend of wind and weather
And from fire is born

Pity then the cool betrayer
Waiting patiently
No precaution made will save him
From the traveling storm

Could have been an hour ago, or maybe yesterday

She's never met a stranger, I'm sure you would agree
And if you got to talkin', she probably made you laugh

Restless as the wind

The wild ones will run again

But love is like a songbird and every song she sings
You'll hear a sweet reminder of her wings

You're on my mind as I drive home in the rain
I'm reminded again of some familiar yesterday

Cheers to old times, raise a glass to the pain
I hope that you'll alright but it seems not much is changed
You are buying a round for everybody at the bar
You are painting the town with your daddy's credit card
All these things you must do to keep from going insane

Up and then down, a chill, nothing remains
Sand through an hourglass on its last grains
Only now that it's over I know who to blame
A bottle of wine and a bag cocaine

In this lonely apartment in a cloud of regret
I go through the same old argument to reminisce or to forget
I find acceptance so fleeting unless it's coursing through my veins

If my heart is still beating, if in my sleep I've not chocked
Come over tonight and won't you bring along some smokes?
We can put on a record and I can fill your head with lies
We get so sentimental but it's only lust in disguise
It's so hard to extinguish such an old familiar flame

Foolish and unguarding,following blindly without fear
Skippin' school and hoppin' fences
Making love down by the pear

Burn bright in the night like an old kerosene lamp

What a vision to behold

And your words are like home
I do not deserve such kindness
Keeps me warm down to my arms
We bear some strange familiar likeness
To a man I feel I know

As if to keep each other safe
They spent the night and then embrace

Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer

Tomorrow is near

More of your kind

Robert Forster,"Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm paying my rent everyday in the Tower of Song

I said to Leonard Cohen: How lonely does it get?
Leonard Cohen hasn't answered me yet
But I can hear him coughing all night long,
A million floors above me in the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born like this, with a golden voice
Twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond,
Well they tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song

You can stick your needles in a voodoo doll
I'm sorry baby, but it don't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
They don't let a woman kill you in the Tower of Song

I've grown bitter, bitter, of this you may be sure:
The rich, the rich have got channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgement but it won't be long, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song - oh yeah -
The guitar, the bass, the drums, so nice every hour in the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
But I loved you, baby, way back when
All the bridges are burning that we might have crossed,
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
But I'll never have to lose you again, Tower of Song

I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'm back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me, baby, long after I'm gone
I'm speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song

Now you can say that I've grown bitter, of this you can be sure:
The rich have got channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgment but it won't take long, I may be wrong",Tower of Song,1991
Robert Forster,"I took her out of her world and put her into mine
I took away what she knew, had treasured over time

Let's sail away, baby
I can't explain what I see
Let's sail away, baby
Please try and follow me

I took her out of her home, a cabin near the woods
And took her to this desert with threatening
Neighborhoods

Well I believe, baby
I thought it was better for us
Yes I believe, baby
There was gold in that dust
 
And now I see, baby
I put distance into your own life
Let's sail away, baby
Let's sail into this life

The blue carpeted floors, the tall wooden doors 
I held you in my arms
Junebug, I'd burn down a picture of a house 
Say it was ours, when we didn't need it anymore 
And that was when I loved you best
We were kids then
We shouldn't think about the rest

You'd put the moon in a basket on your bike front by the coast
The way your fixed it up, in pale grief you were a ghost
You liked to play with darkness, all the universe could give
I was the home you once tried to escape, the dark in which you lived

Soon they'd find you laying there on several different homes
They'd find you laying on their porches, did you need to use the phone? 
And lure you into their rooms
That was the last I heard of June
And that was the love I could not allow

You were beautiful then, you're just a coke jaw now

Oh

You were beautiful then, I'm still in too deep",Junebug,2010
Robert Francis,"Light shines off rivers flowing through
Every part of me wanting every part you

Soft and simple veins make a stain or find a dream
If I was the one
Maybe I could feel your pain

And the water boils while the night is on fire
I patiently wait like a bird on a wire

New dreams are made of fear while sleep surrounds us
Tunnels changing lanes oh summarize your pain inside a school bus

Summer fall, October ends
Shadows, odds and ends
Winter won't pretend
Oh I know I'll see you again

The wind blows you and me
Catching teardrops in the leaves
Oh I don't believe that every night I feel you breathe

And the tension boils like sailors close to home
Time is black, but you assume I'll be alone

Fate does tempt itself like a game of cat and mouse
It soon will find us

And anything we need
God knows the devil could precede
In denying us",Dakota,2007

Start of another day
Sleeping through the epilogue
Waking to the sound of rain

Driven to the crossroads
Where value's meaningless
What did you do to my faith
In justice, hope and happiness

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

Take my fire
Take my food and water
Forget about those promises
Of social good and social order

Lassoed by the cowboys
Tied down and it shows
I'm roping in those bad dreams
And selling off my working clothes

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

Gonna take a course of action
To restore my sight
'Til the heart of motivation
Is filled with a golden light

They're hiding in the treetops
Tugging at my coat
Power lines are falling down
And burning in the undergrowth

Social, economical, spiritual
I'm moving to the house of love

As the river runs, tumbles and turns
You know you shouldn't stay
Play the game again
It could be different this time
You may win

Dreaming, dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
Lying down

Moving to the house of love

Robert Fripp,"He beats the door and breaks his watch
Raids the fridge and eats the lot
No room for silence, pause of thought
To ease the hurt inside him
They placed a barrel at his head
Raging blind and rising
Cursed by saints and all the rest
He can`t stand up for trying
Shot through with anger and desire
A mouth to feed, a room for hire
He drinks 'goodbyes', the bottle dry
Brutalised but smiling
Causing casualties by the hour
Outweighed by stars
And Firepower
Causing casualties by the hour
Waylayed by stars
And Firepower
He beats the door and breaks the lock
Afraid to sleep he won`t let up
No room for silence, pause or thought
To ease the hurt inside him",Firepower,1993
Robert Fripp,"He gambles on the saddle
He's pulling on the mane
He thrashes on the horse's back
Ambition is a bloody game

Horse doesn't want to jump
The river looks too wide
Well he faces every hurdle
With a nervous state of mind

Stay with me, breathe deeply
Take three passes back
Turn and make a full attack

The gods are laughing
And they're tugging at the reins
But he's taken to his wings
And they hit the bank

Heaven may stone him
But jean the birdman pulls it off

His finger's on the trigger
His eye is on the clock
He doesn't give the game away
And quickly fires the bullets off

Six hearts cut short
Still dreaming they're alive
Blown 'round in dusty circles
Like an absent state of mind

Who hunter? who victim?
God love America
He surely doesn't love him

Hitching out of nowhere
Lines of traffic knee deep
A chance to stave the morning off
And get some sleep

Heaven may stone him
But jean the birdman pulls it off

He wears a crucifix
His mother left to him
It's wrapped in chains around his heart
Rusted and wafer thin

Don't count on luck son
All the angels sing
Don't need to check a weathervane
We all know what tomorrow brings

Life is a cattle farm
Coyotes with the mules
Life is a bullring
For taking risks and flouting rules

Became a home for a flock

Fought with the aliens

Pointed the way to a flock

Magazine times
With coffee more sugar and milk than coffee
Aborted rhymes, rotten beats, and failed hooks
Roads as bumpy as braille books
Fail cools, bad French, and mad push at the door
Gourmet food at the starving soiree
A choice of one easy woman at a time
I'll take three the hard way
Trying to be as abstract as possible
And vulgar, the more shocking the more profitable
A baby fed molten gold
And sat upon a pedestal promote getting called 24 carot souls
How to describe this
Insightful remarks such as the best thing I've ever heard is silence
Some more technically impressive
In a faux Spanish romantic hues of a Marxist dialectic
Please listen to the critics, pointless is the common passerby
Might as well not even exist, not even a bit
In the event of my demise give everything I prize to the poor
And to the oppressors, I leave a war
And so on and so forth",Always Shine,2012

The night is young
Oh, shine your light

For me when I'm out in the streets
Ends justify means when you making a meet
When you losing the sleep that you saying you need
But what good is rest when it's family to feed
When it's money to get, when it's dollars to count
Fuck a job, you never raised for larger amounts
Keep the lights on, front door locked
'Cause the villains in the wilderness, lotta George Zimmermans
Damned with some innocence
So that mean he still out on the prowl for a black child
While the judge and jury crack smile, Lord
Keep the lights burning

Oh, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

For me when I'm out on the creep
Do whatever to get a meal when you barely can eat
I'm determined to fight the power to further the peace
Mama scared the police might make a point out of me
'Cause it's hard to sleep living life in a daze
When kings wanna be niggas, I hope it's a phase
Queens down to be hoes as long as they paid
Chained to our oppressor, unknowing we slaves
Who wants to be saved
When they claim that the prayers that we pray go unheard
In these God-forgotten days, just in case
Keep the lights burning

Oh, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light

For me when I barely can smile
And the sun refuse to shine when I'm out in the wild
And the raindrops tap the window pane on my room
Scared I lost faith, pray I find God soon
In a world full of alt-rights I was left field
Black man born poor, I was black steel
Black man born free, this how blessed feel
Because my dreams are dreams, don't make them less real
Nightmares are still the same thing
I've fallen from grace, wishing I had wings
Like a dunk in the Summer but I ain't had Spring
'Cause all that running from trouble'll give you bad knees
Now how can I make a move without a play
I got freedom of speech but with nothing to say
'Cause all that working for something but they barely can pay
What the glimmer of Heaven giving me every day
So I wade in the water
Filled with the sharks, snakes, gators, and piranhas
Till the higher, higher ground of the mountaintop
Away from the shooters that's down for shooting to take a shot
'Cause they believe in everything they ever heard
From the bigots and racists that twisting every word
So, a hotel balcony could be the end
Or a podium speaking to family and friends

So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me
So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me

Robert Glasper,"Peace, Peace
Everything we do is a creation
In complete harmony our creation becomes art
Everything we've ever invented stems from the human imagination
Everything we've ever invented or created that moved an era is recognized as work of genius
Science and the empirical man, philosophy and the thinker
Religion and the shaman, art and the sick who can metabolize
Everything with a trace of decay is human error
Forgivable human error the curse from the radiance to the gift which becomes a shadow
Necessary evil so to speak, or we'd have figured it out by now
Striving for perfection is a result of genius
Find peace, share your genius
See I can't see my own face without a reflection
Whether it be your reaction to my expression, a mirror, or water
I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
Through this understanding, I know that all things are one
According to science, everything is a wave of energy
A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
My eyes are receptors for another type of energy which my mind then depicts as images
Same goes for smell and touch
Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
Now when given full attention to something other than time and space, time and space disappear
I'm simply doing
Yesterday, tomorrow, here, there, Poof!
It is always now
All is energy
Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
Technically I'm only a vessel channeling those thoughts
My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies which I either contemplate or share with the outside
I believe we all function with the same foundation: energy, which is everything
Everything is one ocean of energy
Everything is within you
Everything is you
The identity of me is but a series of memories
In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
Remember it is always now
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
In other words, energy can neither be created or destroyed
Energy only transforms
We are thus forever and death is but a blink
So I ask why hurt? Why kill? Why hate? Why fear? Why war?
Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself?
Can the state of the world change?
Can the state of the world change?
If energy only seems to transform then why not?
It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
A planet amongst other planets rotating around the sun in the same fashion as electrons do
Around the nucleus which form the cells, which form us
Ah, yes, all is one and, my friends, it is beautiful
Let us unify our heart, now feel your power and I thank you
Peace, forever

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
Ayyy, where we at with it?
Where you at?
What era is this?

The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
Delivered hand to hand like we slangin' the mixtapes
You tryin' to describe us you might as well get it straight
We the content creators we greater than clickbait
The passion for the culture the vultures they try to kill it
It's a war for your spirit the lyrics is here to heal us
We looking for a fountain to keep us forever young
While I get my energy from the sun, all things are one
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue
My color is my penalty mentally on the run
Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun
Releasing blockages I ain't stoppin' until they gone
Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
Until I realize I can change what's going on (Let's go!)
To every single place I go I'm right at home
I'm right at home (Let's go!)
Waiting for that day to come
Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
Get my energy from the sun

Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue",Write at Home,2017
Robert Glasper,"I was also gonna ask about your fear as an individual
You know, it's plenty of people, feel a sense of 
Security around you and kinda lean on you
You ever feel like a certain amount of pressure from that?
Do you ever get afraid?

Of course I do
I mean everybody gets afraid sometimes

What possibly could make you afraid?
What are you afraid of? (Afraid of, afraid of)

(I'm afraid, I'm afraid)
(Sometimes I'm even afraid to admit I'm afraid)
I'm afraid of the weight of my problems
Haters working overtime, 8 or 9 jobs worth
All these wanted ski masks niggas
Old basketball shorts under jean ass niggas needa know
I'm a product of a dead poet Ryan at his low

Lying on the padded floor
Addict at it's best
Eradicated from the fabricated
Afraid at the thought of releasing music 
That's indicative of where I'm at in life
Will they like? Will they hate?
The better question is if they hate it is you down to pay the price?
I'll look you right in your eyes and say you mother fuckin' right
Don't bother me with adversity, I conquered more ground than King Kong could
All I think about these days is Mom good
'Cause she diabetic
My daddy just had a cancer scare
And do he still work at the post office? The answer's yeah
I'm introverted, knowing that it's not about Oz
Bigger problems outside

There's a war going on outside
That no man is safe from
You see you can smile but that won't change the color of your skin
But I'm the sinner
Yet you kick me, punch me, say don't trust me
Shoot me down like I'm up to something
Fuck with me and say I've deceived you
But how's that legal? Am I that evil?
Why do you hate me?

I'm afraid of you going to college and not acknowledging 
I'm your father 'cause you not proud enough
But I fought hard to make sure you never see certain things I'm a product of
It's easy to confuse being a father with being a provider
But all we got is us, and I'm afraid to lose you
You the coolest kid I ever saw
She did a good job with you
Sometimes I hesitate to take credit for raising you too
'Cause all I did was discipline
I never taught you to ride a bike but we still a lot alike
And you making music now? I wonder what made you wanna give this a spin
You know what I'm about to say next, right?
I'm afraid of you drinkin'
Though I never taught you to swim, I'm afraid of you sinkin'
I know I taught you to fight, you ain't in condition to win this
You wired different
You just ain't the nigga you friends is, it's scientific
Not my opinion so you know you genetically
Predisposed to more than just eating soul food
So I'm afraid of you to try to risk it
You in a gene pool with a lot of sick fish
And I'm the sickest of them all
Alcoholics die when they stop from symptoms of withdrawal
Look out the window, tell me what you see
Police shootin' brothers the color of you and me
And they actin' like they hate us so you may just
Wanna love yourself enough to compensate it
If I can say this, say this one thing, this one thing non-related
You were never, ever, ever, better than me in basketball

Even though you're not here to be with
I hope I see these gangsters actin' like teachers
Wake up out they sleep, then they dream
And the world so Martin Luther King-less

You're in my heart, you're in my mind
You're the star that will always shine
Forever you'll be with me

And to my hero Heron, Gil Scott
In a discourse with Baldwin
On a jet plane with no fear for fallin'
But wishin' it never lands
Reminiscent of the dream time
Presently en route to the rhymes of the machine time
Magazine times
With coffee more sugar and milk than coffee
Aborted rhymes, rotten beats, and failed hooks
Roads as bumpy as braille books
Fail cools, bad French, and mad push at the door
Gourmet food at the starving soiree
A choice of one easy woman at a time
I'll take three the hard way
Trying to be as abstract as possible
And vulgar, the more shocking the more profitable
A baby fed molten gold
And sat upon a pedestal promote getting called 24 carot souls
How to describe this
Insightful remarks such as the best thing I've ever heard is silence
Some more technically impressive
In a faux Spanish romantic hues of a Marxist dialectic
Please listen to the critics, pointless is the common passerby
Might as well not even exist, not even a bit
In the event of my demise give everything I prize to the poor
And to the oppressors, I leave a war
And so on and so forth",Always Shine,2012

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore,
'Fraid she's gone forever more.       
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea
That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""

Was a crying shame

She took my watch and chain

She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car 
Jumped in my Caddy and she drove afar

On her trail

They'd chase her by the mail 
  
She got picked up 
And then was put in jail 
Stroked the judge 
Just to go her bail

She took my diamond ring 
She took the keys to my Cadillac car

To go to Kalamazoo 
Made her a fortune 
Out of fools like you 
  
Met her a rich man 
Who was married and had some kids 
Stroked that cat 
Until he flipped his lid

Told me she's sorry 
She had hurt me so

And a two dollar bill 
The way she took that 
Lord, it gave me a thrill

Just a babe
Still cavorting in her crib
Eating breakfast with a bib

With her baby teeth 
And all her baby curls
She's a tot
Just a tot

Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she
Doesn't even know that boys aren't girls
She's a snip

Just a snip
Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys
Just a chickadee who needs a mother hen

She's a cub, a papoose
You could never turn her loose
She's too infantile to take her from her pen

In spite of all her youthful zeal
She was exceedingly polite
And on the whole a sheer delight
And if it wasn't joy galore

At least not once was she a bore,
That I recall
No, not at all
Ah! She's a child

A silly child
Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven how it shows
Sticky thumbs are all the fingers she has got

She's a child
A clumsy child
She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn't have a shape

Where her figure ought to be,
It is not!
Just a child
A growing child

That's so backward for her years
If a boy her age appears
I am certain he will never call again!
She's a scamp and a brat

Doesn't know where she is at
Unequipped and undesirable to men
Of course, I must confess
That in that brand new little dress

She looked surprisingly mature
And had a definite allure
It was a shock in fact to me
The most amazing shock to see

The way it clung
On one, so young!
She's a girl,
A little girl!

Getting older, it is true
Which is what they always do
Till that unexpected hour
When they blossom like a flower!

Could it be so?

Oh no! Over night there's been a breathless change in you
Chorus Verse:
Oh Gigi! While you were trembling on the brink
Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star?

Oh Gigi! Have I been standing up too close 
Or back too far?
When did your sparkle turn to fire?
And your warmth become desire?

Oh what miracle has made you the way you are?

He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night,1963

Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love

Robert Goulet,"If ever I would leave you
It wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer
I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sunlight,
Your lips red as flame,
Your face with a lustre
That puts gold to shame!

But if I'd ever leave you,
It couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn
I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle
When fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn
And I must be there.

And could I leave you
Running merrily through the snow?
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire's glow?

If ever I would leave you,
How could it be in springtime?
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so?

And not feel you going through me
But the second that I never think of you
Oh how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you could I ever ask for more
It's just impossible
And tomorrow, should you ask me for the world
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love

Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

The sweetness and the sorrow

And I can't regret what I did for love, what I did for love

And towards always tomorrow
It's as if we always knew
But I won't forget what I did for love, what I did for love

Gone, love is never gone
And we carry on, love's what we'll remember

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird

Walking in a winter wonderland

Well, in the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married? We'll say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made

I felt for just a fleeting moment that I was suddenly free of being lonely;
Then I closed my eyes and saw the very reason why.
I saw a man with his head bowed low
His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.

Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.

Robert Guillaume,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1991

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Dry dusty road
Brother, won't you carry me along
This dry dusty road

Children shallying
Playing in the morning sun
Spike-heeled lady
Running through the burying ground

You set my soul on fire
You set me on my own
Broke-down car but the wheels still roll
Down the dry, dry dusty road

Stuck inside a tunnel
Beset with diamond lies
Wings of night enclosing
Like a long, long night without a dawning

Being bent on ruin
I tried to sell my name
All that I got for it
Was one good look at flame

Drive, drive dusty road
Dry dusty road
Oh brother, let me carry you along
This dry dusty road

In that flame I saw a face
I've never seen before
If they ask me why, I know
Just who I done this for

No one else to come to
Not much else I know
Not much else I'm good for
Lay away my lady-o

Robert Hunter,"I heard you singing
What were you singing when the people got right?
Were you singing 'Stand And Deliver'?
Or was it 'Down By The River'?

Were you singing a fine old tune like 'Gone To Glory'?
Laying it down with grace and power
Long about the midnight hour

I heard the people all singing
Like they'd never sung before
All over the country
Who could help but stand beside you?

Hello, hello, is there anybody here?
My knuckles are sore from rapping all day
I said, ""Give me one more chance
I'd do it for you if I had your way, if I had your way""

What do I know? What do I see?
Don't know nothing but the name of the game
It's high-card draw with everything wild
You bet your life like anyone's child
What else would you want to do?

I heard the people all singing
Like they never sung before
Singing in key and strumming
Everything they heard from you
Hello, hello, hello, hello, goodbye

Looking back across the years
Other matters disappear
In the murmur I can hear
Familiar voices loud and clear
Hello, hello, hello, hello, goodbye

I heard you singing
Like one last song in the middle of the night
Were you singing 'In Tongues Of Fire'?
Or was it 'Knots Of Anger'?

Were you singing a fine old tune like
'Love Me, Love Me, Love Me Only'?
Were you caught between the curtains
Thinking this was too uncertain?

Remember the people were singing
Like they never sung before
All over the country
Did you love the way they loved you?

Ain't no knocker on the last big door
Just push on the panel and walk on in
Hello, hello, is there anybody here
But a two-bit high and a busted mirror?
Hello, hello, is anybody here?
My tongue is so sore from rapping all day

Sunshine in the dead on night
I know that can't be right
Could it be? I don't know
But it never done that thing before

So close to my own back door
It got me wondering what to do
And the only thing was to come and tell you
Because I heard you singing, I heard you
",I Heard You Singing,1974
Robert Hunter,"The silver fox has shed its tail now
Left it by the frozen water
The leaves were drifting down
Now they are gone, gone, gone

I draw milady's carriage
Ever since her horse retired
I don't think I can pull much longer
I've never been this tired before

Up jump the black chain dancers
Empty hands that grasp for answers
Fasten on to one another, fly
Fly away

Ariel is sweetly singing
Wait you, just one more season
You're not blind, you only hide your
Eyes within your hands, within your hands

Ariel, Ariel
Ariel, Ariel

There is no night like this night
Where candles burn through daylight
Minds restrained by golden tethers fade
Fade away

The sun objects with smiling sadness
Roman highways laced in diamonds
Sink like grave Atlantis into
Dreams of other days they fade away

Monuments to crippled madness
Puppets dangle in the treetops
The cold magician carves his voice in stone
Then flies away, then flies away

Ariel sings overhead
Deaf men mouth the words she's said
But they don't hear the songs she's singing now
Oh no, not now

Ariel, Ariel
Ariel, Ariel

As wild and unholy place
As any place I've ever been
You can knock and knock and knock
No one comes to let you in, no one comes

As solid and as fine a floor
As any floor I've walked upon
Broke beneath my footsteps
I've got no place left to stand, not any more

Loves to love and not to chain
Some are lost but some remain
Nothing can replace the light
That once has died turned to night, no one can

If I had the sense to know
Which things count and which are show
I'd hold my fate within my hands
Instead of all these chains and bands
Yes, I would

Robert Hunter,"Up near the border where the cruel white water
Drowns vagabond who sleeps too low
Me and my companion, famous Jack O'Lanterns
Tracked the misty mountain through the snow

Ran across the hidden chord, couldn't learn the changes
Blue Pacific called, I had to go
There was holly on the ivy in the apparition mountains
The warmest bed I found was ten below

Courted lady Greensleeves, she threw me out the window
I landed like a feather in the trees
Took off across New Mexico and landed in the Bayou
But the catfish was too lean, I had to blow

Don't lie for gold, no, no, no
Don't lie for love, turns out cold
If life depends, just get out whole
Don't lie for less, no, no, no, no

Marie, Marie Helena
You're my amour, you're my own heart
Oh, Marie, Marie Helena
Oh Marie, Marie Helena

Left the life of ease and caught the black iron steamer
Across the barren waste to your arcade
I sang, 'Take me to your leader in my strangest country tenor'
The bed I meant to lay was halfway made

Leftover pieces aren't exactly what I needed
They didn't have much meaning on their own
There was some talk of deviation from what was never mentioned
So I set out to find the wrong way home

Home inside the hour, tuning my guitar
Well, I get that sudden urge I know too well
I finished my rendition of don't pity my condition
Then I looked around to find what I could sell

Can't sell your soul, leave that alone
Can't change your role, Big Daddy Low
Don't break your back less than love
Don't trade your love stars above

And Marie, Marie Helena
My firelight, you steal my heart
Oh Marie, Marie Helena
Oh Marie, Marie Helena

Caught up with Jack O'Lanterns in a town called Make It Hurt
Preaching three card Monte in the Live And Let It Church
The choir was down and dirty, drawin' bad and bettin' worse
Left at ten to six in a padded hearse

I might find companions in the after-hour taverns
Tell a tale or two I've never heard but the strangest song I know
Is 'What the thunder says to lightning'
And I never could recall a single word
Except

Up, near the border where the cruel white water
Drowns the vagabond who sleeps too low
Me and my companion, famous Jack O'Lanterns
Tracked the misty mountains through the snow

Don't lie for gold, no, no, no

You must call it one thing or another
This one parted water, that one walked upon
Perhaps I'll call this child a Rose of Sharon

What's to be the ground that child walks upon?
Will it be solid rock or shifting sand?
Think I'll set him down on concrete highways
We'll bring him up to walk the land

Think I'll call him just another stranger
Believe I'll call him knocking at your door
Asking you for shelter from the lightning
Space to rest upon your kitchen floor

Will he be a man of constant sorrow?
Born to beg a coat against the storm?
Will he want a house with marble pillars?
And fire of a night to keep him warm?

And if a stranger comes for troubled shelter
With hounds and torchlight on his midnight trail
Will he find a moment free of madness there?
And ears that still can hear to tell his tale?

Then you could call that child the Rock of Ages
You could call him raft upon the flood
He has been the face of many races
He has been the palace in the blood

If that child should end up in a prison
As sometimes chance will deal to honest men
One room is like another to a stranger
Any man of worth will be his friend

Now what you gonna call that pretty baby?
You must call it one thing or another
Think I'll call him flame out on the water
Think I'll call him shore between the sea

Drop him on the rocks and he will shatter
Cut him with a blade and he will bleed
Plant him in the ground, he will rise up again
Sometimes as a flower, sometimes a reed

What you gonna call that pretty baby?
You must call him one thing or another
This one parted water, that one walked upon
Perhaps I'll call this child a Rose of Sharon

Robert Hunter,"In a torrid little cabin 'neath Aurora Boreeay
Wild Bill waxed his whiskers, dabbed perfume behind each ear
From a flask of Spanish lotion that he'd had for many years
Kept it for occasions when he went to see his dear
When he went down to see that little girl

Slipped off a ring of silver, slipped on a ring of gold
With a twenty-carat diamond that was carved into a rose
An ivory-stemmed revolver was reflected in his boots
That glittered like the cuff studs setting off his lovin' suit
When he went down to see that little girl

Threw a handful of ash on the fire
Made his way out through the snow
To the finest cuisine south of Canada
The finest north of Mexico

The lady who was his intension
With the look fit to fetch or to kill
Had tattooed 'neath the lace on her bosom
'Wild Bill Loves Diamond Lil'

She was not just the girl of his dreams
He was not only fond of her charms
She could knock down a man at ninety paces
While he rolled her around in his arms

Shot a hole through the hand of Michael Miller
As he crept up behind Wild Bill
She said, ""Now share a little of the life I've saved you
Where you know you can relax and not get killed""

Jacob nailed the ladder to the floor
Now we can't move the ladder 'round no more
Sunday is the day I go to church and pray the Lord
Take me when I die to golden shores

Monday is the day I go to work and pay our bills
Saturday I go and spend what's left at Diamond Lil's
Yeah, that's the day I go to Diamond Lil's

Robert Hunter,"Anxious hope and thoughts of love
Will never let me down or let me go
Inside, my heart's a cage of ice
Where love and loss still toss the lonely dice

I burned the whole night long
My thoughts were never far from you
Love that locks and binds must die
But when it dies a part of you dies too

Born, born, born upon the world
The restless heart keeps flying
Trying to become the heart of home
Love, love, love, it picks you up
And spins you round
Sets you right back down, where you belong

My head don't fit my hat sometimes
It gets so full of clouds
Every time I pass your door
I hear you cry out loud

Sometimes I look the same to you
As you have looked to me
My eyes get filled so full of stars
I don't know when I leave

Born, born, born upon the world
The restless heart keeps flying
Trying to become the heart of home
Love, love, love, it picks you up
And spins you round
Sets you right back down, where you belong

Love is like the April rain
That makes the harvest grow
And when it grows it's like the summer gold
Love is like the colored leaves
That drift down from the trees
One by one 'til every tale is told

If I go a-dancing out across the yellow moon
I'll be home by morning if it doesn't come too soon
If you seek protection go and find a safer man
And if he can't give you what you need
Then come on by again

Priestess of the sun and moon
And goddess of the wind
You know too much to ever lose
And not enough to win

Though you built your house upon the rock
And not upon the sand
You're still looking out your window
For another traveling man

Born, born, born upon the world
The restless heart keeps flying
Trying to become the heart of home
Love, love, love, it picks you up
And spins you round
Sets you right back down, where you belong

Love, love, love that picks you up
And spins you round
Sets you right back down where you belong

Robert Hunter,"Does God look down on the boys in the barroom?
Mainly forsaken but surely not judged
Jacks, Kings and Aces, their faces in wine
Do Lord deliver our kind?

From singin' for whiskey, three strings on a fiddle
Four on the guitar and a song that I love
Many's the night we spent pickin' and singin'
In hopes it be pleasing both here and above

Jack string fiddle to my saw tooth bow
Who loves loneliness, loves it alone
I love the dim lights like some love the dew
The only thing I wonder sometimes

Is does God look down on the boys in the barroom?
Mainly forsaken but surely not judged
Jacks, Kings and Aces, their faces in wine
Do Lord deliver our kind?

Robert Hunter,"Tiger Rose got new clothes
The ladies love her so
They laugh at her connections
But they don't say no

Get down high, get down low
Get your heels in tow
We don't care what
Mama don't allow here anymore

Tiger tea, tiger gee, you my Tiger Rose
Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song
On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

There's the day breaking
Windows shaking at my cabin door
Love me like you did last night
Just one time more

I know it don't make sense
But then it don't intend
You keep coming by
We'll make it up again

Get up, Johnny, sing along
Get along now, get along
I could be right, I could be wrong
Pretty soon be long gone

Lay me down in worried sleep
Listen while the river weep
Thought I heard it sing a song

Come on, big eyed handsome moll
And be my party doll
We'll live in jive o county
'Neath the waterfall

Just tell 'em, ""Anything""
Cut glass spur or a silver chime
Can make 'em ring

It's a lesson to me the deltas and the east and the freeze
The ABC's we all think of and try to win a little love

The shoe is on the hand that fits, there's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit 'cause it's alright

We didn't care
She said that someday soon
The sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine,
My valentine

As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine,
My valentine

And I will love her, for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain
That I can fly

And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon
The sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there

Before it's too late, my love

Be good to me please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm

Just disappear

And when you're near, close to me dear
We touch too much

The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That darling, it's getting me down
So on your mark get set

Sittin' here in love rehab, I'm so crazy about you, dear
Doctor of my soul, I will never check out of here
Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace
You took me in and gave me joy and, girl, now I'm free
You are my circle, when I needed to talk you had my back
You my homie we go back, thank you for your love rehab

Doin' bad, ain't nobody in my life
I'ma kill a nigga or somebody gon' murder me soon
I'm a hope fiend, I need a woman in my life
Could you take me to the emergency room?

I need somebody that can nurse me back to health
'Cause I'm out here lovesick, shakin' like Pookie
You took me up outta the hoopty
Put me in the Lex 300 and got me blowin' on dookie

Now why do I respect ya, 'cause she down for a nigga
Before I was rollin' city to city
She got me screamin' out ""Yes Sir"", like I'm Pretty Ricky
Lookin' freaky, freaky while I'm smokin' on the sticky-icky

When I'm down and out, you be rubbin' my back
Because I miss you, you know I got issues
When I'm ridin' dirty and I got the thumper
And the law pull me over you will hold my pistol

Sick of how the women harm on me, you charmin' me

You like a veteran when I need some medicine
You better than Exederin, fellas in trouble that wanna get you

So many roads that I have to choose, yeah

There were times that I got weak, fell short
I couldn't go on and she came through

So many friends, so many liars, so many haters
Sometimes I just don't know who to trust
But yet and still I turn the wheel of life and try my luck
There was a time when I was broke, didn't have a job
And this woman, she showed me love

Oh, since we first met, I've been risin' like an escalator
Now five years later, we have come up like an elevator
You made me better, babe, when I thought I was goin' crazy
I was just about to lose my mind, then you put me in your love rehab

Forget what they all say
She the only one that helped me
Hit her with a little bit of 12 Play

When the Twista wasn't proper sippin' Vodka
I could remember tellin' the love Doctor ""I need some help""
Through the fire like I'm shocker, love it every time I rock her
Cock a pistol when I think I bleed to death

My surgeon and my methodome
The only one I talk to when I'm left alone
You the one that helped me fight through my challenges
Tell me what's my psychoanalysis

Robert Knight,"All my friends had to ask me something they didn't understand
How I get all the women in the palm of my hand
I told them treat her like a lady; do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
I know you've heard that the woman soon takes advantage of you
Let me tell you my friend there just ain't no substitute, you ought to
Treat her like a lady do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
Oh, you've got to love her, tease her, but most of all you've got to please her
You've got to hold her and want her and make her feel you'll always need her
You know a woman is sentimental and so easy to upset
So make her feel that she's for real and she'll give you happiness
Woh, oh, oh, strange as it seems, you know you can't treat a woman mean
 
So my friend there you have it, the easy simple way
If you fail to do this, don't blame her if she looks my way
'Cause I'm gonna treat her like a lady;  so affectionately
I'm gonna treat her like a lady, she'll give in to me
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
Oh, you've gotta treat her like a lady, do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you

Robert Kyle,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Battle only half fought
Crawling 'cause I can't talk

Flashing like a neon
Noisy as an A-bomb
Looking to the beyond
Staring into the half-life of eternity

Lord, my friends all layin' around

But now an I spent all my money
All of my friends cannot be found

Now your friend don't know you
Boys, when you down an out
Your friend don't know you
Boys, when you down an out
If you ask them for a favor
They don't know what it's all about

Now they'll stop here to tell you
Boys, what your friend will do
Yes, they just stop here to tell you
Boys, what your friend will do
They'll help you spend all yo' money
And sing farewell to you.

Robert Makinson,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Robert Makinson,"Sometimes in the morning, when shadows are deep, 
I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see, 
I study the small things, you do constantly, 
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
In only a moment, we both will be old, 
We won`t even notice the world turning cold. 
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above, 
My cup runneth over with love . . .

Robert Makinson,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2003

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Robert McAtee,"I see an ant crawlin’ on the table. He’s all alone walkin’ in a puddle of wine.
And bloody mary’s in the kitchen. I always knew it was just a matter of time.
We flew to Vegas and got married. The road was golden. The sky was red.
The fireworks blasted in that desert sky. I saw an angel in those pretty blue eyes.
I thought that things would be so perfect. A beautiful girl I thought I’d never have.
I used to think she was so cute when she started to fight.
Mary disappeared into that Hollywood night.
She’d come back home when she wanted to.
A boy in love will put up with whatever a girl will do.
I started to lose my mind when she played with my heart.
I had to finish what she wouldn’t let me start.

One man band. Sand on her feet. Sweet treat. Hurry up and wait. 
Sit around like bait and wait to bite the hook ‘cause you’ve got the look and I’m a shark so I should know. 
Eyes like diamonds. Cash in my front pocket but yeah I’m happy to see you too. 
Too much to do in too little time and it’s a crime that this has to end someday. 
Send me a letter ‘cause rejection in person is way too personal and God forbid a nice transaction of physical attraction being left in a dirty alley. 
The black cat walks by like a lady of the night. 
La La La Land. One woman band. Sand on her feet. Sweet treat. Bacon cheeseburger, greasy fries. 
Skies so blue. Too much to do in too little time. 
Tie a knot inside my body and there’s no stopping until the end. 
And where are my friends when I need ‘em? We all have a plan. 
We all ran from something and we sweat. Eyes back and forth. 
Crazy she is and hungry and hot. Hot water rainin’ down. 
Her body curvy in all the right spots. Lasers comin’ out of her eyes. 
Run to the plane and join the party. Give me your money and give me your time. 
Free cheese and wine. We’re all in a bind. Cat scratchin’ and the dog is awake. 
Runnin’ from tongues on the ground. The sounds of ummm and ahhh. 
La La La Land. One man band. Sand on her feet. Sweet treat indeed. 
Go for a swim. Pink bikini. Cotton candy. Wow, wow, wow. 
Plastic and metal, I’m such a devil and I laugh - ha. Hit me in the chest ‘cause I can take it. 
I love my Jane. Keep the change ‘cause I don’t give a buck unless I like you, damn. 
Bam! Would you look at that? Cat scratchin’ and the dog is awake. 
And bake in the sun this place is so fun. Run downtown. Leg in the sky. 
My oh my. She makes me cry. Like a hungry lion and I’m not gonna let go of your hair in my hand. 
La La La Land. One man band. Sand on her feet. Sweet treat. Fascination, imagination. 
Calculating fantasy. Lasers come out of her eyes. Tease, tease, tease. 
Please, please, please be real. Make a deal. 
I’m the million dollar man. Turn off the fan ‘cause I like to see you sweat. 
The sound of ummm and ahhh. Ahhh.",La  La La Land,2014
Robert McAtee,"I’m in a bad mood. I’ve had a bad day. 
I’ve had a bad year. I wanna float away. 
Feel like I’m chokin’. Feel like I’m dyin’. 
Need you to grab me. Stop me from shakin’.
 Look into my eyes. Tell me who I am. 
Tell me the end of the story. 
I’m back at zero again.
You’re livin’ in a castle. I bet your feet are tired. 
That’s a long way to walk for a log and a fire. 
Take off your glasses. Take off your clothes. 
I need you to grab me. I’ll do what I’m told. 
I need you to grab me. I need you to control me. 
I need you to save me. I need you.",Need You to Grab Me,2014
Robert McAtee,"I’m looking down in a hole. I rest my head on the ground. 
I feel so disconnected from myself. The skunk walks by in front of that blue sky. 
The air is cold and the sun is hot. Hot or cold it doesn’t matter where I am. 
It doesn’t change anything. The Grand Canyon, a dusty street to the flying trapeze. 
“Oh please,” she said to half the things that I said. This ground makes a nice big bed. 
There’s something nice about hunger. I need a long hot shower. 
I need a smooth shave. I want her to skydive onto me. That would be a sight to see. 
I need to simplify. French toast and ice cream make me think of her. 
I wanna see her run around in circles in a hotel room that doesn’t exist. 
I wanna tear open the present under the tree of the past. I never had to wear a cast. 
Knock on wood. She was so good like a book that couldn’t put me down. 
A light in my eye I follow back and forth. I don’t know why some things annoy me so much. 
I need to simplify. The greatest sense is touch. Sometimes ignorance can be cute. 
Sometimes intelligence is overrated. I need to simplify. I need to simplify. 
The torture is a matter of opinion. Abstaining can be pleasing to someone, two, three, four frogs hop by. 
The stream is ice cold. I don’t like to do what I’m told unless it’s coming from her. 
The first sip of beer is always nice. I gonna pick her up and take her far away. 
I like how she plays with me. I like how she tastes. Snakes crawl around the road. 
Sunglasses can make someone look cool. I’m gonna put her on the mule and take her down to the bottom. 
The Grand Canyon, a dusty street to the flying trapeze. 
I wanna tear open the present under the tree of the past. I always think that this could be the last time. 
A deer runs by. I got an itch all over my body that she needs to scratch. 
The things and people get so dirty when they’re ignored. 
Sometimes I like to pull on the cord ‘cause it gets me off when I’m on. 
I don’t know what I’m doing here I’m not killing time I’m just living it and loving it, even the pain. 
‘Cause there’s something to be gained every time. Hot water me and her. Let’s do nothing. 
Doesn’t that sound like fun? If this keeps going on I can get her off this complex way to live. 
I want her to tear open the present under the tree of the past and simplify.",Simplify,2014
Robert McAtee,"I’m cold and alone on your street. I walk to my car, it’s not very far. 
The lights are out and I’m giving in to the face of reality and to why or when. 
How can I walk away? How can I drive away? 
How far can I go without turning around? 
4:30 in the morning on the Hollywood Freeway. The cops are out tonight. 
The lights blur across the road. It’s so cold in California on these winter nights. 
And it doesn’t seem right drivin’ away from what I want . . . what I need but who can change somebody else?  
Nobody can do that. I look in the rearview mirror and it gets smaller ‘til it’s gone. 
But she’s comin’ with me at least in memories. And she’s a mystery that I thought I knew. 
All the clues but things have a way of changing in the blink of an eye. Why? 
That’s the question of the day. I feel like I should be cryin’ and tomorrow I’m flyin’ away. 
For three weeks I’ll be gone. I guess that’ll help me move on and make things right. 
Somehow. Some way. Twenty one days. The radio’s broken and I sing her a song. 
Tonight this road seems so long. I feel like I should cry. 
The lights from the valley light up the smog in the night. 
She’s sleepin’ right now back in Hollywood. 
I feel like I should turn around ‘cause I’ve never found anyone like her in the world. 
What a wonderful girl she is. But I don’t think the world is on our side. 
Don’t know how or why. I feel like I should be smokin’, I don’t know why I feel this way. 
I feel like I should be drinking the night away into the morning. 
But I really feel like I should turn around. 
Speed through the night ‘cause this just doesn’t feel right drivin’ away. Into a new day. 
The heater is getting warm and my eyes are starting to fall. 
My cell phone says 4:32, I still don’t know what I’m going to do. 
But I still keep my foot on the gas and in my mind I’m still lying on top of her. 
Traffic is stopped as they tow some cars away. Accidents sometimes are part of the day. 
Sometimes you just don’t have the right words to say. 
And you leave the words, the wrong words up in the air and you wish you could take them and tear them like a little piece of paper and say them all again. 
I don’t know where or when we’ll see each other again. 
I yawn and I hold onto the wheel sometimes time moves in slow motion when things aren’t going great. 
Sometimes it’s hard to wait for the next time that I’ll see her face. 
I pull up to my place and walk up the stairs. Sometimes I feel like no one really cares. 
I drop my keys and take off my clothes and get under the blanket. But now I can’t sleep. 
I feel like this is a dream. I wish I could feel her warm, naked body wrapped around me.",Smog in the Night,2014
Robert McAtee,"My head really hurts and my ears are ringing. And I pour another drink. 
Splash water on my face. I sink to the bottom and I drink to the top. 
I paint a blue sky on a dirty, empty canvas but it always fade’s to a dark grey. 
It’s the story of these days in a blink it’s the night. 
This pain is hard to fight off I wish I could write off my character from this horrible show. 
I’m just a piece of grass that gets mowed over again. 
There is no end to the pain that this world has created. 
And it multiplies and it’s makin’ my eyes look old. 
So what’s everybody pissed off at now? 
When hope is gone I sing a song Hallelujah. 
When love is gone I sing a song Hallelujah yeah. 
I’m repeating myself over and over again. 
From the beginning of the end to the end of the beginning. 
And how am I gonna write all these checks my money’s flyin’ away. 
And what am I gonna say next and how am I gonna hold on to the time. 
And how is everything gonna be alright. 
All the people have left my side and I’m all alone once again. 
I take a chance every day that’s how I need to live. 
There’s yellin’ comin’ over the phone it hits me in the chest and takes away my spirit. 
There is no end to the pain that this world has created. 
And it multiplies and it’s makin’ my eyes look so old. 
So what’s everybody pissed off at now?

When love is gone I sing a song, Hallelujah yeah.",So What's Everybody Pissed Off at Now,2014
Robert McAtee,"If I could paint a perfect world … would you come there with me?
If I could take your tears away … would you let me?
If I could hear your words and understand … could I ever have a chance with you?
If I could make you smile, make your dreams come true … could I touch you? Could I love you?

Someone to share
Lonely hours and moments of despair
To be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved

Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day
To be love, to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved

Some wish for fortune and fame

Robert McCarther,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Robert McCarther,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Robert McPherson,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001
Robert Meadmore,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being In Love,1988
Robert Meadmore,"Can't we two go walkin' together out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill, 
The heather on the hill.
