Czech National Symphony Orchestra,"Yo estaba bien por un tiempo
Volviendo a sonreír 
Luego anoche te vi 
Tu mano me tocó 
Y el saludo de tu voz

Te hablé muy bien y tu 
Sin saber que he estado 
Llorando por tu amor 
Llorando por tu amor

Luego de tu adiós 
Sentí todo mi dolor

Solo y llorando 
Llorando, llorando, llorando 
No es fácil de entender 
Que al verte otra vez 
Yo este llorando

Yo que pensé que te olvidé 
Pero es verdad, es la verdad 
Que te quiero aún más 
Mucho más que ayer 
Dime tú qué puedo hacer

No me quieres ya 
Y siempre estaré 
Llorando 
Por tu amor 
Llorando 
Por tu amor 
Tu amor se llevó 
Todo mi corazón

y quedó llorando 
llorando
llorando

llorando
llorando

Y te rompa el corazón
Nunca olvides que aquí 
Te espera mi amor
Cuando no puedas sonreír 
Y mueras de dolor

Ven a mi 
Ven a mi 

En mi amor puedes confiar 
Nunca dudes en volver 
Siempre te voy a esperar 
Siempre te voy a querer

Sogno all'orizzonte
E mancan le parole
Sì, lo so che non c'è luce
In una stanza quando manca il sole
Se non ci sei tu con me, con me
Su le finestre
Mostra a tutti il mio cuore
Che hai accesso
Chiudi dentro me
La luce che
Hai incontrato per strada

Time to say goodbye
Paesi che non ho mai
Veduto e vissuto con te
Adesso sì li vivrò
Con te partirò

Senza di te il sole non brilla più
Mai mi aspettavo di amare una donna così
Mai mi aspettavo di avere paura così

Lo sai, quanta melanconia
Lo sai, quanta melanconia
Per te

Per mille notti sai e mille giorni ormai
Non faccio altro che pensare fisso a te
E mille notti tu non mi rispondi più
E mille giorni ormai, chissà se tornerai

Prenditi il tuo tempo
Di te e di me
Ancora un po'

Pensa a noi
Perché quando poi tu leggerai
Io non ci sarò

Sarai lì, immobile
Come polvere
Ricorderai noi due
Piangerai

Ormai io, io non sarò che
Un triste addio

Non somigli a chi
A chi sa difendermi da me
Non spieghi perché
Ma mi lasci indietro
Ti lascerò
Ma soltanto per un po'
Tra i dubbi che
Sanno esser guai

Provi ad ingannarmi
Quando parli
Di un amore straordinario
Anche un'unica illusione
Può bastarmi
Forse a crederci si avvera
Lo sai
Che dove brucia è vivo
Ma poi
Ti perdi, cerchi il cielo
E non c'è ghiaccio mai
Neve casomai

Non so più chi sei
Né chi son quei due
Fingono col mondo di esser noi
Chi fa male a chi
Neanche me lo chiedo
Mi aggrapperò
A quei sogni che non ho
Saputo mai
Rendere miei
Ai dubbi che
Sanno esser guai

Czech National Symphony Orchestra,"Cos'ho?
Ho dei tagli sul viso
Si, ma io cos'ho?
Che se sanguino rido
E mi sciolgo un po'
Tanto non sento niente
Io cos'ho?
Sembra aver già deciso
Ma proprio non so
Mescolarmi al sorriso
Di chi più non ho
Tanto non sento niente

Parlo con te
Sempre
Anche se tu sei
Assente
E quelli non dicono
Niente
Solo un silenzio
Assordante
Muoio con te
Sempre
Vivo di te
Tra la gente
Quelli che parlano, parlano, parlano ancora

E non resta più niente
Proprio niente
Del cielo che abbiamo perso
Rubandoci i pezzi più neri
Più neri del nero
E ora più niente
C'è una stella cadente
Ma era l'ultima già
E schiantandosi precipita
Sulla mia pelle
Lasciando un pozzo infinito
Dove tutto è finito
Per sempre finito
Nel fondo più fondo
Della libertà

Che farò?
Se questi tagli sul viso
Ancora io ce li ho
E di rosso vestita
Negli occhi sarò
E ancora tu niente
Io non ho, non ho, non ho
L'obbedienza
Di chi è sparito
Già da un po'
Se dipingi un paradiso
Io lo distruggerò
Così tanto per niente

Parto da te
Sempre
Per tornare ad essere
Niente
Finisco a te
Sempre
Analizzando la gente
E non ha più senso quel
Niente
Quel che rimane ancora niente
Quelli che parlano, parlano, parlano ancora

E non resta più niente
Proprio niente
Del senso che abbiamo perso
Nei gesti di un altro
Che non fa più testo
E intanto ci uccide
E non lascia resto

E non resta più niente
Nient'altro che niente
E il tetto l'abbiamo perso
E ormai piove a dirotto
Su mobili e teste
Allagando speranze
Che affogano lente

Nuotando nel niente
Nuotando nel niente
Io nuoto nel niente
Tu nuoti nel niente

Czech National Symphony Orchestra,"Un incontro occasionale
Un po' banale, superficiale

Grande affinità

Ma non è qui che fuori piove

Can read it in your sad
Wet eyes the strangest thing is that i don't mind
I see you flowing through my fingers while
I don't try to stop
Your fearless ride
I'm too young to blame
Too woman to cry
Over a dream that i know won't survive

And that now we try to buy now that it's too late
And nothing seems real

Chances
For brand new wishes

I'm begging you please
Don't deny how good it is we've got a new road
A new way to be
You're too man to fake
Too wise to lie
When we both know
That staying here makes us die

Czech National Symphony Orchestra,"Tre sono le cose che devo ricordarmi di fare
Quando come una luce entrerai
Le prime due nasconderò dentro ad una pagina
E la terza scriverò sui vetri sporchissimi di un auto blu
Blu come i tuoi occhi a cui raramente sfuggirò
E anche se fosse tu non chiuderli mai

Deciditi a capire che non mi servono fiori
Spiegami senza nemmeno parlare che senso hai
Costringiamo la notte a non fare rumore
Abbandoniamoci al giorno del tutto nuovi

Tre sono le cose che devo ricordarmi di dire
Quando davvero sicura sarò
E lo saranno le mie mani a cui raramente sfuggirai

Czech Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra,"If I leave in silence
Would you notice me
Would you hate my absence
Would you drown in your misery

If I leave with a reason
Would you argue to your grave 
Would you hold on to a promise
Like a master keeps a slave

I throw the question 
To see if you feel the same
Because there is nothing 
I wouldn't sacrifice
For you

I am too tired to cry
Don't you leave me to die
I have become at peace
As you set me free

On my last confession
The final breath I take
Will you look me in the eyes
And say my name

the only consolation
Is you remember me that way
With the butterflies
And the happy times we made

I throw the question to see if you feel the same
Because there is nothing 
To replace you",Free,2004

Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me

Your eyes mustn't glow like mine

People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

And I can see you crystal clear. 
I know that you will, meet me here. 

I walk the narrow path. 
Perplexed and befuddled. 
I'm persecuted, plagued and I'm troubled.

My future's a mystery. 
There's only one certain thing 
That's for sure. 

It's my God who is so real. 
He makes my life easier to deal. 
With the aid of his goodness. 
I experience true bliss. 
Do you understand your life is in his hands? 

Confusion is my hat; 
Centrifuge of hurt is where I'm at.

D,"You know it wasn't so long ago 
When things weren't as we know 
Back when I was younger and had a hunger 
For all the things I didn't know 

And I remember the day when 
I went out to play 
And I bird flew down to my hand 
Didn't want to leave and 
When I asked to keep 
I remember my dad said 

Yeah son let it go away 
Hope that it comes back 
Here to you some day 
Just let it go away 
And if it comes back 
you know it's here to stay 

Since then I've gone through changes 
Since then I've gone through life 
Since then I found me a beautiful woman 
I thought could be my wife 
She said she really loves me 
But she said she couldn't stay 
She said I've got to go my love 
To find things my own way 

So I let her go away 
Hope that she comes back 
Here to me some day 
I let her go away 
And if she comes back 
I know she's here to stay 

There's not always reasons for the things in life 
But it's comforting to know within your mind 
If you love something enough 
And you've done all that you can 
If there's one thing I have known and learned first hand 
Sometimes you have to just let it go away 

Hope that it comes back 
Here to you some day 
Just let it go away 
And if it comes back 
You know it's here to stay 

Let it go away 
And if it comes back 
You know it's here to stay

I on it and I know it, I ain't afraid to show it
Gotta a pocket full of bread, bitch, I came here to blow it

So bitch, get your mind right, pull out I'm talking some
Swagged up I be killing, killing
My car ain't got no ceiling
I know these boys don't talk down
But for haters I've got no feeling
The paper in my pocket, my bitch ain't got no panties
A tall Puerto Rican that I met that in Miami
I went to her apartment so she act like she could spare me
'Till I seen her with her friends all boppin at the grammies
So I f-ck her at the Grammies, I keep condom handy
My Chevy sittin' slanted told eddie paint it candy
I'm blowing on the Cali my hand full of skittles
Treating broads like stitches I could split them down the middle

She graduated from Florida state, but I hear
Pulling up in a fo' do', with fo' ho's, and fo' fo's
All I smoke is good dro, mid grade a no-no
She told me come and get that pussy right know
I had to tell her ""momma, please pipe down! ""
I'll be on my to put that pipe down
Well I gotta go and hit a nigga right now!

I on it, I'm zoning, I grind hard, I'm flowing
So I'm not only the boss, but homie I'm also the one that own it
I own it, in A-T-L with that bonus, I gotta a super broad that will blow me
And I'm not about to wait for not a dollar if you owe me
The double cup is lonely, so pour some of that juice
I'm leanin' tough, that ain't enough, I need at least a deuce
These tricks about to get loose, get loose
A bad bitch to the roots, I'm papered up she tatted down, my waistline to her boots
I'm on one or two, but I'm a need me a few
I'm gone off in bananas like gorillas in the zoo
Don't worry if I run out, I keep something in my shoe
And the broad riding with me, ready to blow some

We are the warriors at the edge of time
We lurk inside your brain, hide inside your minds

For a child on the run, I am free

Your sword is red-stained I can see

Acres of land, four and twenty

Get off me, started talkin fast and lost me
Of course we them niggaz, ""What What"" like N.O.R.E.
I blind hoes, when I step in the club
My chain so bright, I got chicks checkin for bugs
D-Flow lyrically I'm swift with the tongue fo' sho'
Killer you feelin me I'm sick with the gun and yo
It's nuttin new son, bring your crew son
I knew none of these rappers, had it, my flow like magic
Hoes attracted to the kid with the small bling
South Boogie, niggaz got it plus more bling
On the spot a hot 16 that ain't shit
Rock blue and grey all day, and I ain't Crip
My bank sick, dough stack to the sky
And I'ma stay high with a pound in the back of the 5

We get it poppin, we get it crackin, we get it dusty
We get it crunk son, we get it all that, trust me
Droppin, 'til it's platinum, 'til it's dusty
Get it crunk son, we get it all that, trust me

What's my profile?
Demeanor of a chief over this here beat, check the pow-wow
Sirens, reminiscent to violence
Wildlife, with about a hundred niggaz behind us
Get it feelin like it's World War 3 up in this bitch
before the bomb hits nigga
We get it dirty, done deal, guns I reveal
Yo' gun stay concealed, let's leave it at that
Machine gun rap spray off
Layin niggaz six feet, eyes wide from the chaos
Many minds wanna know why they call me Mush
But if I tell ya then I got ta kill ya
See I leave no stones underturned, that's how a lot of niggaz get burned
Man I'm ""Deep Cover"" like Fishburne
It's my turn, pay-offs is froo froo
Layoffs'll make a nigga turn postal and shoot you

We get it poppin, we get it crackin, we get it dusty

See 'em ridin' just like sally

And I'm searching for a ruby
In the gutter with a promise
And I'm on my way

Send us all to high school
Make us pray to statues
So we hang on corners lookin' bored

All the rubbish that you cherish
With your hedonistic pleasures
And your latest status symbols
Just can't stay

Seen the majors chase the minors
With the military blinders
Dangle carrots in the faces

And all the capitol sickness

Just meetings and functions
And social corruptions

For a Cinderella savior

Call us fags and call us phonies
But I make the ginamone 
And you hate it cause I shake 
It

Barking in the darkness
A broken hero at the bar

Cause I'm the worlds best secret

What you standin' there for?
Cause I'm the one that do that music you feel
But you still review this

Right now before my goons have to tear it town
We don't wait in line and we don't stand around
We at Club Zen and drinkin', actin' brand new
Actin' like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot
They know I'm Cash Image and I'm with Tech N9ne
And before the club close, The owner gon' respect mine
Spend a lot of money and that's the bottom line
Ten cars on chrome, Plus the neck shine
Baggy jeans on and J's with a lot of bucks
And you ain't gotta know me
You could tell my dollars' up
Poppin' collars in the club, turnin' bottles up
And all the models in the club wanna follow us
It's Mr. Chevy Man, You hear my song playin'
And every time we in the club
We be spending grand's
First deny Tech then deny me
And I was number one on 103 for forty weeks

You say you hear me knockin'
So why you don't wanna let me in?
But I ain't buggin', So tell the cops to come and get me then
Complain about my shoes, ain't really talkin' 'bout shit
Dude, I spent like three hundred and fifty on this outfit
NV ain't gon' let me in, zen actin' funny with me
What it's gon' cost me, homie?
I brought a little money with me
I don't wear tight shirts, my pants kinda baggy
KC hat tilted, so now they wanna red flag me
I'm by the bar every time, point blank, Period
The door man hatin', takin' his job too serious
Me, Cash Image, Tech and Kaliko about big business
So what I'm talkin to a bouncer for?
The woman see me, Scream my name like announcers, bro
They actin' brand new this week
So I'm about to go to the block and bubble and get plenty cake
I just wanted woman and I don't like this club anyway
So fuck y'all!

I get money from music, Kinda like to spend-spend
When I hit the town, I know they gonna let me ends in
But these other clubs be trippin' like I begin sin
You hear me knockin'? (Oh yeah)
Well let me in then
Cause NV ain't so friendly
They got a gay assembly of femmes
Who think the blacks be packin' Semi's
(That's why they don't sell no Henny)
Stink butts who think bucks
But they don't know my bank account is like a Brinks truck
Could buy it any day
Two poin one on a new building and lease 'em and the N9ne has plenty say
The rhyme, it give me pay
So I resign cause NV gay
And plus NV stands for no vagina's anyway
That place, Me and Lil' Weezy-Wee get no love
That's why when I brought Chingy in there
He peed in your club, not in the toilet either
You don't enjoy the beaver
You'd rather plot on how to get below your boy, The Peter
America's Club and Fase 2, I erase you
My pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too
Orlando South's racist, they treated me cold
And Lucky Strike and Power & Light won't let the N9ne in to bowl
Whoa, guess my Dickies the wrong clothes
Play my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors
Over a million records sold, Lot's of money to fold
They should let me in any club in KC, MO!
And I'm the biggest tipper, bartenders know me well
And waitress's love me, so club owners go to hell!
You got that blow to sell but you want this bro to fail
But it really ain't me 'cause it is your destiny to go to jail
And when you're though servin
You might see work on Club N9ne
When you walk up, you might be hurt
You might skeet-skirt cause you ain't gettin' in
If you ain't got KC hat and a white t-shirt, aye!

Listen, power

Let's go back in a day
I'm talking back in a day
Before I used to MC
When D-Power D he was just a DJ
I was in the jungle vibe
Selling records from 9 to 5
I used to go old school
...
And skip a bus right then
I lost a vibe
Then UKG come alive
I'm talking munchie
Talking...
And then came one two three
And then came Wiley then came Dizzy Kano and D Double E
...
And grime is alive
It was hard but we still survived
I know music evolves through time but
I thank you Lord that grime still alive
And I bust the mic
Now I'm on lord of the mic
Now I've linked on with modestep
2012 is a whole next hype

Alright where do I start
Let me come back let me go from the start
My life without music is a thorn in the heart
This marriage could have end in the park
It's like taking tea from a shop
English way Jamaican herry
The rivals listening to Morgan Harage
UKJ hard ass crew
Beating of the drums
LIstening to ABBA
I knew like when it was like Jacobs
...
Bob Marley, Gwen Steffani James Brunt
For you they may hardly relate
But for me they're all in the same playground
And it all comes together like a rain and cold weather
This is my Darwin Theory
Not like humans and apes
It's more like ...
Then you got dubstep
Then party like a rockstar

Yeah, yeah

For as long as I remember
I've always had music on my agenda
Yes! Number one contender
Yes! Lyrical skunk never heard of my scent
I used to listen to Call Fm!

Couple a years later
Lyrical sniper
I was a raver
Me and my man got briefing everywhere
Goin' on horrid
Heartless bears we are so solid
To be a MC ouh it was so funny
After years and determination
I'm part of a world known organization
Undefeated no other teaming

And no formation
Me and my mate is a Jesus
I was broke
Everybody loved me
Get paid up

I'm sick understatement
Me and your mate work in a basement
I used to have one pair of nikes
Now I've got countless trainers

Been doing this thing since TDK
Now it's all like top cd Djs
The way that I know that's PBK
Hardless fun I bust your mind

I will lead you to another land
D. R. O. C. K. is here with the light
Shinin' bright 'cause I'm right
Close your eyes and just concentrate
It's never to late to erase the hate
Focus your mind when I say my rhymes

Now how the hell you little nigglets

Knowing the whole time you grew up on the green
Y'all trying to be Paul
But I ain't tryin' to be y'all

You're on the radio in one goddamn city
So check your crooked lip bitch
And change yo plans
It's the numbers on your phone
And numbers on your cell

Verse 2 Juicy J
I ain't messed up by messin crooked cowards
Wit a nigga name testing my gangsta
Get his fuckin feelings hurt
Eyes 45 on the fish desert green
Sippin hen smokin and coughin on the scene
You say you wanna fight I know you is a joke
So step in the ride
They call me the Juice

It's wit all the sports
So watch bitch

You a hoe nigga in tight jeans shown off your thighs
I'm a g nigga nothing but dro' rolled up in my swisha
In a big Lac with leather seats a pistol ready to split ya
I' m ready wit my partner ready to jump up in the chevy
I'm ready to kick it wit Three 6 Mafia
Back up 'cause we won't fuckin stop

Verse 4 J-Bo
You can call it how you like
But I'ma tell it like I see it
We strapped up wit heaters and bones
They so conceited
Dribble and bounce pass niggaz they so grab
But the whole world will know when we blast it
Knock em off in the ghetto ready nigga let's go

But shit like that get niggaz killed
Either you won't but nigga you will
All these stories you makin up killin my ill
And my patience ain't long at all
Nigga don't fuck wit me if I ain't fuckin wit y'all
'cause I'm ready for the world but is it ready for me

They use the myth

And liberty abuse
The lies they tell are pretty
And blow up another city
They steal away your freedom
And your love

Are calculatingly designed
To rob you of your mind and time

Make you slaves to fancy words and phrases

Avec du naturel, exactement comment je les aime

A pris le highway direction la grosse pomme

A dit au directeur chu pas faite comme une modèle
Mais donne-moi un scénario pis j’te promets

En raison des leurs contacts

Avec ses rôles pop, teinté d’une vraie passion

C’est ça une star, quand t’es visible partout sur la planète
Maintenant elle a des années de métiers dans l’corps
Depuis un certain temps elle reçoit pu autant de call
Ses rides la trahissent, dans le milieu c’est pas pratique
Elle pense chirurgie plastique avant de devenir has-been
Elle se contemple dans le miroir
En tâtant ses courbes sur le bord de ses hanches
Elle cherche le fond-teint, c’est peut-être sa faute hin ?
Tout l’maquillage au monde ne pourrait cacher sa grosse peine

Boom shakalaka, elle est revenue en avion, de son escapade de la mode,
D’sa métamorphose en platinium
Elle a bu la fontaine de jouvence du couvent, elle a perdu douze ans, elle est prête pour les louanges de la populace
Est revenue en visite,
Pour le temps des fêtes dans son ancien district,
Elle tente de saluer le monde qu’elle croise en bycik
Mais pu personne au monde ne reconnaît Brigitte 
Photoshoppé comme une créature de magazine
Elle habite un corps maladif qui vient tout juste d’atteindre son paroxysme
On lui a serré les courbes, serré à double-tour,
On lui a greffé ses joues pis même son sourire
J’essaye de comprendre, j’essaye surtout pas de juger
J’sais pas c’est quoi d’être femme ou de se faire dire qu’on est usé
J’essaye de le dire avec les meilleurs mots de Molière
Comment elle peut être femme fière sans son fard à paupière
Dans la salle de bain, faut pas qu’on la dérange
Elle veut être parfaite comme une toile de Michel-Ange/
Moi j’aimais Brigitte Jones, avant son silicone,
Avant son physique chromé 


5-	LE GÉNIE D’ALADIN

Des fois j’me sens minuscule, dans mon univers
Quand j’travaille à l’année longue comme dans une fourmilière
J’suis pu les saisons, l’été est devenu mon hiver
J’me créé des pépiques bin amers comme des conifères
Quand j’vois des rappeurs corny qui ont les views de Cory Hart
J’ai l’goût de me noyer dans une bud, ou une Colt 45
Chu en train de chanter les blues, chu en manque de Teletoon
Une chance que ma blonde est là pour m’empêcher de péter les fuzz
À tous les jours je m’alimente de mes rêves caviars
J’mérite plus de reconnaissance, c’est là que l’affaire est fatigante
C’est peut-être à cause de mon timbre de voix qui est nasillard
Ou que chu pas assez agressif comme un cannibale carnivore
La reine est attirante, c’est une évidence que Money Talks
Y’a des voix dans ma tête qui me répètent d’aller voler une banque
Mon rap vient d’un gisement d’amiante
Chu passé d’influençable à devenir une influence
Mais donne-moi le génie d’Aladin
J’fais tripler les ventes de mon cd au magasin
Avec le mic à la main, j’me ferai connaître jusqu’à la Main
J’ferai mon thang jusqu’à ce que les lumières s’éteignent
Chu normal au quotidien mais donne-moi un mic stand
J’me transforme en X-Man, j’en veux plus
Comme un ivrogne qui a mal bu
Rien à foutre si l’ambition est mal vu

J’rêve d’avoir le génie d’Aladin
On dit fait attention à ce que tu souhaites
J’rêve d’avoir le génie d’Aladin
Y’aurait des bonnes chance que tu regrettes

J’voudrais baisser les prix,
J’voudrais faire cesser les crises
J’voudrais spread la bonne nouvelle un peu comme Jésus Christ
Mais donne-moi de la magie, ché pas comment j’réagis
J’amène de l’ordre dans la ville quand la ville est Jumanji
J’en demande plus, jveux une croisière dans l’sud
Un endroit où mes oreilles n’auront pas besoin de tuque
J’voudrais emprisonner Monsanto, j’veux sample
Un peu de bonheur sur ce tempo, j’veux le faire gros
Appelle-moi le Costco du rap,
J’faisais cette musique bin avant que Rob Ford faisait du crack
Bin avant Youtube, bin avant Itunes, 
Bin avant l’apparition des films d’enfant de Ice Cube
Ramène-moi la passion du début
Celle des partys dans les sous-sols de l’église
Où on rappait pour impressionner les filles
Aujourd’hui c’est le stress de ne pas avoir d’entrées
Comme MC Solaar j’trouve que les temps ont changé
Yep, j’veux le talent d’un architecte
J’veux une pyramide comme Imhotep 
Fuck it, j’veux un hypothèque
Avec ma voix qui est différente
Avec ma musique hippocampe
Original, j’voudrais faire une différence
J’veux être le David, sculpté des deux mains de Michel-Ange
J’veux l’abondance pis la romance
J’voudrais pouvoir acheter à mes parents une piaule en Provence",J'préférais Bridget Jones,

Y’a tu un ovni qui comprend ma philosophie ?
Y’a des hauts pis des bas
Y’a des jours où j’ai pas le goût de chanter mes états
Il faudrait que je m’éjecte, que j’déconnecte
Que j’revienne sur la terre dans la peau d’un métèque
Non c’est pas la télé qui a toutes les réponses
C’est pas la politique qui répond à mes questions
J’irai prendre un drink plus près des étoiles
C’est dans les belles choses que la vie se dévoile
Le diable est vivant, y’é sur un divan pliant 
En feuilletant des dépliants, mon art est si grand
Comment tu l’ignores quand chu sikh depuis mille ans 
Comme un kirpan
J’ai un train de vie qui vole comme une comète
J’ai pas le goût d’aller répondre à la sonnette
J’ai décidé que ma journée était Dunkin
J’ai décidé que j’allais me pogner le beigne

On n’appréciait pas d’où est-ce que je venais

‘’Pourquoi t’as fais ça, criss de fou’’

Je lui ai enlevé la casquette

J’ai du marcher des kilomètres, pour grandir en mètres,
pour devenir le maître des tous les maitres de cérémonie

Tu voulais une chambre pour les outils, une section pour les épiceries pis un hangars pour les technologies
J’voulais le gros-lot, la loto, la moto à quatre roues motrices, l’allocation, la location de la nouvelle locomotive
Tu voulais qu’on t’aime, tu voulais ton nom sur des totems, enfin tu voulais que ton nom soit immortel
Tu voulais voir Montréal, après Montréal, t’as décidé qu’on allait voir la ville de Québec
Tu voulais aller à gauche, j’ai chauffé le char jusqu’à la gauche, après tu m’as dit vas y vire à drette

Moi te prendre un sac de Doritos, un billet de la 6/49, aussi un pack de cigarette
Tu voulais aller voir les Rocheuses, on a vu les Appalaches pis le Bouclier Canadien
Tu voulais aller voir les US, rendu au Texas tu m’as dit on va tu un peu plus loin ?
Rendu un peu plus loin, y’a fallu stopper au magasin pour s’acheter une nouvelle paire de mocassins

J’pars de la côte Ouest du Québec à Nazareth
Rien m’arrête, j’coupe les poissons qui ont plein d’arrêtes
Pour mes boys qui suivent mon message
Mon but c’est toucher plus de gens qu’un massage/
Les Romains me veulent pas à la radio 
J’transforme en vin l’eau potable du lavabo
Chu métaphormidable
Si c’est la Guerre des Tuques, ton fort est fort minable
Le jour où chu sorti du ventre de ma mère
J’ai crié « Thug life » avec le majeur dans les airs
C’est qui l’Juda qui m’a unliké
J’travaille pour être su’a coche comme Nike
Anti-Babylone, mais mets dans ton système
Jusqu’à ce que j’revienne le jour

Tu pensais j’étais mort, mais chu là
Tu pensais j’étais mort, mais chu là

Le jour qu’il va décider de revenir de l’au-delà
J’aurai une chorale qui pourra chanter alléluia
J’aurai fait appel à Vishnou, Bouddha
J’aurai tout’l bloc, prêt à cueillir ce dude-là/
En ce moment, j’me promène chez les Païens
Pour aller chercher ce qui m’appartient
J’garde mes amis mais mes ennemis sont proches
J’fais attention à ce qu’on concocte
J’peux m’arranger pour qu’il s’mette à pleuvoir
Grâce à moi, les aveugles peuvent voir
J’ai des pouvoirs c’est dans mon ADN
J’dois donner un shoutout au paternel
Yeah, les yeux sont rivés sur moi
Collé sur le mic comme un frère siamois
J’bounce sur la terre Sainte, New York
J’reviens dans mon patelin avec des apôtres
California love, mon message c’est la paix
Tanné de voir des labels qui nous prennent pour des épais
D-Track c’est le dernier des vrais
Le dernier à mettre ses couplets dans son livret
Mes prestations religieuses
Attirent plus de followers qu’un compte de Tweeter
Juste avant de me faire crucifié
J’ai dit que j’allais revenir sur terre en tant que justicier

Islam
Il place des mots ici pis des mollah
Pis i s’en calife
Il le fait depuis qui jeûne
Même son père i demandait : « Coudonc, kes tu fatwa? »
« J’ai peur que tu t’es-soufisme dérange pas avec tes maudits Mohammed-iter dessus!! »
Mais Islam
Parce que plein de monde sont dans Shiite
Pis i trouve qu’i faudrait qu’on Sunnite
Fait qu’i travaille sur une écri-Turquie parle
Plutôt que sur une écri-Turban-Caire
Fidèle à sa voile poète djihad-orer ce qu’il fait
Il car-burka-ça
Il n’a dieu qu’Allah composition de textes tout compte fait
C’est un prophète pour ça
Islam
Pour que l’aumône se lève debout
Pour qu’on se Mecque à aimer la poésie de genoux
Fakir ressemble un peu à notre Fred Pellerin
Islam
Parce que sa minaret pas de se plaindre
Parce que sa ma-Mahomet d’écouter ses complaintes
Islam Abraham ouvertes
Pis il s’en fout si t’Aissa
Ou si tu le trouve pourr-imam!
Islam comme un fou
Parce que des PD-Jésus-bventionnent les plus riches
Parce que y’en a qui dorment à l’année longue dans un Ramadan-inn
Islam
Parce que beaucoup se font marcher sur le Coran
Parce qu’on a besoin d’Hégire-ophares dans la noirceur de nos consciences
Pour lui c’est un arabe-solu facilement commu-niqab
Ça fait que la rime devient sa fibre 
Comme un bon muezzin au son

Mais bien parce que c’est un mosquée fondamentaliste

Il livre ses é-tapis les gens le trouvent ad-mihrab
Falah bien que ça lui Allah rive
Qu’il réussisse à hadith-er les gens 
Avec toutes sortes d’i-maghreb-olutionnaires
Islam
Parce que ça l’al-lune
Parce que ça l’a-musulman-tal
Parce que trop de gens exagèrent et charia
Parce que c’est sa manière à lui
D’enfiler ses gants de boxe sur l’harem
Parce qui en a plein le casque
De voir des politiciens qui se muslim-age
Islam
Sans égard aux islamophobes
Parce que y’a trop d’allergies aux a-Rachid
Parce que y’é fier de ses textes Médine Québec
Il ausculte les mots halal loupe
Il se kaaba constamment
Parfois i nage même à contre-courant haram
Mais il réussit toujours d’arriver à Rome
Tout en se moquant des gens
Qui disent qu’être te-Nacer à rien
Avec sa plume il in-humus ses maux de tête
Il le fait comme si un Abdel était venu l’interpeller
C’est pour ceci, pour s’Allah

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams

All the lovely things you are to me

D'Arcy,"As far as you take me
That's where I believe
The realm of soft delusions
Floating on the leaves
On a distant shoreline
She waves her arms to me
As all the thought police
Are closing in for sleep
The dilly dally
Of my bright lit stay
The steam of my misfortunes
Has given me the power to be afraid
And in my mind I'm everyone
And in my mind

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

I'm beautiful, you're beautiful
As beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful
As wonderful as they come
And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass, wanting you

In the slipstream
Of thoughtless thoughts
The light of all that's good
The light of all that's true
To the fringes gladly
I walk unadorned
With gods and their creations
With filth and disease
Porcelina
She waits for me there
With seashell hissing lullabyes
And whispers fathomed deep inside my own
Hidden thoughts and alibis
My secret thoughts come alive

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

And in my mind I'm everyone
In my mind I'm everyone
In my mind I'm everyone of you
You make it right
It's all alright
You make it right

Yo,
I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed it to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - to read the gender how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Comps are dated - I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

I would begin to dial -
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ""Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana""?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it

All the evil in our eye
When I myself, feel the high
From all that I despise
Behind the jail or in the grave

I bet ya need a lot to gets monotonous
Spitting more games than an evangelist
Girl you know ya scandalous
I'm trying to get a one on one monogamous
Let's look into it like an analyst
I'm thinking about, can you handle this?
Take you back to the room with just a little touch
Touching the zone that's erogenous

Yeah, yeah, oh
Know I love my baby, my baby loves me
Laying in some heaven, need a little company
Let's go into a heaven, time to get some geto heaven
Geto

Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, I want the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Him rocking the holy spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than ""any ca, any ba ca"" any broad
He found geto heaven in himself and god

Geto heaven
Standing in some geto heaven
Geto heaven
Standing in some geto heaven
Geto

Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
Cause one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stopping him for
Not even I could ignore being alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and god

I know I love my baby
My baby loves me
I'm laying in some heaven, need a little company, yeah
It's twenty four seven, time to get some geto heaven
Time to get some geto heaven
Geto heaven, geto heaven
It's time to get some geto heaven
Time to get some geto heaven, oh

This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys who collecting court orders
Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hoping you could grow to it
Whether serving or a surgeon, you goin' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like donnie hath' helped me see lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to imhotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and god

Or is it that my eyes are telling me something you could never see
Something like me being with you ,or you being with me

Your love be da cherry in my chocalate covered dreams
So it seems, my oh my,

Oh my goodness, here she comes, switching that ass
I wondered if the men in her past have treated her bad
But if I had the chance, I'd treat her like a queen
Just like I do in all of my dreams
If you only knew how many times that I think of you
I'm quite sure that you will find, I'm going out of my mind

And here I am far from home
I dwell within a land that is meant
For many men not my tone

The blood of god is my defense
Let it drop down to my seed
Showers to your innocence
To protect you for all eternity
And with this wood I beat this drum
And we won't see defeat

From kings to queens becomes a prince
Knowledge wisdom is
Understanding what we need

Ever since the day you came
My whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
For your own
Everyday I see you grow
And remember what you already know
I receive the love
That radiates from your glow

From which you came was love
And that's how it all should be
You and my soul are one
Through all the time and history

D'Angelo,"I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in

Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

Yo, no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script, I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

D'Angelo,"(The hypnotic, the hypnotic)

Yo, I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed in to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - Tariq Agenda how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Calm, sedated- I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

Driftin (the hypnotic, the hypnotic)

I would begin to dial
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said ""Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana""?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it

D'Angelo,"After all jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries Mary

The traffic lights they turn a blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that they lived is dead

And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember?
The names it has blown in the past
And with its crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers ""no, this will be the last""

And the wind cries Mary",Everybody Loves the Sunshine,2006

Imagine niggas trapped
Imagine it havin' action

Imagine Pac gettin' call pop 'bout one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son

When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
When you put back to the streets you get right back in

Remember when they asks ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
We act like we hate to see you gun hoe
But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know.
Imagine niggas in the LBC felt just like Snoop Dogg & D-R-E,
And felt just like the niggas in the 2-1-3.
Then imagine us was comin' when you fuckin' with me.
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean imagine we said fuck this shit
Imagine if my niggas got together and tow up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growin' up in the jail done
Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run
Would you imagine growin' up to sell your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' on somebodies son

Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other
All the drunk fool gets pissed on balls

I wondered if the men in her past have treated her bad
But if I had the chance, I'd treat her like a queen

That's love
I believe that's love

I believe that's love
That's love
I believe that's love

I believe love, love

Uh of the things we believe
There's a whole lot of work we should roll up our sleeves
And we got a hold firm when fate's full like a sieve
Why doubt your plans cause when its all worth believing
We can make it work do believe that
We've mistrust in the dust and believe fact
We can achieve tact
By tuning out negative feedback
Naysayers can hate we concentrate to bring belief back
Into ourselves into the world into the rap game
Emcees are miserable that means their music's leaving mikes maimed
Man look we holding down for the truth
If we alone in the loop we gone hold for the proof
Man put it in believing
Believe in believing
Seeing ain't believing its the feeling that we needing
Believe in each other put the question to the system
They promising returns then question what you getting
We should believe in the reasons we existing
Time for renaissance to reawaken what is with it
Belief can confirm make it is what it isn't
Sometimes I wish I had belief when I didn't

I believe that's love (let's go c'mon)
I believe that's love
That's love

In the land of make belief time to make unbelief believable
Take a belief to the realm of the real
Believe in this shit that's force fed through the medium
Believe it is real when it's really a raw deal
Never disbelieve when you see human miracle
Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon
Believe in that don't believe in stats to the contrary
Gotta be weary of them theories carry on
People find belief when they don't find identity
Believe in your friends don't believe in your enemies
Mountains of doubts and disbeliefs right in front of you
Troops on the other side what you gone do

Oh that's love that's love
Oh oh I believe
Oh that's love that's love

so tragically its fragile I'm waiting for it to fall

I'm gonna take all of my love back on the way out
I'm gonna break out, gonna break out
I'm gonna take all of my love back on the way out
I'm free now, I'm gonna break out
I'm gonna take all of my love back on the way out

The fortress of our trust, a mirage of a mighty mound
I let you build around me above me it seems profound
But much to my surprise it receives a little hit and it crumbles
I'm leaning at the core, no support, all I can do is stumble

[Chorus]

A streak of light exposes all the glass
For stone this mountain can no longer pass
The confidence we shared has been a facade
I'm breaking out and leaving only the shards

Formidable destruction surrounding me only looks
I bust right through the glass, one attempt and that's all it took
I wanted to remain feeling safe, but it just can't sustain me
It feels more like a trap, gotta break out won't let it contain me

Lace satin covering up her charms

I'ma give her what she need
Can't snatch the meat out of the lioness' mouth
Sometimes you gotta just
Ease it out
I give her a pacifier
I fill my baby's crib with all the sweetness Daddy wants to give
And when it comes to rocking her to sleep, I'll never tire

Vamonos po' encima pa que aprendan algo, maima
Y tratan y no empatan, necesitan mas que bachata
Vamonos po' encima pa que aprendan algo, maima

Come comelon con pesta callejon
Quedece tranquilo no se ponga jaqueton

De que valen palabras sin asaña

Que puedo hacerlo durante toda la vida

Blinded I stumbled through each day
Chasing the answers in the dark

Swimming against the tide

Black and white seem to follow me

When I'm hearing gray
Cut the noise, find some clarity
Stereophonic sound
Racing through my veins

You pulled me through into the light
Locked in your gaze, I feel alive
I've shed my skin, learnt from the pain
Reborn from within. Reality changed

暗闇の中で 名前を呼ぶ方へ
向かっても 何も見えないとき
ただヒザかかえ うずくまってた
不安と孤独おそう この場所から
やさしく手にぎって
連れ出してくれた
光のさしこむ方へと 今 歩き出す
守るものがあるから 強くなれる
どんな痛みも どんな悩みも
きっと受け入れられる
だから大丈夫
アナタの声はきこえてるから
今までずっと分からなかった
アナタがくれた 信じる力
この願いも届く気がする
両手をあわせ ただ祈ってた
人は傷つくコトもあるけれど
すぐにまた笑えるトキが来るから
光のさしこむ方へと 今 歩き出す

もしもアナタが弱ってる時は
かわりに私が強くなるから
心配いらないよ

D'Wayne Wiggins,"Yeah, you know, it's like, I rap
I got two platinum albums
I do a lotta concerts all over the place
I seen the groupies
They do whatever you say
When you want it, how you want it, and where you want it
But I ain't trippin'
Cause these are the '90s
So when a freak say to me she loves me
I just say somethin' like this

I say baby, why you want to do all that?
Sleep with a brother just because I rap
You keep lookin' in my eyes, and you just won't stop
All damn night you been on my jock
But I'm no fool
Cause you're sprung on my house and my swimming pool
Call me a dog, I got several freaks
When I do my shows I can't get no sleep
Cause you keep knockin at my hotel door
I was there to sleep, and can't get no more
Sleep, so why you want to wake me up?
When I told you once I don't want to fuck
So get on, girl, won't you mind your own
I'm tryin to sleep, so just leave me alone
Next time I see you, I do my duty
But tonight, I got another hoochie

[Chorus]
Hoochie, tryin' to be bourgie
But you're nothin' but a groupie
Riding on my snoopy

I'm Short Dog, I want to take you backstage
And you can read it like it's on the front page
You want to do somebody right
For those who ain't famous, not tonight
You do the NBA and the NFL
Rappers and singers as well
Keyboard players and the drummer
It's like track and field with just runners
So let me get on the phone and call all my friends
Ain't a damn thing changed but the paint on our Benz
Get somethin' that you can't get from good girls
Care less about a weave or a jherri curl
Cause I know something you don't know
Ain't nothin' like these groupie hoes
And since Tony Toni Ton?made the track
Get lost, fool, and tell your girl I'm back
Sing it

[Chorus]

Get off my lap, cause you're gettin' kinda heavy
Lookin' at the bed, askin' am I ready
Ready for what, sex?
Well, after that, baby, what's next?
We get a house in the suburbs, two-car garage
And every night I get a good massage?
Save that drama for later
And take this number to my sky pager
Keep in touch, but don't call too much
When I come back around, you know what's up
It's time to get busy once again
Bring a few partners, cause I got friends
It's goin' down like always
Young groupies in the hallways
I got the money, the fame, and all the things you like
So I see you next time when I rock the mic
You

D'Wayne Wiggins,"(Take a hit of this joint, take a puff of the bulkest dove)
Puff on it!
9-6 (baby) Richie Rich, Rame Royal, hmm

When I wake up in the morning, first I yoke out
Then I ???? pimp, so I can smoke out
Good green opening up my third eye for sure
As I contemplate on which spot I'd like to go today
Damn, should I CDB again, I feel like loccin
Fallin thru every bomb spot in Oakland
I got the good but I just can't trip
Skyball TWAMP TWAMP for a piece of crip
Danl ???? that's the place to go
And my partner on the corner got the sack for sure
'84, I'm quick to look for booty hook
And if I'm fienin I need to see beamin
Cos, aah, them young brothers smoke the same way I smoke
But now all day I'm comin up short
Uh, I hope the town still love me
For some reason and my deceasing and my zoot's ain't fluffy
I need a pillow

Lay a drop on the pillow (Yeah baby)
And just relax, relax, relax (Cos that was made for you)
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
I'll fly free sack (fly free sack), fly free sack
(Cos that was dove for you)

By chance it might seem strange, many nights I dream
Of trees on the range with branches of light green
Women slumbering get tossed like salad with cucumber
But can't stop me from gettin lost on the lands of broccoli
High! I shut em, close my eyes, cough, too much spirit goes
The cloud nine where I'm a lyrical wiz
Magical like Willow wit automatic flowin pillows
Get rolled in a bliz and consumed, that's how Rame Royal is
In my room at the villo, sun shines thru blue blinds
On the window, lettin me know it's time
To go back to reality
Oakland, Cali
And a sack of indo left on the bed
Next to my rizzy's head
Fulfillin wishes, I'm fillin phillies, Vegas and swishes
Wit twenty reefers, sticky weed - minty and delicious
All I need and can axe for, a twamp to crunch
Probably won't want another blunt til lunch

Fell thru Sophia's but didn't see her
Now I'm convinced that it's on when I fall thru this red fence
I shoulda flipped the whole thang when I had the chance
But that done broke my back like a bald bozack
On a late night, I lurk for sure and got a lot of dough
For the first cat with the platinum sacks
And, naw, it ain't a jack, you can hold my scraps
But pull a move and catch a lump to the back behind the scak
Richie Rich might walk a country mile, smilin all the way long
Wit dreams of pullin bongs, writin bomb songs
Buzzin with my cousin at the villo
Stressin off a pillow

Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
And just relax, (just) relax, relax
(I know, I know, I know the sack was one for you!)
Lay a drop on the pillow (yeah baby)
I'll fly free sack, (fly free sack), fly free sack
(I know this sack was wrong for you)

Yeah ba-by!
Oooh yeah
Here we are gettin night endeavour
Don't worry cos it's gonna get better

And I'll blow a pillow with you",Pillow,1996

Now you know I've never been the type to have 
A loss for words
So I tell you these feelings I have for you
They're all so true girl
I heard someone say that love can be so blind
I'll give you your space to go and you know I'll always be there for you

D'Wayne Wiggins,"[Chorus]
How does it feel when ya livin' like that, and ya pockets are fat?
'Cause you're a playa, and you're pimpin' hoes
So tell me how does it feel when ya money ain't right,
And ya pockets are tight?
You're still a hustla, and you can't let go

When I was broke, I used to feel the pain
Now I got money, ain't nothin' changed
Same hustla, tryin' to hold on to what I got
And that's a lot, players like me can't be stopped
I was starvin', couldn't afford a TV Dinner
But now I roll around in a DB-7
Throwin' up the two, to the hoes and pimps
It's all about the money, you know what I'm gettin'
How the fuck you think I felt when I was broke
All the rumors I got killed and I was smoked
I tell the truth, I don't care how you feel about me
I'm still in the game and you still gotta see
My face goin' down the muthafuckin' street
Top down, beat loud with a top-notch freak
You say it ain't real life
'cause you don't know what it feels like, beyotch

[Chorus]

I feel like I'm a million dollar bill
Still in the game, all about the real
Can't feel sorry for you, do your thang
Don't be mad at the world 'cause you can't hang
If you feel like doin' somethin' that ain't productive
Look in the mirror, check yourself and say ""fuck it""
It's the year two-thousand, I know you feel me
But I can't understand why you niggas want to kill me
Went from broke to rich, I got your bitch kneelin'
I told her ""smoke this dick bitch, don't fight the feelin'""
And when she did it, she started jockin' me
I saw it in your eyes, you felt like sockin' me
For every action there's a consequence
Playa-haters always tryna start some shit
But then you gotta fight these niggas here
It feels good to be a playa, bitches everywhere

[Chorus]

I feel like eleven albums ain't enough
And at the same time you feel like you can't come up
Sometimes real life don't feel right
You been fuckin' her for years but its still tight
Then I came through bammin', vagina started expandin'
Used to be shallow, but now you landed in
Deep water drownin' and that's some real game
It's been your pussy for years, but it don't feel the same
I been creepin', feelin' your bitch up on the weekend
Is it still good she calls me Dr. Feelgood
I'll be her last pimp, you just a has been
And when she talks about you its all past tense
I said I don't give a fuck about history
I'll tell you bout my life then show you how this dick'll be
In you all night, go ask your bitch was she feelin' me
Man, you niggas be killin' me, haters

You don't need it anyway

Knows a place in Casablanca

So tired of bein' all alone 

Don't throw your life away, remember 
When you're down and fighting from the corner 
And you feel that there's no way out 
Just believe in the power deep inside of you 

Hold on and things will be alright 
And in the end when it's all over 
You'll be the winner on the night 
And in the end when it's all over 

You're not the same you used to be 
You know it wasn't easy 
But with experience you'll see 
You'll make it out if you remember 

When you're down and fighting from the corner 
And you feel that there's no way out 
Just believe in the power deep inside of you 
Hold on and things will be alright

I'm driving, through the mountains

No, I won't look back for another day

D*Note,"After all jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries Mary

The traffic lights they turn a blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that they lived is dead

And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember?
The names it has blown in the past
And with its crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers ""no, this will be the last""

And the wind cries Mary",Everybody Loves the Sunshine,2006

D-Age,"So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick!

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
It's just too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed will hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, ""Forgive me""
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin', nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a ""Stop the Violence"" rally, I blast gats
BMI my publishin', get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', ""Kuniva, yo, yo!""
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

Just rhymin over here man
Hey go 'head, go get drunk nigga
Ayyy, go smoke yo' weed nigga
Yo, go drink yo' forty motherfuckaaaah
It's Brick City dawgs over here
We gon' take it down like this, yo, D-Don, Don..

[D-Don]
It's bone-afficial my nizzle
D-Don got issues, and a type team that dismiss you
Oh boy! I gets more +Chips+ than +Ahoy!+
I got toys that deploy, I just aim and destroy
I keeps it gully in a bonafide skully
I ain't never had a hit but still get props like Nelly
I'm platinum in streets I got, love in the streets
And I'm more underground than your, basement concrete
Braids in my hair, gold still in my teeth
Still, bringin the beef if you're, bringin me grief
I, rat-a-tat-tat it like one-two one-two
Cock my shit back and let off on your whole crew
I'm Brick City baby twenty-fo'/seven
A project nigga that's, tryin to see heaven
I done ran through hell with gasoline drawers on (AOWW!)
I'm the portrait of a hustler, and once again it's on
I still got money buried in my back yard
I'm Bumpy like Johnson, they call me D-Don
My shit's so dope when you smoke you nod
And I spit that shit that leave you holy like the song

[Pacewon]
Yo.. we from the place where they pump out D and steal cars
Kids wild wave at you and smile you feel large
like they cut, and you got the power to heal scars
Never down cause the underground crown is still large
See I rap for a livin, probably rap 'til I die
If you dope, where you been at? Your raps is a lie
I'm all real, the one, the raw deal
Do tour, come home, do a flick for four mill'
What the hardcore heads on the block would call ill
Never catch me at the ball-out spot with small bills
Innovative rapper, rhyme in new ways
When I spit niggaz cough up blood for two days
Never catch me with material girls, they fugaz'
Rather bounce with a short chickenhead in blue shades
'Til the day I'm rich like Bruce Wayne
I'ma kick raps like pimps blew game
Ridin through your block with six new chains on
Pullin over droppin H-bombs
No doubt I got it locked Sanford Ave. to Penn Station
Chancellor to Central a thousand men waitin

[Chorus - 2X w/ minor variations]
Jersey that's whassup (whassup yo?)
You heard me light the Dutch (smokin weed)
Rock on like what the fuck (what the fuck?)
Jersey that's whassup, Brick City

[Roz]
Fuckin with me is a close call out of my crew
Don't try it I fuckin roast why'all, you and your co-stars
Next up to bat, I done had enough of cats
Blast tracks like what the fuck was that?
Roz spit rawness
State to state, hood streets and block corners
Rhymes hold so much weight, the feds on us
Lot of niggaz didn't want to see me last
But I won't stop just slow down like Easy Pass
Back up and give the are room
Or we gon' brawl worse than cartoons in bar rooms
In my city they don't pop they collar
Cats that do, get shot drop and holla
I'm from the be	-are-I, see-K-S
And my, squad is hot, any beef they bless
Any, squad that test gon' meet they death
Ask yourself, do you really need that stress?

[Shooga Bear]
Aiyyo, I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door, no bitin allowed
Plus the blows that I throw bring a light in the sound
So whoever want the drama I'm invitin them now
Phenomenal shit, spit 'til my abdominal split
Plus combined lines so minds demolish a click
Still burn MC's like Everclear, never fear
With razor sharp skills so ill they, sever ears
Hard to the roots a hundred proof with no chaser
Scarves and some boots a hundred troops with chrome bangers
Now rock with me, I spray blocks with glock fifties
Still when I spit I flip like Spock sent me
And never gave a fuck what a rapper grossed
But if they, brag and boast I'ma clap the toast
why'all can analyze this, watch me paralyze clicks
And sabotage why'all, I ain't a fan of why'all shit

[Chorus]
[Double O]
I'm a nasty ass disease, and now I got ya mouth celibate
I'm a direct descendant of Hannibal's elephants
That's word to mother, them damn jokes is over
You gon' run your mouth like a motor 'til I fuck up the rotor
It's Double O again, still runnin, still gunnin
It's like I got a cast-iron dick, I'm still cummin
Talkin that killer shit like you blood raw
And ain't even did ten minutes in the back of a squad car
Be big niggaz to they weak, I'm true to the streets
why'all niggaz is half-assed like one booty cheek
I'm (??), why'all is Swiss Miss
My camp'll make your army pull back like a slipped disc
It be the Bricks again, with me with them steel rods
It ain't right unless Shane, Tariq, and Raouf Nayim is involved
I did ery'thang from robberies to dope
And why'all just lie about it, like it's a big-ass joke
Playin like kids, I think you want me to spank you
Ninety-nine on the charts with a ship anchor on your ankle
And if you niggaz don't like what I say
I'm in Newark on Market and Hasley e'ry fuckin day

D-Eazy,"I've been coming home at night
And it seems like all you wanna do is fight 
Your friends say I don't treat you right
What they know about us? Don't believe the hype
What they know about the bond we share?
They ain’t there when I’m thinking ‘bout you in them things you wear
Girl you ain’t gotta sweat I swear
Man there's so many hoes out there but they can't compare
What we've got is rare
Girl we go together like a 808 drum and snare
And you're all I need
I can tell you don't wanna leave me even Ray can see
Why you listen to your friends when you know you're a 10
And they mad cuz I ain’t been fucking with them but
No matter what they say I do
Just know that I’m always coming home to you

You fell in love with a hustla, you know I gotta do what I do
I just need you to trust me; I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
I've been around the world and I
I'm coming home to you
I've seen a lot of pretty girls and I
I'm coming home to you

Would it be this way If I wasn't on my grind would you be okay?
If I stayed home with you all day, would you still think I creep like your friends say?
What's it gunna take for you to give me all of your trust?
You give your girlfriends that, but what they know about us?
They don't know when I’m gone man I’m missing your touch
And when your gone girl I’m praying you ain’t giving it up
Why you let 'em fill your mind with them lies and you crying
Thinkin’ I ain’t being true when I’m out on my grind
Girl you're mine and I’m letting you know
When I’m out on the road I ain’t fuckin with hoes
I got so many tryna get at my dough
But you're the one that I’m missing and my loving is yours so
No matter what they say I do
Just know that I’m always coming home to you

You fell in love with a hustla, you know I gotta do what I do
I just need you to trust me; I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
I've been around the world and I
I'm coming home to you
I've seen a lot of pretty girls and I
I'm coming home to you

I've been patient, I’ve been understanding
I know it's hard when my schedules demanding
And it don't help much that your girls try to make you believe
That I deceive every time that I leave, if you can see
What I do every time that I’m gone
I'm working hard wishing I could be home
And even though your friends talk about me I ain’t doing you wrong
Don't believe everything that you hear on the phone
Cuz baby they just wanna see us apart 
But the don’t know what I feel in my heart
Cuz I’m a Thug they assume that I creep
Cuz I spend all my time in the street
Why you listen to your friends when you know you're a 10
And they mad cuz I ain’t been fucking with them but
No matter what they say I do
Just know that I’m always coming home to you

You fell in love with a hustla, you know I gotta do what I do
I just need you to trust me; I'm coming home to you
I'm coming home to you
I've been around the world and I
I'm coming home to you
I've seen a lot of pretty girls and I
I'm coming home to you
You fell in love with a hustla, you know I gotta do what I do
I just need you to trust me; I'm coming home to you

It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
In the middle of the night I hear gun shots go off by my window, window
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy 'round here

The streets is so cold, it's hard to hold a smile
I'm in the hood and I’ve been pushing blow for awhile
And things ain’t looking up, niggaz is in denial
And I ain’t seen no better days beyond all the trials
I walked the church isles and prayed for God's hand
To lead me through the jungle cuz imma lost man
Still no response, damn been through a lot fam
And all I’m searching for is peace up on the blocks and
All I see is murder Dope fiends and Johnny law
And niggaz struggling, please believe it man I've seen it all
If you a ghetto product and you've got it hard
This one’s for you cuz it ain’t easy being who you are

Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
In the middle of the night I hear gun shots go off by my window, window
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy 'round here

Murder and drug abusing, Alcohol and prostitution
The streets are not protected under America’s constitution
Got cops and criminals and they both can't seem to stop the shooting
So we hit the 40 and the blunt like now we got solutions
Bullet holes I stop signs, crack sells I got mine
But can we stop crime so our mothers stop crying?
D-Eazy yeah I got us, we both them ghetto products
I love the ghetto so don't ever let the ghetto stop us
Don't let me get some paper cuz I can do some good
If I get rich then I gotta give back and I’m gunna give to the hood
To all my ghetto people, keep your chin proud and high
Cuz all you gotta do in life is just stay brown and die

Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
In the middle of the night I hear gun shots go off by my window, window
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy 'round here

Whoa, it makes me wanna say 
It makes me wanna say
Oh, Oh Oh

I've been to California and Phoenix Arizona
It's all the same struggle nigga just a different corner
We see an OD daily out in Espanola
G the struggle never stops it's like it's taking over
It's hard to stay sober when you know you're living greasy
The hood ain’t all that shit you niggaz see on the TV
Believe me homie none of y’all out there wanna be me
This life we lead ain’t easy ask Reno Beazy
I make a little money but everyday it's spent
And with the price of gas it's hard for me to pay the rent
Livin’ that check to check ain’t never been easy
Fuck a nine to five cuz I grind cuz minimum wedge will never allow me to find a
Way out of this struggle and suffering
So my mother and sisters stop worrying that I’m hitting the streets and hustling
Customers keep on coming in dozens and have to pay
But that's the ghetto and it keeps you trapped until you pass away

Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy
Dear father 
It ain’t easy, it ain’t easy; it ain’t easy, it ain’t easy

I live for today like there's no tomorrow
That's why I do my thang with the time I borrow
Tippin’ bottles daily tryna drown my sorrows
Heard God's on my side and I tried to follow
My pops even tried to tell me life is short
Too short to be spending all your time in court
But life is a game, kind of like a sport
When the clock stops ticking there's no life support
We all die of course; when you're gone you're gone
I don't worry ‘bout tomorrow when the chron is strong
All I need is a hit of the bong like Cypress
All my niggaz try to tell me how my life is priceless
It's hard to fight it though, they could be right
Ask Jigga man he'll tell you that this could be life
I'm livin’ life in the fast lane, mind on my cash gain
I'm staying high till I die nigga I can't change

I'm livin’ for today even though it ain’t wise
All I do is sip Hennessy and get high
We ain’t guaranteed another day so I ride
In the fast lane live as the days pass by
I'm livin’ for today even though it ain’t wise
All I do is sip Hennessy and get high
We ain’t guaranteed another day so I ride
In the fast lane live as the days pass by

I don't know why homie but I live for the moment
Too many niggaz waist time and don't even know it
Walking on egg shells and don't even notice
But, I don't waist mine though, I'm focused
On today fuck stressin’ when tomorrow's a question
If I see another day imma count it a blessing
I take a puff and let it ease the tension
And I tip Hen to release depression
Ain’t no worry on my mind when I breathe the weed
Livin’ in the fast lane cuz I need the speed
All my doggs try and tell me how I need to be
Cautious, But, imma keep it G believe
And as long as I’m free imma tip the Hen
Maybe, hit some skins if I miss the pen
I'm livin’ life in the fast lane, mind on my cash gain
I'm staying high till I die nigga I can't change

I'm livin’ for today even though it ain’t wise
All I do is sip Hennessy and get high
We ain’t guaranteed another day so I ride
In the fast lane live as the days pass by
I'm livin’ for today even though it ain’t wise
All I do is sip Hennessy and get high
We ain’t guaranteed another day so I ride
In the fast lane live as the days pass by

I make it do what it do with the time I'm given
Livin’ life to the fullest cuz time is tickin’
I ain’t got time to waste in prison
But I might end up there the way I'm livin’
I hope I’m forgiven when I hit them gates
But as for now imma push my weight
Get high like Styles P and chase my cake
Live it up right now before it gets too late
If tomorrow comes for me imma do it again
Imma get my money up and stay pursue them ends
Maybe smoke a little something mix up juice and the gin
And thank God for the time that he gave me to spend
All my friends try and tell me that I move too fast 
But, life ain’t forever homie time don't last
I'm livin’ life in the fast lane, mind on my cash gain
I'm staying high till I die nigga I can't change

I'm livin’ for today even though it ain’t wise
All I do is sip Hennessy and get high
We ain’t guaranteed another day so I ride
In the fast lane live as the days pass by
I'm livin’ for today even though it ain’t wise
All I do is sip Hennessy and get high
We ain’t guaranteed another day so I ride

D-Eazy,"It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood
It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood

I was born to the world, born to the drama; I was born to the streets
Born to the anger, born as a stranger, in a world with no peace
Never had a choice, never knew nothing more than a war that I wish would cease
Man I was forced to a world gone madd, forced to deal with the pain and the grief
All I ever seen growing up is shootings and young mothers out prostituting
Everybody feuding lives left ruined stuck in a world of mass confusion so
What was I to do? All I know is what I’m doing
I wasn’t put down here with a manual, answers or resolutions but
The streets embraced me in a world where we all gone crazy
And it gave me that fatherly love I needed daily
You can say I’m shady and hate me but you can't blame me 
Cuz I’m hood but I’m gunna be hood until they take me

It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood
It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood

I'm a product of a world so cruel, 
Like Flesh Bone but I had my crew
I had my click when shit got thick growing up they taught me like a father do
They're all I ever knew
I had their back and they had mine too
If they had they gat then I had mine too
They taught me life in a world confused 
If you was in my shoes then you'd know what I see every day
Know what it is to live in the pain then you'd know why we live this way
Unless you're blind like Ray, then you see all the anger and rage
All the feuds and the hate displayed all the struggle in the USA
I shed tears for the homies locked up and the ones in the grave
But I hold my head high and show that I ain’t afraid by
Staying down for the niggaz that stayed and never strayed
And staying loyal to the gang until I pass away

It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood
It's what we face in these streets every day
I ain’t heard no one say it would be easy
If I could bounce out this bitch, believe me, I would
But no matter how tough it gets I still claim my hood",Madd World (Interlude),

If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain

I know about the revelation and the ending of times
So my life is a sign that my vision is blind but
It's hard to see how these conditions are fine
We in a prison locked up without committing a crime
I never chose to live a ghetto life, never chose struggle
I never wanted this pressure, I was born troubled
I'm in a fight take a look at my knuckles
It's like I’m hitting brick wall living life on the hustle
Trying hard not to buckle under all of my stress
I confess misery got me wishing for death
Is this life worth living given all of my tests 
I'm just a man in the flesh trying hard to progress
See my life is a mess full of drama and hurt
I'm feeling cursed and my life got me down in the dirt
I'm on a search for some light through the thunder and rain
You wouldn't be so quick to judge if you were feeling my pain

If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain

I'm on a journey through a maze that I call my life
Getting scared through the process, I call it a fight
That got me up against the ropes and I’m holding on tight
Trying hard not to fall so I call on Christ
Is there a way out this ghetto prison
This life I'm Living got me paranoid wishing God would listen
I'm losing all faith in religion falling deep in depression
God, I’m going crazy holding all this aggression
I'm here stressing tryna find some direction
Begging God for his blessings but I get the impression
I'm all alone in this life of sin
It's like I’m lost in a jungle in this life I’m in
Without a friend to depend on lately I've been livin’ in fear
Heading straight for destruction, my ending is near
It might appear that I’m legally sane but
You'd think twice if you were feeling my pain

If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain

You don’t really know somebody till you walk in his shoes
And you don't really know his struggle and the shit he's been through
Until the shit hits the fan and the person is you
In the struggle all alone and you don't know what to do
I find it hard to keep my composure
The ups and downs of my life is like a roller coaster
Without a shoulder I can lean on, maybe I just need to be strong
But I’m suffocating daily trying hard to hold on 
You can tell that I’m hurting by the words of this song
So believe me when I tell you that this journey is long
It's like me and misery have been building a bond
We've been together for some time but we ain’t getting along
I'm sick of living life cold hearted, sick of shedding tears
I'm sick of calling to God and getting closed ears
I love Jesus but I’m looking for change
He'd probably offer me a hand if he were feeling my pain

If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain
If you could feel my pain

You can take a ride with me, let's roll
Let me tell you everything you niggaz wanna know
I'm a real heat banger, 505 gangster
Thugish nigga with flow
I do me like a real pimp should
I always keep it G cuz I’m so hood
Eyes stay tight cuz I puff on good
On the block with my kinfolk up to no good
See I’m just like you, I still chase cheese
And I still pop thangz with my New Mex G's
Ain’t a damn thang changed, I’m still me
And I put it on wax so the whole world sees

I heard you wanna hang with me
Well wassup?
I heard you wanna bang with me
Well wassup?
Man I’ve been puttin’ down tracks, tryna make stacks so if you wanna hang with me
Well wassup?

Well wassup?
Man I’ve been puttin’ down tracks, tryna make stacks so if you wanna hang with me
Well wassup?

Real recognize real, I do real thangz
I'm a real thug and I do still bang
My lifestyle ain’t never gunna change
This is me and I’m true to the game
If you wanna know me, you wanna know D
Take a look at the life of an everyday G
You can see that I’m still H double O. D.
And I still stay draped in a tall white T
Everybody know me, the kid from the block
Big black muthafucka flippin’ birds to the cops	
I'm the same ole G just under contract
You can see for yourself boy imma real cat

I heard you wanna hang with me
Well wassup?

[Big Moe]
Now see it started back in seventy-fo', Teri gave life to Moe
See momma was a hustler, daddy was a buster, why y'all know how that go
I was raised Screwed Up Texas, didn't know my direction
Now I'ma state representative, been chose by election
Some said I wouldn't make it, but I'm still in the game
Things done changed, diamond rangs,
man it's funny how things done changed
I hooked up with that DJ Screw
He slowed it down, chop-chopped it too
Got blades on the bus, candy paint on the truck
If you want to know what's in my cup

[Chorus]

[D-Gotti]
Now, now, now, 
That ""Purple Stuff"", that Houston soda in my cup
Now I'm behind the wheel, catch the wood, I'm done
Under the influence of bar
Drank stains on my FUBU and I still feel like a star
Now I'ma go up behind the wheel cause I done woke up
Wrapped around a pole and took a sip from my cup
Now I can't slip up, clipper
Catch a player leanin' impa-uh, one up in the trunk
Now, now hut, two, three to da fo'
I done slammed up the for with a Crush Pineapple
Gotti goin' last long but I ain't sipping with that bowl
Drinkin at the bar baby I be way too throwed
And I guess a player had about enough

[Chorus]

I love that Purple Stuff, yeah..",Purple Stuff,2002
D-Gotti,"[Chorus: (Big Moe) Toon]
If you thugging in the club (thugging in the club)
And you rolling on dubs (rolling on dubs)
You ain't tripping, showing love (and showing love)
Say it's about to go down
You got money in your city (money in your city)
And the mamas looking pretty (mamas looking pretty)
If you feeling what I'm feeling (feeling what I'm feeling)
Say it's about to go down

[Mr. 3-2]
As I slide down on dubs, moving around on concrete
That g, oh he and I stays on feet
Heat with hollow clips, ready to bust shots
Glocks, full of heat leaving the situation hot
Plot all day boss hogging for position
Street game all in your face watch the rolex cushion
Heavy weightier, I'm the champ, Mr. 3-2
Really though big baby and it's 2002
Wreck a shop with Mo-Yo I'm boy hard
Boys, want to got to war black them out like tar
Swingers, on my guard, in a old school
I'm a god damn fool, start to busting with the two
Fresh braided, player made it, deuce out the roof
Rest in peace to my old and in these streets running loose
Ain't no use, trying to stop it just come and pop it
Loco, big dozer and we still sitting sloppy

[Chorus]

[D-Gotti]
Cash me Gucci coat, slicing a bad bitch
Watch her get a china face lift
Gear shift, we performing up in the land
Suicide doors, dubs and twin cams
All bitches on the fam' heads turning tonight
Watch us be the star traction and a harder night
More than Sprite, plus my neck and wrist are cold
Ice cubes in my watch and the piece is just froze
These hoes, all on a nigga dick cause I'm young, fly and rich
Escorting a bad bitch, doja lit, I ain't worried about the laws
Hoes whisper to each other girl I think he played ball
No bitch, I'm just a rapper out the hood
And I'm wrestling with the wood, powered up feeling good
Little engine that could, beat the block for it's stock
Turn around and swap game for a political job
R.I.P. to Pab aka Mr. Sweets
If you peeping from the south we about to blow you fin to see
Gucci boots on her feet, Gucci boots on my feet
I'ma pay a lot tonight, shine and have a seat

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
When I hit the scene, I'm crispy clean
I got a box of doughnuts from Crispy Creme
Everybody looking at me like Flip you the shit
Hell yeah I'm the shit, look at my wrists
I roll up a Philly, roll up a Philly
Head to the town and watch 3rd Ward Billy
Knock a nigga out while pouring up a drank
Got my mind on the bank, in the jail I use a shank
I sip that, flip that, wood grain grip that
Go to the Papa Do's yeah I'm gone tip that
It's Lil' Flip I'm a million dollar star
Blue, black or red don't touch my car, uh

[Chorus]

[Noke D]
I'm shook up, I'm looking throwed
Gucci wardrobe to match the Gucci soles
Gucci hoes and hop out the SL
I'm popped up and sliding on Sprewell
We sell, everything you need
Riding through with Pardon Davis and some falling t.v.s
Moe and me, we have been a lot
Looking for some head in a little bitty shop
On top, on wrist rock it's going down
H-Town southside 3rd Ward bound
Pulled up acting and class so they'll know
The south on shine cause we ain't broke no more

D-Gotti,"Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Gotti we gone slide down swang wide
(Aight)
We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

Let me see your hands raise, if you playa made
Let the Screw bang, go on and do your thug thang
(We can do it like this, we can do it like that)
(You can hit it from the front)
Or I could hit it from the back

I'ma do it like this, I'ma do it like that
I can hit it from the front
(Or I could hit it from the back)
I'ma put it in your crack, see how you act

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor
Act a damn fool, on this damn tape
Like Po-Yo said got them hoes screaming rape

When I, pull out the drop, the sun is hot
And you know I'm feeling hot and I
I'm gone, do what I got to do
Stay true and I'm gone bang my screw

[Big Moe]
When I woke up I was in another mood
Freshened up, looked up thanking god that's who
Then I, I make my moves on the low
And everything looking lovely, everybody want to know
And I, po po's all in my face
Say I'm done hitting licks, I'm rapping to get rich
And I, I don't think it's ever gonna stop
Cause I'ma get some hot stuff, and like me dropping the top

[Chorus: x2]

[Big Moe]
Big Moe baby and everybody be listening
Except when I'm coming down top gone, you get with us
And I, I be doing what I want to do
When I pops up at my home, and the finest on my crew
And I, I wear more ice than you 
How I keep it so fly on my feet, when my toes hit the street
Now I'm, sitting in a large man car
Chopping up the deuce cause I'm a ghetto star

[Chorus]

[Big Moe]
Said we, bang screw, do what we got to do
Stay true, come down chopping in, something new
We so fly-why-why
And, Mo-yo my gal have low, cause we, time slow
Everybody know that I'm, oh no
I'm on some purple stuff

I huffed, I puffed, I blowed the dro down
Watch shoes do the who with spectacular sound
That'll make you look around
School of Hard Knocks to the socks
Fresh out the parks, that's known for hot blocks
Cause players get changed so I focused
Affiliated with the game, sitting inches from the ground, now I'm holding
Rolling, want up in the lane
How I come from nothing to going back with change
Pitching the game, knowing that I got another chance
To be, fronting on dubs, stretched shirt down pants
Now I alert why'all to the dance floor, I clap hands
Doing what I want in my 64 with people saying

It's a damn shame, when your gal pull hoes for you

Peep game, my girl

That's my girl, dancing on the bar
Ma, baby take a charge for me
And my girl, is a real hot thang
And she catch hoes for me

That's my girl, with a red coat on
Sliding down the block, and her shoes made of chrome
She don't mind, when the hoes all bop
My baby ain't ashamed, she'll jump off the top
And I like, when she make her last spot
When I put my school head, up on fifteen knots
You, better not touch my baby girl
We just balling all night, in our own little world

Now my girl, a sexy red with a throwed head
North star brain, and keep her down in my bed
Baby ain't scared, to strut her stuff in your lane
When I touches her brain, she get wet like rain
Jet down mayn, on a beautiful day
Waving my blue trunk, like we in a parade
If you lay in an escapade, when we in to winning
Don't drop the matches, on my baby's buck skin
Twenty two's tucked in, crawling for a playa
She love when Moe-Yo sing to her, getting paper
Hot we wreck the spot, and don't mind
When the fellas try to holla, 'cause I know baby fly

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

See my boo, don't mind being couped up
'Cause when the weekend roll around, she gets ooh stuff
When she juiced up, attitude screwed up
Leave a chip on her her shoulder, boys swear she souped up
I chunk my deuce up, 'cause my lady too tough
Four scoops of purple stuff, mixed in my cup ha
No matter who what, when where or how
In the middle of a crowd, baby gotta stand out
Let the top down, she don't believe in broads
Quick to snatch my boy, 'cause she attract the law
Ask her bout them boys, like his like your's
She is my bitch playa, part
Every time we floss the board, is something you never saw
Not a single score, a solitary flaw
Started life as a Houpe, but now baby bulletproof
See uh, call my girl is proof

Let me in the door
You keep sayin' you hear me knockin'
What you standin' there for?
Who I gotta kill or sleep with?
Cause I'm the worlds best secret
Let me in the door
You keep sayin' you hear me knockin'
What you standin' there for?
Cause I'm the one that do that music you feel
But you still review this
Let me in the door

Right now before my goons have to tear it town
We don't wait in line and we don't stand around
We at Club Zen and drinkin', actin' brand new
Actin' like he never seen my face and I ain't got loot
They know I'm Cash Image and I'm with Tech N9ne
And before the club close, The owner gon' respect mine
Spend a lot of money and that's the bottom line
Ten cars on chrome, Plus the neck shine
Baggy jeans on and J's with a lot of bucks
And you ain't gotta know me
You could tell my dollars' up
Poppin' collars in the club, turnin' bottles up
And all the models in the club wanna follow us
It's Mr. Chevy Man, You hear my song playin'
And every time we in the club
We be spending grand's
First deny Tech then deny me
And I was number one on 103 for forty weeks

[Chorus]

You say you hear me knockin'
So why you don't wanna let me in?
But I ain't buggin', So tell the cops to come and get me then
Complain about my shoes, ain't really talkin' 'bout shit
Dude, I spent like three hundred and fifty on this outfit
NV ain't gon' let me in, zen actin' funny with me
What it's gon' cost me, homie?
I brought a little money with me
I don't wear tight shirts, my pants kinda baggy
KC hat tilted, so now they wanna red flag me
I'm by the bar every time, point blank, Period
The door man hatin', takin' his job too serious
Me, Cash Image, Tech and Kaliko about big business
So what I'm talkin to a bouncer for?
The woman see me, Scream my name like announcers, bro
They actin' brand new this week
So I'm about to go to the block and bubble and get plenty cake
I just wanted woman and I don't like this club anyway
So fuck y'all!

[Chorus]

I get money from music, Kinda like to spend-spend
When I hit the town, I know they gonna let me ends in
But these other clubs be trippin' like I begin sin
You hear me knockin'? (Oh yeah)
Well let me in then
Cause NV ain't so friendly
They got a gay assembly of femmes
Who think the blacks be packin' Semi's
(That's why they don't sell no Henny)
Stink butts who think bucks
But they don't know my bank account is like a Brinks truck
Could buy it any day
Two poin one on a new building and lease 'em and the N9ne has plenty say
The rhyme, it give me pay
So I resign cause NV gay
And plus NV stands for no vagina's anyway
That place, Me and Lil' Weezy-Wee get no love
That's why when I brought Chingy in there
He peed in your club, not in the toilet either
You don't enjoy the beaver
You'd rather plot on how to get below your boy, The Peter
America's Club and Fase 2, I erase you
My pants are too baggy even though I'm clean and I'm paid too
Orlando South's racist, they treated me cold
And Lucky Strike and Power & Light won't let the N9ne in to bowl
Whoa, guess my Dickies the wrong clothes
Play my music but won't let me and my homies through the doors
Over a million records sold, Lot's of money to fold
They should let me in any club in KC, MO!
And I'm the biggest tipper, bartenders know me well
And waitress's love me, so club owners go to hell!
You got that blow to sell but you want this bro to fail
But it really ain't me 'cause it is your destiny to go to jail
And when you're though servin
You might see work on Club N9ne
When you walk up, you might be hurt
You might skeet-skirt cause you ain't gettin' in
If you ain't got KC hat and a white t-shirt, aye!

A young go getter mind locked on havin' wealth
Livin' wild with this thug style, I got these hoes
Tuggin' all on my Avirex clothes
A young brown Mafioso, I put my foot through the door
Infrared light smilin' title, desert eagle 4-4
Layin' Cubans on the floor, 
I send my ghetto troopers to the mother load 
To snatch a bottle of A-1 yo,
I'm hearin' rapid fire through the house
Eternal warfare with heavy weaponry
Me and my soldiers ain't scared,
You get a bullet to the head in trainin' if you don't aim for the head
So I know my young shooters left somebody dead around the corner
Plus got the yola out the trunk bendin' over
Its daytime I can't wait till it turns to night 
Cause that's the time when ghetto stars come out and shine

Quicker than outlaws I draw on haters with glocks and techs
Buckin' at undercover agents dippin' off quick in the lex
That's my trigger finger fuck 'em lets bring the heat to the street
Gave him one to the head and there he dead eternally asleep
Deep in this cold world where there's no love, what the fuck should I do?
People be killin' they family for yola not trustin' in you
But now I'm teachin' you some ackrite 
With forty-fives and flashlights
Fuckin' around with thug niggas
And drug dealers
Manajetuahs and jaguars getting chopped in the drop
Killin' haters that act hard nigga like it or not
Cause it's a hold up, your hands go up real slow
Should've told ya that I'm a soldier who kills hoes
Pullin' no mercy on these busters ain't no callin' the cops
And my nine is comin' to fuck you nigga ballin' or not

I'm off in this shit like Mr. Hanky, Janky, but when it gets stanky
Time to rape fiends, my niggas take G's, make G's, but it ain't free
Pimp niggas laced me when I was a baby, how to slang D
And stained me, a suck ya up nigga lip locked but I can't speak
Now it's crazy, niggas be lazy, imbecilic, milli vanillic, 
Can't speak on it but I feel it, I'm the villain stealin' scrillion
Convo be thrillin' your brain waves get to healin'
Just to reach out and touch you 
train of thought make a killin', Soldiers willin', 
So I do it for thug niggas and drug dealers through the snow and rain
Focused on fetti fuck how it came, steady remain
Paper over hoes, and stay on my toes 
And air these niggas out like sandals, 
Blow 'em out like candles
Handle my business and listen to my theezo
And in this thuggin' category I keep it sharp as a needle

Bust it, listen MC's, or get broke
The mic I strike and all that's left is smoke
The mics you struck, was held by ducks
You want to light my mic, hold up, you're outta luck
and time, chant this rhyme as I tell ya
Front on the mic tonight and I'll sell ya
a wolf ticket, to the Twilight Zone
Like Al. be	 Sure, you're off on your own
microphone that alone could display all day
Then I'll slay your array
of deranged rhymin, no timin
Like a mountain man I keep climbin
Over your vocals, reignin supreme
Takin me out on the mic is a dream
Age 19, and my theme
is hittin skins while I make the ends
meet while I speak straight to the weak
For those that oppose, I'll even defeat
Point blank, period, your rhymes are slayed
You're feelin the clash of the knight's crusade
So clear the stage, as I invade
When compared to me you're low grade
On this stage, you better be stable
Compared to me you're just ""Crumbs On the Table""

Ha ha you don't stop, keep on, a keep comin strong

D-Nice,"(Chorus)
My name is D-Nice...
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

Yo, this is D-Nice and I'm about to drop some funky lyrics on this track I 
made up, you know what I'm saying, huh, yea and you don't stop, yo

My name is D-Nice although I hate to admit it
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it
See every episode remains in this mode
Very cool, very calm, there's no sweat in my palm
I just pick up the mic, proceed wit a song
I get right to the point, my competition's not long or short
It's like a sport hanging in the middle
But now if you're puzzled, let me kick the whole riddle
That my name is Derek and if I didn't mention
D-Nice is just a description
It describes the kid on the mic
I'm the TR-808, huh, but just call me D-Nice

Chorus

I start to think, a very big conscious all around me
Who will be the sucker MC to try to doubt me
Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or him
But I'm like a tree and every lyric is a limb
You throw it on the turntable, very unstable
But you gamble because you need that example
There's a 1000 MC's on the planet earth now
What is the word you say to get hers
Some like to explain, some talk educated
Some like McBoo, he's X-rated
I like to think of myself as a pure rebel
A radical thinker on a musical level
'Cause suckers want to stop me and girls want to kiss
Wherever I go, yo, it seems I can't be dis
'Cause my name is D-Nice but all the girls call me Derek
It ran through my crew so I guess I've inherit
The job of explaining and also retaining
The fact D-Nice is remaining
Not a king nor a prince but as a teacher
Wit dopies like this, I know I'm gonna reach ya
So now I don't think you should all despise
This fact D-Nice is on a rise
Straight to the top like a bubble of water
It's a slaughter so I think you oughta
Think realistically, not egotistically
It's suicide if you even think of dissing me
'Cause if you try, I'm a make you wait
To learn the reason I'm the 808, but just call me D-Nice

Chorus

I live in the Bronx by the D and the 4
Writing lyrics, it's addictive, writing more and more and more
About peace, about wars, about whores
Breaking city laws to me become a chore
I wear no jeri curls but I still pull girls
I don't slur my words when I rap 'cause that's wack, huh
But in fact, I do not slack
When I drop the funky, funky lyric on a track
I'm not conceited when I walk the streets
And you can tell by the words that I speak
That I'm not just another brother on the mic
'Cause the females love me and they call me D-Nice

Chorus",Call Me D-Nice,1990
D-Nice,"(Is that a turntable?  Well get on it, it's your turn)

Who gets laid, the chicken or the egg?
How about the MC that has just been led
To a renegade teacher, preacher then he got stomped
Cause I'm a feature straight from the Bronx
Productions, better known as Boogie Down
If I was a king right now I'd get crowned
The Nice is a teacher, not a prince or a rap lord
I even write my rhymes on a blackboard
To get specific, and probably make you understand
What makes the 808 plan
It's simple, I'm a round it off like this
That's how many stupid MC's I've dissed
But if the commence to try me I won't buy it
I'll look them up and down and I'll say ""Don't even try it""
Cause I can go on and on without breathing
The TR, another form of BDP-eating
MC's like Chunky, moving real bluntly
Shaking and baking MC's like a junky
Fiending, hitting MC's like they was cocaine
Calling them John Doe, meaning they have no name
I'll spin you like a quarter, drink you like water
Hit below the belt with things you never thought of
I lay down the law that I am a slaughter
I roll like a tital wave, so you oughta
Float like a sailboat, move like a speedboat
In water, now watch you soak
Into a rhyme of mine until you hit the bottom
It's heavy like an anchor, it's no problem
For me to just bake you, eat you like a cookie
I am a profressional, boy, you're just a rookie
I'm here to sing a song, but some are not able
Compared to me you're just crumbs on the table

In my prime, more vocal than I've ever been
I'm not an amateur, sort of like a veteran
Split from the bums, arriving from a long trip
Now I'm back to just cold rip
MC's like confetti, eat 'em like spaghetti
I chill for a year and yet I'm still ready
To house MC's, sink 'em like a boat will
I roll heavy, thick like oatmeal
So now you know the 808 is showing
I do damage in just one moment
Here's a little message to those who want to hang out
Just remember that I give pain out
The TR-808 relates to a terrorizer
Never hiding, clever always memorizing
Poetry, history, math, or even paragraphs
I'm not into be	-boying, just hoeing
Showing, blowing MC's like the wind does
I might lay you, sort of like a hen does
Cause your rhymes are weak and unstable
Compared to me you're just crumbs on the table

You must think, before you even get soup
I'll put you on the corner and sell you like a prostitute
Like a street whore, make you want more and more
Move you to the side, up and down like a seesaw
Pulling out a gun is uncalled for
But I'm with it, so go for yours
You may even try to diss, but I call it flattery
I pack more volts than a Duracell battery
Charging MC's, smooth like the breeze
Scott made me funky, yo, that was one theme
Or topic, showing I be rocking
Every little city I play I leave a heat wave
Burning up the industry, never try to get with me
I'm the type of person that never needs rehearsing
Just a little sex, a six pack of Beck's
And my room to move about, and a Guinness Stout
To make me feel able, chilling, and stable
Sometimes I'm on the mic, sometimes I'm on the turntable
I'm superb, sort of like herb
A man of my word and I've never been served!",Crumbs on the Table,1990
D-Nice,"I grew up in the city where everything is rough
Where everywhere I turn, I seen somebody gettin bust
Plus everywhere I look
All I could see is a crackhead or a goddamned crook
Runnin' around with a pistol or a blade
Stickin' up, in other words, gettin' paid
But I chose not to follow those ways
Cause the only place you headin' is to jail or the grave
But on the other hand
I know a man named Stan
Who in the future had plans
To be successful on his quest to
Take his moms and pops out the ghetto
But that plan was soon to be crushed
When one day he realized he must
Get a better job to pay for his schoolin
While his friends would sit around just coolin
He applied for a job in the system
And everywhere he looked, everybody would diss him
He doesn't have any type of skill
And life is not all games, it's real
he took a long walk down the street
Tryin' to think of a way to make his ends meet, huh
So he could buy the fly things he adored

And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more
As he walked home, he thought to himself
Now what am I supposed to do to get wealth
He felt that his life was worthless
Then he ran into his man named Curtis
Now Curtis, he's the type that stops and brags
About all the things he's got
Drivin' a Saab with a black ragtop
Come to find out Curt's workin' for the cops
He told Stan there's a job that's open
Makin' it all sound good, just hopin he would take it
Yup, and like a big dummy
Stan said ""Freak it, yo, I need the money""
Curt took Stan to meet his boss
Officer Sims, a sergeant on the force
He gave him a gun and Stan began
His new career as a damn hit man
his boss really liked his work
And gave the boot to his partner Curt
he didn't realize what he was in for

And all Stan wanted to make was a few dollars more
A few dollars more is what he started to make
Now he's drivin' around a Saab, with a house upstate
He got gold and diamond rings
Crazy girls and all those glamorous things
But one day this life-style end
When one afternoon while hangin' with a friend
Sittin' in the park, drinkin' quarts of beer
And somebody said ""Throw your hands in the air,
It's a stick-up"" and put the gun to his head
And said, ""Make another move and you're dead""
Now Stan had to make is choice
He paused and said I recognize that voice
Huh, where have I heard this
Now he remember, it's his man named Curtis
Curtis is mad and felt he'd been robbed
""Cause Stan is drivin' around in his Saab
He looked at Stan and said, ""I can't believe him,
Now its' time for me to get even""
Stan made a move real quick
Curt jumped back and said, ""Yo, that's it""
Shot him in the back of his head with a nine
Reached in his pocket, grabbed his cash and then dashed
Now here lies the man on the side
The same way he lived was the same way he died
He never knew what he had in store

Back in the civil war days of 1863
was the year that free
blacks would try to adapt as soldiers
Live as equals and get what's owed us
And in this time they had yet to find inner peace
Which comes from the heart and mind
So listen close as I explain the story
of the regiment of blacks on the path to find Glory

""Courage, spirit, and honor"" .. on the path to find Glory
""Courage, spirit, and honor""

[D-Nice]
Bust it, yo
Here's an example of courage and strength
that dwelled in the men that went the whole length
To prove that each can stand as a man
And demonstrate, he can carry his own weight
But there was some tryin to add to the plight
of the black man, denyin his right to fight
as an equal, for self-esteem
Ran through the crew or so it seemed
Cause even in times when life seemed colder
He still remained proud to be a black soldier
Waitin for the chance to advance
and under the circumstance, managed to enhance
his courage, and when put to war
he'd do much more than what's bargained for
And each man, that can tell the story
knew from the start deep down in his heart they'd find Glory

""Courage, spirit, and honor"" .. on the path to find Glory
""Courage, spirit, and honor"" .. break it down

{*scratch: ""here's an example of courage and strength""*}

These brothers have died and cried, for power and freedom
But now look what we've done
We're robbin and killin our own race
Black and rap will be lost without a trace
So take heed to the knowledge I'm bustin
You're sellin yourself short, that's ""Self Destruction""
The song I sing to let freedom ring
So listen to the knowledge I bring as I speak about Glory

Mess around and this becomes critical

You're talkin bout foolin me?  What could you do to me?

Mess around punk, and get a foot in your {ass}

Or else have a glass of milk, and a cookie

D-Nice,"It was a hot summer day, I was dyin from the heat
Walkin up 118th street
Although I'm hot like stew
In the back of my mind it was a bottle of brew
Now a ice cold bottle would just quench my thirst
Or get some boom from the dread, which ever one comes first
Now is it brew? (yeah) or is it boom? (yeah)
So I lit up the boom and now may I presume? (yeah)
Now about 3 o'clock I had to meet my crew
I looked at my watch and then I noticed it was half past 2
I saw these two honeys walkin down the avenue
And one of them said: all I think about is havin you
Now in my mind I realized I coulda took her, coulda took her
But Nice is not the one to treat the ladies like a hooker
Don't mean to diss, but it's not on my list
So I gave her a kiss and said: ehm, good-bye, miss
From the streets I heard a horn beep
There was a crew 4 deep in a dark blue jeep
I heard em speak, he said: my ride is fat
So why you're sweatin D-Nice, baby, he ain't all that
Now first things first, why all the rude behaviour
You shoulda been taught how to respect this flavor
He jumped out the jeep like yo, what up chief
But I don't eat pork, so I guess he wanted beef
I realized I was on my own
I didn't proceed to make a move until a blow was thrown
He swung but missed, I caught him with a fist
Although I wish it didn't have to come to this
I started breakin him down with the speed, had him astounded
The right caught his jaw and it sounded
Like boom boom bap boom bam
He had no idea that D was nice with his hands
He stepped back, so I thought he was through
But right about now up steps his crew
We all threw down and went round for round
I'm givin it all I had to give until I fell face down

They proceeded to stomp but in all of the madness
Somehow someway I was damn sure glad this
Person slid me a pistol from behind
Not the weasel, pop-pop-pop goes the 9
So if you're wonderin why you ain't heard word of them

With my boy Too $hort, leavin everyone in awe
I met this little honey, she said, ""Hi, my name is Bunny""
I never would have thought she was out for my money
Now she appeared to me to be smart and legit

Well I'm known to wreck a mic like a prince, so all hail
To the raw deal, on a scale your style's frail
I don't believe I can fail, cause I'm headstrong
You're trackin me, plus jackin me knowin that you're dead wrong
I got a Tec for those that want to step
You're ghost, cause since you're playin me close you're gettin checked
And I can't conceive a better way to do it
So when you're in my comp, get ready to be stomped, there's nothin to it
Cause I got piles of wicked styles and files of tracks
I get wild with a South Bronx style of rap
So you think you got rap sewn happily?
How's that: you couldn't sow shirts in a factory
You're what I label as a hip-hop hypocrite
You smile in my face, behind my back runnin off with lip
But I got somethin to kill that, though
I'm a real rap pro, bad bro, so now you know

(The TR 808)
(Straight, straight from the Bronx)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now back to the scene of the crime
I was taught to bust a nine
At any and all who's outta line
Yo, that's the way I was shown how to hold my own
Until I found other ways on the microphone
I used to see so many out on the ave. die
Strung high, playin a game, and that's why
So many up in the Bronx, they got done
For livin a lifestyle of crime like it was fun
But now I'm hittin ya hard and pullin the cards
Of those that want to act a fool, they got schooled
And got caught with a right to the mug
It wasn't enough, cause they wanted to bug and caught a slug
And got they bodies just laid to rest
Cause in the streets you gotta get all you can, and no less
The first minute you do, you get bucked
So you and your crew better duck
When you step into the Bronx

(The TR 808)
(Straight, straight from the Bronx)

Check it
I want to take this time
To send this out to my man Dino
And to my man Scott-La-Rock
Cause if it wasn't for them
I wouldn't be here today
But since I'm here
I'ma continue to make funky music for my brothers
You know what I'm sayin?
I'm outta here

[ CHORUS ]
	To the rescue, Nice, to the rescue! 		(4x)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Well, it's about that time for the hyper one to react
But in fact, get back, cause I got the sudden impact
And I get hot like a sunny day
So the man D-Nice ain't the one to play
Cause I remember the one who tried to carry on
Stepped up and got ran like a marathon
Cause he thought he was able
And got served with the 'Crumbs On The Table'
Cause I'm the type wihthout Vanilla hype
I rush into the night and snuff you with a pipe
That's right, so rappers with lip
When I flip, you might just catch a Mac-10 clip
Cause I've had it up to here with the nonsense
Swingin with this you get dissed
Cause yo, my mouth is like a loaded Tec-9
For those that try to take mine

[ CHORUS ]

(Let me tell you)
(Let me tell you something)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now guess what I heard: a brother can't flow
That is a no, no, no, cause I flow just like a all-pro
So now I'm ready to go, cause I'm open now
Competition that's dissin gets broken down
So just sit down, clown, or I'm smackin ya
Cause I'm rough, yet smooth as an Acura
So capture my stature and rapture
And I'll never ask you to praise me like a statue
Just dig into the music that I threw down
And now you know who to call for a new sound
Cause I sat back and watched some get laughed at
Tryin to get live with weak raps and a half-track
But here's a piece of the whole pie
So grab your mic and give it a bold try
You try to step up, remember I stepped through
For those that get stuck, it's Nice to the rescue
(To the rescue, Nice)
I burn rappers till they turn to dust
So all competition better catch the bus
Or get crushed and ate like food, boy
That's the outcome messin around with the rudeboy

D-Power,"Let's go back
Listen, power

Let's go back in a day
I'm talking back in a day
Before I used to MC
When D-Power D he was just a DJ
I was in the jungle vibe
Selling records from 9 to 5
I used to go old school
...
And skip a bus right then
I lost a vibe
Then UKG come alive
I'm talking munchie
Talking...
And then came one two three
And then came Wiley then came Dizzy Kano and D Double E
...
And grime is alive
It was hard but we still survived
I know music evolves through time but
I thank you Lord that grime still alive
And I bust the mic
Now I'm on lord of the mic
Now I've linked on with modestep
2012 is a whole next hype

Alright where do I start
Let me come back let me go from the start
My life without music is a thorn in the heart
This marriage could have end in the park
It's like taking tea from a shop
English way Jamaican herry
The rivals listening to Morgan Harage
UKJ hard ass crew
Beating of the drums
LIstening to ABBA
I knew like when it was like Jacobs
...
Bob Marley, Gwen Steffani James Brunt
For you they may hardly relate
But for me they're all in the same playground
And it all comes together like a rain and cold weather
This is my Darwin Theory
Not like humans and apes
It's more like ...
Then you got dubstep
Then party like a rockstar
A rockstar
Yeah, yeah

For as long as I remember
I've always had music on my agenda
Yes! Number one contender
Yes! Lyrical skunk never heard of my scent
I used to listen to Call Fm!
Black market...
Couple a years later
Lyrical sniper
I was a raver
Me and my man got briefing everywhere
Goin' on horrid
Heartless bears we are so solid
To be a MC ouh it was so funny
After years and determination
I'm part of a world known organization
Undefeated no other teaming
...
And no formation
Me and my mate is a Jesus
I was broke
Everybody loved me
Get paid up
...
I'm sick understatement
Me and your mate work in a basement
I used to have one pair of nikes
Now I've got countless trainers

Been doing this thing since TDK
Now it's all like top cd Djs
The way that I know that's PBK
Hardless fun I bust your mind
That man there was leaving away
...
That's what I was back in the day
But I still represent the sounds of the UK
Little bit of dubstep little bit of grime
...
Be my
Doing this for awesome crew
One for the a track and dynamite boo
I don't wanna tell them what to do
They'll deal with a nasty crew

Letting motherfuckers hear all that bass around
I ride an Impala, don't pop my collar
Coming through the record company, want all my dollars
You ain't got my paper bitch, you don't get no dick
And I ain't put my dick in the uh you wrecked
Cause tramp hoes be talking, on the pilla walking
Out the street get them hoes, telling em bout all your clothes
And your car sitting on gold, and how much you get at shows
You shouldn't trust that bitch, that bitch will get you hit
I see it all the time, bitches get knocked on the grind
Keep it ten with that wife, coming back in the middle of the night
Say bitch you need to stop, you need to sell some cock
You need to get off them rocks, and get on private yachts
I'm talking bout they cousin, coming through bitches buzzing
Drinking on Hennessy, bitch you don't know Pimp see
You late on the slab, coming through whipping ass
I whip it up in the lab, and put it out like it's dark around

(Aight)
We gone ride gray or peanut butter buck eyed
Then we gone tip toe, so slow
We gone wreck the slab for the dirty third coast
Hell we gone post up, on the lot

Fifth drop screens lit, trunk pop
Stash spot, cash box, on vogue socks
Old shoes chrome laces giving haters blues
Banging what Screw, tell me what it do
Shocking and rocking club and the thug and staying true

I'ma do my thug thang, bang bang, chitty, chitty chop
With the stash unlocked, trunks staying hot
HA, green sticky la, deep in the shop
Cardiac kicking times

It's a party baby bounce, bounce sugar hit the flo'
I'm on the cool up in the fo', in the newest Gucci clothes
'Bout to drop it to the door, baguettes touching my navel
Body rocking kinda slutty, served out like label

We got, a stable full of pop
That dish the satellite and throw cable at the spot
Up on the table if it's able to get wet like a mop
And after we wreck the spot we can just ride

If you like it on your knees, you could have it for a snack
I'm a fat mack, in a handy bag with a snub with 'em
Broads like the way the fat mack do his thug thizzel
When I hit 'em with my love then I got 'em

I'ma hit it from the top, I'ma put it in a bottle
I'ma hit it from the back, the big black Casanova
I'ma put it in your head and I'ma set it on your shoulders
Syrup in the soda, talking bout the Barre

Foreigner car, feeling like a fallen star
'Bout the menage 'tois ain't that what that Pokey said
Never been scared, South side will leave you dead
And call me Big Meaty, call me Big Meaty

Don't come into my room if you ain't gone get freaky
Working on his boys, run through em like a tractor
Out the South side, Moe-Yo make the god damn adapter
I ain't even quit, I'm doing mighty fast

Sitting on glass, Moe-Yo showing my naked ass
It's the Moe-Yo freestyle I'm so throed
South side playa putting it down, cho-cho
Playas get chosen, like M O E

Put it in your middle yes the big body
Riding big tractor, I'm a money stacker
Out the South side Moe-Yo I'm kinda actor

D-Ruff,"[ VERSE 1: Tony Rome ]
16 days and I wake up and I'm outta here
It's been hell since I got in here
Now I'm back on the streets where the problems that I left still remain
Nothing seemed to change
So I'm right back where I started
No j-o-be	 to make ends meet
I'm gettin change on the streets
But this ain't how I planned it, I'm trippin
I can feel myself slippin
From the beginnin I been tryin to get a grip, but I can't grab hold
24 years old and I'm out here on my own
Yo, I'm slowly losin my mind
Nobody knows the pain I been holdin up inside
Buildin up insid is enough shit to hurt ya, it's torture
When your mind tries to desert ya, no one to support ya
For some of y'all life has been a fantasy
And I been livin up in hell, nigga, lookin for my sanity

[ CHORUS: D-Ruff ]
All I want is my sanity
Although it might seem I'm goin insane

[ VERSE 2: Raydog ]
I wake up every morning, nigga, get up
But this time I grab my nine just in case I gotta tear up
Hard times all around
Still I'm surrounded by the stress but I don't never let it keep me down
Make no mistake, I'll be a dog till I die
I'm always livin on the edge and I wonder why
See, motherfuckers want to kill me, but that's aight
Cause when I go in, niggaz still screamin ""RSO""
Until that time I lived my life day for day
Never knowin when another nigga gonna try to (kill Ray)
So now I'm thinkin to myself is it really all worth it
No, better yet, do I deserve this
Way of life I been given, I been livin wrong
All I want to do is see my son grow strong
So please God, watch over my family
Cause when I die, I wannna die with my sanity

[ CHORUS: D-Ruff ]
All I want is my sanity
Although it might seem I'm goin insane

[ VERSE 3: E. Devious ]
It's hard to maintain and keep a sane frame of mind
When my life's like a battery low on alkaline
I be feelin like I be in a room
And all four walls be closin in for doom
I try to escape the mental manslaughter
I feel like that dude when Jaws was in a water
I can't seem to redeem all my traction
Too many trife niggaz around me to be relaxin
Gotta watch those who I'm 'posed to trust
Don't want to but I'll haunt you if I have to bust
To protect my welfare
You clowns tryin to bring me down'll catch hell here
I won't falter, you can't halt a
Devilish mind when I climb behind the altar
People, stay calm, I'll be real brief
I puff weed from the Philly blunt leaf
And if they torment the E any further
Insanity'll be my plea bargain for murder
Born in hell under a spell called calamity
All I want is my sanity

[ CHORUS: D-Ruff ]
All I want is my sanity
Although it might seem I'm goin insane
My whole life's been filled with calamity
So how can I ease the pain",Sanity,1996

Shot my house up on graduation day and damn near killed my first born and my sister 
You gotta make more to play more thats what they told me 
I could give a fuck about you intended cops, thats what my daddy told me 
I put that on my only son, my other seeds 
You fuck with me I gone make your body bleed 
We got some funk with these niggas that cant stick in they chest 
We chief the heat 
The garlic hollow tips with the vest 
Bulletproof ski mask 
Raid they ass like the task 
Get the jewels and the cash and their Adverse class 
To a six foot ditch

And thats the same punk hoe that was ready to snitch 
On your whole team 
For sellin' ounces of cream

We used to live and laugh about tomorrow
Running out of precious time we borrow
And there was you and love was all you wanted
In your heart you'll find where we belong

And she was always there beside me
Reaching out and holding me tonight
If I had a chance I'd tell her a thousand times a day
That I still need you I can hear you

Chorus

After love has come and gone
You wonder what remains
And you will you have the strength to let
Your feelings show again
It's never easy but I tell you
A thousand times a day
That I still need you I can hear you

Chorus(Ã?2)



",Always,2005
D-Side,"I won't forget you, I'll miss you more all the time
But I need yo let you, know that apart you're still mine, because

With everything I ever have, everything I 'll learn on the way,
I'll wipe your tears away
Everything I ever have, everything you'll ever need
Everything you want me to stay
You'll still be mine today I'll wipe your tears away

Chorus:
Crying now, won't drown the love out
I'll wipe your tears away
You and I don't need a goodbye
Don't hide
I'm here tonight so baby don't cry

There's no tomorrow, without you I don't feel the dance
But I need to follow, my own feet to give us a chance, because

All the dreams I ever have, everything I long for today
Might take me far away
All the dreams I ever have, it's not as if I wanna leave
When every last look that you take
Just makes me want to stay please wipe your tears away

Chorus

It's cold and it's lonely tonight

Because everything I ever have, Everything I'll learn on the way
I'll wipe youe tears away

Chorus(Ã?2)



",Baby Don't Cry,2005
D-Side,"Isn't it strange?
Isn't it wrong?
When we've known it for so long
This is insane
We're so right,
But we'll be all alone tonight

And if I tell you girl the moment that I met you
I knew my life would change and now I can't forget you
You're the one believe me now

Chorus:
One more night alone in my bed,
I can't sleep without you
One more night alone in my head,
Can't stop thinking about you.
You're still the one
And I can't live without you
Always the one
We can't have one more night alone

It's not too late
But it's time
That we both made up our minds
It's okay, it's alright,
There's so much more than one more night

And if I tell you girl the moment that I met you
I knew my life would change and now I can't forget you
You're the one believe me now

Chorus

You're still the one
And I can't live without you
Always the one
We can't have one more night alone

Chorus



",One More Night Alone,2005
D-Side,"Hey you what do you say
You found yourself alone today
Did you lose your place in line?

Hey you what do you know,
All messed up no place to go
Do you feel so left behind?

You can't stay
Sleeping on your own again
So close your eyes abd count to ten
The love you need is here again

Chorus:
I'll be your ticket to the final
Junkie to your vinyl
I just wanna be your groupie
You don't need Brother Blaine or Beckham
You shoud just forget them
Baby you're a superstar to me

So come on back look at me
I'm the one who wants to be
The greatest fan you'll ever find

You can't stay
Sleeping on your own again
So close your eyes abd count to ten
The superstar is here again, she's here again She's here again

Chorus

So what if they're super famous
Their 15 minuites are over
And everyone knows
The superstar is here again, she's here again you're here again

Who wants the world if I can't have you to be my love?
Who wants the world if I can't have you to see me through?

Only time can tell you that you've made a big mistake
Now I can't let our time pass me by
I was such a fool to think that I could walk away
When all that really counts is you and I

I've lost everything now
But you could bring it back to me somehow

All the dreams I had lie shattered
I would give the world away
If I could hold in my arms again

Ask ya life what is it willing to sacrifice
Half the night, nigga's said I needed a drug
D you be wilding, but the beat make's me bug
The lab attict, with bad habit's, feeding giraffes cabbage

Ha ha ha ha ha ha I don't think so
Ya mink coat, and stink flow, could sink slo
Drown dave, but I could never cause I found way's

Have megatron, crying and beg the don
To let his arm go or hell get his mom, threaten to set a bomb

You a thug like me

You can catch me green stick it up,
Dick it up,
Cut a nigga shit over 50 bucks,
Need work on the low nigga hit me up,
Never quick enough after pickin up,
Feds on a nigga block ridiculous,
'cause the game done brought all our shit to us,
I done bit the dust-countinus
Now I ride double ? to the ind you bust, 
Oh no wrong move if my ind you touch,
17 but its real when you playin with much,
One in the chamber on the table when you chillin for lunch,
And head up with your door open feelin your blunt,
Where I'm from 20 gone by the end of the month,
I get drunk smoke the weed to the end of the blunt,
Make sure 10 shells done been in the pump,
If its on-first draw that's a nigga wit luck,
All niggas playin games start endin em up,
'cause your block young buck will start bendin em up,
As soon as your adrenaline pump,
Make way dear lord 'cause I'm sendin em up

[Chorus x2]
Its all about money,
Gettin major paid,
Stack your cheese in all different ways,
Tote your strap and keep your khakis creased,
Yeah nigga, you a thug like me?

[Verse 2 - D-tay]
They call me D-tays up
Get em up put the aks on,
Let em know we don't play sir,
Anybody in the way gets sprayed brah,
Anybody in the way gets sprayed brah,
Wanna play rough?
Y'all cats wanna play tough
Tay wanna spray stuff, erase stuff
Niggas wanna start shit with they gun then run,
Tay don't wanna chase ya,
Bullets wait ta, replace ya,
Hit em with the shells of the 45,
Make em all duck, with the four-five buck,
Put em all up, 
Got 2 so we got you but we don't give a fuck,
Seals comin gunnin out the cut,
Spittin at you cats,
Spittin 50 rounds like I'm spittin on a track, 
Y'all niggas know that you can't hold that,
Ima spit the gat till the gat click-clat,
Then chit chat,
Niggas gun learn that you beef with this here this heat gone burn,
Ima show ya cats how to bus y'all guns, 
Hit a nigga up and leave his ass left numb,
Don't play with me, 
You know I spray the heat,
The A.K. gun niggas down fatefully,
You think expectfully, just wait and see,
Young buck and D-tay nigga ready to g,
If it pays to be, the boss in the cause,
My gun so big gotta limp when I walk,
Don't talk the talk 'cause T.I.P. we comin,
First go about money

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3 - Young Buck]
Its all bout thuggin, 
Gettin paid and shit,
You either slang the dope or hit major licks, 
That's why all my niggas be sevin bricks,
Y'all gunna see what we workin with,
Not me baby doll, 
I ain't hurtin for shit,
G.S. 400 with a leather kit,
Oh you don't wanna holla?
Well whatever bitch,
Don't say shit when the bezzle flip,
See a nigga tote straps for the hell of it,
I ain't givin a fuck about jealous shit,
And I don't smoke weed for the smell of it,
Just before I kill, I inhale the shit,
You can't trail me bitch I be in 50 states,
Paranoid, with about 50 cakes,
Once a nigga find out its all heart no shake,
That's when I infest the place,
I'm thugged out, 
Up in the drug house,
Got it all-from the beer to a quarter ounce,
We da real ass niggas, all work no slouch,
Can I get that there? all that count,
All they amount,
But when it go down and a nigga make all ya say all that out, 
What you gunna do nigga what you about,
Either ride or die, when I'm raised in the south,
Love the block, when a nigga wake up,
I wash my face and then hug my glock,
Brush my teeth and scream south side,
Smoke a blunt and put on my socks,
But it still don't stop, from dusk to dawn,
A nigga been out here on his own-livin day to day,
See I'm only 17 but a nigga out here just gains farm

Ya'll niggaz wanna know what we did this is what we did nigga

Extended the family world-wide, recruited a couple comrades
I was a chosen one due to my chrome gats
Bad ass lil' nigga wit' a trash bag now I gotta confess it
Every day arrested

Niggaz wanna test this to get at the hoes
So even mamma stay invested, damn that's cold
Bitches seventeen years old, round 100 kilos
Half of y'all pickin' pot out your nose with Afros

Rollin' with the big boys soakin' up game
And we'll be back seat with the Cartier frames
The easier it got nigga the harder it came
But I stayed in the game, that's the heart in this mayne

There'll be hell on earth if I stay in the game

I make one move, hit your block, and your whole spot hot
Uh-huh, if you're lucky have your whole block cocked
Now I ain't sayin that's gon' stop all my niggaz that chop
Cause in they mind, ain't no dyin, niggaz flip to get flopped
Shootin more than 50 shots and my heart catch not
When the gunfire a-start it ain't no callin the cops
Besides, you started beef, I'm just bringin it back
All my niggaz you hunt around so what you packin a gat?
Just leave that where it's at, or leave here on your back
Make one move like you're reachin and I'm leavin you flat
Warnings I'm givin you, but you never did listen
So I'm spittin Smith & Wessons 'til they out of ammunition
I'm clip totin, holdin rollin with my cousin Priest
I'm back, and ridin in the candy painted 'llac
We max, and gettin all these hoes for they cheese
We jack, and gettin all these ballers for they ki's

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Didn't think that I would make it this far, throwin rocks at the pen
Left niggaz layin dead and I did it in sin
And I'd do it again, thugged out 'til the end
Still we gon' keep ridin 'til we caught in the wind

[Rizin Sun]
Nigga I'm gon' make it if I gotta rob and steal
Cock back my grill, let 'em know this burner's for real
When the coast is cleared that's when I plan my escape
Wanted in 50 states, my first shot is debate
Don't be late, Buck we got hits to make
50 is you with me, if they really want me they'd come and get me
Now I'm a fugitive on the run, killers don't leave home
Without the gun, blaze one
They got me nationwide all over the world they tryin to turn me in
But the pearls, I think ahead on that
Fuck the pen, I'm tryin to see my money stacks
If you lookin for me I'm where the ballers at
Drinkin Cristal gettin smoked out
Try not to take the bar out, but they done, tapped my house
I'm goin all out, got me on some major shit
Dressed in black, when I attack, please believe that

[Chorus]

[Young Buck]
I need to get my hands on somethin, I suggest you play it low
Get your last words in when the soldier's rag over my nose
Look the anger done build up, I'm damn near about to blow
Tryin to unhook a time bomb when I'm right at zero
Fuck a stolen vehicle, we gon' pull up in luxury
Bubbilize somethin, survive nigga you're lucky
When shit get ugly, bustin e'rythang that rush me
Swingin this fuckin chopper 'til my arms get musty
This occasion calls for military issue buddy
My fetti took a slight fall now y'all gon' be bloody

So don't go with that, we leave you flat paralyzed from the neck
With a motherfuckin' hole in ya back

And we ain't hard to find we just sleep in the daytime
After the sunshine we duckin' for war time

down at some bar sip lil rum, feelin' kinda lonesome
Mad open off the port hole that made me want to explode one

I chilled continued takin' sips, I knew I was buggin'
Cause I see this chick pass by and had thoughts ah rapin' that
nah my mind was buggin', eased up to the rump
I wanted to exchange some words with this chick
and not come off as being dumb, so I
Settle for the car a little tipsy so I stumbled
Got distracted by a horn goin' off feelin' the conscience rumble
I turned around and see my man Dalow
I peeped him call my man Isley to the car
and ask him where he wanted to go
We all hopped in, inserted some hip hop in his radio's cassette deck
Conversatin' who can have sex best
Gettin' bored circlin' the block
Talkin' about how lovely it would be right about now
to have a chick, workin' the cock
My man Eric said let's go to H-P, no doubt
We haven't even been there lately, yeh we out
I said, I'm gonna have a bitch drinkin' my babies

I'ma show y'all where to go now
Some next chicks suckin' some next dick
We see her face is bangin' so we're tryna find out if the rest is
She steps up, get a good glimpse of her breast-eses
Pulled her shirt back down
reaches for the door handle then exits from out the vehicle
Tellin' her home gal, here we go we got some customers
I said, how much would it be for up-in-yas?
So we started negotiatin' prices
I said chill what if you 5-0, and you tryna arrest me
Let's see some titties or somethin'

Let's break it up yo them niggaz seem to be frontin'
I said yo, if you show us somethin' it's on
She flashed a left breast
Had us open askin' if she accepts checks
Makin' em laugh, anything to get there face in the grass
She smiled slightly, sayin' that, all they accept is cash
Chargin' thirty bucks a blow, twenty if it's three sucks or more
I was broke and my man spotted me the dough
So we, parked by the curb
Three of my peeps stepped outta the car
While me and my boy where patiently awaitin' to get served

"D. ""Dyme-a-Duzin"" Blocker","Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Sound of Silence,1994

Meus olhos não veem a minha direção
Da minha boca saem coisas sem sentido
Você era o meu farol e hoje estou perdido

O sofrimento vem à noite sem pudor
Somente o sono ameniza a minha dor
Mas e depois? E quando o dia clarear?
Quero viver do teu sorriso, teu olhar

Eu corro pro mar pra não lembrar você
E o vento me traz o que eu quero esquecer
Entre os soluços do meu choro eu tento te explicar
Nos teus braços é o meu lugar
Contemplando as estrelas, minha solidão
Aperta forte o peito, é mais que uma emoção
Esqueci do meu orgulho pra você voltar
Permaneço sem amor, sem luz, sem ar

Perdi o jogo e tive que te ver partir
E a minha alma, sem motivo pra existir
Já não suporto esse vazio, quero me entregar
Ter você pra nunca mais nos separar
Você é o encaixe perfeito do meu coração
O teu sorriso é chama da minha paixão
Mas é fria a madrugada sem você aqui
Só com você no pensamento

When the D called me, and told me, we must be
Lyrically, the best that he says, the
K N O see K, and S and K, it's spray
Comin away, the B.T.J., it be they
I'mma hold it down, wit sounds
Like clowns, walk the trey pound
Now in the underground, B.T.J. just entered
Remember, the S comes last like December
Once shit cock it's time to Rock like the Monsta
In reality, B.T.J., is lyrically responsible for all difficulties

Hittin yo wit mind craftin, flows to molecular cord graphin

Aiyo one day it was me and the D
Walkin down the street, some niggas stepped to me
Said are you Lil are-you-T-I-Z
He said I heard you nice on the muthafuckin M-I-see
Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book wit my lyrics I'm endin this""
(No question) All this shit he poppin in my ears
Fuckin ejected, he can't hang wit my style
Look now, here's man fillin it, back to like what I was sayin
I start extortin, I'm not playin
You want Lil Knock? I come on your block
Cock and then start sprayin, lyrics
So don't start what you can't finish

Physically you dead wit the push of this button
Explosion be corruptin, from the expert of execution
I met Lil Knock at the junction
He was talkin about walkin, to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin about ""Where the two glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do wit my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick wit the mic device""
Drivin off, said ""Have a good night""
Personally I might, and all that shit I said was a psych'

I'm just happy to be here!

[E-40 over singer]
Hard times, the struggle
The ups and downs, the highs and the lows
You know just goin through it man, ghetto politics
Tryin to make a way out of no way
I was the oldest, so I had to be, the daddy of the family
Momma had to work three jobs, oooh

Feet stickin through my shoes, skid marks in my drawers
Garage sales and flea markets, we never shopped at malls
No dental plan, no medikit - we poor like rain
Colored folks think that castor oil cures everythang
Pork chops and chicken, we like our food fried
Hypertension, Prenavil pills and hydro-chlorizide
Some of my family still living, some of my family died
Health complications, natural causes and homicide
Just tryin to survive, nothin to lose but plenty to gain
Started hustlin, flea flickin and servin that candy cane
Put all my cars in my lady name, as a true hustler should
She had a 9 to 5, worked at Planned Parenthood
While I was in the hood, up to no good
With a hoodie over my head, tryin to outslick the feds
Or should I say cops, at this point in time I only had rocks
Went from a little a jelly jar up to a soup pot
The fast quarter my negro, don't want the slow nickel
I done seen yola the same color as peanut brittle
I done seen hella people relapse
I done seen my homey grandparents go back to crack
How sick is dat? Beggin my loved ones to send some pictures
Pray for me over the phone and read me some scriptures
Oooh; it's gloomy out here, dark days ahead
God got my back but the devil he want my head

[Chorus: D.D. Artis]
I'm just happy to be here right now
Lot of my folks been locked up or laid down
See I'm sayin I ain't shed no tears, no
But I'm just happy to be here

[E-40]
Listen to this, oooooh
The devil-me side know that some of y'all done seen it
Somebody's momma washin her son or her daughter's bloodstain off the cement
Wrong place at the wrong time, infiltrators drop a dime
Mistaken identity, bullets start flyin
In every direction, hit a pregnant teen, she passed
But her baby live through a see-section
I know it sound foul and sound hecka rude, it ain't cool
But it go down like that sometime when you're funkin, and you're puttin down a move
We heartless and shrewd in this day and age, it ain't the same
Our parents need to beat us with a belt, like Poody Tang
I be high like an airplane
I be smokin and perkin, takin out anger and stress on the wrong person
Re-uppin and coppin turf an' just servin the soil block
Grittin tryin to put some gifts in my kid's Christmas stock'
Ooooh - pour out some liquor and shed a tear
For the homies that never made it and family that ain't here

[Chorus]

So happy
You know I'm happy to be
Said I'm happy, so happy just to be here

D. Deezer,"I would take the stars
Out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling
If you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Your wish is my command
I could move a mountain when
Your hand is in my hand
Words cannot express
How much you mean to me
There must be some other way
To make you see
If it takes my heart and soul
You know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess
I'd gladly sacrifice

Oh you to me are everything
The sweetest song
That I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you I guess
I'm just a clown
Who picks you up
Each time you're down
Oh baby, oh baby
You give me just
A taste of love to
Build my hopes upon
You know you got
The power boy
To keep me holding on
So now you got
The best of me
Come on and
Take the rest of me
Oh baby

Though you're close to me
We seem so far apart
Maybe given time
You'll have a change of heart
If it takes forever boy then
I'm prepared to wait
The day you give your love to me
Won't be a day too late

Oh you to me are everything
The sweetest song
That I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you I guess
I'm just a clown
Who picks you up
Each time you're down
Oh baby, oh baby
You give me just
A taste of love to
Build my hopes upon
You know you got
The power boy
To keep me holding on
So now you got
The best of me
Come on and

D. Foster,"Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

And after all that you've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise you
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to kept away
Not for a day, from your body
(baby, I can't live without you, not even day)
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away from the one that I love

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say, I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise you
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go",Hard to Say I'm Sorry,2001
D. Gasparyan,"I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now 
I've got to live",Freedom,1998
D. Horne,"Everytime I think of you, I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
And I'm wonderin' why you left
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what I might say

There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sending out, like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance, stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, I can lie to myself

And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

Ain't missing you, I ain't missing you

My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things

You heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there, so we moved on
To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there, so we moved on

And now we've left Alaska
Because there was no go-old mine
But this time, only two of us moves on
Now all we have is each other
And a little memory to cling to
And still you won't let me go on alone

D. Lindsey,"We always wanted a big two story house
Back when we lived in that little two room shack
We wanted fame and fortune and we'd live life the way the rich folks do
We knew somehow we'd make it, together me and you

With dreams and hopes of things to come we worked and never stopped
Not much time for you and me, we had to reach the top
We bought that big two story house and soon became the envy of the town
With all our work behind us we'd finally settled down

Now we live (yes we live) in a two story house whoa, what splendor
But there's no love about

I've got my story and I've got mine, too
How sad it is, we now live in a two story house

The house is filled with rare antiques, there's marble on the floor
Beauty all around us like we've never seen before
There's chandeliers in every room, imported silks and satin all about
We filled the house with everything but somehow left love out

Now we live (yes we live) in a two story house, oh what splendor
But there's no love about

Amor sin desengaño

Querer es admitir que tienes que sufrir

Tal vez te has encontrado
Con un amor sincero
Pero no estés confiado corazón
Tarde o temprano llorarás

En contra de un cariño

Que juega por capricho
Con nuestro gran dolor

That would've crippled most men

Soak it up just so I can spit it

How can you understand me
I don't fucking understand myself
How can you even help me

I fight to control it

Decimate my enemies
Slow torture, bottomless pain

Where no one is safe

A deadly viper
In the skin of a normal man

The eyes of a snake see visions of the end
I fall like the night and take you down with me

The beast is unleashed
Upon victims verse after verse

And the violence pours out like a curse
In the day I seem normal
And I smile and joke and laugh
When I write late at night
I'm a murdering sociopath

D. Thomas,"Die Sonne zieht an mir vorbei, obwohl sie eigentlich steht,
während die Welt an ihr vorbei so langsam untergeht.
Und wenn es dann dämmert und die Nacht erwacht,
Beginnt ein Untergang, der jedem Tag das Leben nimmt.
Was diese Welt am Tag verneint, lädt sie des Nachts ein
Und einer ihrer Schatten wird von mir gemacht sein.
Dunkle Seiten seiner Seele bietet jeder zum Tausch
Unter Menschen, die sich suchen und nichts finden als Rausch.
Die nach mir greifen und mitunter kriegen sie mich zu fassen,
zieh'n mich runter in den Bunker voller dunkler Grimassen.
Hier kann ich Grenzen überwinden und meine Seele verwetten
Oder einen Engel finden und mich retten.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier...
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.

Kann dir die Möglichkeit, die Sonne nicht mehr aufgehn zu sehn,
einem die Lust am Leben nehmen?
Ich teil' mit jedem heute Nacht den Ballast und das Elend uns'rer Not
In der Angst vor dem Leben und dem Tod.
In diesem lebenslangen Kampf, der krank macht und Kraft raubt,
Häng ich an allem, was mich schwach macht und aussaugt.
Wehr' mich dagegen, anzunehmen, was weh tat
Und niemals zuzugeben, dass ich jemals falsch lag.
Doch wenn es wahr ist, dass man erst durch Fehler vollkommen wird
Und dass wer aus Angst am Leben hängt sich vollkommen irrt,
Dann ist der Schmerz loszulassen, wohl nichts gegen den Schmerz,
Wenn einem alles genommen wird.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.

In einer stürmischen Nacht erlöschen Träume wie Kerzenlicht
Und wer nicht von Herzen spricht, trägt einen Schmerz in sich,
Hüttet und versteckt ihn hinter tausend Ausreden.
Ich sollte beten, aber irgendwas spricht dagegen,
Ich will vergeben, denn der Zweifel ersticht mein Leben,
Ich kann nicht glauben, meine Liebe zerbricht am Ego.
Ich will vertrauen und ich weiß nicht mehr, wie das gehen soll,
Ich seh kein Morgengraun, nein, ich seh nur dichten Nebel.
Ich bin am Boden geknebelt und fast zu Tode getreten.
Doch hab nicht vor so zu enden, ich hab nicht vor, aufzugeben.
Ich werde dieses Leben ändern und ich werd's überleben,
Ein neuer Morgen wird kommen und er bringt Hoffnung für jeden,
Der neu geboren unter Schmerzen aus dem Koma erwacht,
Damit das Feuer des Herzens auf ein Neues entfacht.
Das hat das Leben jeden Tag in diesen Händen verbracht,
Damit das Licht der Nacht ein Ende macht.

Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Du bist nicht allein, ich bin immer hier, um da zu sein.
Es liegt nur an dir.",Die Nacht...du Bist Nicht Allein,2006

Like this games new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry and all them fuckin' shopping sprees

See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just play your part
Just play your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part

I'm incline with women who come on they time
She came over and she came a few times
From crispy futons to Christian Louboutin
Game over had her shopping in Milan
Twenty racks really that's sneaker money
Triple white Ferrari yeah that's the Easter bunny
At the Caesar in Vegas yeah I put the Visa on it
Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
And I let her spend a half the ticket give or take
A couple dollars Harry Winston stone collars
Canary yellow everything plane chartered
I spoiled her maybe 'cause I adored her
More than fly that girls a flying saucer
My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
And she said the love of picture just roll the dice

[Chorus]

I try to love 'em in the physical not literal
She said that she love me but what I'm feeling is minuscule
I understand that Prada lives in her inner soul
So the devil that droves in her got in control
Anne Hathaway, and sack chasin' getting got cake up
Though my paper way thicker than model make up
But ya'll wait up my mind racing my toe slippin'
A lot of women is real some bitches Robin Givings
I never give 'em no liquid no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I'm pitchin' bitches that's dreamin' thinking I'm trickin' chicken
I'm simply fuckin' with bitches that know they whole position
That's real nigga shit
Real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I ain't tryna fight, I ain't tryna fuss
I trying for the money, they tryna fall in love.

[Chorus]

I say, how can they compare to you
Everything material
Trickin' shit for kids and you know I don't need no cereal
You know I was ridin' and you switched up a gear or two
So I let others shit you on dead, burial
Funeral, check my phone, reacting like its new to you
Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica every weekend honey moon and you
Like the sound and I ain't ever try tuning you
But now I'm just assuming you
Living off of hearsay
Treble like the radio 'cause everything was air play
First class herm ass
Panamera perp pass
Greed written on her face
When I bought her first bag
And I ain't really give a fuck
It was like a nigga rushed
Told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up
She call me daddy like a nigga puff
Just play your role and you can live it up

So where you at why'all?
 Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear
So where you at why'all?
 Right here, if you represent then throw your hands in the air

Hear my synopsis, I drop this
Generates thoughts of born-awareness of the here-and-now
Buildin a poem with many spearin out
Society inflaws unjust laws remain the voided common cause
Equality rules you to love that equality
Many's law to trust this
Act of the devil possess the sword of justice
Take the devil's head through levels and bad truth can spread to mental dead

Imagine us traveling back to Nazareth
 Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
 When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
 No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall of the ledge
And blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

As we struggle in the jungle of sin, my thoughts are militant
Destroyin the ignorance, buildin the innocent
Teachin infants infinite knowledge
That wasn't taught in high schools or college
My representation is with the thirty million man destination
Washington, D.C., war with the masons
The only celebration is Satan's elimination
The past education at the present is revelations
The future's our creation, elevation of the nation

[Chorus]

Yo around Red (16) October
BROOKLYN ZOO attack like cobra
Killin warrior soldiers in D.C., you face Jehovah all over
The darkside, I ride tracks to provide
Elementive intelligence while you fake MC's hide
LEFT RIGHT as I command all my sons 'cause I'm grand
(Pull his head, snatch land) See if I slide through the sand
Snakin those who choose to fake moves on Zoo, ya get bruised
(Bring ya crew) Opposin the chosen son of God, you get scarred hard

Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene nahmean?
But I've been knockin em out the box like ????
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
And mould me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart with the million man march

D.C Lee,"[Chorus x 2] 
What's the question?  
Why are you flexin'?
Here's the answer; choice of weapons

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, The Remainz, kid, why you flexin like a bicep?
Heat on your hip just to get a rep; it ain't worth it 
Just because you pack a biscuit doesn't mean you can't 
Become another statistic; you figure it 
Life's a gamble even for vandalz; I handle mine with minds 
Only unless my chest is under pressure in a contest 
The fear of layin' in wreck causes the stress 
I have to adjust to this mess and pull when it's best

[Guru] 
Yo, little big man, feelin' your oats because you're strapped? 
Bustin' a cap at another kid who's black? 
It ain't all that when the shots are flyin' back 
You made a choice, and the choice you made was whack 
Kinda tipsy, with the liquid confidence 
Pullin' your pistol when it doesn't make sense 
To be the bigger man you figure 
But in the end, it don't pay when you're livin' by the trigger

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
Yeah, it's the master of the who, what, where, and the why 
But, still, I got a problem with seein' my brothers die 
I've been around and lived past the average age of us 
In every obituary, a full page of us 
The game is money, but what about inner wealth? 
The mental, the spiritual, and physical health 
But still, everyday, the city is a test 
That's why some people feel a gun is the best

[Stikken Moov 2] 
No doubt I pack protection, but every altercation 
Or situation doesn't deserve blastin'; I mastered precisions 
Choice of weapon - should I peel or peel out? 
My choice of routes may decide my whereabouts

[Chorus x 2]

[Stikken Moov 2] 
I pack no weapons then the seargeant bargin in 
Ready to bomb a rapper like Saddam, Stikken Moov swarm 
Ready to bust off, like Ron Jeremy, but I chill, G 
Relax and consider lucky to live to see a quarter past three

[Guru] 
That's why I wield the steel; yes, my microphone is crazy real 
I'm not the one sellin' out to get the mass appeal 
But jail cells are filled with my peeps 
While the rest are gettin' killed in these ill-ass streets 

[Chorus x 2]

[Guru] 
So, pick your weapon - a mic or a gun 
I make a sucker run when my tongue stuns; check it 
Leavin' the spot, I seen some wild kids 
One stepped to me, asked me to freestyle, kid 
Meanwhile he flexed a burner on his side 
I looked him in the eye, smiled, and walked to my ride 
He was actin' kinda hard on the surface 
I said to myself that it really wasn't worth it

[Stikken Moov 1] 
Yo, you think you're all that, 'cause you pack heat? 
Seein' your own brother play the concrete in defeat 
Tryin' to prove yourself while you put the next man down 
But what goes around, comes back, black; best believe that

[Chorus x 2]

You know what I'm sayin'? 
That's all the real heads all over the world 
That realize that this music is real 
That we keep it real like that 
Peace to all my brothers on the third 
And all the real brothers in hip-hop 
It's like a rap's new generation thing, baby 
Peace to Guru

If I, if I have been unkind,
I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung

D.H.T.,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth...

And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say ""come dance with me""
And murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems at seventeen... 

A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said: ""Pity please the ones who serve
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly... 

So remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
In debitures of quality and dubious integrity
Their small-town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen...

To those of us who knew the pain
Of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
the world was younger than today
when dreams were all they gave for free
to ugly duckling girls like me...

We all play the game, and when we dare
We cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
That call and say: ""Come on, dance with me""
And murmur vague obscenities
At ugly girls like me, at seventeen...

[Baby Solider] 

I'm Baby Soilder 

I done told ya

I'm getting colder 

I'm putting 20's on a rover 

Money spending windows tinted 

My cousin see told me if it ain't tru i can't get up in it 

We on the rise we got the shine 

Where y'all stay broke niggas slang nickels and dimes 

We outstand it, we should've planned it 

Moving birds everyday niggas we taking chances,we taking chances 



Chorus Repeat 4x 



[D.I.G.] 

First of all I got my niner, she's my body breeder 

And every time that I squeeze she screams like Anita 

That's why I keep her to my motherfucking waist line 

In case one of you niggas try and take mines, thugged out 

And I'm leaving your set with my guns out 

And it ain't no love know 

I'ma about bust your your shit and watch you drown 

And your heart stop 

And know you feel the pain coming from my glock 

And that's what you get for trying to hit my motherfucing block 



Chorus Repeat 2x 



[Reginelli]

And for all them niggas that oppose me you better bring help 

I'm like pork chops and pork and beans I'm bad for your health 

This niggas a devil 

The fatal thought sank in my mind

We on enemy lines so I'ma ride tonight",Never,1999

D.I.G.,"[Chorus: x2]
We goin' die thuggin', cause that's just the life we lead
We goin' die thuggin', busting at our enemies

[Verse 1: Sam]
Busting at our foes, for the sake of being riders
Till the casket close, thug shit be inside us
We try to survive it, cause all we got is the projects
On the camouflage sets, in the bricks, niggas die wet
Till the death for street glory, it's infinite beef
Though it's most of the reasons lot of niggas six deep
With heat, when we ride, we 'posed to roll that way
To keep a soul that way, with 44's that spray
The key to the city, it come in bricks or them birds
Thug niggas, drug dealers making flipping that 3rd
Born to my work, deserve what's supposed to be mine
If it's what the fuck we need 
Then D, we 'posed to be ride
Try to separate us, but it's survival of a thug
While you try to play us, now you gotta watch my slugs
Ride wit us, die wit us, follow us to the war
We got five on the weed and we blowing inside of the car

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: D.I.G.]
Y'all niggas better I'ma die for this shit that I need
I've been committed too long for me not to succeed
I been in greed my whole life 
And caught up in the weed
Hustling with thugs and everyday, go to sleep
Keeping the guns cocked
Surrounding the block, opening up shop
With a bundle of rocks in my socks
Niggas wann beef
If it come to that dogg, I'm down with it
Stank a lick for the fetti
Get the cash and clown with it
Hennessy and weed when I'm comin'
Throw your guns up, let me see
If you bitch ass niggas gon make some noise bruh
Follow me now cause I'm coming up
And ain't that cold I got too many bitches running up
And niggas wanted to blast me, police harass me
If I slip in the street
I really think them niggas'll snatch me
Like I'm faking the game
But taking the pain letting them niggas know
How I'm shaking the game with nothing to explain

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: C-Murder]
We goin' die thuggin', we ride or die, stay mugging
And busting, and flooding many bullets in your cousin
Survive or not, any block I hit is hot
Ask them warlocks shit, them hard-knocks give me props
Like them Melphomine boys 
I got them toys that'll split ya
With enough ammo for every nigga that's with ya
I hit ya sun up or sundown it don't matter
As long as my motherfuckin' pockets get fatter
Bitch ass niggas on the edge they bout to fall
You want to brawl, I make a motherfucking call
And kill y'all shit, that's what I said and I meant it
That was your last dollar and you spent it, ya heard me
You 45 cent ass nigga, I make mills
Your bets to chill before you get your shit spilled
Lil' daddy I hope you make the right decision
I know some that'll have your ass missing

[Chorus: x4]",Ride,2000
