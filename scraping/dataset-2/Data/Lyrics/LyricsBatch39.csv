Charlie Parker,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,2006
Charlie Parker,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

The fact is the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?",Nice Work If You Can Get It,2006
Charlie Parker,"Baby here I stand before you 
With my heart in my hand 
I put it to you mama 
Hoping that you'll understand 

Oh, baby 
Mama, please don't dog me 'round 
Yeah, I would rather love you, baby 
Than anyone else I know in town 

This is my confession, mama 
And it's sung by all your song 
It proves that I'm in heaven, mama 
When you hold me in your arms 

Well, baby 
Can I have you for myself 
Yeah, if I can't have you, baby 
I don't want nobody else 

Well, baby 
Don't you want a man like me 
Well, baby 
Don't you want a man like me 
Yeah, think about your future, baby 
Forget about your used to be",Confessin' the Blues,2011
Charlie Parker,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house so lovely
Near to the sun in a day, near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way, dear

Living our love in memory
Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die; we'll keep it that way
Up among the stars we'll find

A harmony of life, too lovely tune

Charlie Parker,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April [Takes 1 & 2 (False Start)] [Alternate Take][Take],2015
Charlie Parker & His Orchestra,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",Almost Like Being in Love,1990
Charlie Parker & His Orchestra,"I've been around the world in a plane
Settled revolutions in Spain
The North Pole I have charted
But can't get started with you
And at the golf course I'm under par
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star
I've got a house and a show place
But can't get no place with you

You're so supreme
The lyrics I write of you
Dream, dream, day and night of you
Scheme just for the sight of you
Baby but what good dose it do
I've been consulted by Franklin D.
Even Gabel had me to tea
But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you

But now I'm broken hearted
Can't get started with you",I Can't Get Started,1990
Charlie Parker & His Orchestra,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",If I Love Again,1990
Charlie Parker & His Orchestra,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night [Take 1][#],1990
Charlie Parker & His Orchestra,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks [Take 1][#],1990
Charlie Parker & His Orchestra,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,1990
Charlie Parker & His Orchestra,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?

",A Night in Tunisia,2011
Charlie Parker Quartet,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,

The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1975

Charlie Parker Quartet,"This isn't sometimes, this is always.
This isn't maybe, this is always.
This is love,
The real beginning of forever,
This isn't just mid summer madness,
A passing glow, a moment's gladness,
Yes it's love.
I knew it on the night we met,
You tied a string around my heart,
So how can I forget you.

With every kiss I know that
This is always.

Yes it's love.

Charlie Parker Quartet,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love,2002

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,2002
Charlie Parker with Strings,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2006
Charlie Parker with Strings,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2013
Charlie Parker with Strings,"You came, I was alone
I should have known you were temptation
You smiled, luring me on
My heart was gone, you were temptation
It would be thrilling 
If you were willing
If it can never be
Pity me for you are temptation and I am yours

Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation
You were born to be kissed
I can't resist.

You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart, take it and say
We'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you, temptation",Temptation,2013

I discovered Daddy's tools
and amassed a small pile, of scrap lumber
and I built a rabbit box
and i set it facing north
but i caught a possum and a kitten
both of which were a bitch to set free
cause I thought they were going to bite me
but we all three escaped safely

well once I took my single shotgun
and put on my camouflage
and hid in the neighbour's pasture by the little cow pond
and finally after a long time
a bunch of doves flew by
and landed in a huddle on the power line
and so I aimed with an eagle's eye and fired
but it was two pigeons that fell like bean bags into the weeds
well they sure looked like doves to me

Charlie Paxson,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

All along the streets, every one of them looks the very same

Charlie Persip,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,

Take the place of sand and skies
All the World forgotten
In one Woman's smile

One alone, to be my own
I alone, to know her caresses
One to be, eternally
The one my worshiping soul possesses

And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue

Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes

Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said ""Whatever"" cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up

Uh, she just wanted to be popular

But, them drunk nights are more fun than sober ones

If I listened to my Uncs, all them older ones
They all talk about karma, how it slowly comes (uh)

Spend my bank account tonight and have to borrow funds

If I had a shot less, then I might pass
But, I'm faded and I got a little sedated

She got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
Hoop earrings, some bitch left on my nightstand
Cussed me out and stormed off like ""Alright then"" (uh)

Why do people do things that be bad for 'em?
Say we done with these things, then we ask for 'em

And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels

A new born baby (haha Yeaahh)
I was once lost but now I’m found

Father please help me with the lyrics at hand
I don’t wanna misrepresent the miracle man
But I gotta dedicated a very special song
To the one who gave me everything and kept me strong
From a child you protected me and I kept you busy
Sold so many times that it missed me
Thank you for my mom, my abuela and others
My babies, my lady and the worlds best brother
My friends, my fans, I call it my family
Everything good that I got, you handed me
My only big sister, she’s on top of my list
She taught me how to write poems and now it’s my gift
Her hand was heavenly
Since 1970
Every hug, every kiss, every book she read to me
My dad might of left but he was always around
He became my best friend, I will die for him now

I’m writing mine down I’m on 103
And I can keep on going till the end of my life
An incredible sight
An unforgettable ride
And it still ain’t over
Tho I’m deep in the struggle
You can still see my feet while I sleep on the rubble
Your boy still breathing and I ain’t trying to be even
Cause everything happens in this life for a reason
My heart is healing and my mind is seeking
My eyes are blinking and my rhymes are reaching
Every soul that is lost there is hope on the cross
People walk away like they don’t know what it cause
And I’m not saying that I’m any better than you
You will see for yourself if you stepped in my shoes
I ain’t blind but it’s times, I’m too stupid to see
But I just wanna show what Gods doing for me

I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier
And it sets my spirit free

We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby
I was once lost but now I’m found

We all face obstacles and difficult times
We try to resolve them with our physical minds
Sometimes you gotta give us unreasonables
To him whom makes end possibilities possible
I know that it’s easier said then done
But just try your best and the rest will come
They gave me 45 long years up in prison
But I never let the tears interfere with my vision
I keep on moving, I can see things changing
I feel my soul strengthening and it keeps me patient
Knowing that I’m loved in a world so crooked
Jesus Christ died so the rest of us wouldn’t
There is only one truth and a zillion lies
That truth is NOT just for biblical times
And tonight, before I lay my head to sleep
Imma pray for the angels he sent to me

I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier

Oh, and it's so hard, she starts coming on
I back it on up, turn it around and take it on home

Sometimes I've gotta go out of town
I'll be gone for a couple of days
And this buddy of mine he's a hound in the first degree

And almost always there's the ladies
And it ain't easy there out and alone
But I back it on up, turn it around, take it on home

I take it on home to a woman who sticks by me
'Cause I believe she'd do the same if she was me
And I wouldn't know where to turn to if she was gone
So when I ain't working, I don't hang out I take it on home
I back it on up, turn it around and take it on home

And staggered all around
I've heard a scream and saw the car
That knocked him to the ground

A silver haired ol' lady rushed to him
And raised his head
He must have thought she was his mama
Because these words he said

Mama, my wife has gone and left me
Mama, she left with my best friend
Mama, I was coming home to tell you
So mama, take me home
And help me live and love again

I saw him laying there, his broken body wrecked with pain
I wanted so to help him but I was too ashamed
He rolled his head from side to side, struggling for his life
You don't know how I felt 'cause I'm the friend that took his wife

That she'll forgive him 
And she'll believe he's changed his ways

He deposits hi-is last dime

And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby Mcgee,2006
Charlie Rich,"You followed me to Texas
You followed me to Utah
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

You went with me to Alabama
And things looked good in Birmingham
We didn't find it there
So, we moved on

I know you're tired of following
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams

You had my child in Memphis
Then I heard of work in Nashville
But we didn't find it there
So we moved on

To a small farm in Nebraska
To a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there
So we moved on

Now we've left Alaska
Cause there was no gold there
But this time
Only two of us moved on

Now all we have is each other,
And a little memory to cling to
Still you won't let me go
Go on alone

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor and I love you.
You have made me what I am, and I am yours.
My love, there's so many ways I want to say I love you.
Let me hold you in my arms forever more.
You have gone and made me such a fool.
I'm so lost in your love.
And oh, we belong together,
Won't you believe in my song?
Lady, for so many years I thought I'd never find you.
You have come into my life and made me whole.
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning.
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear.
In my eyes I see no one else but you.
There's no other love like our love.
And yes, oh yes, I'll always want you near me.
I've waited for you so long.

Charlie Rich,"You've painted up your lips
And rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating
Going out somewhere
The shadow on the wall
Tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

It wasn't me
That started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go
And do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that
I'm not the man I used to be
Oh, Ruby I still need some company

Its hard to love a man 
Whose legs are bent and paralysed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age 
Ruby I realize,
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I not around
Oh Ruby
Don't take your love to town

She's leaving now cause
I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it
Some 100 times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun
And put her in the ground

It was here on Madena that we made our home
The year 1850 and I sent for my girl
Oh Fraulein, come meet me in this brand new world

Me and my cousins decided we'd run
Up through Louisianan to meet up with Grant
But one hundred damn rebels shot us there in the sand

And the life they was livin' was shot all to hell
But we ain't seen nothin' no different than dust
Sept the wheels on the wagon all covered with rust

And I wondered if I could kill kin with my gun
But we sat there in Paris in a little cafe
And as they toasted Truman, I drifted away

About some old city that ain't even there

And the frost on the windshield shines toward the sky
Like a thousand tiny diamonds in the lights of loving county

When in walked a woman, looking richer than sin
And ten years worth of work on her hand

Well, I followed her home and when she was alone
Well, I put my gun to her head
And I don't recall what happened next at all
But now that rich woman, she is dead

Ten miles from my sweet baby's arms
And the moon is so bright it don't look like night
And the diamond how it sparkles in the lights of loving county

And I put that ring in her hand
Then she said, ""I do"" and she'd leave with me soon

And wait 'til the timing was good
And I drove back home and I was alone
'Cause I thought that she understood

The next night an old friend just called me to wish us both well
He said, he'd seen her downtown, sashaying around
And her diamond how it sparkled in the lights of loving county

Well that sheriff, he found me out wandering
All around El Paso the very next day
You see, I'd lost my mind on that broken white line
Before I even reached Balmorhea

Well, now she's in Fort Worth and she's just giving birth
To the son of that oil company man
And they buried that poor old sheriff's dead wife
With the ring that I stole on her hand

And sometimes they let me look up at that East Texas sky
And the rain on the pines, oh Lord, how it shines
Like my darling's little diamond in the lights of loving county",Loving Country,1998
Charlie Robison,"I will see you in the morning
When the moonlight leaves the trees
But I will always feel the embers
Of the flames in Tennessee

I was sleeping when they came knocking
They said boy you better leave
Said South Nashville is rocking
And they can't get no relief

So I run and put my pants on
And I run to get my car
But the flames they was a rising
And I didn't get to far

There was a black man on the corner
He said boy just turn away
I got a gun here in my pocket
And I will take your life away

So I showed the man your picture
And I said we had a son
And I was just up here from Texas
I wasn't hurting anyone

So I run out to the highway
And I finally caught a ride
With some white trash outta towner
With his wife and kids inside

So I sit here on the roadside
And I talk to your machine
I can see the flames a rising
Over Nashville Tennessee

Well, don't go out looking on your TV
They gonna keep this all discreet
They will never tell the secrets
Of the flames in Tennessee

You know I hope she don't discover
That this all was all just a lie
But If I don't get home to see her
Then my heart will surely die

I will see you in the morning
When the moonlight leaves the trees
But I will always feel the embers
Of The flames in Tennessee
The night they burned down Nashville Tennessee",Molly's Blues,1998
Charlie Robison,"Well, I had a buddy back in '81,
And we made ourselves a pact.
We were headin' for the new pipeline,
We were never comin' back.
Well we worked 80 hours making time and a half,
But La Grange was too damn hot.
We drove back home at the end of that week
And we spent it all on pot.

So I'll see you in Houston,
If I ever get out that way,
I'll see you in Dallas,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowing down,
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.

Well, I played ball every single fall,
I could run just like the wind.
Went to college like they asked me too
But they didn't ask my friends.
Don't think I seen a single classroom,
But I drank a lot of beer.
My buddies still love to listen to me when I talk about that year.

[Chorus]

Now I got myself a little band,
And we're pretty good I guess
But I never learned how to wear my hair,
And I never learned how to dress.
So I'm leaving for the last time honey,
I'm never more to roam.
Gonna pack my bags a little heavy this time gonna head my ass back home.

So I'll see you in Nashville,
If I ever get out that way.
I'll see you in Austin,
But I won't have long to stay,
If you're ever out west son,
And you're feeling like slowin down.
I'll see you around,
Around my hometown.

Charlie Robison,"Well, I wish I had my picture on The Rolling Stone today
I wish that The Enquirer spread a rumor that I was gay
Well, I wish I had some buddies, some movie stars and such
'Cause I probably wouldn't worry about the two of us as much

And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine
And I would not remember how you broke my heart today

You know I, I wish I had a super model so skinny and so wild
And a waitress in Nevada, she says she's carrying my child
Well I'd drive down Sunset Boulevard, my hair blowin' in the wind
And I'd stop at fancy restaurants and they'd finally let me in

And I'd spend all my money on caviar and cocaine

Charlie Robison,"My name is John O'Reilly 
And my father worked the fields
In the hills of old Kilarny
Where I helped him turn the wheels
My arms grew hard as iron for a boy of 17
And I used my fists for gambling in those wet Kilarny streets

Well the ship left for America and I brought my pack aboard
Said goodbye to my dear Ireland said a prayer to my dear Lord
I fought those sorry guineas in the kitchen they called hell
I fought them for their dollar and those guineas paid me well

[Chorus]
Fair thee well fair Dover
Fair thee well your seasons turn
For my pockets will be jingling on the day of my return
The day of my return

I fought in New York City and I fought the Jersey shore
My gut stayed full of whiskey and my bed stayed full of whores
They called my right a cannonball and my left they called the same
I left em' all lyin' half in blood and half in shame

I met a man on '32 and he stuck out his hand
And he offered me a thousand if I'd fall before his man
I said it could be done but only for another two
He smiled at me and nodded as I stuck it in my shoe

[Chorus]

They rang the bell two times before I let him have my nose
And I let him work my left until my eye was swollen closed
Then I let loose a right that they still talk about today
For that guinea didn't know that I had bet the other way

They covered every dock and every port there on the coast
Looking for that double crosser who had turned into a ghost
But I was on a train my friend that rode the other way
And i'll sail from California back to Dublin one fine day",John O'Reilly,2000
Charlie Robison,"[Chorus]
Well they call me the life of the party
They call her the belle of the ball
Well we start before anybody
And I promise we'll outlast them all

Well it started when I was in high school
My mom and my dad taught me well
A bottle of wine at Thanksgiving
And a valum when Grandma raised hell
Sso I had some champaigne at a wedding
I belive that they called it Cold Duck
And they girl I'd been eyeing all evening
She took me round back and we sucked down the rest of that bottle
And things really started to click
Well we kissed on the boxes of liquor
And she reached down and grabbed her some dickle and added some cola
Far be it for me should I pass
For I thought that if I drank another
I'd certainly need me some Aspirin on the next morning
I'd tried not to make me a sound
'cause the girl who was sleeping beside me had gained herself two-hundred
Pounding on my bedroom window
My Dad yelled to jump out of bed
But she woke up from all the commotion
Insisting she'd give me some headlines she'd read in the paper
She said it had been yesterday
They said if you use moderation
My mornings could all be this way

Charlie Robison,"Well, I hear that old John Deere tractor
At the low water bridge
Pulling the young drinkers across
He's dragging so many on this Saturday night
I can smell that old tractor's exhaust

But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
And the cowboys are fearful the most
But Deena done broke from his ragged old pen
It's making a run for the coast

Well, there's a place down on Main Street
Right across from the bank
Somebody drew one on the line
About twenty foot up on that Frontier Hotel
Where crested back in twenty-nine

Well, this city took most of this little old town
'Cause we live on what they call the flame
Well, I read all about it in the cafe downtown
Where they got that old newspaper frame

But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
The cowboys are fearful the most
But Deena done broke from his ragged old pen
It's making a run for the coast

My grandmother called about ten minutes ago
Like she does almost every night
She said they come home way early from the old rodeo
When a big boat had knocked off the lights

Well, she said a cowboy got buckin'
Just before it went dark
On a boat that they called 'Chequered Tree'
And ain't nobody's saw if he finished his ride
So I guess I'll forget about sleep

But the rain on the roof sounds so pretty
And the cowboys are fearful the most

Charlie Robison,"Well, you are still here
And I am still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
You went a semester to West Texas State
But the freshmen fifteen you gained
Killed all your dates
I guess I still love you if I ever did
And I can see myself having a couple of kids
And we will get by
For the rest of our lives

So play the Cotton-Eyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin

Well, I am still here
And you are still here
Whether I ever loved you is
Not perfectly clear
Though weight's not an issue you have gained more
And when I said I do well I slammed all the doors
To a future where I could see Paris in spring
And I wasn't prepared for the weight of this ring
But we will get by
For the rest of our lives

So play the Cotton-Eyed Joe
For the folks don't you know
Keep the dogs in the truck
Til you leave
We got some wieners and buns
When the brisket's all gone
For our wedding in suburban Seguin

So play some old BTO
For my friends don't you know
Keep your dogs in the truck

Get out the wieners and buns
Cause the briskets all gone

A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm

And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man

And he heard again his mothers words

Leave your guns at home Bill

When he comes home the house is dark
She says 'Baby did you make it alright?'

But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares out alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born

Charlie Rock,"Girl, you gave me all the love a man would ever need 
But all I did was hurt you 
You were always there for me to care for my needs 
And I never said I loved you, I never said I loved you 
So now you're gone, you left me all alone 
I never felt so empty, I know what was wrong 
I took your love for granted baby 
Now I know when you have something good you don't let it go

Oh I've been missing you, missing your love baby 
Since you said goodbye to me girl 
Oh I've been missing you, I'm missing your love 

I always try to hide the way I really feel 
But you opened my eyes girl 
You made me realize I need you in my life 
I really truly love you, I really truly love you 
One more chance, that's all I'm asking for 
And I would never make you walk out the door 
I took your love for granted baby 
Now I know when you have something good you don't let it go 

Oh baby, when you walked away from my arms girl 
Oh I've been missing you, missing your love baby 
Since you said goodbye to me girl 
Oh I've been missing you, I'm missing your love

Baby, yeah 

When I first looked into your eyes 
I saw all the love that you had inside 
I gave you my heart and soul 
And now you say that you want to let go 
You better wake up and realize what you have 
Before you make me a man from your past 
This love is true, this love is hard to find 
So you better keep that in your mind girl 

[Chorus:]
Listen to your heart, don't walk away from love 
Can't you see that would be a mistake girl 
Listen to your heart, don't walk away from love 
I will be the only one you'll be thinking of 
Listen to you heart girl 

You said your love for me has died 
So tell me baby, why these tears in your eyes 
You know that we were meant to be 
But you still want to walk away from me 
You better wake up and realize what you have 
Before you make me a man from your past 
This love is true, this love is hard to find 
So you better keep that in your mind girl

Charlie Rouse,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Charlie Ryan,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot, Rod, Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,1964

Charlie Shavers,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Charlie Shavers,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart

Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

You took my heart and threw my heart away

You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Charlie Shavers,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996

Charlie Shavers,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?

And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss

Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye

Charlie Shavers,"Don't even go to a movie show
If you're not by my side,
I stay home by my radio,
But I'm satisfied!
All my flirtin' days are gone,
On the level from now on!

Don't go for any excitement now,
Books are my best company.
All my opinions have changed somehow,
Old-fashioned as can be!

There's a thrill in solitaire!

Really am in love, and how!
I'm through playing with fire,
It's you whom I desire!

They can't break up our romance!

Charlie Shavers Quintet,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,2002
Charlie Shavers' All American Five,"First you say you do
And then you don't
And then you say you will
And then you won't
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
Now you want to play
And then it's no
And when you say you'll stay

That's when you go
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?
I've been sitting on a fence
And it doesn't make much sense
'Cause you keep me in suspense
And you know it
Then you promise to return
When you don't
I really burn
Well, I guess I'll never learn

And I show it
If you've got a heart
And if you're kind
Then don't keep us apart
Make up your mind
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?",Undecided,1996
Charlie Shavers' All American Five,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

I am his forever more",My Man,1997
Charlie Shavers' All American Five,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Above all, I want my arms about you!

Charlie Shoemake,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no

Whatever else I may do
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through
I'll never stop wanting you
And when forever is through
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes
Of this I'm more than just sure
My love will last and endure
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you

Charlie Shoemake,"Can't we two go walkin' together out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill, 
The heather on the hill.

Alone, alone on a night that was meant for love

Charlie Shoemake Trio,"In my imagination, I'm finding consolation
Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
