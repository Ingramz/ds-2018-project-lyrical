James,"I've been digging this grave, but now that it`s made
I see that black is one hell of a color
Want to break out so I start to shout
But the mortician`s returned to his parlor

Black hole
Wrapped in my shroud upstairs, the music`s so loud
That I can`t concentrate on my sorrow
Let down my hair and find something to wear
And then dance myself into tomorrow

Black hole
I`m in a hole here and all I can see
Are these grey walls that are closing in on me
Throw me a ladder, lend me an arm
Beam me up Scotty, lift me from harm

Oh why, why deep holes?
Oh I love my holes
Black hole

If the weather would change these clouds might blow away
And my body'd be wrapped up in sunshine
I want out of this wind that is wearing me thin
Blasting my flesh to the marrow

Why deep holes?
Why deep holes?
Black hole",Black Hole,1986
James,"Ladies and gentlemen, here's my disease
Give me a standing ovation and your sympathy
Poor old Johnny Yen's set himself on fire again

See the Jean Genie on his high-wire act
At the back of his mind lies a suicide pact
Poor old Johnny Yen's set himself on fire again

See the young men itching to burn
Waiting for their own star turn
Needing danger where war would do
If they can't let it out, they'll pick on you
Poor old Johnny Yen's set himself on fire again
On fire again
Poor old Johnny Yen's set himself on fire again

See Houdini and his underwater tricks
You were sitting at the front hoping his locks would stick
Watch Knievel hit the seventeenth bus
You got crushed in the souvenir rush
Poor old Johnny Yen's set himself on fire again
I said, poor old Johnny Yen's set himself on fire again

See the young men itching to burn
Waiting for their own star turn
Needing danger where war would do
If they can't let it out, they'll pick on you
Poor old Johnny Yen's set himself on fire again
On fire again
I said, poor old Johnny Yen's set himself on fire again

Ladies and gentlemen
Here's my disease
Give me a standing ovation
And your sympathy

(Come on, somebody, finish him off please!
Put the poor fool out of his misery, will you?
Can't you see he's had enough?
Finish him off, somebody!)",Johnny Yen,1986
James,"An emotional charge like an electrical spark
But the fuses are two, you can't tell them apart
When the bodies collide, the bodies emerge back into one
The only urge all change, all change etc.
Change your paths

But you can't help the thought that when nothing stays still
The tiger moves on when it's taken it's fill
But you cling to the part like a shark to it's prey
When the part doesn't last there's pain, but no one to blame who's to blame?
Fail to achieve a basis for collaboration
Fail to achieve a basis for collaboration
But you cling to the part like a shark to it's prey
The preacher looked out on my doing today
And he said, ""oh, this looks curly to me.""
",Just Hip,1986
James,"To be loving when the knives are out
Takes much courage and a mind without doubt
I'm just some robot, wind up the clockwork jerk
Trying to impress is the nature of my work

And it's so hard to remain open
If it's true, it can't be spoken

Really hard
Really hard

Rhetoriticians think they're running this show
Words as power is all they'll ever know
I'm just some reflex, when struck, the knee will jerk
Trying to impress is the nature of our work

And it's so hard to remain open
If you bend, you won't get broken

Really hard
Really hard

Wake up from this dreaming state
A long scream out, it's not too late
I am dying to begin
I am dying to begin again

Really hard
Really hard
",Really Hard,1986
James,"Which scarecrow has the power of voice
It will stab you in the thigh
And when she wails, it twists your insides

Wise scarecrow
Which scarecrow
Which scarecrow

A pitch for which she has been searching
Holds the key to the dreams she's been dreaming

(refrain)
Coming on, coming on, coming on
She's coming on strong
She's coming on coming on coming on coming on
Coming on strong

Droll,
Try to mix her ego with her soul
Never mix the ego with the soul
I always twist my ego with my soul

Which scarecrow
Wise scarecrow
Which scarecrow

And 'cause you was her inspiration
Got a plan that could shatter a nation

(refrain)
When your song strikes me
My walls fall down
And I can sit down
In your perfect light and sound
",Scarecrow,1986
James,"An earwig crawled into my ear
Made a meal of the wax and hairs
Phoned friends, had an insect party
But all I could hear was the bass drum drum
All I could hear was the bass drum drum

Now if you put your ear close you'll be able to hear
Not the sea shore noise of the shore sea shell
The clatter of plates
And the bronze of the bell
Going ding dong, ding dong, ding dong dong

Going out of my mind as they hollow my head
I'm floating in the air, but my body's in bed
The more they eat, the more I see
What is not, but just could be
You can hear them laughing in my head
You can hear them laughing in my head
Ha ha ha ha ha

Now they've eaten my memory, I can't recall
How the world used to be before
So a vision is the same as what is real
Depends upon the lighting, and how I feel
Ding dong, drum drum, ha ha ha ha ha

And then the music stopped
The musician went away
They'd eaten all my brain
The red and the grey

They all stack at home
Dug a tongue through my nose
Where my brain used to be
Now there's only a hole
",Skullduggery,1986
James,"There are so many traps been laid
How can you avoid one
Put your foot down in a moonlit glade
Snap, your ankle's broken

I don't know how decisions get made
Which are the turns to take
It doesn't seem to matter what plans are laid
You can't tell when the wave will break

So many ways
There are so many colorful rays
How are you going to choose one
Bright lights look all right from here
But seduction has to be wrong

So many ways
I don't know which path you're taking, 
If it's bent or straight
All I know is I've found something that will take me home again
So many ways
If you keep your wits about you, 
Search with an open heart
You'll be sure to find your answers, penetrate the scream in the cynics
So many ways
Lost and if you are looking for foot's path
Floating free in space
There are all these lights coming out the dark
Do they lead to the same place

So many ways",So Many Ways,1986
James,"Down the chute and out the door
I know that I've been here before
The blinding lights, the long white coat
Cut the cord before I choke

Oh, please sir, handle me gently
I've got nothing to protect me

This man in a mask stabbed me in the back
No sooner alive than I'm being attacked
If this is the planet Earth
Oh please, mom, take me back in your sack

My keepers aren't too bad this time
The man's quiet, the woman`s crying
When I arrive, what`s hers is mine
I take and take it all the time

Oh please sir, do not tempt me
Those sweet things, they just destroy me

I always want more than I can get
My belly`s full, but I`m not done yet
Need something to kill
The word is you¡­.mine

It's true, it`s true, it`s true
You taught us how to be the same as you
If only you really knew
We wouldn't do what you do
It's true

As you poison the Earth you poison our lives
This isn't living, but another disguise
Go looking for truth
As all of this is built on lies and lies etc.

Hey, hey, hey now you've found me
Everything's so clear

With your arms around and your song in my heart
There's simply nothing I can fear
Feel he inside burst through my head
Replacing my eyes

Please don't let me hide 
Cut through my head
Replacing my eyes",Summer Songs,1986
James,"Why so close
Big boys in black hats
Cowboys with white guns
White guns shoot blue white
Blue white baptism
No buffaloes
No indians
No more buffaloes

Red sky is falling
Blue blood no stalling
White heat will strip you
No time to run far

(refrain 1)
Ivan's built a wall of lead 'round his house
Nobody can get in or out
Running out of food for ammunition
Frightened of the darkness
Sending out scouts

Why hang the fire so close
Why hang the fire so close
Why hang the fire so close
Why so close

(refrain 2)
Wayne's got a wall that's much more subtle
Wore headphones since he was born
Watches ivan through dark glasses
Hand on his gun waiting for the storm

One false move and we all fall down
No funeral games, no such fun
Here's your ticket to the party
That's what you get for playing with a gun

Six-gun so close

(refrain 1)
Ivan's got a wall of lead 'round his house
Nobody can get in or out
Running out of food for ammunition
Frightened of the darkness
Sending out scouts

Why?
",Why So Close,1986
James,"Withdrawn, muscles all tense
Nothing flows for the self-obsessed
Feel all washed up

Restless, can't sit still
A mental state, or a physical ill
Toxic, bones all cracked
Step on a bus, get a panic attack

Of that you took me so high
Now getting out of bed is enough to make me cry
Saps all my energy
That's how it used to be
You came just in time

Feel all washed up
Need a wash up
Need a wash

Restless, muscles all ache
So tense, watch me shiver as you shake
Not a dance but a scream by the body at the stake
Pierces my heart, something's gonna break

Amazed when you cannot deny
Going out of bed is enough to make you cry
That's how it used to be before you came by

Screwed up at school
Hate bad food
Too many t.v. views live in you (my friend)

Feel all washed up (need a wash)
Much to take, I'm overcome
So wash me up with a loving song
",Withdrawn,1986
James,"Today, I won`t think of any sad things
Will not think of torture, or the rape of nature 
Just today, I won`t touch those sickening papers
Will just let myself get swept away by this beautiful day

What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for
What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

The sunset tonight is beyond all words, in the sky above the square
The starling spiral dancing on air. 

What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for
What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

I will pass through the glass into air past those birds 
In the square, I am sun, I am sky in my mind`s eye

Today, I will dive into foaming seas
Sick fish, myself, and some strange debris.
I would prefer to be anywhere away from here
Oh I would prefer to be anywhere away from here
I would prefer to be anywhere away from here 
I would prefer to be anywhere away from here

James,"Hey hey hey

Julie says that I must wake up
I am losing touch 'cause I think too much
I'm afraid to feel, my life feels unreal
You will not find love if you think you're not good enough

Are you ready to rebel
Change your mind, I know you live in hell
Are you ready, oh

All of my beliefs, they come back to me
I think life is tough, so my life is tough
She says find a way to develop love
To receive my love, believe you are good enough

Are you ready to rebel
Change your mind, I know you live in hell,
Are you ready

When we forget why we're here
Out goes love, in comes fear
And if not then, I'm all alone
I need nothing 'til my mind takes hold
Hold, hold

Are you ready to rebel
Are you ready",Are You Ready,1988
James,"Why is it always, when I open my mouth
I clash with whatever you do
When we dance together your rhythm and tempo
Cuts through my quick step and tune
You cry, I, I, can't take anymore
But you can't find the bloody door
Oh you might think we're free
'Til we slip back into memory
We're joined by a purpose that will not release us
'Til we have come to some terms
Some love and acceptance, not hate and repentance
These skills are things to be learned
You cry, I, I, can't take anymore

But you can't find the bloody door
Oh you might think we're free
'Til we slip back into memory
I love you so
I'm stuck, can't you let go
Let's try again
This time we will be friends
I cannot change

Lost in memory
Here's to memory",Fairground,1988
James,"I'm in a crowded room - I've been half-asleep
Says the sister in uniform
""Has everybody understood?""
The listeners turn and nod
But I can see their fear, do they know more than me
Do they know why they're here
I don't want that poison in
She passed around a potion - it went from lip to hand
I took a sip, a taste I didn't understand
The woman then explained, that this was the juice, the juice that causes pain
That all great singers need

I don't want that poison in
I stumbled from the room
There must be some mistake
I do not want this seed
Think I'm in another's dream
Now I can feel this creature flapping in my throat
Try and throw it up
But my cough turns to a choke
Put my fingers in my mouth
I have it by the head
It dug into my jaw
I threw the sucker to the floor

James,"She grabs her magazines
She packs her things and she goes
She leaves the pictures hanging on the wall, she burns all
Her notes and she knows, she's been here too few years
To feel this old

He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone
If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
He knows, she's been here too few years to be gone

And we always say, it would be good to go away someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang

The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
Funny how he couldn't see it at all 'til she grabbed up her coat
And she goes, she's been here too few years to take it all in stride
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go (you let her go)

And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang
The same for you
I'll always hang

Well I always say, it would be good to go away

And there's nothing there to ease this ache
But if there's nothing there to make things change

James,"It's that time again when I lose my friends
Go walkabout, I've got the bends from pressure
This is a testing time when the choice is mine
Am I a fool for love or foolish with desire
You can throw him out you can spit on him
Call what he does a sin if it makes you feel better

And I can't believe you're all I'll ever need
And I need to feel that you're not holding me
And the way I feel just makes me want to scream
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home

After thirty years I've become my fears
I've become the kind of man I always hated
I am pulled apart, and my swollen heart
Has flipped out of the pan into the fire
I am in love insane with a sense of shame
That I threw stones at the condemned and
Now I'm slated

And I don't believe you're all I'll ever need
And I need to feel that you're not holding me

James,"You may say I am cynical, but I say man is flawed
He has a vague memory of like before some fall
Behaving like a reptile, but talks of walking tall
If God is in his image, the Almighty must be small

Swaggart has been caught with his trousers 'round his knees
After damning me and you to Hell for eternity
Sex and power and money is the prayer of these priests
They bribe their way past Heaven's gates and steal a set of keys

God only, God only, God only knows
God only, God only, God only knows
God only, God only, God only knows
God only, God only, God only knows

My Guru has been sleeping with adepts and with sheep
While I was fucking celibate, self-righteous in belief
Yesterday he was God, now he is a creep
We fell upon each other starving for belief

God only, God only, God only knows
God only, God only, God only knows
God only, God only, God only knows

I speak in the name of God
I speak in the name of that White Haired
Old Man in the clouds, always a man
Dispensing lightening justice from His fingertips
Watching you every second of the day
Just waiting for you to fuck up

I speak in the name of God
I'm His intermediary
I'm a Mollah, I'm a Priest, I'm a Vicar
If you want to go to God
You have to come through me
Because my God is bigger than your God
My God is bigger than your God
My God is the only way

Is Heaven full, oh Lord, of these babbling preachers
All these self-righteous, self-appointed prophets
Because if so, I know where I'd rather be

Speak in tongues, power is money
I see our interests fall
Well behind their curtain
Break down the government walls
Infiltrate our television
Break down the government walls
Time to be outspoken


I can hear the sound of falling masonry
As they try to plug that leak
I am tempted by their cloak of secrecy
To find out what their games are about
Ask a question and they'll talk of secret services
Secrets from the people they should serve
When they can hide their crimes in a legal disguise
Truth will not be seen nor heard


In ireland they may shoot to kill without
Warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets to close to the
Truth of it
They'll set him up in style in style
In china, they murder
Their youth
Who are questioning
How their lives are controlled
Do they have the means to rewrite history
Wipe out the genes of doubt

Bring them down within my lifetime

See what they are concealing

Not one for yes but two for no
Some spirit is unsatisfied
From watching her world spin out of control
At night she goes walking around her old home
Objecting to how it's all changed
She preferred her arrangements to the ones which we have made
Walking the ghost
Walking the ghost

There's baggage on my shoulders
Making me stoop bending my frame
My neck is crocked lopsided
I will never be tall again
At night she goes walking around her old home
You can feel so much sadness wrapped up in her bones
I can feel so much sadness wrapped up in her bones

Stab in the back burn in the ribs
I need your fingers to straighten my flesh
I hope your fingers are kind

Those words are a piece of a part that you played
That sounds like your father, a teacher, the church
Didn't spring from the heart, but research

The only way I learn is put the fist in and get burned
Go get burned

Old wives, mystics, hearsay
Wise men, rich men, shamen and sage
When you're meek on the Earth, when you die you will pay
For accepting that lot, in the cheapest of graves
The sexes divided, men mustn't be weak
Sensitivity is a vice of which we shan't speak
And women are a plaything that are just made for men
To treat how the boss he respects treats him
And I am going to grow up like daddy wanted me to be
To impress all those, who so impressed me
And young boys melt into men
And we'll start the process again

Add a touch of mystique where the writing gets weak 
Break up coherence with a cut-cut-cut up technique
When you've got nothing to say
Shut up
Or show that you're willing to play
With words that simply aren't out of touch
With the genuine feelings which lead to their birth
Most things are better not written or heard
When you open your mouth, out drops a turd

That lie is not for we

Raise a rope and a knife

Lit up against the sky
Like a sign
Like a neon sign

Drops into the gutter
Cut strings
Legs twitching

The flood swells his clothes
Delivers him on

Everybody wants more money
Everybody wants more loving
Everybody wants the same things

I came across the border
Through the east and the west divide
The land between the trenches
Was patrolled by the deaf and the blind

The blind were shouting, ?Listen?
While the deaf said, ?Can't you see??
Somewhere deep in no man's land
The man has lost a key

I open up into this mystery
I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

There's centuries of fighting
So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

I opened up into this mystery
Every key can lock you up or set you free
I believe that there is magic
In this mystery

This woman's a saint, or at least she's a queen

Talons and wings and a cute 45

Bound to stray, bound to betrayal
The moon is rising, it's a physical thing
Nothing can hold him, not even the ring

She's only human, only female
Bound to victim, bound to betrayal
The moon is rising, it's a physical thing
She's only acting on the right of spring

A plague for the naÃ¯ve

Been more loved, been less afraid
If only I had scored the goal, got the girl or even played

To be born again then fall
Let it fall away these lies

Of the tribe who drown in a grave of gold

With the glasses and suit
Heart and soul
It won't wear out

That's not enough I want what's inside
Fish fillet knife would cut right through my eyes

I'm looking for some words
To call my own
Not worn-out phrases and hand-me-downs

They'll knock me
In where I stand
Put on its back
In a corned beef can

I'm going under
You can feel them stripping me down
To the rust inside

This is the way
Frankenstar is born

From bits and pieces others have worn
All held together by a management glue
Too much glue, and the stars turn blue
Turn blue

And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on

Everybody wants more money
Everybody wants more loving
Everybody wants the same things

Through the east and the west divide
The land between the trenches
Was patrolled by the deaf and the blind

The blind were shouting, ?Listen?
While the deaf said, ?Can't you see??
Somewhere deep in no man's land
The man has lost a key

I open up into this mystery
I have seen

There's centuries of fighting
So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

I opened up into this mystery

Well behind their curtain
Break down the government walls

As they try to plug that leak
I am tempted by their cloak of secrecy
To find out what their games are about
Ask a question and they'll talk of secret services
Secrets from the people they should serve
When they can hide their crimes in a legal disguise
Truth will not be seen nor heard


In ireland they may shoot to kill without
Warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets to close to the
Truth of it
They'll set him up in style in style

Their youth
Who are questioning
How their lives are controlled
Do they have the means to rewrite history
Wipe out the genes of doubt

To impress all those, who so impressed me

The sound that lovers make

Quiet as cats, across the courtyard
Moving from shadow to shadow
Past the guards to the forest
So quiet in her still reflection
Drawing them down, drawing them down to the lake
To the center of her attention

Before the morning
Steal the moon tonight

Across the sands they move so softly
Slip into water

And drift like a cloud
To the center
Beneath her cool attention
Still water

Was patrolled by the deaf and the blind

While the deaf said, ?Can't you see??

The man has lost a key

I open up into this mystery
I have seen

There's centuries of fighting
So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

I opened up into this mystery
Every key can lock you up or set you free
I believe that there is magic

"James ""Fuzzy"" West","She grabs her magazines
She packs her things and she goes
She leaves the pictures hanging on the wall, she burns all
Her notes and she knows, she's been here too few years
To feel this old

He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone
If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
He knows, she's been here too few years to be gone

And we always say, it would be good to go away someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang

The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
Funny how he couldn't see it at all 'til she grabbed up her coat
And she goes, she's been here too few years to take it all in stride
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go (you let her go)

And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang
The same for you
I'll always hang

Well I always say, it would be good to go away

Go walkabout, I've got the bends from pressure
This is a testing time when the choice is mine
Am I a fool for love or foolish with desire
You can throw him out you can spit on him
Call what he does a sin if it makes you feel better

And I can't believe you're all I'll ever need
And I need to feel that you're not holding me
And the way I feel just makes me want to scream
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home

After thirty years I've become my fears
I've become the kind of man I always hated
I am pulled apart, and my swollen heart
Has flipped out of the pan into the fire
I am in love insane with a sense of shame
That I threw stones at the condemned and
Now I'm slated

He has a vague memory of like before some fall
Behaving like a reptile, but talks of walking tall

After damning me and you to Hell for eternity

Dispensing lightening justice from His fingertips

Just waiting for you to fuck up

I'm His intermediary
I'm a Mollah, I'm a Priest, I'm a Vicar
If you want to go to God
You have to come through me
Because my God is bigger than your God
My God is bigger than your God
My God is the only way

All these self-righteous, self-appointed prophets

Warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets to close to the

And the gap between crack and thunder
Crack and thunder
Is closing in
Is closing in

The rain floods gutters
And makes a great sound on concrete

On a flat roof, there's a boy
Leaning against a wall of rain
Aerial held high
Calling ""Come on thunder,
Come on thunder!""

And the rain lifts lids off cars
Spinning buses like toys
Stripping them to chrome
Across the bay, the waves are something else
Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

The boy's hit!
Lit up against the sky
Like a sign
Like a neon sign

Then he crumples
Drops into the gutter
Cut strings
Legs twitching

The flood swells his clothes
Delivers him on
Delivers him on

Puts my ear to his

Through the east and the west divide
The land between the trenches
Was patrolled by the deaf and the blind

While the deaf said, ?Can't you see??

The man has lost a key

I open up into this mystery
I have seen

There's centuries of fighting
So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

I opened up into this mystery
Every key can lock you up or set you free
I believe that there is magic

What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

The sunset tonight is beyond all words, in the sky above the square
The starling spiral dancing on air. 

What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for
What for, tell oh me, tell oh me, what for

I will pass through the glass into air past those birds 
In the square, I am sun, I am sky in my mind`s eye

Sick fish, myself, and some strange debris.

If anybody ever had a heart, he wouldn't be alone
He knows, she's been here too few years to be gone

And we always say, it would be good to go away someday
But if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you I'll just hang

The trouble understand, is she got reasons he don't
Funny how he couldn't see it at all 'til she grabbed up her coat
And she goes, she's been here too few years to take it all in stride
But still it's much too long, to let hurt go (you let her go)

And we always say, it would be good to go away, someday

Call what he does a sin if it makes you feel better

You have to come through me

Well behind their curtain

As they try to plug that leak
I am tempted by their cloak of secrecy
To find out what their games are about
Ask a question and they'll talk of secret services
Secrets from the people they should serve
When they can hide their crimes in a legal disguise
Truth will not be seen nor heard


In ireland they may shoot to kill without
Warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets to close to the
Truth of it
They'll set him up in style in style

How their lives are controlled
Do they have the means to rewrite history
Wipe out the genes of doubt

Stripping them to chrome

Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

Lit up against the sky
Like a sign
Like a neon sign

Drops into the gutter
Cut strings

Delivers him on

"James ""J.T."" Taylor & Regina Belle","An earwig crawled into my ear
Made a meal of the wax and hairs
Phoned friends, had an insect party
But all I could hear was the bass drum drum
All I could hear was the bass drum drum

Now if you put your ear close you'll be able to hear
Not the sea shore noise of the shore sea shell
The clatter of plates
And the bronze of the bell
Going ding dong, ding dong, ding dong dong

Going out of my mind as they hollow my head
I'm floating in the air, but my body's in bed
The more they eat, the more I see
What is not, but just could be
You can hear them laughing in my head
You can hear them laughing in my head
Ha ha ha ha ha

Now they've eaten my memory, I can't recall
How the world used to be before
So a vision is the same as what is real
Depends upon the lighting, and how I feel
Ding dong, drum drum, ha ha ha ha ha

And then the music stopped
The musician went away
They'd eaten all my brain
The red and the grey

They all stack at home
Dug a tongue through my nose
Where my brain used to be
Now there's only a hole

How can you avoid one
Put your foot down in a moonlit glade
Snap, your ankle's broken

I don't know how decisions get made
Which are the turns to take
It doesn't seem to matter what plans are laid
You can't tell when the wave will break

So many ways
There are so many colorful rays
How are you going to choose one
Bright lights look all right from here
But seduction has to be wrong

So many ways
I don't know which path you're taking, 
If it's bent or straight
All I know is I've found something that will take me home again
So many ways
If you keep your wits about you, 
Search with an open heart
You'll be sure to find your answers, penetrate the scream in the cynics

Floating free in space

Do they lead to the same place

I know that I've been here before
The blinding lights, the long white coat
Cut the cord before I choke

I've got nothing to protect me

This man in a mask stabbed me in the back
No sooner alive than I'm being attacked

You taught us how to be the same as you
If only you really knew
We wouldn't do what you do

As you poison the Earth you poison our lives
This isn't living, but another disguise
Go looking for truth
As all of this is built on lies and lies etc.

Everything's so clear

With your arms around and your song in my heart

Toxic, bones all cracked
Step on a bus, get a panic attack

Now getting out of bed is enough to make me cry
Saps all my energy
That's how it used to be
You came just in time

Feel all washed up
Need a wash up

So tense, watch me shiver as you shake
Not a dance but a scream by the body at the stake
Pierces my heart, something's gonna break

Amazed when you cannot deny
Going out of bed is enough to make you cry

A look in her eyes, says you don't understand
And the moon is full, what are you gonna do?
A gun in her hand makes her feel like a man, ooh

Her man is a monkey we've all agreed
This woman's a saint, or at least she's a queen
But if you mess with this angel, the harpy arrives
Talons and wings and a cute 45

He's only human, he's only male
Bound to stray, bound to betrayal
The moon is rising, it's a physical thing
Nothing can hold him, not even the ring

She's only human, only female
Bound to victim, bound to betrayal
The moon is rising, it's a physical thing
She's only acting on the right of spring

Here she comes with a gun in her hand

A plague for the naÃ¯ve

Meteors may strike the earth
Nations live and die

Bridge a gap that wasn't really there

With the glasses and suit
Heart and soul
It won't wear out

That's not enough I want what's inside
Fish fillet knife would cut right through my eyes

To call my own
Not worn-out phrases and hand-me-downs

They'll knock me
In where I stand
Put on its back
In a corned beef can

I'm going under
You can feel them stripping me down
To the rust inside

From bits and pieces others have worn
All held together by a management glue
Too much glue, and the stars turn blue
Turn blue

Depends upon the lighting, and how I feel

Dug a tongue through my nose

And women are a plaything that are just made for men

And I am going to grow up like daddy wanted me to be
To impress all those, who so impressed me
And young boys melt into men
And we'll start the process again

Break up coherence with a cut-cut-cut up technique
When you've got nothing to say
Shut up

With the genuine feelings which lead to their birth

Aerial held high, calling ""come on thunder, come on thunder""

Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore

And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching
The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on

Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul

An old man's taking Polaroids
But all he captures is endless rain, endless rain

Everybody wants more money
Everybody wants more loving
Everybody wants the same things

I came across the border
Through the east and the west divide
The land between the trenches
Was patrolled by the deaf and the blind

The blind were shouting, ?Listen?
While the deaf said, ?Can't you see??
Somewhere deep in no man's land
The man has lost a key

I open up into this mystery
I have seen
I have seen
I have seen

There's centuries of fighting
So I brought myself a gun
The salesman called it freedom
So my enemy bought a bigger one

I'm saving up for a missile
That will shoot him up with love
Now his finger's on my button
And my hand is in his glove

I opened up into this mystery
Every key can lock you up or set you free
I believe that there is magic
In this mystery
