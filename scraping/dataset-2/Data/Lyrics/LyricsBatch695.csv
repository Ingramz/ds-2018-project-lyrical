Mastodon,"We trip the light
Firebird flies
Burn your inside
Given a lesson
The path I've shown
Follow all I know

Into the Spectrelight
Into the afterlife

It came from the ocean
Gift from the sea
Lava forms the stone
Belief in power
Believe the dream
Trust your own truth

Into the Spectrelight
Into the afterlife

You listen through the light
Tolling on the sea
Barren eyes behind you
Leave the shadows waking dreams

Rising through the door
Writing with a knife
Cut speech
Cut light
Cut chord and break the dawning wretch of silence

Trust your own truth
Souls of the fallen
Death of the Godhead
Listen and breathe

Into the Spectrelight
Into the afterlife",Spectrelight,2011
Mastodon,"The temple of bodies
A building with souls
Given the cosmos
As we let go
As we let go

Locked in a dance
Surrounding the moon
This far from the clouds
Stargasm flows
Stargasm

Lead us by horses
On the way to our graves
Father the owl
It is your faith
It is your faith

Awake in the moment
Awaken the heart
Look to the spirits
Stargasm glows
Stargasm

And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire

Henged from the solstice
Bohemian grave
Flesh lies the altar
As we let go
As we let go

Glasses are empty
The owl has flown
Sever relation
Like you didn't know
Like you didn't know

And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire",Stargasm,2011
Mastodon,"With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last

Love your warm embrace
Hold me close don't let me go
Nipple pink and cold
Filled up with mother's milk

Buried deep inside my past

Hoping you'll be the last

Mastodon,"And though they were sad
They rescued everyone
They lifted up the sun
A spoonful weighs a ton

Giving more than they had
The process had begun
A million came from one
The limits now were none

Being drunk on their plan
They lifted up the sun

Forcing it off with their hands
The trap door came undone
Above our heads it swung
The privilege had been won

Being drunk on their plan
They lifted up the sun

Yelling as hard as they can
The doubters all were stunned
Heard louder than a gun
The sound they made was love",A Spoonful Weighs a Ton,2012
Mastodon,"It flickered to light
It turned broke what was right
It got the roots by the hair
What was was no longer there

It blocked out the sun
It climbed up the stairs
And then it slipped through the cracks
I wasn't watching my back

A commotion
A commotion
A commotion
A commotion

If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart

It stalked through the rooms
And then it tore the sheets off the bed
It ripped the books off the shelf
It turned heaven to hell

It held me down tight
It took all my fight
It broke all the windows
It came flame from the kindle

A commotion
A commotion
A commotion
A commotion

If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart
If it rips you all apart
The grudge has still got your heart

Mastodon,"The moment you walked in the room, my friend
The demons, they all went away
Be careful, they're only asleep for a while
Pretending there's nothing to say

Throw salt in all the corners here
Make sure you watch him leave

Build up the walls around this house
And dig out the rot in the floor
Block out the entrance with brick and stone
And mortar that's made from coal

Crawl into this hole I've made
Transform these feelings of fear

I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind

Loose lips have fallen on deaf ears
Loose lips have fallen on blind eyes

An ocean of sorrow surrounds this home
I hope that we make it to shore
As time chips away at the fortress walls
It seems that we weathered the storm

The sun begins to show itself
Revealing victory

I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind

Loose lips have fallen on deaf ears
Loose lips have fallen on blind eyes

I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind
I'm on fire (say you'll remember her voice)
And I can't get you out of my mind

And I can't get you out of my mind",Asleep in the Deep,2014
Mastodon,"I don't see the fearsome fright
All I see is beauty shine
Not much time to say goodnight
I can hear you scream in the sky

Nephew do you feel all right
Always up in overdrive
They would try to smother you
Never let your feelings through

Live out loud
Live out loud
Live out loud
Live out loud

I'm sniffing your garden
I'm sniffing your rose
She's stuck in the middle
You know how it goes

They're crawling across now
They'll give him some blow
We'll do him a favor
We'll give him some gold

I remember your eyes came out
I can see you run and shout
Don't know where to place the blame
You knew how to hide your pain

We just want to see you alive
Taught me how to speak my mind
Release you in atmosphere
It was just too small in here

Live out loud
Live out loud
Live out loud
Live out loud

Hey ho, let's get up and rock n' roll

Mastodon,"I saw the mountain crumble down
I saw colossus in flames
I heard the ocean draining
Nothing that I could ever tame

Off with my head, come down the line
I have the right to decide
I'll bring this light, as is the sky
Altered minds they criticize

Unrest within your flesh

Into the void I go
Will I ever see your face again
Or will blank be all I know

Arriving inside
Ire hurts a life

And the darkness here is grim
But it found us, surrounded
Lead me deep into the canyon
You push your guidance in the wrong hands

Feet ungrounded, giving your best
Now take your gold into silence
You take a stand, bracing yourself
For this cold is never ending

Mastodon,"Wide is the line
Separates the rivers from the dirt
All the while I wonder who's the one

Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)
Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)
Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)
Within the one and only eye (Self-blinded to see through the veil)

Can you see there's a child
Standing idle by us in this mess
Who am I to cause this emptiness

Willing the sea to cleanse my soul
Of all that I've been
To bring me free to this clarity
Clarity

Trouble rolls in
As the tides, they twist and make the turn
Pain subsides
And sweeps across the earth again

Willing the sea to cleanse my soul
Of all that I've been
To bring me free to this clarity

Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)
Within the one and only eye (we all stood cut free)

Within the one and only eye (Self-blinded to see through the veil)

I'm standing deep in these waters
Bleeding free and bent
To drag us onto the new visions
Only loss fills my void
Only loss fills my void
Only loss fills my void

Only the void connects me
With these mountains
Of dust, blood and soil
The stones born in the flames of truth
Demand a sacrifice
A sacrifice
A sacrifice
A sacrifice

Don't just bleed us and leave us to ourselves
We will return so deeply harmed
And we will shatter you
And we will shatter you
And we will shatter you",Diamond in the Witch House,2014
Mastodon,"You walk with boundless grace
Think old thoughts from yesterday
All being lost in the fire
You wandered and lost the way

When the door of life closes

And you were slipping away

And if I want you to stay
What do I say to you?
What do I say to you?

This moment I take for you
Think of all we didn't do
All seeking answers from this
Hope to come out alive
Standing still my hands are tied
Our eyes open up to the sky

It turns me inside out
There's no direction
No ebb and flow
You call them rejects
They're all I have
The mills of life
They will grind you down

See the red
All I know is
See the red
Watch it flowing

I see a vision
Chew it with my teeth
Believe the dying
And minds that read
A change in season
Your mind crawls back
Turning neurotic
A self-attack

See the red
All I know is

Watch it flow

This beast is vicious

And keep the search on for mystery
You told a secret
Confide into the trees
Thinking you know a man's history

Mastodon,"Orange and black take me back to Halloween
I've given to the blind as you can see
Gasoline runs thru my veins
So don't you mess with me
I couldn't tame that beast with a handful of meat

Just wait till my robe falls at my feet
Cold and dilated like my memories
Strange voices in my head
Who could they be
It's the master of disguise and he's breaking me

You will find spirits never rise
Without warning
Feel your fate as you come alive
They're here to take you home

Crashing through the walls
You're the one I want to see
Bent all up on a moon-soaked night
Death is riding with me

Dripping blood with hell froze at my feet

Because now I'm going to speed

You let the storm come and wipe us out

I take the ground below you

Trying to remember whenever there was nobody listening
Before the hugging and the kissing, the booing and the hissing
All I had was just a vision,
All I had was my ambition
Your love without condition
Kept me swinging when I'm missing
My eyes upon the prize
Kept me striving for the mission
When I was down for the count, falling out of commission
I can hear you voice now screaming out ""son, listen""
Get on up, don't give up, though you struck opposition
Time to buck all that stuff, find out what's you condition
Like a pull in my soul, like keys in my ignition
Call you all my commission, my love and my vision and

I would cross any line, I'd swim across the sea
I would take a bullet for you
I would take a bullet for you
I would lose it all, I'd take my fall
To show you it's for real

Remember when we used to flow together back in the park
You would slang guitar licks under the stars in the dark
You'd say let's grow together as this world falls apart
I was holding on to hope but hardly holding a spark
All the rhymes that I wrote you'd call dope from the start
I'd be like a pure note. like a quote on the mark
You'd go to every show and promote from the start
From the beginning we've been building much more than this art
Remember bearing scars in you car to impart you heart
You cared enough to call my bluff through the junk from the start
That's why you're holding onto half of my heart
You've been there through the times,
Through the nights that were dark and

Mat Kearney,"My girl America is just a youth in this world
Her smile is more precious than the sparkle of pearls
And though her age reads she's just a young girl
Age behind her eyes show the pain that she's swirled
Through the hand that's been dealt though it's quiet as kept
The weight was all felt last night when she slept
And as she crept into the dreams of the things of her past
Seems to have grown so fast, way beyond her own class
Though they're right there with her, hers brothers and her sisters
A natural born leader even when her peers diss her
My girl, she's at a crossroads, people praying for her
Some are preying on her magazine ads, sex, drama, smoking marijuana
Longing for a father to call her 'daughter'
She's part of a generation longing for reconciliation
And this future that they're facing and this poison that they're tasting
My girl, I know this love that you're chasing

My girl America's crying when she's lying on her bed at night
I can see that she's screaming when she's dreaming for her freedom
My girl America's dying while she's trying just to stop this fight
Don't stop believing, my girl America

Boys with hungry eyes have been beating her door
Telling her that's what's she's for, trying to rob her at her core
Then leave calling her a whore, but still she knows there's more
I know she knows there's more because there's a voice she can't ignore
Cause it was founded in the foundations, from the day of her creation
In God we trust engraved in the treasures of her nation
And the void the boys can't fill
With the tippin' of the bottle or the poppin' of the pill
But still most of her friends don't care as they glare
Ready to drown the funnel as they frown down the tunnel
They stumble and they tumble, breaking down into rubble
My girl America, stop, can't you see
It's not the circumstances that determine who you're gonna be
But how you deal with these problems and pains that come your way
It's for you that I pray with hope for a brighter day
So I say, your deliverance is comin'

My girl America's crying when she's lying on her bed at night
I can see that she's screaming when she's dreaming for her freedom
My girl America's dying while she's trying just to stop this fight
Don't stop believing, my girl America

Faith like a child from your first birth
You left it in the dirt on your worst hurt
And I see each tear and every scar
The hands that have held you where you are
And I can see we've strayed so far
A king born under that morning star
As a crown of thorns was placed to erase
Each tear that's touched your face
His palms and sides were pierced with spears
He hung in love just to draw you near
My girl, out of this whole world
Can't you see this is where we started

My girl America's crying when she's lying on her bed at night

Cause you know you broke the hardest part 
You know you broke the hardest heart 
I'll never let this love fall in the middle 
Through it all 

Fifteen years old in a sea of blank faces 
Swimming bold against a stream that's mocking as it races 
In these halls, mountain high under a tangerine sky 
Crack a smile just to hide the race that's inside 
Eighteen years old bags packed and a pass for the rail 
One last look at the past as it drowns in the hail 
One in a million, still I keep feeling you keep me from a fall 
A world to lose coming back with you tall 
Through it all 

[Chorus]
No parachutes no safety nets here 
One foot on the water to face these fears 
I'm coming out strong like I can't be wrong 
I said ""hey, I won't fall in the middle"" 

Twenty five here I am with freshman lp's 
One life to write one, two years to repeat 
Behind a curtain, uncertain if an encore's in store 
Tuck my shoulder like a soldier to knock down the door 
Thirty something here I'm running with kisses for one girl 
These scars upon my sleeve still casting out my pearls 
Throw each stone microphone like it's my last turn 
With a kiss to the abyss and watch the ripples return 
Through it all

Mat Kearney,"Like a breath of fresh air and the wind at my back
Toe to heel with strong strides taking miles off the map
In this journey called life where I've walked so far
Under the heat of your sun and the shine of your stars
Step by step I've crept, I've crawled, and I've run
Felt the palm of your hand and the barrel of death's gun
I ran for my life stood strong through strife
From a miscarried life to waiting for my wife like
I heard it sung a thousand strong all night long
Heard heaven's bell going something long, it's like
I've been there in total despair
Now I've tasted and I've touched
A breath of fresh air

'Cause I do live and I hope and pray
For something better and brighter today
For something there for something there

'Cause I was just a poor boy living in a poor world
But you gave me more love that set me free
'Cause I was just a poor boy living in a poor world
But you have gave me more love that set me free

Like road trips on open roads
Windows down sun setting and fresh new clothes
Shoes off so you can stop reflect on all these paths unfolding
With these staffs that are pulling in this world so controlling
It's not always best to take the interstate
Sometimes the most is on the windy coast way
'Cause wide is the path pulling astray
Narrow is the truth in these days
But all the while I hear a still small voice say
You climbed the cliffs rocked the desert on your very own
Swam the seas, sang the songs with the sweetest tones
The beaches you've combed, moons you've roamed the love you've shown
But all the while a voice calls you home

'Cause I do live and I hope and pray
For something better and brighter today
For something there for something there

Mat Kearney,"This is my renaissance
This is my one response
This is the way I say I love you

This is my second chance
This is my one romance
This is the cutting line
On which I stand to show you

It happened fast in a flash, just this evening
As I hit the gas, horn blast, brakes were screaming
As the car crashed, broken glass, broke my dreaming
I hit the dash, so fast my ears are ringing
My sister's on the right side just slightly leaning
I grabbed her hand hard until she started breathing
My brother's in the back, jaw cracked from the beating
The breath in my chest has slipped and I'm sinking
Blinking through diamond spider webs of cracked glass
I'm trying to remember all the words you said in the past
Through the ash, siren screams and red beams
I hear you sing softly to me

I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change
I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change

This is my broken heart
This is my bleeding start
This is the way I've come to know you

This is my winding road
This is my way back home
This is the narrow door you know that I will walk through

I got a letter today of why she went away
She said, â??It's better this way, you knew I never could stay.â??
Half empty closets and frames, all that's left to my name
As she left in the rain and left my heart on a chain
Three years I've built this two-face tower for hours on a lease
You gave me one yellow flower that said rest in peace
In pieces I've broken open to think too much or just enough
Alone to trust midst the rubble and the dust
Humbled, it took this much to break down and understand
Spent my life this far on castles made of sand
Tossed in the breakers in the palm of your hand
Now I can finally stand

I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change
I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change
I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change
I can be the wall when you fall down
Find me on the rocks when you break down
I heard it in the song when you call out
But I got to say now it's got to change

Under the scatter of the stars from a voice cracked with fright
And as the tears stripe cheeks from pain running south
The taste of salt hits the corner of her mouth
Resting on tied tongues with no breath left to speak
Sick of throwing up with no bread left to eat
Tired and confused from disillusionment
Sunny days turn to grey and away he went
Ripping the hooks out your heart from the promises at dark
The words found their mark as the sheets came apart

Every spoken word broken
As he flipped you a token
Kiss on the cheek as his feet found the open door
What's in store for you he didn't question
Shook his burden to the floor to leave you guessing
About the future and what it will unfold
But you're still standing there rockin' it so bold like

I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow

I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow

Holding on these songs of hope 
I cannot sing them without you
Holding on, holding on

You can't just point a finger and say it's alright
Make a trip downtown and put it out of sight
Because two came together so strong one night
And two wrongs don't make one right
Giving a voice to the voiceless saying it's choice less
'Cause they're priceless my princess

I feel the kicks and the churns give me a turn
And a shot at this world to fight the fight
To beat my plight and let my light shine
In this dark time with all its ways of wearing crime
And let this world drown in these ultrasounds
Hearing this heart beats speak sweet so profound
From beat down to higher ground
Where hope abounds with love that astounds
Les Miserables this ain't no miserable daughter
Calling you Cossette 'cause God will be your father 

I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow
I hear a voice crying out from the bellies of their mommas
Hold on for today don't worry about tomorrow
Though the rains of today seem to fall with sorrow
Let me be and we'll see this life for tomorrow

Mat Kearney,"I'm past the point of returning
For you I'm ruined and broken
There is no way of me turning
You've got my heart in the open

I see it shrink in the distance
In the glow of your glory
And I never will miss this
Bottom line of the story

I see the ocean come crashing
Under lavender skies
I see clouds come flashing
Now tell me, who am I?

You're the air that I'm breathing
While I'm lying there sleeping
You're the cool of the evening

You (Oh lord. yes I am) 

I'll kiss it all with a farewell
Goodbye, how you doing
And let it echo in stairwells
All these songs of my ruin

Now watch me climb my own cross
Without a loss for these words
As I motion a moment's silence
Let it fly with the birds

All else I got without you
Is mucha ado about nothing
I'd rather stand by you gone
Than on the throne of another

You had me all from the start
I count it lost every part
I'll sing it out in the dark
You've got a grip on my heart

You (Oh lord. yes I am) 

Where could I turn from you
The darkest nights, you know you'd find a way
What else have I to do
What words are there left to say
You are the air that I breathe in
Here is my heart I give
You are all of my reason
You are my reason to live

Mat Kearney,"It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable

February fifth, Friday morning, purple dawn
Broke a yawn as a I stepped through the fog, like I stepped to a song
A moment like a poem; you wish you could hold it
I shut my eyes like it's frozen; it's gone when I open

It slipped passed the clouds right there where it lingered
Like your band and a girl could slip through your fingers
My feet hit the ground like a beat for the lonely
On a path beaten down by the crowds in the morning

If only I could touch past the phony
If only they were there now to hold me
As the questions keep droning

You're the only one who stuck it out last night
The only other one who caught the other line
You're the only one when this world collides
The one that I can't deny

It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable

It's my last year here
My first class moved to portable 'A'
Under construction since summer
And it's cold today

I can see my breath and what's left of the west parking lot
And all the spaces that we fought
And it all seems forgotten, left in the bottom
In past piles of rubble in puddles of rain water

That hurt last night when I left like that
When I won't come back
Speaking my peace to the past
I can't help but wonder who is this wind at my back
A whisper to walk on come on from all that

It's undeniable how brilliant you are
In an unreliable world you shine like a star
It's unforgettable now that we've come this far
It's unmistakable that you're undeniable

How am I gonna take it away in this winter wind?
You found me on a summer breeze
How am I gonna run away when the autumn breaks
Now that you found me in the spring
Come on and sing it out",Undeniable,2004

Mat Kearney,"You woke the morning up
Running off the darkest night
The longest fight I've seen
Here goes a chance I know
Cashing in on all my chips
Let all my ships come fly

These days, a little bit longer than the last
And all of your ways, a little bit stronger than the past
And your light, found my bottle in the night
Gave me second life, kept me in this fight

And I won't back down
I won't turn around and around
And I won't back down
Doesn't matter what comes crashing down
I'm still gonna stand on solid ground

You found me once and for all
I laid it down in the sinking ground
The hopeless undertow
Singing out the gentle sound
Rattling through my smoking screens
My broken dreams last night

These days, a little bit longer than the last
And all of your ways, a little bit stronger than the past
And your light, found my bottle in the night
Kept me in this fight and gave me second life

And I won't back down
I won't turn around and around
And I won't back down
Doesn't matter what comes crashing down
I'm still gonna stand on solid ground

Hallelujah ripped through my veins
I heard the hammer drop
My blood in the rain

Hallelujah came like a train
When all is lost
All is left to gain

And I won't back down
I won't turn around and around
And I won't back down
Doesn't matter what comes crashing down
I'm still gonna stand on solid ground
And I won't back down
I won't turn around and around

Doesn't matter what comes crashing down
I'm still gonna stand on solid ground

Mat Kearney,"Here it comes it's all blowing in tonight
I woke up this morning to a blood red sky
They're burning on the bridge turning off the lights
We're on the run I can see it in your eyes
If nothing is safe then I don't understand
You call me your boy but I'm trying to be the man
One more day and it's all slipping with the sand
You touch my lips and grab the back of my hand
The back of my hand

Guess we both know we're in over our heads
We got nowhere to go and no home that's left
The water is rising on a river turning red
It all might be OK or we might be dead
If everything we've got is slipping away
I meant what I said when I said until my dying day
I'm holding on to you, holding onto me
Maybe it's all gone black but you're all I see
You're all I see

The walls are shaking, I hear them sound the alarm
Glass is breaking so don't let go of my arm
Grab your bags and a picture of where we met
All that we'll leave behind and all that's left
If everything we've got is blowing away
We've got a rock and a rock till our dying day
I'm holding on to you, holding on to me
Maybe it's all we got but it's all I need

You're all I need
And if all we've got is what no one can break
I know I love you
If that's all we can take
The tears are coming down
They're mixing with the rain

I know I love you, if that's all we can take
A pool is running for miles on the concrete ground
We're eight feet deep and the rain is still coming down
The TV's playing it all out of town
We're grabbing at the fray for something that won't drown",All I Need,2006
Mat Kearney,"She says today is gonna be the last one
I know there's never gonna be an easy way out
She's rolling round the town with a fast gun
And I know I can't be there to catch her when she falls
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either halfway drowned or half way â??round the pier
When you're that far gone

I walked the steps to her apartment with the window by the shore
And saw her curled on the tile through a crack in the door
I've been searching for the words I don't know how to say
I've been searching for the words to make it go away
I spent all of last night and the night before that
With my feet in the sand and the wind on my back

Watching a ship sail out to a blue wide sea
There must be more than this with a kiss we can't see
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either half way drowned or half way round the pier
I can't break her, I can't break her fall
She's lying in the back room, crying on the bathroom floor
Singing I can't take it, I can't take any more
Just one reason, one to believe in
That's not that far gone
Not that far gone

I held the back of her head and laid her in the bed
And watched the sheets raise and fall to the rhythm of her breath
Turn the lock on the handle and slipped down the stairs
To the cover of the night with diamonds in the air
I'll say a prayer in my breath and take a left at the water
To the rhythm of my feet a sister and a daughter
To the rhythm of the sea with the breeze in the autumn
As it blows through the trees my hands into the water
Well half way down is half way out of here
We're either half way drowned or half way round the pier
I can't break her, I can't break her fall
She's lying in the back room, crying on the bathroom floor
Singing I can't take it, I can't take any more
Just one reason, one to believe in
That's not that far

I can't break her, I can't break her fall

Mat Kearney,"These back steps are steeper to the ground
The brightest stars are falling down
I'm walking the edge, walking the tightest rope
We can be frank, reality rips on through
Rolling like a hurricane

If everything's falling, if everything's changed
If I'm in the open, if I'm in the way

What am I doing here
If you're not with me
What have I got to live for
If it's just my own dream
When gravity's pulling
You're still holding my heart
You come crashing down
Crashing down

These four walls are closing in on me
The talk is louder than I'll sing
I want to be there, want to be where you are
But you know it all
Every look and smile that aren't meant to break
I'm over the bridge and under the rain

If everything's falling, if everything's changed
If I'm in the open, if I'm in the way

What am I doing here
If you're not with me
What have I got to live for
If it's just my own dream
Take it back to the beginning, back to the start
When gravity's pulling
You're still holding my heart
You come crashing down

And you say that everything is different
Why don't we just hold on
And you say that everything is different
Why don't we just hold on

The sky's alive with a burning light
You can mark my words something's about to break

And I found myself in a bitter fight
While I've held your hand through the darkest night
Don't know where your coming from, but your coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've ever known or seen

Come on, and we'll sing, like we were free

And here we go
There's nothing left to choose
And here we go

Cold as I remember
And caught me off guard
In the middle of December
Sometimes a crowded room
Can feel the most alone
Sometimes I wonder
Why you won't pick up the phone

This wall is glaring
And it's too hard for me to climb
I've ran and ran
And now there's nothing left behind
I see a picture of a broken man inside
I tried and tried
And now there's nothing left but time
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you alone
And I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you alone
Together we will fly tonight
Leave all of the rest behind
I'll wait for you

These hands can feel
Like they're not even mine
A tree and hill and a cry in the night
Sometimes a little step is the greatest divide
Sometimes I feel your breath right at my side

When this wall is glaring
And it's too hard for me to climb
I've ran and ran

Here I am at the edge of the road
One hand on the end of the rope
One crack and it breaks alone
Wondering who's gonna take me home
On my knees when you call my bluff
Begging please from the edge of the rough
I know when I've had enough
And I know it, and I know it

I see a picture of a broken man inside
I've tried and tried
And now there's nothing left but time

I guess I'm looking for the right things to call pretty

You know I'll stay sharp around here'cause they're stoning and leaving type

And I've been looking round for someone to tell me who I am

An angel is crying I'm dying just a little inside as they ran away

And I buy all the perfect clothes

A bottle spinning around the room
And everybody's singing and slipping down the bottom of a halfway rush of blood
And I was grabbing Missy but I was trying to find the light switch in the dark

There's a white sheet left to cover up

Will you help me to dream it all up again

Rather be lost with you instead

Is yours
And you watch my heart break a little bit more

Tell me there's something we can say
Help me to find a light
Something that's worth living
Shes walking the back beat out in the grave
Tell me there's something we can change
Help me to find my way back down

'Cause Annie's got to get out
Before she never can
Were chasing for the ceiling
I'm grabbing for her hand
Were calling on a thin phone line, tonight
Cause Annie's got to get out

Holding the line from the back of the car
Miles and miles from where you are
Maye the hardest things are the dreams that we've been given
And you scream and you sing and you shout
There one way in and there's one way out
Help me to find my way back down

'Cause Annie's got to get out
Before she never can
Were chasing for the ceiling
I'm grabbing for her hand

Add three days in the grave
Fall back in the evening
Now our lives will change

The rain came down and I lost you, In the wind
You said something about don't leave, before you fell back asleep
Before I could sing my song back to you

But you could find your self lost out in this world
And I found a way to get back to your side
No mountains to high, no stone is too small
I'll build a bridge through the fire, for you I would crawl
From New York to California

I could hear you softly breathing, oh what you do to me
But baby I could climb down into your dreams
I Build a ladder down through the clouds
Where the storms Is raging now I
Don't want to sing another song without you

Then I'll find a way to get back to your side

As you keep chasing the light

Remember back when you slept on my floor
Blow up mattress down by the door
Ten pounds heavier from wasted time
We didn't know we were way out of line
From the moment that you
Popped out on the scene
Hard to know what you got or you're meant to be
Everything that you know goes flying
From Jonny O's couch to a gypsy bus island
Holding hands with people in life
Till they walk away saying no good byes
And you keep saying that you're running down a dream
But you don't know where it leads

As you keep chasing the light
Every bridge that keep on burning
Every leaf that you keep on turning
Every road that you find uncertain
Pray for you now
Baby that you'll figure it out
Every hope and a dream that's dying
Every time that I see you crying
Every step that you keep on climbing
Pray for you now
Baby that you figure it out
As you keep chasing the light

Got the call that you sent out yesterday
Forty lines and a fallout holiday
On my knees with the weight that was mine
Think about you when I'm driving at night
Familiar sounds and it takes me right back there
Bridge street and the beat in the summer air
Was it easier to watch you feet
And never deal with the hell that a young boy sees
Where liquor runs thicker than blood
On your own when push came to shove
Before we had these mouths to feed
With innocent dreams, while you keep

As you keep chasing the light
Every bridge that keep on burning
Every leaf that you keep on turning
Every road that you find uncertain
Pray for you now
Baby that you'll figure it out
Every hope and a dream that's dying
Every time that I see you crying
Every step that you keep on climbing
Pray for you now
Baby that you figure it out
As you keep chasing the light

Remember hearing Dylan's first songs first
Remember writing down a train wreck verse
We were running down Franklin High School lights
Burning alive in a Chevrolet night
Remember driving out to Salton Sea
Dreaming bout all we thought we'd be
One way tickets into southern lights
Slammed the door and said goodbye, goodbye

As you keep chasing the light
Every bridge that keep on burning
Every leaf that you keep on turning
Every road that you find uncertain
Pray for you now
Baby that you'll figure it out
Every hope and a dream that's dying
Every time that I see you crying
Every step that you keep on climbing
Pray for you now
Baby that you figure it out
As you keep chasing the light",Chasing the Light,2011

He got the letter they're gonna take their house away
I'm 'bout to have a daughter he yells it in the air
Feeling the weight of a world that just don't care

He lit a cigarette felt it on his lip
Driving home on a long road with regret
He pulls the window down shouts it out loud
Pushing the pedal and praying lord help us now
He's looking for a reason watching the sun coming down

Can you here when we call
There where we fall
Standing our backs against the wall
Top of our lungs hallelujah
Where pain and love bleed into one
Baby when all you see is darkness
It's coming down now
We all need forgiveness
Coming round now

It was Monday night under the street lights
She's turning seventeen in seven nights
Out on the fairgrounds walking in monotone
She kicks a bottle as empty as her soul
On the road alone in a house that's half a home
They give her pills just to kill when she feels alone
She's looking for a reason watching the sun coming down

Can you here when we call
There where we fall
Standing our backs against the wall

Coming round now

Take these broken streets
Take these broken dreams
Hold my hand like we we're walking free
Tell me it will change I see it in your face
The hope the fear the love the faith

I'm working late again slaving to make the rent
I'm slanging coffee with dreams heavy as cement
They're coming one by one the face of falling love
I write a song with a prayer as I slide the cups

Can you here when we call
There where we fall
Standing our backs against the wall
Top of our lungs hallelujah
Where pain and love bleed into one
Baby when all you see is darkness
It's coming down now
We all need forgiveness
Coming round now

Can you hear when we call
There were we fall
Standing our backs against the wall
At the Top of our lungs how far we've come
Were pain and love bleed into one
All that we need it's so bitter sweet
The pain that opens our eyes to see
Baby when all you see is darkness
Coming down now
We all need forgiveness

Hey brother we're all learning to love again

'Cause that was the real you running through the fields of gold wide open
Standing in places no picture contains
That was the real you, windows down, we could smell the mint fields crying
Singing with the radio to a song we can't name
That was the real you saying, “Maybe I'm not too young to be a cowboy.”
Hey brother, we're all learning to love again

Making up your bed that day on a foreign floor between foreign walls
Thinking 'bout the words you'd say to a phone that never calls
Feel the weight of your father's ring and all those dreams, and all those dreams singing

Walking on the water 'cross an ocean of desire
Everyone I know is looking for protection
Trying to pull down your hometown 'cross a telephone wire

'Cause that was the real you standing there in the shape of your body
Fear don' know no love when we're all the same

Mat Kearney,"I was born in Rochester
To a bookmaking man
Had a fake cigar shops
With the games on in the back
See them coming and going
Let them ride on thoroughbreds
Police chief and Tompaw wondering what was the spread
Carried rich men's bag through the brow
Trying to chase down a little white ball
I learned that any soft place wasn't good for me at all
Daddy come home fired up looking for some sort of release
He beat the hell out of Timmy, Timmy beat the hell out of me

I would hop the fence out to this government fields
Run 'til there was nothing more to feel
Lying there watching planes just disappear
Knowing one day I'm gonna fly on out of here

Well that same police chief came knockin' my first freshman day
Put my daddy in handcuffs and put his picture on the front page
To everyone of his suits and all my dignity
Walk the halls around the court waiting for any punk to set me free

I would hop the fence out to this government fields
Run 'til there was nothing more to feel
Lying there watching planes just disappear
Knowing one day I'm gonna fly on out of here

Well I got that call to Vietnam just like everyone else I knew
So scared of the hand grenades threw them farther than any other troop
I came home like an iron fist and Timmy tried to take my keys
Ripped open his front pocket that was the last time he touched me

Moved to an island out west up to Breckenridge
Met a mermaid on a glass boat and she promised me some kids
Bought a house in Oregon where you could touch both of the walls
Had a son named Benjamin and I was so scared of it all
Well Benjamin walked in the front room where I was cutting up my hash
Looked into those deep blue eyes wondering why I'd been so mad
Flushed a quarter pound down the drain praying for the mercy to confess
Trying to rip the boy from Rochester right out of my chest

We're gonna walk right out into these heavenly fields
Run like there was no more time to steal
My three boys in the grace of god I feel
Knowing one day you're gonna take me out of here
Knowing one day you're gonna take me out of here",Rochester,2011

Cold shoulder's what she pretends
I buy Americano every morning
Rings me up and winks with no warning
At the park with nobody else
Purple boots and her basquiot belt
Lights up when she sees my face
Turns red as she's turning away
All I ever know baby
All these games that you're playing
You keep driving me crazy
Gonna get there, get there

Singing she got the honey and I got some money
To buy her a big bouquet
She got the loving, leaves me with nothing

Well I'd beg, steal, and borrow
If tomorrow she'd stay
She's got the honey

That she keeps walking away

Saw her down at the De La show
Walking in looking down at her toes
Tall like a flower on the wall
High heels stealing looks across the hall

Caught you catch the corner of my eye

You keep passing me by
Just wasting time
Trying to prove who’s right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If its just you and me
Trying to find the light

Like ships in the night letting cannonballs fly
Say what you mean and it turns to a fight
Fists fly from my mouth as it turns south
You’re down the driveway
I’m on the couch
Chasing your dreams since the violent fifth grade
Trying to believe in your silent own way
'Cause we’ll be okay, I’m not going away
Like you watched at fourteen as it went down the drain
Your pops stayed the same and your moms moved away
How many of our parents seem to make it anyway
We’re just fumbling through the gray
Trying to find a heart that’s not walking away

Turn the lights down low
Walk these halls alone
We can feel so far

Had to pack, you had cramps,
And I was late heading to a red carpet
They wont know my name
Riding in silence
All that we wanna say
'Bout to board when you call on the phone
You say I’m sorry I’ll be waitin’ at home
Feels like we’re burning this out on our own

Trying to jump on the circus trying to get across our point
Yeah, we were young and dumb and looking for a fight
Burning both ends of the candle at both ends of the night

She was walking gracefully like she stepped out of a cocoon
Down through Manhattan Boulevard and First Avenue
With her black frame glasses and her Daisy perfume
I said, ""Have we met before?"" She said, ""No, it's only noon.""

Uh oh to be young and dumb and in love
To be young and dumb and in love

All I've waited for's come true
To be young and dumb and in love
With you, you, you, you
With you, you, you, you

Well, we sat in park grass so scared of the past
Rolling round like blankets, oh, this won't last
Dancing to five spot records with smoke in the air
You could smell it the morning, you could smell it in her hair
Found myself on my knees a little more each night
Is this what I've waited for for all of my life
Put your hand with a feather tattoo on your wrist
On this skinny little white boys flat hustling hips

Uh oh to be young and dumb and in love
To be young and dumb and in love

She's got me crying first, dying first, waiting for the repo man

Well, under the weeping willows and a sea firing flies
With your gypsy necklace and my big brown bow tie
You kissed my lips like I was catching a flight
I said if I'm honest I fell for you that first night
If I'm honest I fell for you that first night

Drove me insane girl, a white-knuckle ride
So why do I go lookin' through old photographs
And chase you down the hallways of our checkered past
Hold on for dear life and keep the fire fed
I oughta let go but instead

It's like I'm pressing on a bruise
To see if it still hurts
Right now that's all I've got left of you
Everybody knows that just makes it worse
But still I do

I could start a new life, I could move on
I could do a drive by, and see if you're home

And something any shrink would call an injury

Gave up the ghost and the ghost keeps holdin' on
And you run from the sun but you curse the rain
Lost the love so you nurse the pain
Goin' on and on, singin' that same song

Singing ""It's all gonna fall like we're living a lie""

You've been tearing up these walls again
Ain't no place left here for a girl to hide

You know I tell you just like it is
Gonna walk that far in the scars of another guy

And I'm not gonna give up all of this
Ain't no room left here for me to fly

And if our love is a hurricane
Broken phones and broken doors
Baby you know I can stand the rain
Let it lift us off the floor

You use your words just like a criminal
Kinda like a bullet from a gun
(Young Summer)
Well that shadow found me years ago
I've been bought, I've been shot with a lawless love

And if our love is a hurricane
Broken phones and broken doors
Baby you know I can stand the rain
Let it lift us off the floor

Build it up, tear it down
Let it fall right to the ground
All the words that we could bleed
Let it fly just you and me

Wasted pride
It comes in like the rolling tide
We don't have to give up this fight

And you are the rhythm of my life, my life

Mat Kearney,"I was turning nineteen, on a cold December night
Burning like kerosene for nearly half of my life
And I barely had the GPA to make it out of Eugene
You can blame it on me with an ADHD while I'm falling asleep during the SATs
And as I pack my bags and headed to a foreign land
One way ticket on a one way plane
Laying my head down on each night
The same devil's calling and that same old fight
'Cause this one's for middle sons living in the middle love
Where they coming from and a halfway rush of blood
This one's for those first prayers to heaven on a road that seems never ending

For all the heartbreak dreamers waiting for the light
Looking for just one reason to get through the night
Every long lost believer caught in the fight
All the heartbreak dreamers gonna be alright
Everybody sing

And I was turning twenty five in a city that don't sleep
Was feeling only half alive to the dreams that I keep
And I kept on waiting only she's waiting for me
You burning down Maine on a quarter tank of pain with soles off your feet
And you've been waiting and praying for the right one to come
Watch the rise and the falling of another setting sun
Nobody seems quite good enough for you except the wrong one you keep running back to
So this one's for Mike still waiting for his wife
This one's for grandma losing the love of her life
This one's for those first prayers to heaven on a road that seems never ending

For all the heartbreak dreamers waiting for the light
Looking for just one reason to get through the night
Every long lost believer caught in the fight
All the heartbreak dreamers gonna be alright
Everybody sing

And this one right here ah, this is for the fat girls
This one is a, is for the little brothers
This is for the schoolyard wimps, for the childhood bullies who tormented them
To the former prom queen and to the no crate ball players
For the nighttime cereal eaters and the retired elderly Wal-Mart store front door greeters
Shake the dust
This is for the benches and the people sitting upon
For the bus driver's driving a million broken hymns
To the men who have to hold down three jobs simply to hold up their children
For the nighttime schoolers and for the midnight bike riders trying to fly
Shake the dust
This is for the two year olds who cannot be understood because they speak half English and half God
Shake the dust
For the boys with the beautiful, beautiful sisters
Shake the dust
For the girls with those brothers who are going crazy
Those gym class wallflowers and the twelve year-old afraid of taking public showers
For the kid who is always late to class and forgets the combination to his lockers
And the girl who loved somebody else
Shake the dust
This is for the hard men who want love but know that it won't come
For the one's amendments who not stand up for
For the ones who are forgotten
For the ones who are told to speak only when you are spoken to
And then they are never spoken to speak
Every time you stands you do not forget yourself
Do not let one moment go by that doesn't remind you
That your heart beats hundred thousand times a day
And that they have gallons of blood making every one is an Oceans",Heartbreak Dreamer,2015
Mat Kearney,"'Cause it was Bell Biv DeVoe, playing on my radio
And I had Wu-Tang Clan living in my stereo
Mama said we're 6th generation Oregonians
I was rocking in Jordans with reflector tongues
Two kids with wet cement living down in their souls
They say what gets caught when you're young
Stays there when you're old
So misunderstood they say
You're up to no good
And now we're trying our best
To start it over again

If I'd had met you at the playground
Before a hand could tear your world down
Before I slammed down the door and
You said I'm just like my old man
Before I put you in those boxes
And we learned how to disagree
And how your family is a rocket
That blows up in infidelity

For crying out loud I wanna know
How the waves keep on crashing down the doors
Feel the weight of the world and they keep on bringing more
If it's just you and me on the floor
Go grab your coat and I'll drive us home
Like we were just kids
Just, j-j-just kids
J-j-just kids, just, just kids
Like we were just kids
Just kids, j-j-just kids

Bob Marley was painted on
My high-school walls
But I just disappeared
Into the darkroom hall
Never thought I'd ever
Make it quite this far
Teacher put up my photographs
Say ""son you'll be a star""
It was smoking mirrors
Running down through my veins
I kept on running downtown
Running from God's grace
Every morning I'd climb back through
Those window panes
And try my best to ride it out
Over instrumental tapes

If I'd had met you at the playground
Before a hand could tear your world down
Before I slammed down the door and
You said I'm just like my old man
Before I put you in those boxes

When the heart you've known feels like an empty home,
And your frozen hands just don't feel like your own,
When your love is caving and you don't have the strength to roll back the stone.

With the sun on my windshield
Black 4Runner in the summer like a big deal
Apron at Starbucks
What you gonna miss, B
Nah, I smiled out, over the Mississippi
Got a friend out west
With a little studio time
Futon in the valley
And the dream gone wild
Ralph's turkey in the pouch
And Ramen in the cup
Check the funds in the account
When the pennies add up
Well, this fire in my chest weighs more like gold

For all on the quest
Let the story be told
Right from the soul

Driving the 101
My dream down to the bone
Your smile, your kiss
Every little part I miss
Baby, I'm trying to find a place where we belong

I got a buddy name Shawn
And a minivan too
CDs at our feet
How to tour no clue
Thousand cap room
And only eight people came
And five on the guest list were under my name
But I slayed every one from the bottom of my heart
Maybe there'll be sixteen here next time we start
So move with the wind
Fifty dollars in my pocket
Wait for the sun
That silver-lining rocket
Two traveling souls
Living on the road
To wayward kids livin' how they don't know
So we put it with the wind
We let it all unfold

Every favor that I got, I'm cashing in to use

So, Bullet was made
And I'm scared out my brain
And the song's getting played
And everythin' starts to change
People showing up singing along to what I say
And It feels like we might just be on our way

Check the crowd at the House of Blues
Like they're cardboard fakes
Everyone's livin' out loud
And down their mistakes
And these schizophrenic records that I love to make

I could hear the short breath that you're breathing
Said darling it's the way we fall, it's the way we fall

REFRAIN 
C’est ma ville la nuit
On rêve de belles sommes
Partout c’est le même sort
Malgré tous ces défauts, c’est ma zone
Et tu seras le bienvenu chez moi
Dans ma ville, la nuit, la haine nous dévore
Mais ça nous rend plus fort
On tue l’ennui dans le shit au sous-sol
Pour oublier ce que nous sommes

Minuit passé, y a que des putes et plus de cendrillon
Investis sur l’album, écoute la délinquance en échantillon
Y a des petits, des grands qui montent dans ce pays où la violence triomphe
Les règlements de compte au vingt-heure en disent long
C’est pour nos secteurs, les environs
Dédié aux coupables innocents en taule, à cause d’une balance qui se trompe
Ici ça trafique shit, coke, exta ou champignons
Parce que plus personne compte sur l’Euromillion
Y a ce côté chaud et froid qui fait qu’on se tue à la vodka et au Dillon
Demande si c’est la merde, mes khos te diront
De la maternité à la morgue, crois pas que le chemin soit aussi long
Mon son, les groupies l’ont, au bec un gros pillon
C’est pour les mecs de zone d’ombre qui traînent en petit nombre
Ca part en couille car le manque de conscience, la folie comble
J’esquive l’ambulance et le commico
Mon flow est au niveau, c’est du processus verbal braco, mino.

REFRAIN

En direct des quartiers difficiles, paroles explicites
Chez nous, même les culs de jatte font des délits de fuite
Des mecs se font canner, et c’est trop tard pour composer le dix-huit
Ici, y a que des princes de la récidive
Tout le monde regrette les années collège
Les collègues ont le choix entre l’abonnement de l’O.M. et celui des Baumettes
Plus on avance et plus on se dit que l’espoir est dead
C’est pas parce que l’accent est joli que l’histoire est belle
Avant de vouloir soulever des montagnes 
Je commence par savoir changer ma roue quand y a mon pneu qui crève sur un dos d’âne
Un-Trois, bitume matricule
Prises de sueur froide, les vielles ont peur de moi comme d’une canicule
On squatte sous l’abri-bus avec toute la tribu
C’est l’étiquette des voitures qui brûlent, qu’on nous attribue
Elle est moins belle la vie de la Côte d’Azur
Ne te fies pas aux cartes postales
L’odeur de la pisse, nous on l’assume

REFRAIN

Les bruits et les sirènes retentissent
Devant une belle, pour du sexe, les bandits s’attendrissent
Ca vole, ça mendie. On traîne tard en ville.
Esquive les flics pour voir notre argent sale blanchi pendant qu’en taule ça se branle et ça cantine
Représente les coins pas tranquilles
Sur la trajectoire de la balle que Satan tire
Passe la bouteille que je l’enquille
Tout va bien, je me jetterai pas dans le vide
Ce soir, c’est les hyènes face aux chiennes de Sarkozy
Tu veux sortir en boîte, en poche, y a pas un centime
Quand c’est la merde, faut apprendre à pas la sentir
Comme l’on très bien dit certains, dehors ça glisse donc gare à ton fils
Ou sois garanti qu’il atteindra pas trente piges
Ce flic apprenti flippe et s’attend au pire
Ce voyou fait grise mine et n’a pas le temps de fuir
Nombreuses seront les victimes, on va pas se mentir
Ne fais pas les fils si tu ne sais pas conduire.

And here we go yo, I think it was a Friday night
I was kicking it at my place, a'ight
I could feel my thigh vibrate, Sally's on my cell phone
She was at a club but she was by her self though
Sipping on a Bombay, telling me to drop by
I could be her hot date, Jiggy in the spot light
Karaoke contest, she was gonna rock mics
We could sing Beyoncé songs till the clock chimes
One in the morning and the party was boring
When I walked in Sally must have caught me yawning
She said ""Quit stalling boy meet me on the dance floor
I'ma cut a couple shapes up like a band saw""
So under the disco ball we all
Shake it like a Polaroid singing la-di-da

Get the whole block jumping to the latest jams
Rocking out to the sound of our favorite bands

We had Morg dog spinning so the party's hype
I saw my home girl Sally from across the way
An intelligent lady with a lot to say
She had a shimmer in her eyes and a smile to match
Skinny waist line but the style is fat
Just a glimpse of her face it could brighten the mood
Any place that she went she would light up the room
I was like ""let's bust a groove"", she said ""cool""
But she moves like she's rocking two busted shoes
She got two left feet and can't work the beat
She can't dance but Sally's still perfect to me

I find my Baby building a home.

Treat her right.

All of the love we gave
And now these hands are tied

I was screaming out at everything
Waiting for the walls to come down

Mateo,"Ich werd manch mal theatralisch volle Kanne maximal
Ihr braucht mir gar nichts sagen Abschiedsbriefe sind so 80er
Doch jetzt jetzt schmeiß' ich das Handtuch endgültig hin und streich die Siegel
Ich hab mal gelesen jeder verdient die Chance auf ein besseres Leben denn hier
Fall ich zusammen wie ein altes Haus die Wände kalt und grau ich schrei es raus 
Ich halt’s nich' aus ich will hier einfach raus einfach nur vergessen um zu vergessen 
Einfach fliegen wenigstens versuchen mit gebrochenen Flügeln
Sie sagten mir als Kind „Du wirst das Leben lieben“ sie haben gnadenlos gelogen 
Ich hab jahrelang gegraben am Ende des Regenbogens
Zücke mein Handy ein letztes Mal schreibe der Welt „Ich komme“
Fang von vorne an komme was wolle grüß‘ mir die Sonne

Ich hau ab
Einfach so
Lass alles stehn und liegen
Mach mich aus dem Staub
Einfach so
Mein Herz will wieder fliegen
Und ich lösch mein altes Leben
Aus den Augen aus dem Sinn
Und ich renne bis ich ankomm
Wo ich sein kann wer ich bin
Ich hau ab

Ich hab mehr Löcher als Taschen hab die Hoffnung verlorn 
Wer hat mein Lächeln versteckt man ich beginn noch mal von Vorn
Renn so weit wie die Beine mich Tragen auf steinigen Pfaden
Wind in den Armen ich kann’s nicht mehr ertragen die Lichter der Straßenleere
Gesichter die sagen „Ich schaff’s nich mehr, ich hör auf“
Auf der Stirn geschrieben mit dicken Buchstaben „Burnout“
Ironie des Schicksals alles cool alter bis man erfriert
Wie soll man denn sein Glück finden wenn man sich selbst verliert
Ich steh am Gleis nach nirgendwo versteh nur Bahnhof
Habe die Karte für den Schatz in meinem Herzen doch bin planlos
Wo ist die Liebe hin, wenn man sie braucht Ich hab sie lang nicht mehr gesehn
Ich bin nur gekommen um zu sagen dass ich geh
A dieu

Lass alles stehn und liegen

Wo ich sein kann wer ich bin

Einmal um die halbe Welt

Der führt zu mir - zurück zu mir

Mit Oma backen, spielen unter'm Apfelbaum und mit Opa ein Haus in die Wolken bau'n. 
Ihr habt mir gezeigt wie man läuft und grade steht
Das man für seine Taten grade steht
Es war nicht immer einfach ohne beide Eltern
nicht behütet mit Brüdern und Schwestern. 
Mama schenkte mir das Leben, sie war da für mich
Auch in schwierigsten Momenten hat sie mich geliebt. 
Es war wie im Paradies auch an dunklen Tagen
Und ich werd sie dafür immer in mei'm Herzen tragen.

The startling absence of motive it won't cause sway

Who will start the wave?

Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to

I've stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my way
And I wonder if I'll see another highway

I had a lover
I don't think I'll risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing so long

Then I'll stop my dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on corner stores
And count the time in quarter tones to ten
Please don't confront me with my failures
'Cause I have not forgotten them

Hadn't slept in day, close his eyes and he pray
Someone would miss him if he fell like a star out of space
But I'm sure they'll replace him, just a name and a face
They say they love you, but it's easy to fall from their graces
Live for everyone else gotcha losin' yourself
Why be slave when made to be free from the guilt?
To be free from the shame, you are more than a name
If you go down you got the freedom to get up again

[Chorus]

Every moment is passing; just let 'em go
In fifty years, man, who cares? We'll be super old
Many winners will lose, many heroes will fall
And if that's me I'm still (free from it all)

Mathieu Johann,"Y'a que maman qui m'emmenait à l'école
Les devoirs en pleurs, pas d'barbe qui console
Les Noëls à deux, ça fait pas gros
J'te demandais d'être là, d'venir sans cadeau
J'peux pas être triste, d'images j'en ai pas
T'es juste égoïste, il m'manque un bout de moi

T'as cassé son miroir, elle veut plus s'regarder

Les jours d’été, les jours d’hiver
Le temps passé a écouter tes belles histoires
J’te r’gardais dans les yeux 
J’avançais peu à peu

Les nuits d’été à m’faire la cour
Les belles années nous font rêver elles nous entourent
J’ai retrouvé le feu
Je vois la lueur dans tes yeux

Amène moé là
Amène moé où tu t’en vas
Où tu t’sens mieux 
Où on est tous les deux
Oh… ça me rappelait nous deux

Les belles soirées dans notre univers
À tant s’aimer, sans penser, sans aucun mystère
J’te donnerai ma vie 
Si seulement t’en a envie

Fais-moé chanter, fais-moé donc l’amour
On va s’rappeler la beauté de ce qu’est l’amour
Maintenant il faut partir
Pour le meilleur et pour le pire

In such a silence as I know
Or such great writing words as
Uttering overmuch
Stand helplessly before the spirit
At bay

I drove to the station in the pouring rain
Sat all night behind my big iron desk
The oil on the water made a rainbow

At the end of this bone white gravel road
They both lie sleeping on their feather bed
And their hair's as black as the sky at night
But her eyes are grey like the moon

Sia quel che sia questo messaggio d'amore per te
Se ho posato le mani su sguardi bruciati dal mare
E ho scalato le dune del cuore più alte di me
Se ho vissuto le notti sprecando la mia fantasia
è perché ero sola, confusa, smarrita, io

Mai, non ti ho avuto mai
In fondo mai, dolce amore mio, sensibile, credimi
Mai, proprio mai, non ti ho avuto mai
Anima mia, sai che ci sarò
Porta con te questo messaggio d'amore
Mai non ti ho avuto mai
Mai, proprio mai, non ti ho avuto mai
In fondo mai, dolce amore mio
Lascia che sia solo un messaggio d'amore
Un messaggio d'amore
Dovunque andrai sempre
Dovunque andrai",Messaggio d'Amore,2002
Matia Bazar,"La parola non è
Né sapore, né idea
Ma due occhi monelli
Petali d'orchidea
Se nana, ooh vive

Ti sento
La musica si muove appena
Ma è un mondo che mi scoppia dentro
Ti sento

Un brivido lungo la schiena
Un colpo che fa pieno centro
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o

Che mi resta di te
Della mia poesia
Mentre l'ombra del sonno
Lenta scivola via

Se nana
Oh vive
Oh

Ti sento
Bellissima statua sommersa
Seduti, sdraiati, panciati
Ti sento

Atlantide isola persa
Amanti soltanto accennati
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?

Ti sento
Deserto lontano miraggio
La sabbia che muove a cercarmi
Ti sento
Nell'aria un amore selvaggio
Vorrei incontrarti

Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?
Mi ami o no?

Ti sento
Vorrei incontrarti

Matisyahu,"The place lays phased like a warrior slayed
Engraved into the space with his sword still raised
Layers of charcoal sprayed through hallways
Praise relays off the walls echoing all ways

Dirt covered earth lays beneath my rib cage
Giving birth to overgrowth invading on to path ways
Burnt out trees cover streets where children once played
Sown seeds decay through sacred stepping stones in disarray
Where the alter used to be placed inter-changed for bloodstains
Sunrays illuminate the smoke filled haze
Trace of incense scents of sacrifice stayed

Chorus:
Aish tamid eternally
A fire burns continuously
Wondering where you been
Won't you come on home to me?

Flash back patches of grass growing wild in fact
Cracked walls burnt black like a kingdom sacked
Memories like artifacts attacked yet still intact
Melodies wrapped in glass and shatter with the impact

Air intermingling ringing with the singing
of songs once sung, hung, flung into the rafters
Catastrophe struck the sound stuck
Disaster plastered
The aftermath a blasted building once standing, like a starved man fasting
the skies expanding clouds passing, dust particles dancing,
in broken bars of light, streaming from a shaft, slashed into the ceiling,
Sshhhh, you could feel the ground breathing.

Chorus

Daughter of Zion is lying crying in the mist
Morning light slips in, shifting through the darkness
Like a morning wife reminisce having visions of her long gone prince
Memories drip rain drops tip towing emptiness
Intermixed with tears like fears left unfixed
Walls worn thin frozen fortress like dawn waiting for the sunrise of a day that got skipped
Like a life gone wrong wandering wilderness
Lovesick stripped abyss empty once luscious

Chorus

Paint the scene so you could see, the city's picking up speed
On a bench 14th street, taxi's streaming yellow streaks
Spears piercing through my ears, you could hear the traffic speak
Jack hammers drill smacking through the cracking concrete
Buildings filled with windowsills spilled tangled telephone wires
Signs sparking neon lights flash like wild fire
My insides rise I start to feel paralyzed
Let out a sigh-a melody blew by- like an ancient war cry
the way the sunlight hit the trees it really caught my eye,
glistening' listening' to the breeze dancing' through the leaves,
freeze, the city move's in slow motion like a dream

I'm left empty like the temple turned into a fox den
Bus fumes dripping spitting into city summer sun
Sifting through the ash dimly lit vision listening
To the hiss lifting off a nighttime ocean
Shim, shim, shimmering singing hair on my skin
Glim, glim. Glimmering, whispering where ya been

From amidst the darkness set sail with the softness
Breeze traveling across the seas arisen from with in Mt. Zion
Wind coming in picking up momentum
Cutting crisply through the thickness riding on a rhythm
A rollercoaster sizzling, twisting down the mountain
ripping rocket ship exploding like a fountain
overflowing spilling through the courtyards of Jerusalem
Uncovering debris lifting up the fallen arisen within
to reach the yiddin even in Manhattan
exposed menorah glowing in the shadows of destruction
trailblazing through affliction
brushing off the branches golden
standing strong flames
dancing like a lion roaring rising out of nothing",Aish Tamid,2005

Like this, Like this.
It?s the music that grows all the illusion and fears.
It?s the music that makes the confusion become clear.
It?s the music that I live, these 18 years.
It?s the music I give my blood, sweat, and tears.
Not to mention some lifer,
Did I mention I like her?
Then the rest of the cipher man it?s not hard to decipher.
Music gets people hyper,
Music made me a riper.
Music made me a fighter.
Yo man, pass me the lighter.
It?s the fire that igniter, shot it right in the sky.
Look me right in the eye.
Hey yo kid, you want to fly.
The why-o, the n-ya, from N.Y. to egg white.
You cannot deny so why even try.
My mother sang songs to kids in concentration.
His mother sang songs inside the cotton plantation.
Her mother sang songs while we were robbin the nation.
Now I sing songs for much more then an occupation.
I am the music.
We are the music.
I am the music.
You are the music
Austin is the music.
Texas is the music.
We are the mu-sic.


Yo I take two steps forward.
Taking one step back.
Every time I think I am on track, Life fades to black.
Now I pick the slack and attack faster then a rapper on crack.
Feel my knack and just spit.
I bet there?s more triplets 'cause rap has hit vicious.
My style is more delicious the eggnog.
You wish this kid would vanish, so?s his family,
And my spirit needs fitness, that why I flip this.
Yo so I held back the life and blown and feeling.
Alright surprising people 'cause I drowned last night.
Here I am one more time,
My rhymes are at your shine.

Let your brain unravel.

Split this wilderness listen up this ain't where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down; chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Time flies by like clouds passing in the sky lifetimes hear and gone like the blink of an eye
March through this desert one-step at a time, march through the desert one step at a time

Chorus: From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax,
Drop the staff Moshe rabbainu split the ocean in half,
March through the desert this ain't where it's at
Chop 'em down, Chop 'em down

Patterns engraved not so easily erased, still wandering trying to find your place
Playing the game I see pain on your face now a day's the yiddin like children sold as slaves
Strange ways running through the maze, strange ways always lost in the desert trying to
find to find your place lost in the desert trying to find your place

From the forest itself comes the hand for the ax
Split this wilderness listen up this ain't where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down; chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Joseph descended sold as a slave,
thrown into a dungeon cause he wouldn't be swayed
Interpreted pharaoh's dreams and Egypt was saved
stock piled food for seven years of rain
then sold to all the nations when the drought came
Joseph rose to power and the yiddin stayed
They started to build and success was made
Pharos getting worried let's make them pay bound in chains
First born was sent down to their graves
Moshe was saved and a prince he was raised
Hashem spoke to him hears a message to relay
Take my Nation from Mitzrayim (Egypt) I see the suffering
Hard hearts ego breaks take sparks and make way
Trail blaze through the wasteland breaking the chains
Last generation just the ruminants
March through the desert leaving footprints
Peel off the lid this is just plastic, get into it, get into it
Heavy hitter stepping solid never quitter jump into the ocean before it split got a jump into it
Rip through Egypt rip through it,
get into it, 600,000 witnessed it, no you didn't forget
In the spiritual desert things are not what they seem

Each and every day I pray to get to know you please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till twilight
Said, thank you to my God, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I

My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my God, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now

Strippin’ away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high, bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy, and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Searching up to the sky and looking beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
You keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray,
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my God, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now, time we start revealing

My love will rip a skylight in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I

My word is like a hammer like a shattering rock,
crack through your heart and take the evil apart

From the end of the earth unto you I call, time and again I fall, back to you I crawl
You have been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy
Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times
You can't have my heart I'm taking back what's mine
I know it lie just smoke in your eye and you saved my soul from the other side

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me
For you have been a refuge

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall
May the king answer you on the day that you call
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled,

For you I wait silently (his majesty)

My distress you will relieve 
Shield me on the path that's dark and slippery

To say that I'm living in a fantasy

Jerusalem, if I forget you,
Let my right hand forget what it's supposed to do.

In the ancient days, we will return with no delay
Picking up the bounty and the spoils on our way
We've been traveling from state to state
And them don't understand what they say
3,000 years with no place to be
And they want me to give up my milk and honey
Don't you see, it's not about the land or the sea
Not the country but the dwelling of his majesty

Years gone by, about sixty
Burn in the oven in this century
And the gas tried to choke, but it couldn't choke me
I will not lie down, I will not fall asleep
They come overseas, yes they're trying to be free
Erase the demons out of our memory
Change your name and your identity
Afraid of the truth and our dark history
Why is everybody always chasing we
Cut off the roots of your family tree
Don't you know that's not the way to be

Fire not gonna come from me tongue.

Let my right hand forget what it's supposed to do.

Caught up in these ways, and the worlds gone craze
Don't you know it's just a phase

If I forget the truth then my words won't penetrate
Babylon burning in the place, can't see through the haze
Chop down all of them dirty ways,
That's the price that you pay for selling lies to the youth
No way, not OK, oh no way, not ok, hey
Ain't no one gonna break my stride
Ain't no one gonna pull me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Stay alive

Matisyahu,"We're the reflection of imperfection,
We come from the infinite place of limatation.
Rejoice in these days, make our corrections,
We're the completion.

Lights out,
I'm down for the count,
I can't get up, and
Meanwhile the enemy schemes to spoil your stuff,
And the legs of the king are taggled up in a rut,
Fallen pieces, lost sparks, hearts cut.

We're not alone in the madness,
If we're here, the so are you,
Deepest caverns underground,
We've been taken for the truth,
Scraped my knees on the hurdles, face down in a puddle.

Only one will get us out of this mess,
The one that put us here.
I got a spear driven through my ear,
Can't you hear the sound, crystal clear, crystals crashing chandliers.
Long for brooks of water like a deer.

A man is just a man,
Full of faults and weakness,
4 am, jerusalem all alone and speechless.
And night time, no bodies home, roam streets in darkness.
I feel I'm just a man, flesh and bones, homeless.

Planting seeds, they won't sink in.
I'm dried up, like the desert earth, how do these seeds give birth.
Water me down, liquify, so that I may not be cursed.
From one into a billion disperse.

Wisdom rains like water from the heavens to below.
Crush my earth, seeds grow, gardens starts to grow.
You know you gotta rise, although you like to flow.
You can't keep staring out the window.

Earth, water, wind, fire we stay low while getting higher.
Spark in night, a fight, tireously.
While yidden lighten loads.
Fly alive, weep, wail, change, grounded out inside.
Energized by my last thought as children pass me by.

Rise, to the occassion.
Keep these hearts all blazin.
Build your life on a river of wax.
Melt into space, we've been here since the beginning, not going away.
Not going away.....

Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on Mount Zion
Rub me the wrong way, taking the highway
Rubbing sticks together but your fire's man made

Capitalize on hot air, soar like an airplane
Yearn to rise in the sky quick high like cocaine
False pride is suicide but you've got nothing to gain
Babylon's buildings raise like flames

Drowning in their champagne
Explosion pulled the pin in the hand grenade
Soul stain blowing up in your own domain
Fire crackers oh and ah but they never maintain

Fires burning, flames are dancing
Don't burn the house down Lord
Heavenly fire only resides
On an alter made from the ground

Fire descends on high
In the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride
And ride on to Mount Zion

Fire descends on high
In the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride
And ride on to Mount Zion

One pair of eyes
But see two different things
One person cries
But the other one sings

You walk around
Like everybody owes ya something
Take what you got
Thank G-d for all that life brings

The poor man has it all
But not content with anything
While the rich man's hands are empty
But he's sitting like a kind

Fires burning, flames are dancing
Don't burn the house down Lord
Heavenly fire only resides
On an alter made from the ground

Backpack's getting heavy
Moving at a steady pace
Carrying bricks on your shoulders
And lead around your waist

Making way, run in haste
There is no time to taste what you ate
We should be grateful got a plateful
Fire burns like ice morsels falling fire like rain

Fire descends on high
In the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride
And ride on to Mount Zion

Fire descends on high
In the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride
And ride on to Mount Zion

Matisyahu,"The world is moving to the song I hear,
Who's that singing, wind is rushing in my ear,
Mind gushing memories almost lost everything,
Felony and fellows running in my dream,
We were in the van where the hits were driving,
Saw myself In the highlands at age 13
And I'm asking questions to the present day me,
Moving backwards down the hill see we were posting.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

I don't need to glorify,
Ate the apple of the tree and tried to lie,
In the garden I'll remember
That's when I started to sing
I said death brings life into uncertain things,
Cut some slack for me
Sun setting autumn breeze
Sound is moving like a chorus
Keep hearing that melody,
Check the radio but there's nothing playing,
Check the radio again but there's nothing playing.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

Rewind!

Swing low, sweet chariot of flames
Change my name, yo!
It was always the same,
Till if only what you find when you climb,
Check the radio but of all that shines there's no time,
My life is making your mind work in overtime,
But along the line you'll have to pay for the crime.
Slow it down, you turbo too soon,
Vroom vroom then you want to blast off unto the moon,
But you might get trapped in a temple of doom,
You might get trapped in a temple of doom.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go

Matisyahu,"On the way into this world, our soul was born in two
Searching for you, I been searching for you
Where ya been, where ya running to
Where ya got to go, what ya got to do

Lift us up to the heavens, for a birds eye view

Other half of my soul, you are my queen

Other half of my soul, roots of my tree

We could forget about galus for a while, our troubles for a while
Sometimes I look at you and just smile, sit in the park and just laugh all day
Sometimes I just lose it with the things that you say, waiting by the subway
But we missed the train, well take the next one if you can pull me away
Keep me cool down to earth, and no anxiety
Stay Matis with the humble heart always

One woman for me
Other half of my soul, you are my queen
One woman for me
Other half of my soul, roots of my tree

Sunlight or clouds, its all the same
Don't need no umbrella, when we're walking in the rain

So smart and sharp, a soul lovely
And beauty shine bright, yes you're there for me
Keep the ways of our fathers, how way it use to be
Moving forward, don't mean erase our history

Dedicated to your life, bigger than you or me

To seize knowledge we don't need, I forgot my late pass
But I'm early to a arival beatbox, you got raps?
Meet me on the football field, don't sleep on field, the quarterback
No one clapped when we locked in, it was removal of our class
But my flag got captured and I fell between the cracks
My tool for inspiration turned into a handicap
No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fill the gaps
Those whipper snappers, they got trapped old chap
They lost the way, they never had the right map
Needed a sneak attack to slap the demons off my back
So I packed for the schddle dreamed big I wouldn't settle
Put the pedal to the metal and returned to fundamentals
I'll never forget running through the hall with all y'all rebels
Roaming through the high land, young bucks invincible
Echoes in my brain, if kids report to the principle
Substance dulls the mind
Traife wine clouds the heart
You can't sew a stitch with one hand
While you're taking it apart
Bright lights might look nice
But they sure won't make you sharp
You can't sew a stitch with one hand
While you're taking it apart

Yeah, misty morning and my mum's a mess
To make matters worse dog my pops is stressed
Life is a test, make the grade or catch an F
Now death is all that's left to ponder
I wander off hoping to catch my breath

Yeah, misty morning and my mum's a mess
To make matters worse dog my pops is stressed
Life is a test, make the grade or catch an F
Now death is all that's left to ponder
I wander off hoping to catch my breath
And hold it, mold my memories from untold scripts
And roll up in a tornado twist, now I'm certain
There's a pertinent reason I'm on this earth
Seasons change in white plains, but we remain alert
When new school years appear, fools fear for a failure
And crawl away in tears
I play Popeye the Sailor and stay with spinach
We walk the halls with a grimace
Yeah they gossip in groups
I try to mind my business and tell the truth
For instance, I listen, see it all with basketball court vision
Ignoring ignorance in fields of fiction
We lean back in the calmest position
And embrace the honesty found within our tension

What's good?

Substance dulls the mind
Traife wine clouds the heart
You can't sew a stitch with one hand
While you're taking it apart
Bright lights make you blind
But they sure don't leave you sharp
You can't sew a stitch with one hand
While you're taking it apart

Trapped in the elevator of your mind
Is it real, what will you find behind the door
Your imaginations put you in a bind
Around you there's a cloud of gloom
Swallow the key, lock yourself in a room
Can't see outside of your Universe

No more war, there won't be anymore hunger
No jealousy, not even competition

Let go, release, you hold the keys
Time we evaporate into the breeze
We are nothing, we are something
Let go, release, you hold the keys
It's time we evaporate into the breeze

Matisyahu,"From the forest itself comes the hand for the ax
Split this wilderness listen up this ain't where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down; chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Time flies by like clouds passing in the sky lifetimes hear and gone like the blink of an eye
March through this desert one-step at a time, march through the desert one step at a time

From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax,
Drop the staff Moshe rabbainu split the ocean in half,
March through the desert this ain't where it's at
Chop 'em down, Chop 'em down

Patterns engraved not so easily erased, still wandering trying to find your place
Playing the game I see pain on your face now a day's the yiddin like children sold as slaves
Strange ways running through the maze, strange ways always lost in the desert trying to
Find to find your place lost in the desert trying to find your place

From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax,
Drop the staff Moshe rabbainu split the ocean in half,
March through the desert this ain't where it's at
Chop 'em down, Chop 'em down

Joseph descended sold as a slave,
Thrown into a dungeon cause he wouldn't be swayed
Interpreted pharaoh's dreams and Egypt was saved
Stock piled food for seven years of rain
Then sold to all the nations when the drought came
Joseph rose to power and the yiddin stayed
They started to build and success was made
Pharos getting worried let's make them pay bound in chains
First born was sent down to their graves
Moshe was saved and a prince he was raised
Hashem spoke to him hears a message to relay
Take my Nation from Mitzrayim (Egypt) I see the suffering
Hard hearts ego breaks take sparks and make way
Trail blaze through the wasteland breaking the chains
Last generation just the ruminants
March through the desert leaving footprints
Peel off the lid this is just plastic, get into it, get into it
Heavy hitter stepping solid never quitter jump into the ocean before it split got a jump into it
Rip through Egypt rip through it,
Get into it, 600,000 witnessed it, no you didn't forget
In the spiritual desert things are not what they seem
Snakes camouflaged just fit the scene
Put your faith in a mirage it's just a smoke screen
The king is sitting on his thrown of glory

You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe

I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee

Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till midnight

And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

If you're trying to stay high then you're bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Looking up to the sky and searchin' beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
Yes, you keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray,
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now so it's time we start revealing

People say I'm lazy dreamin' my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
When I tell them I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time boy you're no longer on the ball

I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on that merry-go-round

Concrete jungle burn down Babylon

Hazy rice sunny days puff fly a kite afraid to face the night

I'll be coming yes I'm running oh I'm on my way
Just stay and I'll be there by the break of day

Matisyahu,"I told her you must go you can't stay here
She said, ""I know since the death blow
My soul's been old like sand, I'm so tired
It's like my spirit expired""

Remember when I was just a child, yeah
Now I feel like a star at daybreak
'Bout to expire and get lost in the sun
Me and you we got to leave and just run and run

Don't wait for me while I'm down
'Cause I might not get up
All I have is right now
Gonna give you what I got

You are the o-only good thing that I have ever done
We will walk until my blood runs out
Until my heart is burnt you are not alone

(You are the only good thing that I have ever done)
Run, yeah, run, yeah, running away, come we stun you here to stay
Up and down so look both ways trying to live most everyday
If you don't well that's okay, bound to the one and will not sway

Found again his majesty record power radio play (we will walk until my blood runs out)
Climb and climb to outer space, give and take, it's time to taste
Make the best, don't leave no waste (until my heart is burnt you are not alone)
World moves fast, don't lose your place
Wanna build tall, gotta have a strong base
And play like kids and meditate

He sits on top of a mountain
Pumping blood through the veins of creation
Land and sky, he aches for her
But can't find his way, can't live no more

And I ache for her but can't find my way
I can't live no more, she is not alone
Just before the light goes away comes a child
That collects all the reasons to be

The laughs, the smiles, moments of clarity
Exchanging them for another day
Exchanging them for another day
And so my heart continues to say

You are the only good thing that I have ever done
We will walk until my blood runs out
Until my heart is burnt you are not alone

(You are the only good thing that I have ever done)
Here we go, it's you and me, gotta let go, gotta believe
Rip through negativity, find some place where we can be
Oh, I agree inevitably we can't stay here, it's time to leave

We will walk until my blood runs out (slip and slide the day has come)
Until my heart is burnt you are not alone (undone, bottoms up don't be a crumb, undumb)

(You are the only good thing that I have ever done)
She said, ""We got to go, we can't stay here""
I said,"" I know but got no place to go
The nights are cold and we need a place to be""

(We will walk until my blood runs out, (until my heart is burnt you are not alone))
Remember when I was just a child
Now I feel like a star at daybreak 'bout to expire
And get lost in the sun
Me and you we gotta leave and just run and run

(You are the only good thing that I have ever done)
Run and run, run and run away
We can't stay, we can't stay

We will walk until my blood runs out (run, run)
Until my heart is burnt you are not alone",We Will Walk,2009
Matisyahu,"The world is moving to the song I hear,
Who's that singing, wind is rushing in my ear,
Mind gushing memories almost lost everything,
Felony and fellows running in my dream,
We were in the van where the hits were driving,
Saw myself In the highlands at age 13
And I'm asking questions to the present day me,
Moving backwards down the hill see we were posting.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

I don't need to glorify,
Ate the apple of the tree and tried to lie,
In the garden I'll remember
That's when I started to sing
I said death brings life into uncertain things,
Cut some slack for me
Sun setting autumn breeze
Sound is moving like a chorus
Keep hearing that melody,
Check the radio but there's nothing playing,
Check the radio again but there's nothing playing.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

Rewind!

Swing low, sweet chariot of flames
Change my name, yo!
It was always the same,
Till if only what you find when you climb,
Check the radio but of all that shines there's no time,
My life is making your mind work in overtime,
But along the line you'll have to pay for the crime.
Slow it down, you turbo too soon,
Vroom vroom then you want to blast off unto the moon,
But you might get trapped in a temple of doom,
You might get trapped in a temple of doom.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sun ray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel it's for real tell me what you know.

I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go

Matisyahu,"Say from the forest itself comes the handle for the ax
Split this wilderness, listen, I'm not missing where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Chop 'em down, chop 'em down chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Said time flies by like clouds passing in the sky
Lifetimes even gone in the blink of an eye
March through the desert one step at a time
March through the desert one step at a time

Said from the forest itself comes the handle for the ax
Drop the staff Moshe Rabbeinu split the ocean in half
March through the desert, this ain't where it's at
Said chop 'em down, Chop 'em down, chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Said patterns engraved not so easily erased
Still wandering trying to find your place
Playing the game I see pain on your face
Now a day's the Yidden like children sold as slaves
Strange ways running through the maze, strange ways always
Lost in the desert trying to find your way
Lost, lost in the desert trying to find your way

From the forest itself comes the handle for the ax
Split this wilderness, listen, I'm not missing where it's at
Clear a path so that you could find your way back
Said chop 'em down, chop 'em down chop 'em down, chop 'em down

Yosef descended sold as a slave
Thrown into a dungeon 'cause he wouldn't be swayed
Interpreted Pharaoh's dreams and Egypt was saved
Stockpiled food for seven years of rain
Sold to all the nations when the drought came
Yosef rose to power and the Yidden stayed
They started to build and success was made
Pharaoh is getting worried, let's make them pay
Bound in chains, firstborn was sent down to their graves
Moshe was saved and a prince he was raised
Hashem spoke to him, ""here's a message to relay
Take my Nation from Mitzrayim I see the suffering""
Hard hearts ego breaks take sparks and make way
Trail blaze through the wasteland breaking the chains

Last generation just the remnants
Peel through the desert leaving footprints
Peel off the lid this is just plastic, lord
Get into it, get-get into it
Said heavy hitter stepping solid never quitter 
Jump into the ocean before it split got a jump into it
Jump-jump into the ocean, jump into it
Rip-rip through Egypt rip through it
Six hundred thousand witnessed it, no you didn't forget
No you didn't forget
Rip-rip through Egypt rip through it
Said rip-rip through Egypt, yo

Remember my ways 
Oh, will I ever get out of my cage? 
Yes, I am a slave 

Searching for some freedom 
Searching for some freedom 

So intend to sing them 
Songs to spark memory 
What is a man with no history? 
Who am I?
Where am I? 
What is this place? 
We're just spinning in space 

I will be light 
I will be light 
I will be light 
I will be light, oh mama, light some

Time will continue without you 
So in the end 
It's not about you 
But what did you do? 
Who do you love besides you?
Beside you, many died in the name of vanity 
Many die, in their mind's eye, for justice 
We die for you 
And still do, so I say to you 
This is nothing new 

I will be light, oh mama
I will be light
I will be light, hey mama

Burn away the darkness, you got

Matisyahu,"You're all that I have and you're all that I need
Each and every day I pray to get to know you please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till midnight
Said, thank you to my God, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my god all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now so it's time we start revealing

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now

Strip away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high then you're bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Looking up to the sky and searchin' beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
Yes, you keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray,
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now so it's time we start revealing

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to you from the essence of my being
Sing to my God all these songs of love and healing
Want Moshiach now

And see, I lift up my eyes where my help come from
And I seen it circling around from the mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest
You keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest

And the days when our children play
Now they been crushed like grapes
There ain't no escape
This is your place, this is your kingdom
This is your face, broken reflection

We're burning in a burnt down house
We burned this house a long time ago

Silent victim from bite of regret
Sick with a symptom of a name we forget
Forgotten skeleton, no dignity left
Unforgiven, we are forgotten
So
Fill with the venom of an ancient fire that burned our kingdom
The day the high priest sang the anthem
This is your place, this is your kingdom
This is your face, broken reflection
Who have we become, what will we become?
One day the moon will shine like the sun
And our hearts will feel the love and be numb

Separated from the king
Now the water's gushing and you keep trying to swim against the stream
It seems like you're not moving, the many waters gushing you gasp for air

You're a king without his throne
Don't ya know it's time to come home
Found his people you're alone
I'm done tryin' this, I'm done tryin' that
It comes down to this, it came down to that
I look up look down the world's not black
It's time to get out of this track

Strike the match, light the flame
It could never be the same
Light two candles
We fight through the night
Run this race
There's no end in sight
Together we can handle this
We can make it all alright
I'm here for you, are you here for me
We can just be

Look for me, I'm all over the place
Lookin' up into your clouds searchin' for a face
They say I may be just a crazy fool
But my DNA, runs thick like blood
An I'll be stuck in the mud, trudging through the quicksand
A man with a plan so stand and deliver

With my eyes on the prize and my hands reaching up to the sky
They wanna know why with my life on the line
Like my mothers and fathers one thousand times
And it's bound to repeat or you're gon' go back to the earth
This a noun for the sound
One day, I'll leave it all behind
I am yours, you are mine
There's no reason, there's no rhyme
There's no logic in these lines
It's above this space in time
It's above all of their minds
When the time comes I'll close mine
Open up your eyes

Light two candles
We fight through the night
Run this race
There's no end in sight
Together we can handle this
We can make it all alright
I'm here for you, are you here for me
We can just be
Be, we can just be and breathe easily

Strike the match, light the flame
Light two candles

Well exactly what that mean? you needn't make it clearer
Does it mean that the rich are gonna finally start to share up

This far I've done lost my mind
Only to find the other side

Is where the world opens wide
To descend these city streets late at night
I've been searching for my bite
They say I inspired, but I'm still looking for my fire
These lies have got me tired
I'm free falling, I'm done stalling
I'm done crawling up this mountain top
I won't stop till I manifest my craft
The top is close
I'm sky scraping
They stay chasing
I'm like racing in the Sun, I'm running from depths
They're done, I'm going gray
I'm still young having mystic visions
Of the one, I hear the hum, the melody comes
Rushing in like some wind
Cuts close like a knife

All I got I got I got

I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high

Now the rain is falling drizzle dropping on the street
Cleaning off the dirt beneath my feet
I got the speed on repeat
While I'm riding subway trains on a fact
Over tracks to go crack, my heart's black
But intact I've come to take the music back
I'm moving forward this time you can't ignore it
Put the pedal to the floor
Let's take you off
Through the time that has come
The time has come I launch orbit
I'm tight rope
Walking over fire with flames, yeah hot coals
I'm like water for you trolls
I pay no tolls
Speak to ghosts
Time to go high
The cross that you walk by
Got my eye into
I'll magic fly off on the broom
Which is true,
I'm at the crossroads, but I'll give my soul
It's already old

Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high
Crossroads, one million miles
I'm kicking up dirt when I'm flying high

I'm a slave to the throne
The chariot, the flames, it's my home
I'm in a class of my own
Lights out, you're all alone, with your heart of stone

Into trenches hence my invention

Fading colors melt the skies
Shifting winds, sand storms of time
I am yours, you are mine
I am love, play my strings
Play my heart, my memories
I am the song of your glory
I am the splitting of the sea
Am I built to survive?
Fading colors melt the skies
Shifting winds, sands of time
I am yours, you are mine

We flow together like OM
Flesh, blood, it animates poem
Eventually we gravitate home
It's been a long time, it was hard on my soul
But I know you've been good though
Still alive, giving thanks what we should do
The pride is a snake that can hook you
Hey young world
I know you've been put through
All the struggle makes it worthwhile
The clouds go away when your soul smiles
The smile rises up from a dungeon
Locked away so long, let the sun in
The radiance runs in
Humanity's veins, be the change, so abundant
I feel the wave coming
We built to survive
Be the chosen among them

Am I built to survive?
Fading colors melt the skies
Shifting winds, sand storms of time
I am yours, you are mine
I am love, play my strings
Play my heart, my memories
I am the song of your glory
I am the splitting of the sea",Built to Survive,2014

Matisyahu,"""Of David.Annotate Do not compete with the wicked; do not envy those who commit injustice. For like grass they will soon wither, like green vegetation. Trust in the Lord and do good, then you will abide in the land and be nourished by faith. Delight in the Lord, and He will guard your desires and needs, and take care of you. You reveal your righteousness like a light, and your judgments are on high. Depend on the Lord and hope for Him; compete not with the prosperous, with the man who invents evil schemes. Let go of anger, abandon rage; do not compete with one who intends only to harm. For the evildoers will be cut down; but those who hope in the Lord, they will inherit the earth.""

I just wanna talk to You now
This is for the One
You kept me alive
And so I thank You

Moses is on his way down town
Yoshua maintaining the fountain
Right about now I should be over Chicago, lights out the window
Levee breaks, flow like diamonds
All these babies crying, ideas flying around
It’s time to come down from the mountain
Welcome home, just stick to the plan
But how can I be like the stars and sand?
It's only man who commands
He put this one in our hands
Two tabs of stone, I'm alone while these fans keep circling
Over the land like helicopter blades, I crave some breeze
Will you wait, wait for me, please?
Forty days and forty nights, but I can't stand much more
So you think you understand what’s pure and impure?
Now it's pouring my soul on the floor
You think ya know so much, that I'm so out of touch
I tossed in the crutch to the אֵשׁ תָּמִיד
I walk with a limp, with a wound that bleeds
While all these animals feed with their envy and greed
Smoke marijuana seed
Wanna chop this tree
Cut me down, pressure to concede
And give in to what they believe is me
But I'ma fight, I'm a light, I'm the glory of the King
I'm the song that you sing, the melody that you bring
Sharp teeth and venom that stings not gonna bring me to my knees
I'm a fish in this here sea, evil eye won't get at me
I just want to finish this thing
Not gonna bring me to my knees
I'm going down, down to go up
From the pits to מצרים, from the dungeon to the kingdom
To my stage offering, can't give up and won't give in
I am the blood of Jacob and I'll keep struggling
Like Joseph, my brothers wanna sell me out
I had the dream, time to leave the doubt
Multicolored coat with blood on my sleeves
Best believe it ain't from no beasts
Got no car, I walked around this reservoir
This is David’s heart, rainbow-colored cry
From the end to the start, this is David’s heart
A rainbow-colored cry from the end to the start
Phantoms and ghosts, raise your glass and make a toast

This is for the One

Matisyahu,"Sick for so long
I forgot this feeling
When ya wake up in the morning
With your heart still bleeding
With the wolves at ya heals
When ya spark is buried, buried deeply
Burning from the bottom
Cracked open and weeping
That's how you singin' softly
Brooms be on the street now
Sweeping up the broken crowns
Glass in ya feet now
Remove it from ya feet now
Remove it from your back of the sidewalk

Like fire and water
Sun rays on the ocean waves
Fathers and daughters
Now ya gotta relate
Sun rays on the ocean waves

Hey kid, what it is, yea
I know what it is, yea
When ya got melodies and heart disease
Ingredients that won't let ya be
Ya just wanna sing 'em
Air 'em out, let 'em breathe
Words drippin' like honey from the heavens
That ain't mine
What's this
Welling up on the inside, baby
I'm about to come with it
Gettin' higher then a whip it
You know like from the dentist
It's time to go the distance
My vision is the sickest
You're eyes they sparkle
My love it glistens

And I burn another day, and I move like the prince slay the dragons in my way

I'll be gone 'til whenever

I turned 34
I live by the moon
In the shade for real

Left side
Victory is near
Broken circles
Incomplete dreams

In the box
Out the box
Covered in tar
But I'll always be your

Breaking out
Listening close
Dancing on tables
With my hands in the air

Lead from with in
In a box in the sky
Flying over the night

End of the world

Wings spread

The reapers close and the willows weap
And they wail try and fail you will win one day
If I may raise my soul from purgatory
And go dance on a wave
While the people wave and the mountains raise
Speak the truth must come from a slave
Smoked more trees then a forest
Fire till that ish got tired now I let the ish
Retire gettin higher then a mountain climber
Lower then a lawn mower chopping down
The cypher circle up its circle time
Stiff neck with aches in my spine
Weak from the smoke and I'm tired from the wine
Energy come back to me now come back
Take time what's mine claim my place and my name
Moonlight shines in your eyes

Fiscalité frauduleuse
Les erreurs de facturation

D’obscène à fréquentable
Me revoici dans l'arène 
A tapiner de table en table
Au grand bal des mécènes

M’accueille à nouveau dans ses bras

That there's no room for your here boy in my reality

I watch the sun going down
While I stand on sacred ground.
Where once the night found us.
In the twilight of our love.
You said you'd meet me here.
But I'm all alone.
You sounded so sincere.
Well did you lead me on.

I told the starry sky to wait for you.
I told the wind to sigh like lovers do.
I even told the night that you were true.
And you would be here soon.
And now I'm lying to the moon.

And so the night takes me in.
Like a sympathetic friend.
And sends away the trees.
And the willow weeps for me.
The shadows fool my eyes.
And I think I see you.
Then they start to cry.
Don't you know that they believed you

Saturday, I drove into town
In the co-op where your friends hang out
I heard one say ""What's she doing here?""
Well, I held my head up high, swallowed my bitter tears.

Yesterday at the hardware store
They said ""I'm sorry, you don't have no credit anymore""
Well I walked out of there trying so hard to think
Of another way that I could fix the kitchen sink

Got into the truck and it wouldn't start
Is it any wonder that I'm falling apart?
Oh, I'm just another one of the things you left undone.

Well I got home and went out to get the mail
Walked back down the driveway with another pile of bills
I need a job, boy, one more than I have
Last night I fell asleep looking through the wanted ads.

Woke up this morning on the pillow you left
Laughed a little crazy as I made up the bed
It's just another one of the things you left undone.

I'm still finishing what I didn't start
I'm still mending on this broken heart

Have gat men coming; have 'em running from me
Where them missiles come from?

And we'll be holding onto each other

Matt,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,2004

Let's cut down the day
In this green rusty van
Like a red Cadillac
Top down, shoulders tan

I bought my first watch
But it feels all wrong
Let's wait out the day
Bring the heat along

And when the timing's right
Hold up, wait
We'll pull to the side
Arms up, count it down
Just like

Five, four, three, two, one
The checkered flag
Means we've just begun
Let's cut it down
Let's cut it down

And we cut down
The day in my old van
Count down from

Throw our shoes into the ocean
Lay back and wave through the daylight
Sit back and wave through the daylight

Slip and slide on subway grates
These shoes are poor mans ice skates
Fall through like change in the daylight
Fall through like change in the daylight

I miss yellow lines in my roads
Some color on monochrome
Maybe I'll paint them in myself
Maybe I'll paint them in myself

These sidewalks liquid then stone
Building walls and an old pay phone
It rings like all through the daylight
It rings like all through the daylight

And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
I hope that someday I'll see without these frames
And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
'Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home

I have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I'll just unplug it for today
Ill just unplug it for today

Open hydrant rolled down windows
This car might make a good old boat
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight

And with just half of a sunburn
New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time
Step back and here comes the night time

A pair of old boxing gloves
In a new fight
Where every single scar
Well it means something to me
As if life wrote down my history

bottles and road signs
Sound like tires on bent wheels
Our hands and feet and ordinary thrills
When we unlocked all the doors
Just so we could finally breathe
Just so we could sew down these torn up sleeves

here we stand with a wolf like shadow
Here we stand in the end
Hey New York here's our wolf like shadow
Hey New York our old friend

this roof could be my bed
Blankets feel like the night sky
Blankets feel better the heavier they get
Red lights can mean go
I'll take us home
I'll take us home
Cut down the blinds from my windows

Remembered this is my life
With my hands over my head
Friends by my side

And the good ones were all wrong

Thinking about tomorrow won't change how

'cause broken legs can be replaced
Two steps to the finish line
Three sips till I finish mine

And wait to be called

Thoughts so strong
I feel them when you're gone

And I tried them out from bed

But it begins to rain
You forgot how dark it stains
Thought it was a drought

La la la, leave it all behind
La la la, see the fight
La la la, make the best of it
La la la, and goodnight

Left turn look both ways
Take breaks on cloudy days
With miles and miles of roads
How'd you know which ones have holes?
I'm glad we didn't stay

La la la, until the end

Well I just sit here tonight and you always by my side

A solid place to lay

That can spell
I hear now it's words that can say

Stared so long at the future
That I'm blind to reality
Come a time will watch our lives
Slip into the sea
All I ask from anyone
Is that they ask nothing from me

Dreams fly by like a thousand railroad trains
Egos steadfast like mountains in our brains
Those of us who let go will be swallowed
Left here to die

Do not look to the sky
It will not rain for you
Do not look to strangers
They won't help you through
Only chance you got
When you hear those war dogs bark
Is to be one up on your brother
Like a blind man in the dark

Face to face we will meet again
But never eye to eye
Meanwhile, in your mania
Your four wings touch the sky
Fly too high the wax will melt
And you'll fall down to your knees
All I ask from you my friend
Is that you ask nothing from me

Dreams fly by like a thousand railroad trains
Egos steadfast like mountains in our brains
Those of us who let go will be swallowed
Left here to die
Do not look to the sky
It will not rain for you
Do not look to strangers
They won't help you through
Only chance you got
When you hear those war dogs bark
Is to be one up on your brother

Matt Alber,"I don't want to ride this roller coaster 
I think I want to get off 
But they buckled me down 
Like it's the end of the world 
If you don't want to have this conversation 
Then you better get out 
'Cause we're climbing to our death 
At least that's what they want you to think 
Just in case we jump the track 
I have a confession to make 
It's something like a cork screw 

I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna fly 
I don't wanna be dangled over 
The edge of a dying romance 
But I don't wanna stop 
I don't wanna lie 
I don't wanna believe it's over 
I just wanna stay with you tonight 

I didn't mean to scream out quite so loudly 
When we screeched to a halt 
I'm just never prepared 
For the end of the ride 
Maybe we should get on something simpler 
Like a giant balloon 
But I've got two tickets left, and so do you 
Instead of giving them away to some stranger 
Let's make them count, come on 
Let's get back in line again and ride the big one 

Don't you want to fall, don't you want to fly 
Don't you want to be dangled over 
The edge of this aching romance 
If it's gonna end, then I wanna know 
That we squeezed out every moment 
But if there's nothing left can you tell me why 
That it is you're holding onto me 
Like it's the end of the world",End of the World,2008

Because all your words are so cold, so callous, so clean
In the moment you could be honest, you could wake up, up
But your jealousy is more blind than luck

And you could be my enemy
And you could be my judge
If you could start remembering all the time that you used up
And you could be my remedy
If you could show me love
If I could stop remembering all the time that you used up

I got no more time to hear who you think we should blame
Because all your words are so vile, so vicious, so vain
In the end, we did all the damage that you could want, want
But the emptiness will go on and on

It took all week in search of a glimpse of sanity
It took all month to follow through
It's been a year and here I am again
Not knowing what to do

And I could never find peace
Unless you reach down and touch me

The stairway to heaven always starts in hell.

Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",My Heart Stood Still,2006
Matt Catingub Orchestra of Hawaii,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All,2006
Matt Catingub Orchestra of Hawaii,"A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love",A Time for Love,2006
Matt Catingub Orchestra of Hawaii,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?,2006
Matt Catingub Orchestra of Hawaii,"Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me,2007
