Donald Shaw,"Well you and I were meant to be 
And in the end I know you'll see 
That we can never be just friends 
Our only love will never end Delilah 

Just think about the way we were 
A perfect set of his n' hers 
Why does a man have to resist 
A never ending happiness Delilah 

I got myself out of the way 
My debt to you is never paid 
I was a fool to let you go 
I'm sorry and I love you so Delilah 

I think about you every day 
And I'm sorry for the things I said 
My perfect love my closest friend 
Oh Delilah 

Well you and I were meant to be 
And in the end I know you'll see 
That we can walk around like friends 
But soon this day will have to end Delilah",Delilah,2014
Donald Shaw,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
Donald Shaw,"Well I know it ain't been roses lately, baby, it's just been thorns
And no matter what we do, nothing seems to change
Love has always been my shelter, for you it's been a storm
But for a while I thought we'd almost beat the rain

Now there's a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone
Fallen out like so many nickels and dimes
And last of all you, you'd always been my good luck charm
I should've known that luck's a waste of time

'Cause it don't bring you love if you don't love
And it don't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it don't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it don't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Now there's a whole lot of life to be unsure of
But there's one thing I can safely say I know
That of all the things that finally desert us
Pride is always the last thing to go

But it won't bring you love if you don't love
And it won't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it won't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it won't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

And now I wish you only roses, baby, without the thorns
And I hope your dreams are always within reach
And I wish you shelter, baby, from all your storms
They scared you, but they never seemed to teach

That I can't bring you love if you don't love
And I can't bring you time if you ain't got time
And I can't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind
",It Don't Bring You,2014
Donald Shaw,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014
Donald Shaw,"There was a time when we?d be the last to leave 
Watching the sun come up while everyone fell asleep 
The music was always loud and I?d smoke and drink too much 
Until I?d fall in your arms and into your lovin? touch 
Now as the years roll by, time has reeled me in 
I?ve slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

Remember the days when we?d pack our bags and run 
Chasing a crazy dream into the morning sun 
Now as the twilight falls, I find I?m satisfied 
Watching the fire glow as long as you?re by my side 
Here in my heart it seems, time has passed me by 
I love you as much today as the very first time 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

I still want you the way I wanted you then 
If I could do it all over, I?d do it all over again 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 
",Like I Used to Do,2014
Donald Shaw,"On a Monday, I was arrested 
On a Tuesday, I was locked up in jail 
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested 
On a Thursday, nobody would go my bail 

Almost done, I'm almost done, almost done 
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no pail 

Take these stripes, stripes from around my shoulder 
Take these chains, these chains from around my legs 
Lord, these stripes, it sure don't worry me 
But these chains, these chain's gonna kill me dead 

Yes, I'm almost done, almost done, almost done 
And I ain't gonna bring them yellow women no pail 

On Friday, my baby went a-walking 
On a Saturday, she locked me outa the door 
On a Sunday, we were sitting down a-talking 
On a Monday, she pawned all of my clothes",On a Monday,2014
Donald Swann,"Depuis que l'homme écrit l'Histoire
Depuis qu'il bataille à cur joie
Entre mille et une guerr' notoires
Si j'étais t'nu de faire un choix
A l'encontre du vieil Homère
Je déclarerais tout de suite
""Moi, mon colon, cell' que j'préfère,
C'est la guerr' de quatorz'-dix-huit!""

Est-ce à dire que je méprise
Les nobles guerres de jadis
Que je m'soucie comm' d'un'cerise
De celle de soixante-dix?
Au contrair', je la révère
Et lui donne un satisfecit
Mais, mon colon, celle que j'préfère
C'est la guerr' de quatorz'-dix-huit

Je sais que les guerriers de Sparte
Plantaient pas leurs epées dans l'eau
Que les grognards de Bonaparte
Tiraient pas leur poudre aux moineaux
Leurs faits d'armes sont légendaires
Au garde-à-vous, je les félicite
Mais, mon colon, celle que j'préfère
C'est la guerr' de quatorz'-dix-huit

Bien sûr, celle de l'an quarante
Ne m'as pas tout à fait déçu
Elle fut longue et massacrante
Et je ne crache pas dessus
Mais à mon sens, elle ne vaut guère
Guèr' plus qu'un premier accessit
Moi, mon colon, celle que j' préfère
C'est la guerr' de quatorz'-dix-huit

Mon but n'est pas de chercher noise
Au guérillas, non, fichtre, non
Guerres saintes, guerres sournoises
Qui n'osent pas dire leur nom,
Chacune a quelque chos' pour plaire
Chacune a son petit mérite
Mais, mon colon, celle que j'préfère
C'est la guerr' de quatorz'-dix-huit

Du fond de son sac à malices
Mars va sans doute, à l'occasion
En sortir une, un vrai délice
Qui me fera grosse impression
En attendant je persévère
A dir' que ma guerr' favorite
Cell', mon colon, que j'voudrais faire
C'est la guerr' de quatorz'-dix-huit",Lovely War,1994
Donald Walden,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,2003
Donald Washington & The New Day Blues Band,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.",Come Sunday,2001
Donato,"La luz se va alejando
Y el espejo no va hablar

Donato & Estéfano,"Quiero beber los besos de tu boca 
Como si fueran gotas de rocío 
Y allí en el aire dibujar tu nombre junto con el mío 
Y en un acorde dulce de guitarra 
Vaciar locuras en tus sentimientos 
Y en el sutíl abrazo de la noche sientas lo que siento

Que estoy enamorado 
Y tu amor me hare grande 
Que estoy enamorado why que bien
Y que bien me hare amarte 

Dentro de tí quedarme en cautiverio 
Para asomarme al aire que respiras 
Y en cada espacio unir mis ilusiones junto con tu vida 
Que si naufrago me quede en tu orilla 
Y de recuerdos sólo me alimente 
Y que despierte del sueño profundo sólo para verte 

Que estoy enamorado 
Y tu amor me hare grande 
Que estoy enamorado why que bien
Y que bien me hare amarte 

Voy a encender el fuego de tu piel callada 
Mojaré tus labios de agua apasionada 
Para que tengamos sueños de la nada

You know I do it for the ladies

And uh see,
I done had my share with the right but um
Look there's something about you baby
Got me going crazy
And that's my lady, yeah, haha

Look, it's like this girl got me going all out
I got a few sick days, yeah I'ma call out
Scoop shorty, hit the mall, then we ball out
Catch a movie, grab a bite, then fall out
I got her spoiled rotten
She keep a dog droppin'
The latest wear she rockin'
Gotta get tour poppin' (fresh)
It was more shockin'
Them whores at the door knocking
And word for a second my g shock went
She in them pumps, not them Reeboks kid
The only time we fight is on the Wii boxin'
I don't even keep up with how many g's I spend
Usually I keep a safe but the key locked in
But she a new type, maybe a new wife, 
Maybe the one I settle with in a new life
I gotta see, it's moving fast right now
I needa have a conversation with Shad and Bow Wow
Cause ahhh

[Chorus]
I had a few loves before, 
But I never had no one love me quite like this
I was scared of being locked down,
But you made proud to call you my shorty

I had a few loves before,
But I never had no one love me quite like
It feels like I died and went to heaven
Cause I never had no one love me like this

Like wha?

Like this

Like wha?

Like dadadada like this girl

I guess I'm kinda open
Just sitting here hoping that what we shared is more than a joke and
We can last like the great ones do,
As long as our love for each other stays true
Look
I see the growth, we done both came a long way
Arguments here and there,
Fuss and fightin'
Just showing that we care
Can't nobody else compare
Start it over with another, neither one of us were there
All she gotta do is holla and her baby will be there
Ain't a doubt about it in my mind that we a perfect pair
Can't think of anyone, that's how I wanna spend my years
Try my hardest not to hurt her,
Hate to bring her to them tears
And I know just how it feel when I whisper in her ear
No, I let her drive a stick, 
She know how to work dem gears
Ain't gotta worry 'bout the chicks I meet during my career
Me going somewhere should be the last of her fears

[Chorus:]

She's my L-O-V-E
Used to be scared of relationships but this one I can't deny
You my L-O-V-E
Yeah, and when you see her, you see me for her
I ride or die like Ruff Ryders

You know the type when everything goes right
The person you with loves ya just like a dream would

I was looking for seemed to be too tough 
I wasn't rushing to try to make all the right moves
I finally met you now all I can say

For puttin' us together everyday it's been 
6 months and nothing's changed out to movies
Unexpected gifts, still the same and in the 
Bedroom I don't know if it gets better than 
This every touch down to every kiss it's 
Incredible when we're holding each other

He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me
An overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones

Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one more time:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

And I call up my boys 'cause I'm looking for some action
We need to kick it like we use to
Back in the days when we were known as the crazy crew
It's good to reminisce on the old days
When we use to kick it with the G's and the homies
I would go back, yo if I could
This is for my peoples that still roll around in the hood

All the fellas break wide to summer bunnies
That's the way that we flex, yeah
Everyday on the O.G set
But keep it smoove
I keep it smoove on a move spit to the hotties
On a late night move to flex their bodies

Cause in my heart I want you desperately

Done ran away from all the girls I've been dating

When I'm with them  it's only you I see

And she promised me that it would take some time

But she would leave him alone

And the thought of her loving only me

That's the thing that keeps me strong

But only half the time

Still it's more than enough

Looked like she tried on a diamond ring

The way he held her down, it drove me crazy

Spent half the day wishing that it was me

Saying I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time
To be alone

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be
Where I want to be

Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby, oh no
Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go
I think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone
But I have to find what life is like
Without you

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?

Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

As I step on the scene, yo I'm steady maxin'
And I call up my boys 'cause I'm looking for some action
We need to kick it like we use to
Back in the days when we were known as the crazy crew
It's good to reminisce on the old days
When we use to kick it with the G's and the homies
I would go back, yo if I could
This is for my peoples that still roll around in the hood

This is for my playas in the hood
Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should
It's just an ordinary day

Heads up on the ride she's a hottie
All the fellas break wide to summer bunnies
That's the way that we flex, yeah
Everyday on the O.G set
But keep it smoove
I keep it smoove on a move spit to the hotties
On a late night move to flex their bodies
That's the way that we hang
On a regular doing our own thang

Up to no good, lets kick it like we really should

As we're rolling around, and we're doing our thang

While my peoples is poppin' bottles I pursue a rendezvous
Fuck that
Swerve the you-ey lost a hubcap
It's back in the shack came back and a what's that
Straight from Paris, takin' cabbage and baby carrage
Get some cabbage, now burn the cherry radish
Fresh out the dealer, cop the check for the squealers
Wear vests for the killers, nothing less cause it's realer
In the Big Apple, where its quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one, got beef bust your gun
You don't need no one
Talkin' bout that you owe him
I'm a go for dolo
Scarface with a parrono
One deep, I runnin' solo
Bustin' heat through a Polo

It's so hard (It's hard work, baby)

Poppin' shit like a Nazi, iced out like Dee Piassy

Never that, hey yo where my niggas at
Uptown uptown, you know you feelin that
Cash rule, hardcore you can dance to
That nigga Biggie give me (One more chance)

With both hands rip off my drawers and drape me like the Source Awards

And I know you from where? Elementary school?

And I can show you what it's like to be in Trini for a night 'cause (I want to love you)
It's been a long way here, from plan to hallway
To bring us all way here
To the sweets in L.A. or beach M-i-a or chill out pool
Shout out to crib where I lay 'cause I (love you)
And everyday that pass we gotta live it to it's limit like we live in our last
And we been broke before
It's from the bottom to the top
Wit' this love I never felt before now why

[Chorus:]

Now I got a love that'll set you free
This is where you oughta be, yeah
Lady clap your hands with me, huh
It's Donell Jones and Memphis Bleek, yeah
So tell your friends you're going out
You know what this is about
So lady come and ride with me

She wants to be that one to give me that love you ain't ready for
You better start talking, girl

I go to the club strictly to party and find something to twork with
I'm the dude that all the girls wanna flirt with
Jump up in the booth show me just how they work it
So shortly your window is small to work with
I see it in your eyes but you ain't saying nothing
Your girl doing everything trying to push my buttons
Symbolizing us leaving and me cutting
Easy like Tiga' on the green when he puttin'
You betta' start talking
Shorty wanna do something
Do something too live crew man man
Shorty wanna move something
And you front like it ain't what it is
Bout to lose all this 'cause you ain't handle yo bizz
After two shots of the three
She was all on me
And you seen it but try to play it like a PIMP
Now I respect that
But sometimes that's a set back
And I really can't see you setting back lettin' that
Be the reason we ain't breezin' through the city
Girl you better start talking

Can't you see she wants to (take your place)
She wanna give me everything that you don't
Don't let her just walk in

Took you and your shorty in just to deal witcha
In the beginning, it was rough

I got to walk away, look at the big picture
A son needing his mother is the real issue
I'm not a selfish guy, you know I want you in my life
It's killing me inside, don't wanna say goodbye

Can't even show affection 'cause he don't like it
Every time we get romantic, we gotta hide it
The way we living ain't right, he's coming between our love

It's unfortunate that this is over
You don't leave me any choice
This could end up in divorce
Take a nigga straight to court
This decision is the best, yeah

And I'm sorry it had to end this way
In this relationship, I can not stay
I can see that this is it
It ain't nothing we can fix

Ain't even recognizing the signs of a booty call
Better listen to what I'm telling y'all got to show her what she's worth

'Cause daddy took the money and put it up his nose
He hits the hustler up for some credit yo

There is something between us
Whenever we hook up it comes up out
I go through different emotions
And I can't quite figure it out
If I just fight it
And we get down
Or have I fallen
For you in the mist of it all

I don't know if it's lust or love
That I'm feeling for you
Hope you're feeling it too

'cause we wasn't havin' no sex

Mentally abusing you

I hope it's something left inside 'cause girl I wanna be with you

Now she's gone cause she was fed up with me

Then why do we treat women so cold when we come from one
Because you wouldn't do your mother wrong

Just hold on you deserve a life of love

Because you wouldn't take the same abuse

To the women if you cry almost every night cause happiness ain't inside
Just stay true cause your sun will shine again

As I look in your picture frame girl you've been giving a wrong deal
But God loves you and you call up beautiful

of a woman so wonderful she plant the earth with all her seeds
And as men we should take care of them its our responsibility
So respect the one you call your love show her sensitivity
And don't be afraid to get your own or you'll end up just like me

Got the west crib talking

The type a nigga that you wanna roll with baby
Don't get it twisted thinkin' I'm a sugar daddy

And a smile like Janet but that's not enough
You may think that I'm tripping take a minute and just listen
It ain't all about sex 'cause I can always get that
I'm a million dollar nigga need a million dollar woman
Met this chick named Yvett and this what she said

I can give you everything you need
I can be your freak, even cook and clean
If that's all you got then you cannot get it
Cause I got a chef who can cook all my dinners
I'm looking for that nigga who ain't cheap,
Take me shopping every week

So I hook up with this chick we call her Beverley
Had a trunk side body drove a chrome six hundred
With them big wheels gunning
Man this girl was on it

Type of chick that drop a platinum card for me
Just to show this nigga that her pockets deep
And the sex was blazing and her brain was crazy
Lingerie type lady still that's not enough

You may think that I'm tripping take a minute and just listen
It ain't all about sex its what's in your head
I'm a million dollar nigga
Need a million dollar woman
I won't settle for less and Beverley said

I just gotta have you close to me
I'll watch you while you sleep
You will never leave boy
But that is somethin' I just can't do it
Girl I can't be with you every minute

Donell Jones,"Whats up baby! 
Oh you can't say whats up back?
Anyway I see you finally made it home.
Yea, yea, yea I know
Oh you was too drunk to drive huh?
Damn right I got a problem
Its all good, trust me its all good

Imagine that your girl came home
Walking a little different
Got a pep in her step 
She ain't paying you no attention, 
She hits the shower first (shower first)
But she don't mention she is washing 
Out off that dirt she that got in

Imagine if your girl was home
(And you get off work early)
She don't even know 
cause she won't answer the phone
But you sense something is up 
And barge through your front door 
But there is a fellow running out your back door

What would you do?
Cause shawty playing games with you 
While you at work
She been hitting you were it hurts 
Got a couple dudes on her team 
But you don't know 
In your home she's always on the go 
What would you do?
Would you give a second chance
Hoping that it wont happen again
Now flip that around, you know that's what we do 
We tell them that we love them, but our hearts ain't true

Imagine if she crushed dudes like you crushed chicks
(imagine that)
Have a starting five and your position was the bench
(imagine that)
Busy when you call, don't return your messages
(imagine that)
Ball till she fall while you taking care of the kids
(imagine that)
Imagine if she don't wanna tell you where she been 
(imagine that)
Said she hanging with her girls but she hanging out with him
(imagine that)
Imagine if everything that I said ain't true
She home alone waiting while you out doing you

Imagine you were on the road
And she call you and she say that she pregnant
You ask how many months, she don't know yet
But you think to yourself its been a month since you been gone
Whose been sneaking in when you're not at home
Imagine now your all alone
Cause she took off with the other dude,
Left the dog and the kids too 
Shawty left a letter on the couch 
Saying you can have the house
She's in love with him and they're moving down south

What would you do?
Cause shawty playing games with you 
While you at work
She been hitting you were it hurts 
Left you for another dude that's gotta hurt 
When you know you really don't deserve it 
What would you do?
Cause the kids don't understand
That their mother left you for another men 
Flip that around, you know that's what we do 
We tell them that we love them, but our hearts ain't true

Imagine if she crushed dudes like you crushed chicks
(imagine that)
Have a starting five and your position was the bench
(imagine that)
Busy when you call, don't return your messages

Said she hanging with her girls but she hanging out with him
(imagine that)
Imagine if everything that I said ain't true
She home alone waiting for you 

You know put yourself in her shoes,
You gotta learn to treat her right, right.

He gotta treat you right babe
Imagine that, can you imagine that
Cause y'all know what I'm talking about

Imagine if she crushed dudes like you crushed chicks

Busy when you call, don't return your messages

In a small rented room in Montreal
Long curly hair, hands between her knees
With her head hung down
She hasn't said a word since morning
I don't understand
She usually talks like a little bird
Today she hasn't made a sound

Janine, Janine, talk to me, Janine

Don't even know if she's listening to me
I might be talking to myself hopelessly
While she looks right through me
Like I'm not even here

Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the Elysee
We had a drink in each cafe
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy and I
Smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, the football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Are you the hero of my dreams

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away...",Our Last Summer,2004
Donna,"Where are those happy days they seem to hard to find?
I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind
Whatever happened to our love?  I wish I understood
It used to be so nice.  It used to be so good
 
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.?
The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?
 
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out. I wish I understood

Donna,"Schoolbag in hand
She leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye
With an absent-minded smile
I watch her go
With a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm loosing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes
Her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake
I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone
There's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt
I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go
Well some of that we did
But most we didn't
And why I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers -

Donna,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes All,2004

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

The more I want you

More lost without you and so it goes

In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

Is keeping perfectly still

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,2004

Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.

Full of butterflies inside.

Among so many nights I sit here all alone
Though I must admit by now I'm used to it
And I'm not surprised that you're not home

I'll get tired too of waiting some night

When you got no man to give it his last name
And my folks back in Manhattan didn't want me or my bundle
So I took my child and caught an evening train.
And I found a job in Denver washing dishes in a diner
At least it buys my baby milk to drink
He once told me I was pretty but the only ring it got me
Was the ring of grease that runs around the sink
(Chorus)
Yes, I lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told me that he loved me
And he made me dance before the music played
But at least I didn't beg him
I'd rather wash his dishes
'Cause it makes me feel as if my hands are clean
At night I stand here thinkin'
'Bout the man back home in Kansas
And how his folks just turned away the shame
And I stare down through the soapsuds
And reached down and pull the drain plug
And I watch as Manhattan drains away

Why can't I let myself enjoy 
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful
Places I've been
My eyes are on the future
I can't think about the past
My aspirations
Always exceed my grasp

You've got to reach a little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey woa - oh you got to grow
You've got to reach a little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul and you'll never grow old

When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
You may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you
And say these same words again

But now it's worth all that confusion cause I found me an answer

And I've learned that little doubts are just unfinished dreams

And you always warmed a blanket to wrap around my feet
When you tucked me into bed to say my prayers
And I'll bet I never thanked you among all the other things
That I took for granted cause you were always there
Yes you were always there so we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams and me to tell you mine
And we never took the time to talk of love and happiness
And life and death and heartache and pain and loneliness

Why I don't even know if you were happy or if you could have been
Or if you could have one wish what would it be
Or what would you do differently if you could live again
And were you glad that you gave life to me
And I'd give anything to tell you am I glad that you were born
But you'll never hear the words I've learned to say
Cause before I got to know you died of loneliness
And they tell me I grew up and moved away
Yes you were always there so we never took the time
For you to tell me your dreams and me to tell you mine

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready

Donna Fargo,"You know, I've always believed 
That when you feel somethin' 
Especially somethin' good for someone 
You shouldn't keep it from them 
You should let him know 
But I also believe that 
If you think it's love 
There's really no need to bring it up 
If you know there's no chance for it to grow 
But it seems like 
I'm always coming up with contradictions 
Because now I find that 
What I believe and what I feel 
Are two very different things 
And those feelings I've kept all to myself 
Are gonna come out now 
Even though they've changed 
So you see 
I guess I was right in one way 
That I never told you this 
And I don't really know why I'm telling you now 
But I'd just kinda like you to know that 
There couldn't be a you and me 
I might've changed my life for you 
And you might've changed for me 
If there weren't so many ifs and buts 
And if you had wanted it to be. 

But because of the way I am 
And the way you are 
We never took the chance, did we? 
Call it respect, because we're not free 
Call it fear of rejection because of our pride 
Or call it just plain old common sense 
That it would be just too risky 
And too stick a situation 
Because we wouldn't know exactly where we were going 
And we'd be afraid to take the ride 
Call it whatever, but I wanted you to know that 
I like you very much 
And you're the kind of person I could love 
You're honest, sincere, compassionate, not afraid 
To be too gentle and not afraid to be too strong and 
You got that certain kind of something 
People are always looking for and rarely find and 
Never seem to get enough of and somehow 
It doesnt seem wrong to tell you that 
No, we never kissed and never touched each other 
But our hearts have and our souls have and 
If we gaved them half the chance 
Look out, for I'll bet they can start a fire

Daddy I feel that I must talk to you 
Are you sure this is what you want to do? 
Now it's not for us kids that I beg you to stay 
Please don't just walk out on Mama this way 
She's mothered your children, she's spent her whole life 
Trying to be a good mother and wife 
And she stood by you when the rest let you down 
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now? 

I'm your oldest daughter, my age twenty-three 
Your new love is even younger than me 
She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew 
While Mama's are withered from working for you 

Mom's not young any more like your new love 
But your new love won't love you like my mama does

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

I think about you, when it rains and I'm alone
Another day, another memory, the sun disappears
Another morning without you and I cry another tear

What I want might not make me happy
What I do might bury me
What I'm chasing might not ever happen
And it might not set me free

Is just the same as letting go
The hardest thing you'll ever do is find you something
That makes you happy and knowing how and when to hold on

It's taken so long to get where I am
And I've got a long way to get where I wanna stand
Sometimes I'm crazy for the things that I believe
Have I done the best I can, is this the best that I can be?

What I'm chasing might not ever happen

Donna King,"Remark the cat who hesitates toward you
In the light of the door which opens on her like a grin
You see the border of her coat is torn and stained with sand
And you see the corner of her eye twist like a crooked pin

She haunted many a low resort
Near the grimy road of Tottenham Court
She flitted about the No Man's Land
From ""The Rising Sun"" to ""The Friend at Hand""
And the postman sighed as he scratched his head
""You'd really had thought she ought to be dead""
And who would ever suppose that 
That was Grizabella, the glamor cat

Down, floating down,
Floating down to Agenais and we'll go floating down, floating down,

Palace and they were dancing
In long silver veils and white lilies in their hair and then we

To leave we'll go

Come little sister come with

Crawling little by little I can hardly breathe
Unprotected exposed to the numbing conditions I feel no pain
Falling in the snow, dazed and confused, paralyzed with fear, huddled 
Together for warmth in the
Trees, where are the lights, where is help, only the silence oh oh 
Help me 

Still the sky was empty
Freezing fog decended,
And the snow began to fall
Silence was an enemy, more hated than the cold
So we whispered stories to help us forget

Then out of the sky, came the lights, two tiny lights, I wanted to kiss 
The Earth and the stars, no
Cruel mirage, a distant visage, the silence had broken  
Out of the sky, came the lights, out of the night out of the fear, 
Came the strength, strength to live
Out of the sky, came the lights, lights of life out of the fear, 
Came the strength, strength to live
Out of the sky, came the lights, lights of life

""It was my birthday, the day they found me now I am one week old 
My life from this
Moment begins again""

Donna Little,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Donna Lynne Champlin,"Cain slew Abel, Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel suppose to multiply
Why must any of the children die
So he asked the Lord and the Lord said
Man means nothing he means less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower or the humblest yucca tree
He chases round this desert 'cause he thinks that's where I'll be

That's why I love mankind
I recoil in horror from the foulness of thee
From the squalor and the filth and the misery
How we laugh up here in Heaven, prayers you offer me
That's why I love mankind
The Christians and the Jews were having a jamboree
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
And they began to speak
They said Lord the plague is on the world
Lord no man is free
The temples that we built to you have tumbled into the sea
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Won't you please please let us be
And the Lord said
And the Lord said
I burn down your cities, how blind you must be
I take from you, your children and you say how blessed are we
You all must be crazy to put your faith in me
That's why I love mankind, you really need me
That's why I love mankind",God's Song (That's Why I Love Mankind),2001
Donna Marie,"Don't think I can't feel there's something wrong
You've been the sweetest part of my life so long

And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us

Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice

Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me

And the chance to dance for you.

Give me a job and you instantly get me involved.
If you give me a job,
Then the rest of the crap will get solved.

You would think that by now I'm allowed.
I'll do you proud.

Throw me a rope to grab on to.
Help come to prove that I'm strong.

And I scroll and see the pictures you deleted
Like the history ain't happen long as we cannot see it
Getting back is insanity and we repeat it
Mama said we need counseling
But I can't reason with the terrorists
Oh, this is embarrassing
You ain't Cinderella, ain't no pumpkin turning into fuckin' carriages
You create a narrative, people ask me, ""Where's she been?""
Send her back and now she's living back out at her parent's crib
Fight, break up, we fuck, we fight, break up, you know the deal
Vent to friends and tell them, ""It's the last time, I'm for real""
You text me, then the next thing you know, I'm behind the wheel
Pull up, you in the backseat thinking this will help us heal
There's no use for you texting my phone

Back on that nobody's listening
Back to those horrible choices
Back on you moving back home
'Cause I would rather live in Hell than get comfortable sleeping alone
Back to that lying deception, back to the self-will
Back on that ""Well, she don't do it and I know that somebody else will""
You cheated, I cheated, you cheated, I cheated, I mean it
Please, Father, forgive us
The dirt that you've done and the secrets that we swept 
Up under the rug that are gonna die with us
And I should've cut the ties so many times
That I finally gave up on the scissors
We are both sinners if we both lie to ourselves
That is just selfish, that isn't commitment
I try to hold it in, I try to hold it in
Numb to it all and ignoring it
I'm just searching where the closure is
Going in circles, not noticing
But in my heart, I know I'm not over it

We got that bad love, but it taste like medicine
I never had love, so I learned to settle quick

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before
There is more

Instead of dreaming
You're trying to keep yourself alive
And make it through another day

Though it's not easy
Believe me there's a reason why
He gave His life so you can live yours
That's what He came here for

To give us more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before
There is more

More power, more mercy
More hope than ever thought possible
More life in me, because of You

There is more love

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before

There is more than you'll ever know
There is more than we've ever dreamed of

Donna Summer,"Just a baby
On a doorstep
It's how they found me
Cold and hungry
Raised on hatred
Fed by strangers
As a young girl
I often wondered

[Chorus]
Am I born to die
Never having lived
Am I born to die
Without love
In my life

People push me
Knock me down
My foster parents
Kicked me around
They brought me up on
Loneliness
I never had me
A single friend

[Chorus]

Must be someone
In this world
Who can save me
From myself

Or am I born to die
Never having lived
Am I born to die
Without love
In my life

Donna Summer,"Late last night at a fancy dress ball
I was dancing with all the queens and lords
When a tall and mystic man took me by the hand
And began dancing my eyes away

Domino, domino, domino
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know
Who's this masquerading lover
I wish I could discover
Domino, domino, domino

I was feeling so dizzy and lame
Was it champagne or really him to blame
Though our faces were disguised
Feelings couldn't hide
That this wasn't just some kind of game

Domino, domino, domino
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know
Who's this masquerading lover
I wish I could discover

Domino who are you
Domino I'd like to know
Domino who's the real domino
Though we're strangers still
It's real love I feel domino

Then at midnight the bells were all rung
And he kisses me and held me in his arms
Then a crowd would ride between us
Trapped away my stranger
And I never did find him again

Friends no more or less oh
Here we are sharing so much fun
Friends why can't he see that I want him
To be more than my friend

Kidnapper:
Lady we've just kidnapped your husband
Have $800,000 ready by tomorrow night
And lady no police
Or you'll never see your husband alive again

Lady: Hallo
I remember standing there so petrified
My hand frozen to the phone
As a stranger's words that caught in my ears
And chilled me to the bone
Some dark tragedy had come right home to me
They'd kidnapped my man and his life was in their hands

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands
He was a hostage, a hostage

Lady, here's your husband through
To warn not to play any games

Husband:
Hi Honey listen I'm okay
Just make sure you do whatever they tell you
And whatever you do don't go to the police!

Well I couldn't raise that kinda money fast
So I was left no other choice
So I called the police and they came in fast
Saying ""leave it up to us
Just do as they told
The ransom's in this bag
We'll watch over you
And we'll have your husband back too""

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands

Lady: Hallo
Kidnapper:
Listen very carefully lady
Drive out to the abandoned shack on Highway 16
Throw the package of money out the window and keep driving
And remember lady no police!

Well my heart was heavy as I made that drive
I was sure something was wrong
I soon found the shack
I threw out the bag and I just kept driving on
Then the shots rang out and turned my car about
On the ground one lay but the other had gotten away

He was a hostage, a hostage
His life was at the mercy of their hands

Sing along if your song
Has theme of love gone wrong
Sing along and belong

Sing your sad your sad sad song

Ain't it strange the way life goes
First you're used and then disposed
Like a sad song
Saying love was just a word
Used to keep you hanging there
Like a sad song

And following his footsteps
No matter just how far must follow

Sifting sand through my hand weighing what he means to me
In the early morning haze seagulls seem to cry my pain
And ocean feels it too sighs his name on whispering waves

Wrote his name next to mine big and deep there in the sand
Till the earth tends to flow and our names will be drowned
All the birds sing harmonies to the top line of the breeze
While the ocean breathes his name on whispering waves

There's a bistro where we would dine each evening
Candle light and California wine
Love is holding hands across the table
I still go past each night
Look for his car outside

At the foot of this cliff we spent days weaving our dreams
Making plans building homes raising kids and coloring scenes
Then one morning he was gone and our story reached an end
But his words still linger on on whispering waves

She lived in the land of never-never
Where everything real is unreal
And only fairy tales come true
Something like me and you

But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real
So she strived on to make it come true
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her
Never giving up the hope within her

She carried on and on, because she believed
That once, once in a time in her lifetime
The things so unreal would be real

And in the morning, one day when she awoke
To find herself surrounded by the same old room
She was disappointed

So she dreamed and she dreamed
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed
And she said that fairy tales do come true
'Cause I believe, I believe

And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting
Till one day she met a man who held her tight
And she fell in love

Once upon a time, in the land of never-never
Where all things real are unreal
There lived a girl who believed
That all things could be possible

You know tonight is a very important night
For me for a number of reasons
My little girl is here tonight
And I don't think you understand 
What it's like being the daughter of
Someone who's always gone
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes
""Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?""
And so my daughter looked up at me 
Last week and she said ""mummy
When are you just gonna stay home 
One day and be with me""?
And so it kinda struck me funny 
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent
Anytime with her for a long time
So I sat down and wrote down this song 
After she went to bed
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime 
I would sing her son

I bet you ask yourself
Why I'm never there
It's not because I like being away
You see I've made a spectacle of myself
And it seems that the whole world needs me
I understand when you cry alone
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes
You see it's only because
I'm out being someone to make you cry

I got a little letter
And I read it on the plane
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain
I wish that I could be there
To touch your face again

Mimi you're beautiful
Mimi you're mine
And other things that I do in my life
Seem to take up all your precious time

There's so much I long to say
So much more I long to do
But I guess it's all just have to wait
Till I can get to see you

Mimi you're mine
Oh, Mimi you're mine
Oh, Mimi you fill my life

Cause you're beautiful
And you love me 
And you'll understand

This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with
And maybe some of you men too

(the man I love)

Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be rich and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And maybe for awhile
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Spoken:
You know I'm the kind of lady
That always seems to find the wrong man
At the wrong place at the wrong time
It's not that I go out looking for him
But somehow he always seems to find me
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man
That comes home with candy
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man
That comes home fussing
And fighting, breaking my best dishes
And beat my head outside the wall
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!

And how about you?
Great, well I've been gettin' rocked completely!

So you see on Monday nights
I just go out and drink and drink

But when the weekend's over on Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
Cryin' my heart out
Lord above me (come on) make him love me
Then he should
I got it bad baby
I got it bad baby
I got it bad and that ain't good!
No it ain't good at all you know

Spoken:
But listen mister big shot I've got your number
And I'll take care of you
And you too and you and you and you

(some of these days)

Some of these days
You're gonna miss your donna
Some of these days
You're gonna feel so lonely
You'll miss my huggin'
You'll miss my kissin'
You'll miss me honey
When you're far away

You're gonna be so lonely
For me only
Cause you know daddy
You had you way
And if I leave you
You know it's gonna grieve you
You're gonna miss your sweet lovin' donna

Trapped within their world

You know ladies and gentlemen
Please know this
I really love my man
And I want, exactly what he's got
And I don't ever mind giving him every
Bit of my love
And baby you know
I've got a lot to give

I got fire in my touch
There's nothing I won't do
And I bend over backwards
Just to give it all to you

Cause there's only one man
That can handle all this love
Cause there's only one man
That I want to be with tonight
Cause there's only one man
That can squeeze me inside

The one man in my life
And that's you, you and you and you

Cause there's only one man
That can handle all this love
Cause there's only one man
That I want to be with tonight
Said there's only one man in my life
And that's you

And to set your weary mind at ease

It's not that I'm lonely or, that I'm blue
It's just that I need to be with you

Dragged myself across the bed
Alice went to wonderland
But I stayed home instead
I started feeling bad
'Cause I was left behind
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Oh yes, I'm a wanderer

Oh that really blew my mind
I think I'll follow through her rhythm
And her rhyme
I know I'm ready now
It's just a little time

Then out the door

Now they won't
See me anymore
'Cause I can't take
That nine to five life
It's a bore
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Just a wanderer

And so it's up and out
And on and off the road
Won't have no troubles
'Cause the whole world
Is my home
No need to worry
'Cause I seldom am alone
'Cause I'm wanderer
I'm a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space

Got no time

Any time and any place
And you may know me

Change your frame of mind

Siren song

Was tinged with the sadness of a

And only last year everything
Seemed so sure
Now life is awful again

Is to smile in spite of it

Donna Summer,"Met this stranger there, so I was
Feeling somewhat scared
When I vacationed in a land that I
Didn't know that well
But all the ladies there were nice
The gentlemen politely out of line
I kept on thinking how I'd like
To spend some time
I couldn't make up my mind, still
Waitin' for the right sign
I was down in Tokyo
Livin' in hotel Imperial

Met this man, he was something
Very strange
Said he was a spy from somewhere
Else way far away
He told me things about myself that
I could tell nobody else
Passed this message on to me, said
Spirits move in secrecy
I could almost read the man's mind
Waitin' for the right sign

I really wanna know if I'm gonna go
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in
Tokyo
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo

He passed this message on to me
Said spirits move in secrecy
A double agent amnesty
An Ian Fleming mystery

I, I know I read the man's mind
I know I got the right sign

I really wanna know if I'm gonna go
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in
Tokyo
Tokyo, live my life in Tokyo
Live my life in Tokyo, live my life in

Donna Summer,"It's a windy night
Of first and main
Of any city
Of a hundred names
Spirits fly high and the sparks fly low

And the cats are all creeping out the back door slow
And the cats are out, gonna harmonize
They're headed for cool street on the main line
And here comes that joe serpentine
The life of a cat can leave you far behind

They're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause

It's hard to be yourself
When everyone else is around
There's always someone out there
Trying to pull you down

You're sitting on the fence crying out to the moon
The day goes by too fast and the night comes too soon
You bet your life and you sell your soul
Give it all up for beggar's gold
And the hidden city has its own laws
Produces a species cats without claws

They're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause
Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause

Oh, here they come again
Singing songs in a melody
Do, do, do, do, do

Oh, oh, it's tough life, tough life, tough life
And the streets are full of pain
Specially when it's calling out your name
It's hard on the one who doesn't sacrifice
The things the world has to offer nice
Come inside, spend some time, stay alive
It'll take your heart and it'll steal your mind

Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause
Oh, they're just cats without claws
Never had a good reason
Never had a cause

A man he stares into a TV screen
From the next apartment we hear music
Bleeding through the scene

TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed
She must be pretty rich
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck

Eyes
TV's and someone's watching
Eyes
In the kitchen someone's watching

And the maid and butler's watching

Silent sunbeams falling across the window
Suddenly she awakens with surprise
Day and night they always go so quickly
In TV time...

Her husband rushes in and in the meantime
She just slightly smiles and turns her head
He just whispers something to her softly
God knows what he said...

You know it wasn't very long
Before the two of them were kissing
She was his wife, he was her man

Trying to find an open door, so alone
Chains were wrapped around my heart

Telling me ""you'll never escape""
No you can't get away

That I could find love in you
My heart's been renewed
Now all my dreams are coming true
I was frightened in the cold
Desperate when you found me in time
You saved me from the world
Got my life back in control
Chased away the madness in my mind
You saved me right in time
Now the future's looking up
Skies are blue, all because of you
Got the sunshine in my life
All aglow, baby, don't you know, I'm free

I still hear her advice
She said don't ever bet against your feelings
Always think twice
Don't go and throw your love away
To some man just for the night
Promises, promises, don't waste your time
If his intentions don't feel right

Your reputation follows you wherever you go
Don't get a bad reputation
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold
Don't get a bad reputation
Don't need a bad reputation

I'm so thankful momma I am waiting
To find someone who
Was looking in the same direction
That you pointed to

I'll never turn and walk away
If my heart gives me the sign
When the one, comes along
He'll understand
That the wait was worth the while

Your reputation follows you wherever you go
Don't get a bad reputation
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold
Don't get a bad reputation
Don't need a bad reputation

(Momma said, she said)
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

Your reputation follows you wherever you go
Don't get a bad reputation
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold
Don't get a bad reputation
Don't need a bad reputation

I've never felt before

No tomorrow
Could there be without you
And if you should say goodbye
I think that I would die

Like no other night
It's a day
Almost turning gray
It's a heart
Like a broken heart
It's a wheel
At the end of day
It's the plight
Of a boy who's scared
Of the waves rushing out
And the wind in the air
It's the sight
Of one longing to taste
Of life

Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices from some foreign shore
Visions that seem an incredible dream
Echoing for more
Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices crying out hear them call

It's a song
Of a love unsung
It's the pain
Of just being young
It's a cry
Of a voice unheard
Of a face
Speaking silent words
It's the hope
That the time goes by
Take you upon a wing
Teach your soul to fly
It's a wish
That you'll live your experience life

Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices from some foreign shore
Vision that seem an incredible dream
Echoing for more
Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices crying out hear them call

Walking your path of life
Embracing destiny one day at a time

My love life is boring me to tears,
After all these years
No sunshine, no moonlight,
No stardust, no sign of romance

I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love
Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)

And we won't waist another tear

Don't put up with his stuff,
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill,
Get the check pay the bill,
You can do it
Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now
I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,
But he turns out to be like every other man

But no matter where it takes me to
I will always find my way

And on that marble wall which holds a million names
Generations of dreams gone down in flames
Isn't, isn't it a shame

For every boy and every girl

As our leaders roll the dice
The human spirit cries
Its a precious, precious, precious...sacrifice.

Donna Summer,"[Spoken:]
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea
During the time of king Herod
Wise men from de east came to Jerusalem and asked
""where is the one who is born king of the Jews?
We saw his star in the east and we have come to worship him""

Lord we have traveled far
Torn and weary guided by your star
There before us the living king
Hallelujah his praises sing

Herod with a evil plan
Kill the babies
Came his bold command
He tried to alter god's holy plan
God has saved him
The son of man

Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of god
The chosen one of god
Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of love
The chosen one of god

Three kings from a distance come
Bearing gifts for the only one
Shout to heaven sound the drum
Tell the nations
The lord has come

Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of god
The chosen one of god
Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of love
The chosen one of god

He came to bring us his peace
He came to bring us his joy
To bring us love

Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of god
The chosen one of god

Behold the lamb of god
The mighty king of god
The precious lamb of god

Just look him in the eye and simple shout

And I'll never have that recipe again, oh, no

I recall the yellow cotton dress foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
Birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees

Surely you can ask the better way
Strange that you're the one so set on leaving
And I'm the one who said last night that it was all too late

Can't we just sit down and talk it over?
Who knows maybe in a little while
We'll forget our pride and the things we said last night

Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout

Well her eyes were green and her skin was soft
And the lady's heart was as hard as rock

But no matter where the poor man turned, the lady halted him
Her wish was his command, his life in her hands
And the death was slow 'cause she won't let go

Oh, black lady, that black lady

She tried to win, tried to buy
She was all over him 'cause he played all the cards just right
He laid out his hand like a winning man
With a smile so deep, she put him into a sleep
And you know she won

It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed,
In love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one.

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky.
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why.

Donna Summer,"Baby you
Turned my world into something new
Nights are long when you're far away
Hunger for you every night and day
Whisper softly to the wind
Need you back in my arms again
Passion calls from deep inside
It only happens when my love cries

You make my heart sing
When love cries
You make my heart sing
When love cries love cries love cries

And when I am blue
Close my eyes and dream of you
Silent echoes scream out your name
You're the keeper of my flame
I'll survive on desire
'til I'm closer to your burning fire
Ride a star across the sky
I need you here when my love cries

You make my heart sing
When love cries
You make my heart sing
When love cries love cries
You make my hear sing
When love cries

Ooh baby
To be near you
Just to feel you

Baby, baby
Baby, baby
You do it to me do it to me
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
You do it to me

In my heart
I never felt it quite like this before
And if I let it slip
I might not hear it anymore
I look into your eyes oh
And I get a chill
I hear your name
My world comes to a stand-still

The keeper of your flame
I want to be
Two hearts together
'Til eternity
Hand in hand
Side by side
Stride by stride
We'll be the one who hear
When love cries

You make my heart sing","When Love Cries [7"" Mix]",2005
Donna Summer,"You seduced me, baby, you looked at me with that look in your eye
Reminiscing of a perfect angel, completely took me by surprise
You know what I needed, so strong and yet so frail
Without a single word you called me and all the walls came falling down

You're so beautiful, so, so magical
You're so far beyond irresistible, make me feel so invincible
You're so beautiful, so, so darn mystical
My heart feels so unbreakable
You're the lover that I've always dreamed of

And you shared your feelings in these hidden letters
That you slipped in my pocket 'cause you're just too shy to say
Let me assure you, baby, that I feel the same way you do
Guaranteed I'll stay with you forever, oh, babe

Tell me that you wanna have me, that you really can't live without me
And, baby, you can have your way, I just wanna hear you say

Donna Summer,"Like the welcome of spring
Like the light that you bring
To skies that were empty and gray
Just your breath in the night
Can make it alright
When you sigh as you're drifting away
Oh baby

All that is simple and good
Lives in the places you stood
The things that are pure and true
Paint a picture of you
And you are all I can think of
Whenever there is love
Whenever there is love
Whenever there is love

Like a brief desert rain
Like the air that remains
Making everything suddenly new
Oh baby and like the light in your eyes
As if you and I made a world that was only for two
Oh tell me baby

If you are lost I will find you
No matter where you go
If you fall I'll be behind you",Wherever There Is Love,2005

Out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling

I could move a mountain when
Your hand is in my hand
Words cannot express
How much you mean to me
There must be some other way
To make you see
If it takes my heart and soul
You know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess
I'd gladly sacrifice

That I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby

A taste of love to
Build my hopes upon

To keep me holding on

Take the rest of me

We seem so far apart

I'm a woman that you've never seen
You might know me from somewhere else
As someone that I've never been.

I gave everything to play the game
My soul fell apart at the seams
I fell down like a house of cards
When somebody pulled the queen.

[Chorus]
'Cause you could spend your life
Lookin' for your own reflection
Time could blur the lines
Between what's real and what's projected
Had I known what I lost?
What I gained, what it'd cost
I'd still give what remains
To be myself again.

You must believe me when I say
Don't live someone else's design
Turn it around like a photograph
The writings been there all the time.

Now you can have all these hopes and dreams
The ones I can't use anymore
I don't know what it is you lost
But I hope you got what you came for.

[Chorus]

Sometimes I want to leave right now
Sometimes I want to cry out loud
I want to let it all hang out
But I don't want to let you down.

Sometimes I want to just lay here
Sometimes I want to disappear
I want to show you all my fear
But I don't want to let you down.

It's all about who they think you are
Pulling up in a crazy car
The front door is your garage
Everywhere en entourage
Play like you've been living large
Someone got your credit cards
Lend me your blah blah blah

Be careful
Be careful what you wish for

Since I was a child of three
I'd watch old movies on the silver screen
Kate Bette and Marilyn were the reigning queens
(Do you wanna be a star?)
I know if I can make it out
Out of this sleepy town then I could go real far
I could I'd really work so hard
And I could do it and do it and do it 'til I become a star

[Chorus]

Miami, London, Paris in a week
Lying in private, catching up sleep
Celebrity parties, politic profits
Rock'n' roll bullyboys walk the red carpet
Getting in VIP through the velvet rope
Shake hands, photograph and you gotta go
Little black book pools with the CEO
Smile and tell'em what they wanna know
And tell'em what they wanna know

Be careful
Be careful what you wish for

[Chorus]

Everybody wanna be a star
It's all about who they think you are
Pulling up in a crazy car
The front door is your garage
Everywhere an entourage
Play like you've been living large
Someone got your credit cards
Lend me your blah blah blah",Fame (The Game),2008

Saw the sun come through my blinds
And I looked up on the porch
And found an owl shrieking by
But never could I have imagined
Such a place like this

That I so adore
Are the little things that keep me

Miles along the shore
And a thousand seagulls called on me
So we came right back for more

Underneath the purple sky
Every time you look at me

I reach up to forever
With the promises you keep
They fill me with such happiness
It makes my heart believe

To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!

Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
I love you !",Three Times a Lady,2011

Someone found a letter you wrote me
On the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole
In your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant
 
I was so surprised and shocked
And I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul
Just how I've been feeling about you
But they said it really loud
They said it on the air

Don't it kinda strike you sad
When you hear our song
Things are not the same
Since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear
Is that you love me still
And that you think
You'll be comin' home real soon
Whoa oh oh oh oh
Yeah you kinda made me feel proud
When I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know
I can say what I really feel
'cause they said it really loud
They said it on the air

Then tune right in you made find the love you lost
'cause now I'm sitting here
With the man I sent away long ago
He found it really loud
They said it really loud

Or that I'd have to say goodbye to you so fast
I'm so numb, I can't feel anymore
Prayin' you'd just walk back through that door

And tell me that I was only dreamin'
You're not really gone as long as I believe

There will be another angel
Around the throne tonight
Your love lives on inside of me
And I will hold on tight
It's not my place to question
Only God knows why
I'm just jealous of the angels
Around the throne tonight

You always made my troubles feel so small
And you were always there to catch me when I'd fall
In a world where heroes come and go
Well God just took the only one I know
So I'll hold you as close as I can
Longing for the day, when I see your face again
But until then

God must need another angel

Some day I might figure it
Right now I'm just livin' it
Right now I'm just livin' it
Right now I'm just givin' it

Looking out over the multitude
Looking in to the heart of it
Reaching out into the middle of it
Seeing how we're a part of it

Chorus:
I'm feeling the tides of time
Moving in on my senses now
I'm feeling the tides of time
Pull me in, pull me out

Could be in the sun setting
Might be in the rise of a storm
Could be in the morning light
Must be in the moment you're born

Seems like human nature
Seems like the day to day
Seemed like a big hay ride
Started us out to find our way

All of the arrows are pointing sideways
All the lights are shining up
I'm everyone
Crying with a smile since time begun
Crying with a smile since time begun

All of the clocks are ticking forward

So I ran
Accumulating sin since time began

Validities on a ride
I'm so tired

It is now thought that the world is round
Everyone sees that sprinkling poison kills this flower
But what of the magic that causes this flower to be
Blues, greens, shades of demise, circle of surprise
We are born, then die
Thinking, thinking, feeling, smelling
Forever swimming in the middle, it's a question then a riddle
So as I lay down, totally immersed in the riddle of the universe
The unknown still far outweighs what we can be sure about these days

So we will amass all of these unknowns and label them spirit
We will take all the essence and the magic connection and call them love
And we will mix them in a pot with experience
And put them in my heart to bake at 98.6 degrees
And so I go walking, deciding, colliding
Searching from moment to moment 
Urging this bell to ring
For it makes me happy when causes are to sing

Chorus:
As I lay here gently sleeping
Love has caused spring to burst 
the world is turning softly
In the riddle of the universe

As I raise my hand in destruction
As I raise my hand in tender caress
As I raise my hands to sounds in the darkness
It's with an understanding that I do not fully possess

Let's start with the dreams we may have left behind
Let's build a fortress of love by the river

Dreamin of beach houses, mad ladies and Hummer jeeps
Got another beep now it's time to watch a brother creep
and pull another scam, not yet the man but the brother's deep
Ain't tryin to stay in this life for too long
You tellin me that I'm bound to lose, but you wrong
I'm too strong, plus me and my team's got a true bond
I'll stay in these streets, you stay in the house where you belong
Yo who's wrong, you never had to live in my shoes
And my view's, that every second is vital
The way I see nigga's the way I G it
A raw ghetto entrepreneur, yeah I be it
Not as glamourous, as the gangster flicks
I'll show you some gangster chicks that hold me down we get rich
And get this, bet this, I'm after payola

This money's comin too quick, I copped a house and two whips
Who switched it, not me, I'm keepin it real
Keepin the steel while the envious watch hungry, I'm eatin my meal
Late nights, there ain't no time for stage frights
This ain't fiction, it's my mission to get paid alright?
No need to speak about greed, long as I'm feedin my seed
then I'm completin the deed, so I'm keepin this cheese
High-priced lawyers, I'm too nice for ya
Never touchin the work no more, too precise for ya
Controllin the town, holdin it down
I'm the Master Allah Now, I'm showin you style
I go in your file, and make you hard to locate
Delete all your data don't disregard your fate
I'll off you then I'm off with a honey like suave bola
Shit I'm livin this life, til my hustlin days are over

Bouncin in and out of town, hope I don't step out of bounds
Chicks love to crowd around cause of my rep, how that sound?
Enemies are growin in numbers, hopin to catch me slumber
I wonder; how many are hopin to take me under?
NARC's and Feds, throwin darts at my head
Some new cats tryin to make me part with my bread
