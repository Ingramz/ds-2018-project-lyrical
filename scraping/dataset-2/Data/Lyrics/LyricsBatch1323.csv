Blossom Dearie,"All I want for Christmas is you
You're the gift that's made my dreams all come true
All I need for Christmas is here
Finding every sweet surprise wrapped up in your eyes 
Waiting there for me 
Underneath the tree

We'll spend the day
Exchanging kisses
Smile and say 
""What a Christmas this is""

Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells and mistletoe
Or the tinsel's silver glow 
You just look at me and oh - Christmas is here

Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells and mistletoe
Or the tinsel's silver glow 
You just look at me and oh - Christmas is here",A Christmas Love Song,1991
Blossom Dearie,"That certain night
The night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

I may be right I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole damned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said goodnight
A nightingale sang in Berekeley Square

How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
To those hazy crazy nights we met
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

Ah this heart of mine
Loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
We would dance cheek to cheek
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

The dawn came stealing up
All gold and blue
To interrupt our rendez-vous
I still remember how you smiled and said
Was that a dream or was it true?

Our homeward step was just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
And a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square

That night in Berkeley Square.",A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square,1991
Blossom Dearie,"Summer journeys to Niag'ra
and to other places aggra-
vate all our cares.
We'll save our fares!

I've a cozy little flat in
what is known as old Manhattan
we'll settle down
right here in town!

We'll have Manhattan
the Bronx and Staten
Island too.
It's lovely going through
the zoo!

It's very fancy
on old Delancy
street you know.
The subway charms us so
when balmy breezes blow
to and fro.

And tell me what street
compares with Mott Street
in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gli-ding by.

The great big city's a wonderous toy
just made for a girl and boy.
We'll turn Manhattan
into an isle of joy!

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the whiles
And starve together dear, in Chiles

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show they say
We both may see it close, some day

The city's glamour can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
into an isle of joy!
",Manhattan,1992
Blossom Dearie,"I don't know why, but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I've never had
Never had no kissin', oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be

I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me, but there's no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be

That the thrill of romance can be
Like a heavenly dream

Blossom Dearie,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1992
Blossom Dearie,"I don't know what day it is,
Or if it's dark out there;
Somehow that's just the way it is,
And I don't really care!

I go to this or that place,
I seem alive and well,
My head is just a hat place,
My breast an empty shell,
And I've a faded dream to sell.

All alone and all at sea,
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love,
Why is my heart so frail,
Like a ship without a sail?

Out on the ocean,
Sailors can use a chart;
I'm on the ocean,
Guided by just a lonely heart!

Still alone, all at sea,
Still there's no-one to care for me.
When there's no hand to hold my hand,
Life is a loveless tale,
Like a ship without a sail.

Still alone, all at sea,
Still there's no-one to care for me.
When there's no hand to hold my hand,

Blossom Dearie,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Blossom Dearie,"A little while ago I went and placed a call
To tell this girl I know that she could have it all
The wedding, the ring, the whole darn thing, 
I was willing to tie the knot
So I called her up, and this is the answer I got:

[Chorus]
""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine,
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know the whole routine.
Leave your name and number, and I'll try to get back to you;
You have 30 seconds to talk to me before you're through.""

And I said,
""Baby let's go get married, I need to hear you're mine.
I am hanging on, I am hanging on, I am hanging on this line.
And if I can leave one message before you go to bed,
I would say to you.""

And the phone went dead.

So I stepped out to buy some dog food for the cat.
Of course she called about three minutes after that.
Would she be my wife and share my life? 
Well of course you can write the plot,
Cause she called me up, and this is the answer she got:

""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine,
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know the whole routine.
Leave your name and number, and I'll try to get back to you;
You have 30 seconds to talk to me before you're through.""

And she said,
""Baby I got your message, I am answering your call.
I have thought it out, I have thought it out, 
and I think that, all-in-all
If you ask if we can marry, and make it for all time,
then my answer is.""

and the phone went,

""I'm so sorry, you have just reached my answering machine.""",Answering Machine,1996
Blossom Dearie,"Walking down the street
And suddenly you meet a pair of brown eyes
Dancing alone, up go the lights, out go the flags
On come the dancers, bang goes the drum
And you're in love and the show has begun

Then you're hand in hand and louder than the band
Your happy heart starts singing the song
And up go the lights, out go the flags
On come the dancers, bang goes the drum
And you're in love and the show has begun

The worlds a stage, the moons a spotlight in the skies
Your hearts applaudin' and the curtain started to rise
Suddenly you kiss and nothing quite like this
Has ever happened to you before

As up go the lights, out go the flags
On come the dancers, bang goes the drum

Blossom Dearie,"Down with love the flowers and rice and shoes 
Down with love the root of all midnight blues 
Down with things that give you that well-known pain 
Take that moon wrap it in cellophane

Down with love let's liquidate all its friends 
Moon and June and roses and rainbow's ends 
Down with songs that moan about night and day 
Down with love yes take it away, away

Away 
Far away 
Give it back to the birds and bees and the Viennese

Down with eyes romantic and stupid 
Down with sighs and down with cupid

Blossom Dearie,"Say you're fond of fancy thing
Diamond clips and emerald rings
And you want your man to come through

Blossom Dearie,"Into a cabaret
One fatal day
A little songbird flew
Found it so very gay
He thought he'd stay
Just to get a bird's eye view

When he heard the jazz band playing
He was happy as a lark
To each measure he kept swaying
And he stayed 'til after dark

Then back to the land he knew
Thrilled through and through
He sailed on in the air
Called all the other birds
And in these words
Started gurgling then and there

I'm a little jazz bird
And I'm telling you to be one too
For a little jazz bird
Is in heaven when it's singin' blue

I say it with regret
But you're out of date
You ain't heard nothing yet
'Til you syncopate

When the going is rough
You will find your troubles all have flown
If you warble your stuff
Like the moanin' of a saxophone

Just try my recipe
And I'm sure you'll agree
That a little jazz bird
Is the only kind of bird to be

Blossom Dearie,"Once upon a summertime, if you recall
We stopped beside a little flower stall
A bunch of bright forget-me-nots
Was all I'd ever let you buy me

Once upon a summertime just like today
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And stole a kiss at every street cafe

You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree
I was as proud as any girl could be
As if the mayor had offered me the key
To Paris

Now another winter time has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chimed
You loved me once upon a summertime

Blossom Dearie,"There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and ye shall find

I've had in mind

Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret

I'd like
To add his initial
To my monogram

Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb?

There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be

Who'll watch over me

When I take you out in the surrey

Nosey pokes'll peek thru their shutters
And their eyes will pop

      Has it really got a team of snow white horses
      One's like snow, the other's more like milk
      So y' c'n tell them apart

All the world 'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey
When I take you out in the surrey
With the fringe on top

When we hit that road hell for leather
Cats and dogs 'll dance in the heather
Birds and frogs 'll sing altogether
And the toads 'll hop

   The wind 'll whistle as we rattle along
   The cow 'll moo in the clover
   The river 'll ripple out a whispered song
   And whisper it over and over

Don't you wisht it'd go on forever
Don't you wisht it'd go on forever
Don't you wisht it'd go on forever

Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder

Blossom Dearie,"I'm discontented
With homes that are rented
So I have invented my own

Darling this place is
A lover's oasis
Where life's weary chase is unknown

Far from the cry of the city
Where flowers pretty
Caress the streams

Cozy to hide in,
To live side by side in
Don't let it abide in my dreams

Picture me upon your knee
With tea for two, and two for tea
Me for you, and you for me

Blossom Dearie,"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels

As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

And they tell me that I've changed

Blossom Dearie,"Yesterday, when I was young,
The taste of life was sweet, as rain upon my tongue,
I teased at life, as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame

The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned,
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand,
I lived by night, and shunned the naked light of day,
And only now, I see, how the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young,
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me,
And so much pain, my dazzled eyes refused to see

I ran so fast that time, and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think, what life, was all about,
And every conversation, I can now recall,
Concerned itself with me, and nothing else at all

Yesterday, the moon was blue,
And every crazy day, brought something new to do,
I used my magic age, as if it were a wand,
And never saw the worst, and the emptiness beyond

The game of love I played, with arrogance and pride,
And every flame I lit, too quickly, quickly died,
The friends I made, all seemed somehow to drift away,
And only I am left, on stage to end the play

There are so many songs in me, that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste, of tears upon my tongue,
The time has come for me to pay,
For yesterday, when I was young","Yesterday, When I Was Young",1997

Still wishing you had made me stay

It even sounds like a game in a green field
Hobby horses play the dusty game when it's may

pink and paisley skies shining in green eyes
A magic pin wheel, london flowers in her hair

dusty springfield, silver starshine over crystal waters
Petals fall from her glance
Flowers sparkle with a dew of morning
Feathers float from her dance

I wish you bluebirds in the Spring,
To give your heart a song to sing;
And then a kiss, but more than this I wish you love.

And in July, a lemonade,
To cool you in some leafy glade;
I wish you health and more than wealth, I wish you love.

That you and I could never be,
So with my best, my very best, I set you free.

A cozy fire to keep you warm;

Completely square is the envelope

My true love tried to sneak through.
Rectangular is the transom
Over which I had to peek through.

In part I must agree: one chick too many had he!

It's very subtle, The Continental,
Because it does what you want it to do.
It has a passion, The Continental,
An invitation to moonlight and romance.
It's quite the fashion, The Continental,

Your lips whisper so tenderly.
Her eyes answer your song.
Two bodies swaying, The Continental,
And you are saying just what you're dreaming of.
So keep on dancing, The Continental,
For it's a song of romance and of love.
You kiss while you're dancing.

Not a bad idea. 
The Continental, hmmmmm. It's continental.
You sing while you're dancing.
Your voice is gentle and sentimental.
You stroll together arm in arm.
You nonchalantly glide along with grace and charm.

That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul,
A certain rhythm that you can't control,
And you will do

Is when I search for the light
Pick up my pen and start to write
I struggle, I fight dark forces in the clear moonlight
Without fear

Insomnia

I can't get no sleep

I used to worry
Thought I was going mad in a hurry
Getting stressed, making excess mess in darkness
No electricity, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no release, no peace
I toss and turn without cease
Like a curse, open my eyes and rise like yeast
At least a couple of weeks since I last slept, kept taking sleepers
But now I keep myself pepped
Deeper still, that night
I write by candlelight, I find insight
Fundamental movement, huh, so when it's black

Keep the beast in my nature

See if you can relate to this one

Hope I'm not disturbing you
Because you look into thought right now

And I'll never see your face again,
I'll never see your face again. No

Tell the story of your life
Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by, turn a blind eye

Blu,"When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up
I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning Js, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
Twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And made it today, I'll restart fresh and new

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today

Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day",The Day,2010

And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feeling the pinch, some feeling the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone
(Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone)
Never leave you alone
(Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone)

Yo, so what you searching for? From birth
Born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
Lurking and murk them, got them turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
'Cause, see, the past tense it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stumble, the mansion while
Bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks
Bad shit going down on the daily
While bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn
They say he's the bastard for chasing them
Maybe it's the patterns that make me that made me crazy

[Chorus]

Life is fiction, competition, and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto; I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow--that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure make death a hidden treasure
A girly pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never--move it, move it, love it, or lose it
'Fore it's recruited, then included inside the stupid
It's things of nature; paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it; don't allow it to pop without it
Then those who doubt it do or die the death of cowards
The world is yours and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law; start a fire; then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before Glydes and i-Pod

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Yo, it's too much strain, phenomenal gain
I'm going through things, headaches, abdominal pain
Tryna numb it with that kettle like I'm from the Ukraine
Check the blue flame; lighter running out of butane
What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive?
Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant-slash-train-wreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
Hit me up at black dot gov like the government
Banana Republican, alien intelligence
Kill switch, real pissed, thinking of some ill shit
The stone the builder refused he need to build with
Got immunized for both flus; I'm still sick

All my life I had that name, but never banged
I'm from the Bridge, my folk from the 4th
East side to the dro, and all the way back home, let it be known
I got love for my block, love for my color
Love for my streets, and love for my brother
But a nigga put his hands on me, we catch fades
Fuck I look like? 30, gettin' jumped in a gang
And my peeps say, ""How you keep peace these days
If you ain't got a piece by your reach these days?""
I say, my nigga, when you victim to the system
It don't matter what you do, they always fuckin' with you
So just bang

Love over fear, the stars have aligned
The end of a time

The highest realm, she never saw yellow submarines
And human beings from outer space, out of space, out of mind
Dotted line grinds, got 'em signing up for Columbine
Columbian white lines, ring around the rosie's, pocket full of homies
Only one god, sat up above all with the mastermind

Pictures that we never took of bitches off that top shelf

You can bag it like cotton for slaves, water for chocolates
Pilot my pivot, piss in a bucket
Kick our feet up as our children grow up nothing like us

And i don't give a damn if this the end

If this is love, fuck it, I could be a god
If I'm a god watch me pull a heaven out a star
360 billion trillions miles away from home
I heard a heartbeat and decided I should make a song
Momma read a song tell my father I'mma see him where that grass gets
Greener than Seattle after storms, about to read my last poem
Hope you forget it, I told her that it's only one way
I took a million steps, must have read a million scripts
'Fore I picked the perfect role, churches, corporations
Slave wages, pretty hoes
Whoever told the police he could take my life?
Take my brother's life! Fuck it, take my mother's life!
Take my land, take my manhood, my fucking rights! (Biatch!)
Then enforce the laws
Pray to God one day we gonna be free like the children in the king's dream
I remember being free on King street

One day we'll be free like forever

I See you on the other side, not only in my dreams
I See that it's the end of time
Someone, somewhere, every day
I see

Somebody's fag, pulled the dick out they ass and I shot the fucker
I could never stop to love her when shots flutter
Cock suckers with pretty wives and gay children
Wear badges and cry, At beauty pageants my sister won a prize
I was in the prison hiding presents from the guards
And local racism, 8 minutes and this whole world is finna end
I watch the fringe film 'the fin', infant again
She says she got to see where infinite ends and it was beautiful
I said I know I make the music

My bloodline reconnected under my family tree
Was it an atom or Adam? Science or religion?
Was it the spirit in man or molecules in him?
Beer in my hand till I can't stand the system
I walk through ghetto alleys like the titans through the valley
Turn the wisdom into a tooth in my mouth
And spit the Judas out
Producing songs like farms to put my music out
Fruits of my labor, vegetables and turntables
Bringing day with the night
Watching the light cross stage you
The future bit the computer 'fore it chopped up the snake
'Cause they say, apple a day keeps the doc away

Found Atlantis and a poem
Left a rap book in Pomona

Like all at once I wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
Before I go insane I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you (I think I love you)

This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself and never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into the room

I think I love you so what am I so afraid of
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

I think I love you isn't that what life is made of
Though it worries me to say that I never felt this way

I don't know what I'm up against
I don't know what it's all about

Though it worries me to say I never felt this way

Believe me you really don't have to worry
I only wanna make you happy and if you say ""hey go away"" I will

And it ain't about the box,
it's 'bout the rocks

So much I have come across

I have come to know and love
That's what made me who I am
So I'm showing love, to home

There is no place, quite like home

Home is a state of mind
It's the thing that keeps
Me grounded
It's where I can always go
And blend right in (yea)
So even when I'm far away
I'm not really far at all
Because I carry home around
With me in my heart

There is no place, quite like home

With family and friends
For life
They were there long
Before the hype
And this is why

Brings me new life
Then came you

My life depends on you

Yeah, yeah 

I won't say stop because you ask me to 
Don't leave our love behind (behind) 
Honey won't you tell me (tell me) 
Tell me (yeah) 
Why you're messing with my mind 

Chorus 
'cause you don't care nothing about the things I do 
You don't care nothing about the pain you put me through 
Show your feelings for me 
'cause you don't care nothing about the things I say 
'cause you don't care nothing about the way I feel today 
I won't let love r.i.p 

I won't take away your hurt in me 
You gotta treat me with some dignity 
Hey baby, I'm not gonna take it this time, oh no (oh no, oh no) 

'cause I'm much stronger then you think you know 
Won't play your game this way (this way) 
Honey, won't you tell me, tell me (oh) 
Just what you're trying to say 

Chorus 

Oh, ah love r.i.p 
If you say that you're not serious (yeah, yeah) 
Walk away and just forget about us 
Hey baby, I'm not gonna take it this time (not gonna leave our love behind, behind)

Then we'll take it nice and slow

Will the sorrow ever change?

So now my soul's in debt, I must regret

Yet the mirror laughs at me when I forget myself.

I'd sure go back in time and tell that guy ...hey, man.
You can do better than this, you can answer your prayers.
You can grant your own wish.

Just hold on out your hands and give the most you can.
And I swear to you you'll feel a better man.

And it's better by far to do what you do now.

Trying to make two wrongs right

Hurt lovers, hurt, hurt lovers oh
Don't give up, don't, don't give up no

Comes apart at the seams
And when all of the bridges you build
Washed away in a stream

Oh
Whatever comes
It's not the end
We gotta fight
And take a stand

Hurt lovers, hurt, hurt lovers oh
Don't give up, don't, don't give up no
Take cover
We can't just let it go
We gotta try
We gotta try

Hurt lovers, hurt so bad again
Find something, to make things right again
It don't matter who wins out in the end
We gotta try
We gotta try
Even when you lose her
And you played the last card
You know
You know, you know

We're standing in
Allowed to fight
Trying to make two wrongs right

Hurt lovers, hurt, hurt lovers oh
Don't give up, don't, don't give up no
We gotta try

Don't give up, don't, don't give up no

You get your sights on dreams,and man a thousand different things.
You are on for yourself,you're chasing cool desire.
You get addicted fast, but man you're playin' with fire.

Then there's a day that comes to you.
When you get all you want, but there's a space inside that's still as empty as it was.
'Till an angel comes your way and man she's fallin' fast.
You know she's so in need but she is to afraid to ask.

So you hold on out your hands and catch her best you can.
And in givin' love you feel a better man.

*And the gift is what you get by givin' more than you receive.
And you're learnin' fast that maybe this is how you'll be happy.
'Cause in takin' everything you lost, the air you need to breath.
But in givin' it away, you found the precious thing you seek.

Man, it's funny how she smiles, how grateful she is now.
And how that touches me deep in my heart somehow.
Yet the mirror laughs at me when I forget myself.
When I complain about, this hand that I got dealt.

And if I had know before, how much she would change my life.
I'd sure go back in time and tell that guy ...hey, man.
You can do better than this, you can answer your prayers.
You can grant your own wish.

Just hold on out your hands and give the most you can.
And I swear to you you'll feel a better man.

And it's better by far to do what you do now.
And leave the rest to love.
Just be strong in who you are.
Once you start on that road.
You're safe in the knowledge.
That anyway you go.
Will lead you home.

Lovin' every morning
Good loving every night
That is what I gave you,
And you were so satisfied
Dinner on the table
There were flowers in the bed
Anything you asked for
Was it all real or just in my head? 

Think now, of what it should've been
Our love, all it could've been
If you were ever wondering
I'm doin' fine, but in my mind 

I could never believe and never understand
How you could do this to me
Enough is enough, done all I can

Throwing away our yesterdays
Everything we planned
Cause you're a girl, I'll never understand 

How you feelin now?
Are you happy now?
I'm doing just fine 

Covered you in diamonds
Gave you summer in the sun
And at that moment I had only just begun
Got you the designers
From every magazine
Baby if I'd known then
All this pain inside would never be 

Girl, you are a mystery
So glad, that we're history
Guess we were never meant to be
And I'm doin' fine, but in my mind

And wrapped on velvet feet
And here through the window

In the blowing night
And pulled the shade
To a clear green game
And from the visions
Riding heavy sea.

I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna love you till the moon turns black
I'm gonna love you till the sun turns blue.

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

I hear the dancin' of the raindrops
While we tumble in the hayloft
You're laughing at my bad jokes
Singing oh so sweet
I hear the creaking of the screendoor
Bare feet on a wooden floor
But to hear you whisper my name

You're trying to fall asleep

I'm sure you roll your eyes at me
You know that I get fragile when I get off the farm
But you keep me held together

In the grit is where you’ll find us
Separate the weak from the fighters
Presented as the minority with mass destruction behind us
No rest for the wicked round ere
Souls lost like the wicker man’s here
And I swear they got wicked man ear

Baring the scares of the pain of my past
through the apathy translate in these bars
Locked in a cage fight
Face to face with my consequences 
From decisions that I made 
I
Felt like I would fall by the wayside 
And not make it through the raging fire
It’s thin line between love and hate
Fear and Faith 
I situate in a lukewarm state

I drew a bead on him to practice my aim

A shot rang out across the land
The horse, it kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head

I set off running to wake from my dream
My brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me
My head in my hands

The sheriff he asked me why had I run
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
“Explain to the courtroom
What went through your mind
We'll ask the jury what verdict they find”

I said, ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I were dead”
I hung my head, I hung my head

Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows high up on the hill
And off in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain

He's come to fetch me, to see what they’ve done

Remain to love until they droop and die

Thumbed across the East coast to a squat between A and C.

She liked the money, she liked the power she had over them.

Get rid of society... she breathes fire.
Don't need anything... she breathes fire.

Or sparing change in FLA, every year it was a different scene.
She conquered Texas, fell in love in Santa Fe,
Maybe she'd finally found a place where she could finally stay.

Get rid of society... she breathes fire.
Don't need anything... she breathes fire.

Get rid of the family... she breathes fire,
Get rid of the memories... she breathes fire.

She painted fires of the bridges that she burned,
Tearing out the pages from the book that said to take her turn.

Now she's right back where she started,
At home with Mom and Dad.
Watch it burn and blow away,
What happened to the dream she had?

She's back to everything... she breathes fire,
She's back in society... she breathes fire.
Given up on everything... she breathes fire.

Blue Mink,"So we waved our hands as we marched along
And the people smiled as we sang our song
And the world was saved as they listened to the band
And the Banner-Man held the banner high

He was ten feet tall and he touched the sky
And I wish that I could be a Banner-Man

Glory, glory, glory

Listen to the band
Sing the same old story
Ain't it something grand?
To be good as you can
Like a Banner-Man

And the drums went, boom as the cornets play
And the tuba, ""Umba'' ""D"", all the way
And the kids and the dogs were laughing as they ran
And the Banner-Man held the banner high
With an Allelujah in his eye
And I wish that I could be a Banner-Man

Glory, glory, glory

So we reached the square, on the top of the hill
And the music stopped and we stood still
And a few were saved and the people said
Amen

Then we all got up and we formed a queue
And the drums went, bang as the trumpets blew
And we marched back down into the town again

Blue Mitchell,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

They set their hair on fire. Strung thier guitars with barbed wire. Danced in the rain, and sang at the Sunny, just live in the van when they ain't got no money. 

Chorus: Roll on rock and roll soldier. No time to think your getting older, when you got that big green on your mind. 

In a town by the riverside, where the king got fat and died. The rednecks were talkin about a second coming, but the boys on the street were buned out and bummin. So the boys tried to state their case. Rappin rhymes over funky bass. You better watch out boy, you're gonna get censored, or knocked up side your head by a public defender.

Chorus: I want to ride with you in my blue canoe. Baby lets go ridin. slippin and a sliding. In my blue canoe.

You bring the ice chest and I'll get the bait. Meet me at the lake and don't be late. Cause all this hangin around, is draggin me down. I gotta get behind the wheel and get the hell out of town.

Blue Mountain,"Well I knew this town was headed for hell the day they tore down the hippy hotel. Mister Rogers said it was too far gone. Had to clear it away, commercialin zone. For a hundred years it stood the test of time, till they laid it down to rest in pieces that won't be joined again. When they clear away the wreck, they're gonna raise the roof on a disco tech, with mirror balls and woofers cranked to 10.

Well, there's something kinda strange about this street. When I walk it, I can feel it in my feet. Long ago, an old lady lived in a house with 40 cats and a freeze-dried spouse. Memories haunt that vacant lot, hangin in the trees like patchy fog. Late at night, they whisper in the wind. No one listens to the trees and they'll be gone soon wait and see. Once they're gone they won't come back again.

First time that I saw her was the summer I turned 14. She was sitting on the hood of a car, at the drive in show. I saw a tear roll down her face, as she gazed up at the screen. And her black hair in the wind began to blow.

Chorus: Shine on soul sister. She's my only bright light in this town. She's my soul sister, and I'm hoping that she'll come back around.

The last time that I saw here was through the bottom of a glass. I was struggling to hold my head up off the floor. I called her name out once or twice, but she moved just a little too fast, and she walked out of my life and slammed the door.

Blue Mountain,"When I woke up today, I was feeling ok. But my mind started turning as breakfast was burning. My soul slipped away to a red evening sky, and a lovers sweet sigh, in the wink of an eye. In the wink of an eye.

Just try not to think, cause it will drive you to drink. But I cannot forget the all the things that you said while when were high. I was flying too high, hung out to dry, in the wink of an eye.

What more can I say, why should I even try. After reading your letter, I don't know whether to laugh or to cry, or just say goodbye, just say goodbye. With a wink in my eye.

Do you remember, Love, the words we spoke
Have you forgotten all the tender vows we made
In the silent magical moonbeams' light
Gone are the golden dreams with summer roses
And all our tenderest vows were made, but to be broken

Song of songs, song of memory
And broken melody of love and life
Nevermore for me can that melody
Fill the heart with the joy once we knew

Oh night of bliss, night of June and love
Beneath the stars, amid the roses
Oh, dream of delight that faded at dawn

Run for your life run for your life
There's been a riot

They cut him down to the ground
Still they didn't find the knife
They say it's murder-murder in the first degree
They have no suspect, now those hound dogs follow me

They cut him down to the ground when he
Didn't have nowhere to hide

No way am I about to die
No way can I forgive myself

No way I'm coming back today

Around my wedding finger and that's where I want to state this clain

Before I go and get myself in loveâ??

Learning to love life by living through loss andmistakes,
Lessons Learned then gradually surfacing/
Letting go,
Stripping naked to scream/
I am not perfect, nor do I strive to be/
I am alive in this world of face first falls and public breakdowns/
I'm a retarded dis figured clown, dying to be heard for the simple art of letting this heavy wall finally fall/
I'm an equal being of no race, or color, a hallucination if you will/
Sneaking into the the lives of strangers and letting them fall apart to a new rhythm/
Just to feel better.

I sleep the sadness that no one else sleeps
Feel me cunningly adore.

As the tic tock clock lies Goldilocks
What a sick enchanted view
Of the white blot sin that we all began
Not the girl that I once knew.

Blue Sunshine
I've got no vacancies
At the top of the clock was Jesus spying on me
I spoke of friends
Point me which direction
I tried a bribe of when I die but swore he never
Mentioned.

I kicked and screamed,
""Its simple, you must sing
The day I take you, you'll be sleeping
You won't feel a thing.""



",Blue Sunshine [Live],2005
Blue October,"There's something that I can't quite explain
I'm so in love with you
You'll never take that away
And if I said it a hundred times before
Expect a thousand more
You'll never take that away

Well expect me to be calling you to see
if you're okay when I'm not around
Askin' if you love me
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile
To make a smile

[Chorus]
Well I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe, you actually picked me

I thought that the world had lost its way
(Its so hard sometimes)
Then I feel in love with you
(Then came you)
And you took that away
(Its not so diffcult, the one's not so difficult)

You take away the old, show me the new
I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you
So while I'm on this phone
And hundred miles away from home
I'll take the words you gave and send them back to you

Well expect me to be calling you to see
if you're okay when I'm not around
Askin' if you love me
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile
To make a smile

The part about you I'm tearing it out
A simple goodnight, stop fighting
There's nothing left to even read about
I'm leaving you here, my darling
To search for a better and easy way out
Through all of the pain that I'm causing
There's nothing left to even sing about
And it goes (scat lyrics)

In front of the midnight music show,
I beat up, I beat up the boy that made ya happy, though (scat lyrics)

They out-weigh the ones that make me happy
So pull out your hands and meet my, my fine new lady
She's rock and roll, and she saved me

Blue October,"A blackout in the room again
A busted lip and broken skin.
I wake up in the bathroom 
And dare not bother asking
Why the mirror's cracked and all I see 
Are shards of glass inside of me.

There's voices there to dare me,
My father's here to scare me.
My mother sits beyond the door she's 
Curled up crying on the floor,
Look at what her son's done.

When the weight of all the world's gone wrong.
It's gone wrong again.
Gone fucking wrong.
It's gone wrong again.

Well liars they leave a guilty trail.
And let me tell you something people, 
I've been lying for fucking years.
That must be why I'm standing in this space.
Disregarding that I've created these monsters
They're on fucking both of my sides,
So I wipe the blood from both of their eyes.
From all four of their eyes.

And while I wait for wounds to heal
I see you by the window sill,
Your heart's torn out
A plastic spoon
When honesty lit up that room 
So I stole the pillowcase to clean
This mess I've made of someones dream.
Now you've seen what I've done,

when the weight of all the world's gone wrong.
It's gone wrong again
Gone fucking wrong
It's gone all wrong again.

This room is old and wise
I fall onto the bed and wonder,
""How did I get here?""
The little boy who would argue with a tree
Just fucking thump his head
And he'll turn back to normal.

Now why is that what I see?
Don't bother trusting
Don't bother waiting
Don't bother changing things that won't give into changing
Just let me go away.

I'm down

Blue October,"Have you ever been so lonely
There is no one there to hold?
Just pull me in or disown me
And then climb inside
My arms are open wide
Have a look inside

It is not that I am scared to learn
Just why I'm empty inside
Hold my hand or show some concern
If I live or die
My eyes are open wide
Help me look inside

Singing ha de de ha ha de de ah

I hear the water drip from the faucet
It's sweetly falling in tune
I'm gently closing the closet and I 
Fall to the floor
And crawl to my room
The thought of ending it soon
Just let me sleep in my room

Hear me cry! Cry! Cry!
I hear a knock at the front door
Don't come in!
I try to look at you
But I can't stop shaking
Leave me alone, just go away
Mother I'm so scared, I'm so scared

An empty bed and all of the sheets are gone
They're wrapped around me and you
All is quiet but the drop of my gun
'Cause I, I want to belong, to someone
But maybe life's not for everyone

Blue October,"I try to stay on top of you
To hold your body down
Your shaking seems to hinder every grasp that I had found

Moving every inch around me
To defuse your private bomb
I stretch myself surrounding and protecting you from harm

I use a wallet for your mouth so when you bite you will not bleed
I drilled a wire through my cheek and let it down and out my sleeve

And now you're pulling out the best of me
Yeah, which never ever comes
This wire's all that's left of me and it's hooked within my gums within my gums

So drill it, so drill it, so hard, I feel it
(So drain it) so drill it, so drill it, so hard, I feel it
(You've got to drain it)

As proof to show I'd bleed for this I'd cut myself to shame
To get to know this masochist who's stolen my first name

Pretending he's a teacher holding all my weight at ease
But the teacher seems to split in two destroying both his knees

Now crawling I position myself below your broken wings
I lift your feathered left arm where you hide your heart from me

I never noticed it was swollen with the touch of brutal pain
I never knew a heart could live inside the rust from all your rain
All your rain

So drill it, so drill it, so hard, I feel it
(So drain it) so drill it, so drill it, so hard, I feel it
(You've got to drain it)

I didn't think to bring a wash cloth or to rub away the dirt
Myself and I, we share this barely-beating heart of hurt

And when the hurt comes there's an argument
A fight to save a smile
A small attack on human tears to dry them for a while

A dream we all should count on, yeah, a vision I believe
In where confidence is found attached to wires on our sleeve

In where loneliness is history
Told to pack his shit and leave
And where guidance is a fortune told to help in time of need

And where crying isn't secret, it's the art of how we grieve
And lessons are the key to every goal I will achieve, I will achieve

So drill it, so drill it, so hard, I feel it
(So drain it) so drill it, so drill it, so hard, I feel it

Inside a bubble bath
An icing drip below your lip
So we undo the math
A sudden slip between
My pathetic sedatives
A real-life script of how
Mistakes became our medicine, so

Delay the hurtful words
Of complicated overcast
Please take the message that I'm
Picking up my chin at last

It gets stronger when you're next to me

A nervous bleeding in my brain

The one thing that always tore us apart
Is the one thing I won't touch again
In a sick way I want to thank you
For holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself,
You were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions
On things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself
When it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away

Kicking shadows on the street
For every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy,
I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes crying,
And I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling,
""make it go away!""
Just make a smile come back
And shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered,

They're crawling like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, 
A nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you
Will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me 
Just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me? 
It is I that wanted space

Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months,
It's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart 
Is the one thing I won't touch again
In a sick way I want to thank you 
For holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, 
You were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions 
On things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself 
When it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away 
That I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart 
To leave me behind

And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street 
For every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, 
I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes crying, 
And I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, 
""make it go away!""
Just make a smile come back 
And shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered, 
""How can you do this to me?""

To hold your body down
Your shaking seems to hinder every grasp that I had found

Moving every inch around me
To defuse your private bomb
I stretch myself surrounding and protecting you from harm

I use a wallet for your mouth so when you bite you will not bleed
I drilled a wire through my cheek and let it down and out my sleeve

And now you're pulling out the best of me
Yeah, which never ever comes
This wire's all that's left of me and it's hooked within my gums within my gums

I lift your feathered left arm where you hide your heart from me

(You've got to drain it)

I didn't think to bring a wash cloth or to rub away the dirt
Myself and I, we share this barely-beating heart of hurt

And when the hurt comes there's an argument
A fight to save a smile
A small attack on human tears to dry them for a while

A dream we all should count on, yeah, a vision I believe
In where confidence is found attached to wires on our sleeve

In where loneliness is history
Told to pack his shit and leave
And where guidance is a fortune told to help in time of need

And where crying isn't secret, it's the art of how we grieve
And lessons are the key to every goal I will achieve, I will achieve

I feel like I'm getting more paranoid and I'm hearing things
And they never turn out real
It feels like my heart is made of pure steel
It's just so heavy all the time

I'm scared of death
And I'm scared of living
I gave up on the past cause it's unforgiving
I misplaced my trust
I watched my word begin to rust
I'm a balloon about to bust
I need a place for reliving. 
Still

Sometimes I feel like weeping
Awake and when I'm sleeping
Perfecting how to put a game face on
This puzzle I've been keeping
Has been in hiding creeping out the closet door
Spilling out onto the floor

How long will I be picking up pieces?
How long will I be picking up my heart? [Repeat: x7]

How long (in another space and time)
Keep picking up pieces in the corner of my mind
How long (its getting oh so hard to find)
Keep picking up pieces in the corner of my mind
But I still walk on",Picking Up Pieces,2009

I'm laughing with a broken face
I stumble across my self esteem
But to picture the pleasure is making me want my space

That God wrapped you like a bow

There's some shelves that need cleaning
From basement to ceiling, control

If what you're seeing is an open book
That's great 'cause I'm an open book
But I'm real shy

There's a part of me seeking and desperately needing to open up
That's strange 'cause I'm an open book, a confused boy

I'm an automatic steeple for depressed and lonely people
My heart while in its cage

But the only funny thing is that I don't know how to give myself advice

I've got this tattoo of a ring that lies
Around my wedding finger and that's where I want to state this claim

Blue October,"Here alone, standing barefoot in our lawn
Worms squeezing their way through my toes, tonight that's how it goes
I'm at your window kneeling quiet
I thought at least I'd maybe try to get your head right
Your heart right, let him go

Then through the glass I see your dress fall to the floor
As he embraces every inch of you, the woman I adore
I can't believe the way you're bending
Can't believe this never ending moaning asking him for more
Begging him for more

How far will I go to make it feel right?
Come home, I have to fix this on my own

Replace my heart
'Cause I'm convinced mine broke the day I let us end
Replace my heart
I don't wanna live by coping, I'm done with hoping end

I creeped in close enough to see the way he touched her
From her feet across her knees inside her sweetest spot
He pleased and pleased her
I turned around and tried to take control, but no control was capable
It was a centerfold of how less than low can possibly go

I squeezed the life into my brain like pushing knives into a vein
I've gotta get, I said I've gotta get inside
So to the back window I crawl in silent standing in the darkness
Of my living room, this used to be my home

How far will I go to make it feel right?
Come home, I'm moving forward to the bedroom door

Replace my heart
'Cause I'm convinced mine broke the day I let us end
Replace my heart
I don't wanna live by coping, I'm done with hoping end

And I turn the doorknob with two fingers to be slow
Enough to sneak into the room among the corner darkness gloom
I had to see this happening
He pushed himself so deep inside her clapping rang
And bounced off every wooden walled room

And that's when all went silent blank except the color red
As I walked calmly numbing paralyzed beside the bed
I said I know I'm not allowed to be here
I just had to see how good your new man really fucks you
'Cause you both been fucking me

So now I planned the last thing you can both do as a pair
I tie both blindfolds tight around your fucking eyes to blind your stare
I don't want to alarm you, but I figured we could end this in
What seems easy quick and painless, man

So I'll get down to business
I choose you first, there's a gun, it's at your head
So laugh at me one more time but keep your face inside the bed
You sit and watch me while I do this shit and learn from what I've said
I cocked the pistol pulled the trigger, and all I saw was red

How far will I go to make it feel right?
Come home, I have to fix this on my own

Then the screaming oh, the screaming
It's nice to see you scared of such a weak and stupid husband
Who knows you never really cared
I'll leave you with a question that I need to hear from your head
Was all this worth it knowing you have just seconds left to live?

Now think about your answer, laying face down on the bed
I cocked the pistol pulled the trigger and all I saw was red
I gently stroke her arm as she lies lifeless on her back
Then placed the barrel in my mouth, all I saw was black",The End,2011
Blue October,"I've sat at the back of the line for years,
Wishing the world wouldn't spin,
I give in, alone again it appears.
There were pieces of me that lived in corners on a hard wood floor.
Until an Angel walked in through my door.

Time stopped, the arch of her back grew wings.
And pulling me further from a devil to a heaven, she said ""Believe.""
True peace as she looked into my soul.
She said ""I'm here to show you faith, and to help you when you fall.""

Beating underneath these stars?
You're the Angel that came, and took these clouds away.

Flies

I'll whisper in your ear,
You are mine, and you will never have to be alone.
And when I pull you near,
You'll know I love you like I never loved anyone.
So let me be the one to lift you up,
I'll carry you home.
'Cause now I'm here to keep you safe,
And to catch you when you fall.

Only you can see the true me,
Through all the right, and wrong.
Take hold, the best has yet to come.

You've given me the strength to believe in my heart again!
And now we're here to share this faith.
Stand together through it all.

Wrong in righting nature calls.
Everybody wants some
It's always just a shame shame shame
Everybody needs some
I am the only one to blame

Could be remarkable
Because I always used to play
Just the tip.
But I know, I know
That I could live like this forever

Everybody's saying that it’s possible
But it never seemed
To make any since
Now I know, I know
I can stay like this forever
If I go ahead and put it in.

I can be one
I can reach for the sun
Tear my old world down
To build back up

Blue Öyster Cult,"Raise your can of beer on high
And seal your fate forever
Our best years have past us by
The golden age of leather

This was the night not long to come in the year of our Lord A.D.
Where in a desert way-house, poised on the brink of eternity
Four and ninety studded horsemen closed the knot of honor
As only drunken soldiers can

And passed from man to man, a wanton child to dead to care
That each would find his pleasure as he might
For this fantastic night was billed as nothing less than the end of
An age
A last crusade, a final outrage, in this day of flaccid plumage

And there was worn no cloth but leather
Made supple by years of stinging cinders
And here were seen the scars of age
For age had been the common call for one last night together

Down colored the sky (the ritual feast)
Some had died (they were buried with their bikes)
Each grabbed a rag (from a man with a sack)
Torn strips of color (the red and the black)

We made a vow to give it all we had to give
We made a vow to die as we had lived

They flew the colors, they began to fight
They flailed at each other like bugs at a light
Bodies and bikes beyond repair
Smell of oil and gas in the air

Then the wind whipped the desert with a giant hand
And the humans and the Harleys caught the shifting sand
And the old ranger weathered the storm
And he topped the rise by the middle of morn
He saw rippled dunes, calm and surreal
And a glint of a shaft of chromium steel

Perched on American steel Riders with no name
Time cannot reveal riders with no names

On October 31'st many years ago
Three friends went out for a ride
For it was a famous party night
And to party was to get high
They loaded up on beer and cocaine
And they started their bikes with a roar
They couldn't have known that on this night
They were beginning their longest tour

They're torn asunder by those who died

Their metal beasts howled in the night
And dark specter was their guide
They came around the curve too fast
Only time for a scream
A fiery crash of chrome and steel
Was the beginning of the longest dream

[Chorus]
As their fates decreed that night
Their souls must be tried
Now you can hear them every Hallows Eve

Having you so familiar like past lives and nursery rhymes

So I gave away the pictures and your golden ring
And the phone calls you sent me and the silver birds that sing
Then the man he told me something that really brought me down

Blue Öyster Cult,"Cornwall and the harbor
Where witches went mad more than once and
Until this day
In dreams at least
The lighthouse at lost Christabel
Squat and hugely tilts
Upon the strand where granddad's house was built
And having stood the test of time
The starry gale the bloody tide
Grandad's house though gaped with hooks
And filled with books
Could stand no more until
A certain prophecy
Once read - now stood
Before the world fulfilled

Now of these books in granddad's keep
Some of them were new but mostly they were old
And the oldest was a scroll
A prophecy that read
When the riddle begins
The story will end

August the first 1892
And in the guise of destiny
Grandad quit Cornwall
I'm a captain of a ship
My ship is charmed, and called Plutonia.

Stories on land, storms at sea
'tween 1892 and '93
When grandad sailed for Mexico

Ships charmed and ordinary
Sailed the glidepath to the sun
And when the sun proved false
As it always does
Some of them would be lost
And some would sail back home
It was no star
But a magna of illusion
I mean by that
The mirror found
In the chamber of jade grown like a seed
Deep within the ground


The mirror found
By one man
So on and off again
He sailed the Europe's rim
On and off, off and on
Until his time had come

Through tears and smiles
The last domain
The rods of broken crystal
On and off, and off again
Until his time had come
Late to the story that had been
But early to the riddle not yet begun

August the first 1893
The charmed ship Plutonia
Sailed like a ray into Cornwall
And none too soon it seems

That night the captain's granddaughter
Would celebrate her birthday
I've come a long way, said the captain
From lost Christabel this night
Accompanied by my dog familiar
To blast your rafters with my surprise!
Granddaughter, it's a foreign mirror
Taken from the jungle by crime!

Stories on land, storms at sea
'tween 1892 and '93
When grandad sailed for Mexico

When tables collapse
And floors have filled
And the party's over, it's all over
Sea-dogs and rockers will dwell on doom
I've warped the stuff of ground
What seems to be is not
Behind closed eyes

More dark than night then
More a snare than lust",Magna of Illusion,1988

And he laid some tricks on me
He said, ""You do need help my friend""
I whispered, ""Obviously""

He laid a spread of Jacks and Queens
And he made me take my pick
But every face, it had your face
I cried out, ""I am sick""

Sick of hauling your love around
Want to run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone

Oh, it's a hard load to love you
It takes up all my time, having you
So familiar like last life's
Nursery rhyme

So I gave away the pictures
And your golden ring
And the phone calls you sent me
And the silver birds that sing

Then the man he told me something
That really brought me down
Your things were thrown away, it's true
But you were still in town

Sick of hauling your love around
Wanna run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone

Oh, it's a hard load to love you
It takes up all my time, having you
So familiar like last life's

The magician let a message
It flashes when I hide
Accept the chains of loving, accept or else
Remove yourself from her side, do without her love

And I lay back with a steel chain
I keep it by my side
I could mail a letter to you but I still
Have my pride

Sick of hauling your love around
Wanna run my train alone
But the engine tracks straight through your heart
And weighs me like a stone

Three times, I've sent you back from me
Three times, my bones gone dry
And three times, I've seen the shooting shark
Lighting up the sky

It takes my breath away

There's nothing else to say

Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew then disappeared
The curtains flew then he appeared, saying don't be afraid
Come on baby, and she had no fear
And she ran to him, then they started to fly
They looked backward and said goodbye, she had become like they are
She had taken his hand, she had become like they are
Come on baby, don't fear the reaper",Don't Fear the Reaper,1999
Blue Öyster Cult,"On the outside I'm in the high rise
Headin' for a meeting, shining up my greeting
See me in a white suit with a mirror tie

And you you-you-you
Elevate me
You throw off the shame
And you dance on stilts with me

And on the inside, I'm on my knees
Crawling an aching mile, living on the Bowery
Too sick to stand, to try to understand

But you you-you-you
Elevate me
You lift me high, just high enough to see
You you-you-you
Elevate me
You throw off the shame
And you dance on stilts with me
You throw off the shame
And you dance on stilts with me

And no one suspects a thing
They're all hiding just the same
They ache for an outbound train
And the wheels stopped turning in their brains

And you you-you-you
Elevate me
You lift me high, just high enough to see
You you-you-you
Elevate me
You throw off the shame
And you
You throw off the shame
And you dance on stilts with me

You elevate me
You elevate me
C'mon baby, dance on stilts, dance on stilts with me
You elevate me
You elevate me",Dance on Stilts,2001

Blue Pearl,"It's so hot in here, oh
I'm in over my head
Fire fills me, hot and red
Raging like a blood red sun
Fire fueled by deeds undone
Burning and I just can't wait to give a helping hand to fate
Change this crazy world around, first we gotta cool down
Take me dancing naked in the rain
Feel it washing over me, oh oh
Join me dancing naked in the rain
Cover me in ecstasy, oh

Smoke is in my eyes
Drifting from the burning cries
Of those who have no strength to stand
Against the fire in the land
Come and wash away the pain, step into the blessed rain
Cool the fire in your soul, the rain will make you whole

Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?

You, it's you and me.

Blue Period,"So you think that you are a star 
You sashay into a crowded club, everyone knows who you are 
And they all say, ""Oh, you look so fine 
Let's go into a bathroom stall and do another line."" 

Closing time, the lights come on 
You're coming down 
Those friends you just made 
They slip away 

Go on home 
Crawl into bed 
When the sun goes down 
It starts all over again 

On the list and you're through the door 
Your hand is stamped with a Hollywood kiss, yeah you've got the score 
And there's no place you'd rather be than here 
These few hours every night when it's all crystal clear 

Soon enough the dawn arrives 
You're coming down 
Click your heels through empty streets 
Walk home alone 

Close the blinds 
And sleep all day 
Wait for the night when 
It starts all over a... 

Take a pill 
It's much too real 
In the day 

Come on, do another line! 
It'll make you feel so fine 
So you do it every night 
'Cause babe, you're outta sight!

And you always remind me that my baby's gone
Evening, you got me deeply in your power
Every minute seems just like an hour, now that my baby's gone

Shadows fall upon the wall, that's the time I miss your kiss most of all
Even though I try, how can I go on

Oh evening, let me sleep till glow of dawn is breakin'
I don't care if I don't awaken, since my baby's gone

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby

I got superstitious about you, but I can't take change
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known

You better knock on wood

It's no secret, but that woman fills my loving cup

Yo, check it out, yo

Now now, all you all you dye, is this shit right here, boom
And this, you know what I'm saying? Any color you want
But it'd be like, blue and cream, you know what I'm saying?
Shit like that, niggas don't even know
But son word is bond I'mma rock niggas this summer
On the real, know what I'm saying?
Yo son, I had crazy visions

Just imagine if you buy, woo! Check it out
Just imagine you bought navy blue, right
A navy blue, a navy blue pair right, boom

Just imagine that color like
But you got it dripping like it's marble cake like...

Stand on the block, Reebok, gun cocked
Avalanche rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break 'em, watch the alley cats bake 'em
Four-nine made 'em, drop grenades and take 'em
Quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Rap Meyer Lansky crash your fantasy
Getting high fellas stand by, here's the plan, see
Sit back collecting Tecs and checks and
Blowing slow in a Montero flexing
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Blow me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killa Hill locked and caged in
We're sworn representatives, reacting like made men
Strive for wives, nine lives and lies
Max sell and enjoy the highs, what

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal, from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, moving motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments, left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken punches that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries start

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams

Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them check cashing, chain snatching, gun flashing
Niggas in the hoods bubbling good
Analyze Starks, who be buying lion heads and Clarks
To all my house bitches, Starks'll be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch me '96 in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips for seven months, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daquiris and max
Swimming pools, fly jewels, Wally shoes, blow stacks
Relax kids, black kids got a craving for Cris
Until we get back and pack, leave the Mac with your Wis'
But whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, rule this, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and aure-al
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then be out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Blow like a steroid pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

The treasure is the glaciers of ice, orginal man
Possess the power to hold G's guns and grams
Baker baker, pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd and watch me scrape her

My seeds, run with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

It's been a long time since the father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drink Cristal wine
It's been a long time of walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had the Son of Man chant like golden wine
It's been a long time",Glaciers of Ice,1995
