Eddy Duchin,"You are my lucky star
I saw you from afar 
Two lovely eyes at me they were gleaming
Beaming I was star struck 
You're all my lucky charms I'm lucky in your arms
You've opened heaven's portal here on earth for this poor mortal
You are my lucky star
 
You are my lucky star
I saw you from afar 
If Garbo is a glamorous creature 
You're a four star feature 
Though you are never seen 
Up on a movie screen
You are my Shearer, Crawford, Hepburn, Harlow and my Garbo
You are my lucky star
",You Are My Lucky Star,2002
Eddy Duchin,"Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago
Was you",Long Ago and Far Away,2003
Eddy Duchin,"Did you ever see a dream walking? 
Well, I did. 
Did you ever hear a dream talking? 
Well, I did.
 
Did you have a dream thrill you 
With ""Will you be mine?"" 
Oh, it's so grand, 
And it's too, too divine!
 
Did you ever see a dream dancing? 
Well, I did. 
Did a ever see a dream romancing? 
Well, I did!
 
Did you see heaven right in your arms, 
Saying, ""I love you, I do!""

And the dream that was talking, 
The heaven in my arms was you.",Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?,2007
Eddy Duchin,"I'll sing you a thousand love songs
And still they'll seem so few.

One voice to listen to.

And I'll sing everyone, dear, for you.",I'll Sing You a Thousand Love Songs,2007
Eddy Duchin,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2007
Eddy Duchin,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that

Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try

Eddy Duchin,"The weather is frightening
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day

The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So I can honestly say
That as far as I'm concerned
It's a lovely day and everything's OK

Isn't this a lovely day to be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going
Leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke
And oh what a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Though we're caught in a storm
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm

If the skies are grey

Long as I can be with you
It's a lovely day",Isn't This a Lovely Day?,2011
Eddy Duchin & His Orchestra,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1956
Eddy Duchin & His Orchestra,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1956

The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1991
Eddy Duchin & His Orchestra,"I used to fall in love with all
Those boys who maul refined ladies
But now I tell each young gazelle
To go to hell, I mean, hades

For since I've come to care
For such a sweet millionaire

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more

Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy

Shine on my love and me
So we can stroll beside the roll
Of the rolling sea

Moon over Miami
Shine on as we begin
A dream or two that may come true
When the tide comes in

Hark to the song of the smiling troubadours
Hark to the throbbing guitars
Hear how the waves offer thunderous applause
After each song to the stars

Eddy Duchin & His Orchestra,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

Eddy Duchin & His Orchestra,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

She doesn't care if the fun and games she play

For every bad move that this Jo'anna makes

Truths I must be sure
Tossin', turnin', nightmares burnin'
Dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships, the Viking spits
The blood of father's land
Only to deceive
Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death, fear only loss of pride
Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die
Screams of no reply
They died
Screams of no reply
And died
Died

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

With hot emotions, 
I might lose control...

And something can go wrong, 
But risky business, 
Can well be my goal...

And that's the danger of your love, 
I can just hope I'm lucky,

Eddy Louiss,"Some sunny day, baby 
When everything seems OK, baby 
You'll wake up and find that you're alone 
'Cause I'll be gone 
Gone, gone, gone, really gone, gone, gone, gone 
'Cause you done me wrong 

Everyone that you meet, baby 
As you walk down the street, baby 
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone 
Why you're on your own 
Just say I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, really gone 
'Cause you done me wrong 

If you change your ways, baby 
You might get me to stay, baby 
You better hurry up if you don't wanna be alone 
'Cause I'll be gone 
Gone, gone, gone, really gone, gone, gone, gone 
'Cause you done me wrong","Gone, Gone, Gone!",2001
Eddy Louiss,"That's the thing, ain' it? An' membuh there's.

Leavin' soon for New York. Come wid me, dat's where
We belong, sister.

Eddy Louiss,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan [Live],2008

Mami yo sé que no estás bien
Y piensas que ya te dejé de querer
Estás equivocada 
Yo lo sé que fallé 
Porque fui infiel la noche de ayer 
Siempre me arrepentiré
Y de rodillas te pido mujer

Que si alguna vez
Sentiste algo lindo por mí
Perdóname

Sentiste algo lindo por mí

Perdóname bebé

Cómo quieres que te perdone si te fuiste de mi lado
Sin dejarme ninguna explicación
No te importó si yo comía, o sufría
O se partía en dos mi corazón

Ahora me vienes a confesar que estás arepentido
Que hay mucha herida que sanar y en ti yo no confío
Yo pensé que solamente tú eras mío
Ya a ti yo te lo di todo, malagradecido

Come back to me, miss, I'm sorry
Si tú no estas conmigo, mami, I am lonely
Cuando estamos en la camita, baby, we are burning
Te lo hago toda la noche, también in the morning

Okay, tú dices que no siento amor
Ven y tócame siente cómo late el corazón
Te pido perdón por lo que pasó
Baby, tenme compasión

Y si alguna vez
Sentiste algo lindo por mí

Voy a darte una segunda oportunidad
Quiero confesarte que yo nunca dejé de amar
De mi parte deseguro no te voy a fallar
No te pagaré con la misma moneda, yo sí sé amarte

Vamos a darnos lo mucho amor, quiero vivir en la felicidad
Pero sin temor que tú nunca me vayas a dejar
Yo te amo, tú me amas y esa es toda la realidad
Vamos a prender esta llama, vamos a amarnos de verdad

Yo aprendi hacer feliz... why aun estando moribundo sonrei...

No debistes volver

Entiende que se siente tu corazon es un delicuente
Que te roba lo que sientes why te daje casi en la muerte...

Entiende que soy diferente
Why de tu trampa soy un sobreviviente...
Tu abandono me hizo mas fuerte
Para tener el valor de decirte que...

No debistes volver

Que te vayas... why que ya no vuelvas... que ya no vuelvas...

Dime cuantas veces

Por estar sentado viendo su retrato

Siento que
Desde aquel momento que te vi
Descifré
Que nunca serías para mí

Que tal vez conocerte fue mi error
O quizás el amor se equivocó

Y cada que pienso en ti
Se enciende mi corazón
Y nada es más triste que hoy
Hablar de ti

Siento que
Tú me cortas la respiración
Cada vez
Que te acercas sólo un poco a mí

Que tal vez conocerte fue mi error
O quizás el amor se equivocó

Y cada que pienso en ti
Se enciende mi corazón
Y nada es más triste que hoy

Eddy Mitchell,"My mind is clearer now
At last
All too well
I can see
Where we all
Soon will be
If you strip away
The myth
From the man
You will see
Where we all
Soon will be

Jesus
You've started to believe
The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

And all the good you've done
Will soon be swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

Nazareth's most famous son
Should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood
He'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests
Would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go too far

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour
All your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful, but now it's sour
Yes it's all gone sour
Ah ah ah ah ah
God Jesus, it's all gone sour

Listen Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
So come on, come on, listen to me
Ah ah
Come on, listen, listen to me
Come on and listen to me
Ah ah",La  Chanson de Judas,1972

Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby, I still need some company

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and needs of a woman your age really I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I heard its slams one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town

Oh Ruby, for God's sake, turn around",Ruby Tu Reviens au Pays,1974
Eddy Mitchell,"I am a lineman for the county 
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire, 
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation 
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you, 
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you, 
And I want you for all time

Mais si rapidement, que je n'ai pas trouvé le temps
De croiser des chemins qui nous apprennent ces tas de choses

Mais je connais vraiment très bien
Un homme vivant avec son chien
Au bar il commande deux whiskies
Le chien refuse, l'homme se sacrifie
Je suis parti de rien pour arriver à pas grand-chose
Faites-moi taire si je mens, mais laissez-moi le temps
De vous parler d'un bar où il se passe des tas de choses
Car un soir sur le tard, un kangourou est venu boire
Le patron avait l'air surpris
L'animal paya et sortit
On ne le revit plus car l'homme
Vendait trop cher son rhum
Je suis parti de rien pour arriver à pas grand-chose
Mais je gagne beaucoup surtout à être connu
Je suis parti de rien mais j'attends toujours une chose
Si vous voulez me joindre, soyez les bienvenus

Eddy Mitchell,"Qu'est-ce qu'on allume
Qu'on n'regard' pas ?

Pourtant elle me propose
Du sang ou de l'eau de rose
La vie sexuelle chez les fourmis
Des cartoons pour les p'tits
Et du cul mais bien après minuit
Moi qui aux films d'amour
Pleure toujours
J'suis déjà endormi
Qu'est-ce qu'on allume
Qu'on n'regard' pas ?
Qui vous assomme
Qui s'croit chez soi ?

J'essaye bien d'l'éviter,
D'baisser l'son, d'me blinder
Mais on s'parle, on s'cause, ma télé et moi
Un jour, ce sera elle ou moi
Qu'importe l'issue du combat
J'veux qu'elle implose dans mes bras
Qu'elle soit défenestrée
Et du coup, j's'rai p't'être sponsorisé
Et voire même invité
Blasé, interviewé
À 20 heures au J.T.

Eddy Mitchell,"Elle était maquillée 
Comme une star de ciné 
Accoudée au juke-box

Ses yeux couleur menthe à l'eau 
Cherchaient du regard un spot 
Le dieu projecteur

Et moi je n'en pouvais plus 
Bien sûr elle ne m'a pas vu 
Perdue dans sa mégalo

Elle marchait comme un chat 
Qui méprise sa proie 
Où frôlant le flipper 
La chanson qui couvrait 
Tous les mots qu'elle mimait 
Semblait briser son coeur

Elle en faisait un peu trop

Hollywood est dans sa tête 
Tout' seule elle répète

Son entrée dans un studio 
Le décor couleur menthe à l'eau 
Perdue dans sa mégalo 
Moi je suis de trop

Mais un type est entré 
Et le charme est tombé 
Arrêtant le flipper 
Ses yeux noirs ont lancé 
De l'agressivité 
Sur le pauvre juke-box

La fille aux yeux menthe à l'eau 
A rangé sa mégalo 
Et s'est soumise aux yeux noirs

Quand je pourrai me la payer comptant

Et les copains nous voyant passer diront médusés

Voilà que j'arrête ma vieille citron
Et j'ai bonne mine devant la belle maison

Eddy Mitchell,"Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh! The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh, my but that little country boy can play

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

His mama told him, some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight

Eddy Mitchell,"À l'école quand j'étais petit
Les grands se cachaient sous leur lit
Pour fumer en cachette une cigarette
Ils se faufilaient
Sans un bruit
À la faveur de la nuit
Certains d'entre eux fumaient dans les toilettes
Le privilège qu'ils m'accordaient
C'est moi, le petit, qui craquait
Une allumette pour leur cigarette

Fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Fume, fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Et j'entends leur voix me dire
Elle revient en souvenir
Pour devenir un homme
Fume cette cigarette

La surveillante des cours du soir
M'a entraîné dans le parloir
Je n'ai pas l'impression d'être à la fête
Elle dit qu'il faut me rattraper
Qu' j'ai besoin d cours particuliers
Qu'elle a toujours maté les fortes têtes
Elle m'a reçu dans son peignoir
M'a demandé si j' voulais boire
Et tendu un paquet de cigarettes

Fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Fume, fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Et j'entends sa voix me dire
Elles reviennent en souvenir
Pour devenir un homme
Fume cette cigarette
Mais j'ai vraiment fumé plus tard
Lorsque j'ai vu Humphrey Bogart
Pincer entre ses lèvres une cigarette
Identifié à ce héros
Je marchais en courbant le dos
Je me prenais pour un roi du racket
Je n'ai connu que des déboires
Je rentrais en toussant le soir
Sans la moindre féminine conquête

Fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Fume, fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Et j'entends des voix me dire
Elles reviennent en souvenir
Pour devenir un homme
Fume cette cigarette

Il m'arrive souvent de fumer
Des choses plus ou moins bien roulées
Qui n' ressemblent pas toujours aux cigarettes
Je n'ai rien compris et rien vu
Mais un homme je suis devenu
Accroché pour toujours aux cigarettes

Fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Fume, fume, fume, fume cette cigarette
Et j'entends des voix me dire
Elles reviennent en souvenir
Pour devenir un homme
Fume cette cigarette",Fume Cette Cigarette,2006

Nous s'rons blanchis, sauvés

Pour mieux nous oublier.

I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

Au lieu d'aller à l'école

Qu'il était différent
Il était loin loin, loin loin

De l'amour qui nous envole
Baby Doll, je suis à toi
Comme le chantaient mes idoles
Mais elle voulait petit bébé
Et la jolie maison neuve
Mais lui, son regard déjà était
De l'autre côté du fleuve
Il était loin loin, loin loin

En lisant les circulaires

Soulevant la poussière

Eddy Raven,"Now I thought it over how it's come to this
I must have lost all my common sense
I been chasin' a dream runnin' through my mind
So I called her up to say how I felt
Just before I could get it out she was gone, the silence was on
She didn't hear a word, she just hung up the phone

Operator, operator, could you be so kind
As to reconnect this number, I just spent my last dime
She's got my love on hold and my heart is on the line

Well I was always just one step ahead
Just close to keep my fingers wet
I been actin a fool and foolin' no one but myself
But now I'm ready to talk if you're willing to hear
The choice of words is my biggest fear, I'd say anything, yes I would, just

Eddy Raven,"I tore my letter up, I couldn't even start
To tell you what's really here in my heart
There's only so much that words can say
So I send you a piece of this beautiful day 

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark, the moon from the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

I took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up, sealed 'em with a kiss
It's the kind of letter that you can't resist

Living under Orion, we grew so bold
Lying on our days, we were outlaws
Our loss, but, catch me if you can, never wiped out

I guess I didn't know
And now I'm gone, but it don't hurt me anymore

The key that may unlock the chain

Embracing the ones who remain

The glorious ride shall have no end
Hold on forever more

Edenbridge,"Here where the dream of eden waits
The rivers running easy
In their valleys they are slumbering

There the mysteries reveal
By the clearness I can feel
And an island in the stream appears before my eyes

I am hunting lonesome traces in the sand
And someone speaks my name from far away

The ruins of yesterday will disappear
I will reach for the sources of light
As we are all finding our new hemisphere
I am turning just yearning to feel
Feel your dreams, don't toss them away

[Chorus]
Ancient myth arcana, Elysian seas of time
The stones of wisdom shine again, the moonlight hides the rhyme
In long gone days of yore, one thousand years before
The odyssey was in our dreams, arcana we explore

Here I can feel the inner flame
Could forget what we became
And the false mirages can't deceive, deceive me no more

I am facing countless shadows in despair
But I won't follow them into the gloomy calm aside of light

[Chorus]

Thorns of roses that I feel, secrecy under the seal
Hear the tolling of the bell, bring me under your spell

See the mysteries in twilight they're turning away
From darkness to light (into infinity)

Here where the dreams of Eden's near
Leaving to a distant sphere
To Elysian seas of time we ride
I am longing for infinity
Arcana, arcana

Tonight this journey seals my fate
Far beyond the open gate
To the secret places never seen before
For this final odyssey into

Our eyes,the night-time skies 
Are weaving a web of haze 
Golden shores are so far away from silver dreams 
Arcades cast platinum shades 
Way back to the early days 

Here 
The stardust angel spreads his wings and rides the winds of time 
Touched by the moonlight's sonant symphony 
 
Color my sky 
Forsaken am I 
From out of the shadows 
There's a light to rely 
Unbrocken wings 
The rising of kings 
To a new age we're waiting 
For the dawning of springs

Per chance, we're staying in trance 
We summon the coming age 
Listening to the tunes of whales and dolphins here 
Our seams, mistreated and squeezed 
Will turn into furious rage

She's freeing herself from clandestine eyes

I will lead you everywhere

Away from the whispers of the night

Ascending on wings of a glorious ride
She feels the falcon's pride

Look behind the charading games they played

Take those chains here away from me

Shake off the past and you will agree

Don't dream of life just live your dream
And use the power of believing

The deadend fire coming from the sky
Flamboyant signs of imminent times

By sagging spirits the hopes were pinned
To rock in the ropes of sand

denying the peril, pride goes before a fall
Picking its way to the port of call
Apparent horizons to strand

The deadend fire coming from the sky
Flamboyant signs of imminent times

In the streak of the lightning
Into st. elmo's fire

with mounting suspense, waiting for augury
Visions are blending upon the sea
Dimming and fading away

into the wind's eye to terra incognita
The clouds are releasing a shining star
Until the kiss-off the way

But on the sly we never can't be free
We face the stormy petrel
And beg for wings to fly away
Forever away

At farpoint anywhere
My visions leading me that far
Could we foresee

Inmidst our palisade

We cut the old alliance
We skipped off from our legacy
How could we

shaken to their foundations

time what is time, a remnant of hope
A line to oblivion where we're on the rope
And your sun is set, a pale silhouette on the sly

the pride of the season's turning
The providence is concerning
All of us then, the question of when in our minds

[pre-chorus]
Lightly come and lighty go
From source to sea we flow
We can never pitch our hopes too high (and be)

[chorus]
On the verge of infinity
On the edge of this heavenborn starlight
Feel the boundless serenity
In a pencil of light
Farewell to the past and the future
Into the galactic rainbow I ride
Now and forever I'll be in infinity

time what is time, a terrestrial lore
A rock in the surf we've been living for
A line in the sand, the future in hand by a dream

and when the whole world's glided
Through our hands misguided
An ordeal by fire, a dance on a wire without end

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

by far you will see, this immensity
Make leeway endeavor for more
Follow me there, this journey we share
We ride on a lavender dream

(infinity)
The rainbow of starlight will wait
(infinity)
Ride on the passage where time has no meaning at all
(on the verge of infinity)
Now and forever we're leaving the future behind
For infinity

I've been searching my way through
As the river is spreading the hue
From green to blue

Carry on the flame
Try to rule the lion's den
Storm the fortress of standstill again
And again

The powers that be
Shall try to break free
Don't ever try them to deny
They all could have wings
And then become kings
Holding the one the emerald eye

Velvet eyes of dawn I see
The miracle within
Velvet eyes of dawn in me
Outside looking in
The times are gone
While the clock ticks on and on
By the years we're holding on
For the velvet eyes of dawn

Color the pale sky
Try to find the holy grail
And the guardians of time will stand by
And praise your tale

The time to begin
The battle to win
Before the night obscures the sky
The shadows of eve
Will come to deceive
Before the well of life runs dry

One growing blossoms' smile
In moonlight for a while
Announcing one new spring
Dreaming to be king
Come joining the parade
Turn down your masquerade
Free as a bird of prey
Sail your ships off the bay",Velvet Eyes of Dawn,2007

Edgar Blanchard Band,"You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long-ago
And each has meant heaven to you
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn
And have sworn to them all you'd be true

You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune
Then you've left her to hunt a new game
Does it ever occur to you later, my boy
That she's probably doing the same?

If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue
Just imagine the girl you love best
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss
From the lips that you once fondly pressed

But the world moves apace and the loves of today
Flit away with a smile and a tear
So you can never tell who's kissing her now
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year

I wonder who's kissing her now
I wonder who's teaching her how
I wonder who's looking into her eyes
Breathing sighs, telling lies

I wonder who's buying the wine for lips

J'voulais pas partir comme un voleur
Pardonne-moi

S’il faut absolument se briser le cœur
Marqués d'un point final
S'en aller à cent milles à l'heure
Ça fait mal

Au beau milieu du ch’min
La fin
Quand les bras serrent les poings
Enterrer nos nuits blanches
De dimanche en dimanche
Rendue l'âme devant rien

J'ai jamais voulu t’faire de peine 
Comprends-moi
J'voulais pas partir comme un voleur
Pardonne-moi
J'ai jamais voulu t’faire de peine
En m’sauvant vers la prochaine
Pardonne-moi",Comprends Moi,2006
Edgar Bori,"D’abord croiser vos yeux
Comme je n’en ai plus vus – déçu 
L’amour fou
A déserté les rues – sans plus
D’abord saisir au charme
Le temps d’un sourire tendre – attendre 
Quitte à baisser les armes
Au lieu de se défendre 

Sans vous connaître
Vous désirer si fort – à tort
Une chambre à coucher
Qui menait à l’exquis – et puis
Sur un bateau complice 
De gouttes de rosée – tenter
D’éviter à tout prix
Novembre sous la pluie

Vous ma muse et poète
D’ivres nuits de juillet
Je vous aime à jamais

D’abord à vos parfums
De désordre en sentiers – aller 
Jusqu’où mènent ces pas
Qu’efface la marée – je sais
Ensuite vous inventer
À vous laisser partir – c’est dire
Pour revenir peut-être
Un jour quand vous voudrez

Vous ma muse et poète
D’ivres nuits de juillet
Je vous aime à jamais

D’avoir prêté vos yeux
Comme je n’en ai plus vus
D’avoir posé les armes
Le temps d’un sourire tendre – à prendre
D’avoir sans me connaître
Sur un bateau complice
Évité à ma vie
Novembre sous la pluie
Évité à ma vie
Novembre et parapluie",D'Abord,2006

Edgar Bori,"Histoire banale couvée de courants d’air
Pondue dans ’brume jaune de faible atmosphère
Un cœur à « triste » et l’autre à « c’est fermé » 
C’est bleu comment la Méditerranée

Histoire banale d’un tour sans horizon
Petit biscuit pauvre chien p’tite saison 
Parvis d’une vie dévaluée à l’heure
Là où les ballons tournent pas rond sur les nez (Salut Michel)

J’écume les jours à mordre la poussière
Les plumes des poules déshabillées hier
De Cendrillon à la fée Carabosse
J’essuie l’effet d’une entaille jusqu’à l’os

J’ai la mâchoire bardassée aux tourments
Ho la mémoire des sentiers de compagnes
Autant d’étoiles trop tôt tombées en panne
M’abandonnant au pied du firmament

Histoire banale d’où surgit Don Quichotte
Tout droit des poudres d’escampette à la porte
Au grand galop enfer et à cheval
Vers les dits vents de brisure en rafales

J’élève mon verre aux serrements de velours
Aux plumes des poules déshabillées d’amour
À ceux qui rêvent et rêveront encore
De s’émouchoir jusqu’au port qu’est la mort	

Imaginés sur des îles désirées
Les ciels orange et les chants enchantés 
C’est bleu pour qui la Méditerranée 
Oh ma mémoire

Histoire banale de merveilles en émail
Vous m’excuserez mais le passé c’est de la paille
J’ai le goût des braises et d’un avenir qui luit

Évidemment c’est du passé
Évidemment

Encore une histoire d’amour
Pour faire pleurer la voisine

Encore une chanson copie

Dans la foule comme ailleurs
Maintenant que je t’ai trouvée

Parle-moi de tes amours
Qui devaient durer toujours
De tes matins câlins
Parle-moi de tes secrets

Planète au ciel sans gris
Quand tu approches
Toi qui veux voir le vent des îles
Petite fille de dix-sept ans
La vie paraît pure
Quand tu t’avances 
Sans bas dans tes chaussures

Brise à mon âme heure amande
Au fond des yeux portant des cimes
Que j’attendais vertigineuse
Ailées secondes à t’écouter
De belles histoires au ventre chaud
Au sang d’aurores boréales
Et ton départ

Oh qu’il est tôt le thé du départ… 

File d’étoiles
Au corps plus que nature
Ta splendeur tient la démesure
Des pavots bleus
Petite fille 
Aux jeux d’abîmes
Prise farouche 
Tout s’éteint tant tu illumines

Croisant nos sens précieuse amante
En pleine furie à la fenêtre
Jamais je n’ai connu si frêle
Les chants de mai évanouis
Sans amertume
Couleur d’oiseaux d’autres pays 
Et ton départ

Oh qu’il est tôt le thé du départ… 

Je t’écrirai de temps à autre 
Comment j’aurais aimé pouvoir
Rose d’épines
Te dessiner dans mes accroires
Mon combat de moulin à vent
Parfums d’éclats 
Je t’écrirai 
Rose d’épines de dix-sept ans
Toi qui veux voir  Toi qui veux voir
Avant de t’assagir
Le feu des nuits sans idées noires

Pour lesquels on dit au revoir

Quelques photos 
La moitié de l’établi 
T’as gardé l’étau
Les vieux films vidéo
La vaisselle Art déco
T’as laissé un mot ancré
Quand tu m’as laissé 
Un mot où étaient écrits 
Les silences le gâchis
D’un jour où on s’est perdus
Sans un mot de plus

Sache que tu m’as tant donné 
Jamais je ne t’en voudrai
De m’avoir laissé

Tu m’as laissé des rivages 
Marqués de passion
La beauté des paysages
Les horizons
Les saisons à remonter
Mon bel amour d’été
L’hiver à traverser
Un printemps à découvrir
Que la vie n’est pas mal
T’as laissé des aubes roses
Qui font encore mal
L’aube de la première nuit
Celle de la dernière aussi
Un doux temps entre les deux
Sacrés amoureux

Sache que tu m’as tant donné 
Jamais je ne t’en voudrai
De m’avoir laissé

T’as laissé là les chandelles 
Allumées d’adieux 
Un lit pour deux 
Un mirage s’est installé
Comme le manque
T’as laissé des vers brisés
En vacances
Les jours sans fin de nos jours 
Les étreintes dans la nuit
Et tu es partie

Jamais je ne t’en voudrai

Je vis sur mon malheur
Pareil à une livre de beurre
Qui chauffe au grand soleil

J'me tiens debout sur mes pieds
J'fais deux ou trois pas puis j'm'arrête
J’suis plus capable de marcher
Je vis dans mes p'tits souliers

J’suis calme j'me laisse aller
Même quand y a pas d'vent j'pars en l'air
Je glisse je glisse tout l’temps
Je r’tombe toujours à terre

Je dors dans un frigidaire
La porte toute grande ouverte
Les grosses mouches peuvent s'approcher
De la p’tite lumière

J’suis calme j'ai tout mon temps
J’suis jamais à l'heure j’me réveille
Dans mon pot comme une fleur
Qui pas fini d’pousser

J'me suis couché sur mes bras
J'écoute mon sang couler dans mes doigts
J’suis plus capable de rêver
Je vis dans mon ventre à moi

J’suis calme j'en ai assez
J'écoute mon sang couler s’il s'arrête
C'est pas moi qui vais crier
Comme si j'étais une bête

Et j'ai pour les petits poissons
Une immense admiration
Et pour les tortues qui traversent les rues
Un amour profond",La Vie Calme,2006

Hors des murs des salons
Moments d’espoirs d’enfer
Saison de graffiti
Graffiti qui s’exposent 
S’étendent sont là
Incrustés de gronde
Graffiti d’effacés porteurs de noms
À ficher comme des cadavres
Poings fermés au combat

Signés Max Tom Pépère Zedmo ou Fitz
Suez ou Léon Cosz le vainqueur Archibald
Graffiti de l’urbain
Aux morsures peu galantes
Des faveurs de la nuit

Ont en commun bouquets d’alarme
Nés d’artistes maquilleurs de ciment ou d’imitateurs sans talent
De poussières emmêlées fixés à des idées de suicidés
Au bal des cendres ils se balancent
Pestant leurs cris d’hommes chez les rats
Ici s’applique la réplique
Au sans-gêne imposé des voitures
Sur barricages de pollution
Les graffiti chantent nos murs
Où rien ne pousse
Tant qu’est sauf le compte en banque de l’homme méga gonflé de légale protection à mort
Des droits d’achever la vie

Signés Max Tom Pépère Zedmo ou Fitz
Suez ou Léon Cosz le perdant oncle Archibald
Graffiti de l’urbain
D’une espèce qu’on vulgaire
À l’espace limité
D’une rapetissante matière grise

Besoin d’oser au risque pris
Masquant l’horreur de leurs signatures amères
Face au M jaune publicitaire
D’un hamburger dans une vitrine
En mal d’amour face au mépris
Soufflant du large sur les panneaux payants
Qu’est-ce qu’ils ont de sale
Si ce n’est de s’afficher d’une autre viande
Crachant sur celle que compte l’argent

Graffiti de piquant
Témoins de gare à nous
Marchandant les pieds dans la boue
En ont bavé pour nous faire à l’idée
D’un Johnny Hallyday
Avant d’écrire des bombes
Ils embarbouillent le monde

Des flancs de hangars d’usine
Aux couloirs des métros
Par les ruelles sous les viaducs
Sur les poubelles des entrepôts
De Bangkok graffiti
À Genève comme à Rome
Atteignant les façades d’Istanbul
De New York au Chili
En passant par Vérone

Porteurs du dieu malaise
Agresseurs d’agresseurs
Rarement dans la nature
Si peu pour le profit
Comme de simples voleurs
Les graffiti s’attaquent
Au chant du signe des possédeurs
À coups de barres abattre
Les murailles grises de nos penseurs

Edgar Bori,"Les lundis dans la vie
Ça remonte à petit
L’école ou le travail
Rassemblent le bétail

Un cadran qui nous fouette
Un quelconque déjeuner
Moulée dans son assiette
S’enfarger du bon pied

Retrouver la routine
En roulant dans l’trafic
La tête dans l’cellulaire
Préparer son cancer

Les lundis précipices
À l’envie de rien faire
À filer loin d’Alice
Ça nourrit le caractère

À l’abri des sans rien
Tout en tassant ses croûtes
Face au vide le ventre plein
Quand on s’plaint d’ceux qui ont toutt

Ces complets les cravates
Formatés du world beat
Chers vendeurs de savates
M’a t’en chier du Wall Street

Les lundis dans la vie
Gaspillés loin de la mer
Endurcis sourds de bruits
Fragiles aux tonnes de verre

Nous penseurs de ti-culs
Rois des tuques à pompon
Convaincus qu’on fait dur
À l’haleine des moutons

Les lundis quand on dit
T’as du pain sur la planche
Fonce en béni-oui-oui
Crève ou ben r’lève les manches

Les coups durs s’accumulent
Au jardin d’Ensorcèle
Chargé de sa quête de mule
Le bon ch’val tire pareil

En façades en mimiques
Ben attelé pour l’hiver
En avant la musique
Après une brique une brique

Les lundis c’est fini
J’ai mis l’temps à comprendre
Près d’Amélie Poulin
Y’a pus de lundi matin

Ton sourire m’envahit

Entre deux reines publicités
Qui se pavanent d'à qui la chance
Ce sont des enfants dans les rues
Bâillonnés à la baïonnette
Qui n'ont d'amour que la vengeance
Enrayés à la mitraillette
On ne laisse pas mourir les bêtes
Comme les humains de la planète

Ce sont des yeux sur le ciel bleu
Qui vibrent encore aux cerfs-volants
Apprivoisés pris de poussière
Brûlés de peau sans autre enfer
 
Ce sont des rires affamés
Qui hantent en chœur les nuits d'été
Ce sont sur un petit navire
Les perdants de la courte paille
Dont on dit qu'ils n'ont rien à dire
Numérotés simple détail
Ce sont des êtres éliminés
Par la guerre à la pauvreté

Entre confort et satiété
Peu d'entre nous relèvent les manches
Ce sont nos choix dépaysés
Chacun sa vie chacun sa chance
Qu'il est facile d'abandonner
De se lasser de la souffrance
On ne laisse pas mourir les bêtes

Le temps qui passe est notre abri
Le fond de l'histoire c'est l'ennui

Vois-tu là-bas ces héros pathétiques
La nuit de nuit dans la rue des chagrins
On est des chevaux sans musique
Perdus à suivre le chemin

On court dans une ère sans mystères
On donne la patte comme on est fiers
Une job un char achale-moi pus
Le fond de l'histoire s'est pendu

On s'enchante d'avoir internet
Nourrissant les puces qu'on achète
Au jeu du chat et d'la souris
Qui c'est qui va payer l'prix

Vois-tu là-bas ces chevaux sans musique
De nuit la nuit à la rue et chagrins
On est des héros pathétiques
Perdus en suivant leur chemin

Tourne la lumière
Allume le réverbère
Tourne le manège

Tourne la planète

Edgar Bori,"Deux amours deux images
Deux je t’aimerai toujours
Deux routes à suivre deux chemins soudains
Qui mènent au bout près du soleil dans l’herbe

Deux amants de maquillages
Deux paires d’yeux dits fabuleux
Deux désirs-fièvres aux mains de mirages
Qui s'ensorcèlent et fondent comme la neige

Deux amis deux rois d’âme
Deux sourires apprivoisés
Deux puissances aux combats effacés
Forts en silences qui se déjouent des pièges

Tant qu’il y a encore le temps qui reste
Est-ce que ça fait mal

Deux humains deux voyages
Deux fois un petit navire
Deux seules dérives au matin frileux
D'un vent du large échoué sur la plage

Deux passés de passages
Deux sentiers qui vont tarir
Deux traces franches assises à voir venir
De ces enfants redessiner la place

Tant qu’il y a encore le temps qui reste

Edgar Bori,"Les États swinguent tout en entier
Tant'y a des noirs qui balayent les planchers
L’ami requin se r’garde grossir
Perd sa force dans son sourire

Si les sous étaient à la base de tout
Les barbouillés seraient vus comme des voyous
Que ceux qui sèment se flattent la bédaine
Les noirs ne récolteront que les cennes

Les vacances sur la mer c’est pour les blancs seulement
On voit pas d’noir sur la plage souvent
Le noir travaille tout le temps
Les vacances au mois d'août
C’est pas pour les noirs à bout
On voit pas d’noir sur la plage souvent
Le noir se tanne du blanc

Ils se sont tous bâtis sur les trottoirs
Au fond de taudis dont on dit du mal à voir
L'esclavage au dernier cri
D’un travail au noir interdit

Si un jour ces chers devenaient milliardaires
Ils pourraient vouloir nous faire des misères
Mais pour nous faire des misères noires
Il faudrait qu'ils deviennent milliardaires

Les vacances sur la mer c’est pour les blancs seulement
On voit pas de noir sur la plage souvent
Le noir travaille tout le temps
Les vacances au mois d’août
C’est pas pour les noirs du bout
Peu d’noirs sur les plages à Malibu
Le noir se vit sans le sou

Les États brillent d’un songe ensoleillé
Des millions d’noirs se promènent à pied

À se coller la peau
Comme en transpire toute l'affaire
Je raconte ce qu'il faut
La petite était un ange
Son beau-père un costaud
Qu'est-ce qu'elle a perdu au change
Obéissant au chameau

Deux allusions trois menaces
De ce voleur en crise
Sans amour elle cède la place
Et la voilà mal prise
Moins d'une minute a suffi
Pensez éternité
Pour que le buteur crucifie
Sa proie sur le plancher

Oh hisser haut Oh hisser haut
Hisser haut

Souffle court et yeux hagards
En bavant ferme ta gueule

Avant de la laisser toute seule

Remontant son pantalon
La douce brise horizon
Portait le mot brisé

Oh hisser haut Oh hisser haut
Oh hisser haut Oh hisser haut
Hisser haut

Combien d'autres n’osent plus dire je t'aime
Près d'un mur enterrées
À des milliers d'heures d'elles-mêmes
Ce silence à tomber

Dans la fosse des blessures lentes
À se cicatriser

Coupable reste gravé
Si elle se pendait ce soir
La belle d'un tour d'y voir
Si elle se jetait d'un coup
Est-ce que ce serait à mon cou...

I hate you patron toi tu regardes les demoiselles
Patron tu fais la vie dure

I hate you patron des fois quand je fais tes poubelles
I hate you patron je trouve les oui des demoiselles
Patron jamais je ne verrai l'Espagne
Asservi à tes soirées au champagne

I hate you patron la nuit je rêve de cyanure
I hate you patron le jour je barbouille ton figure
Patron j'en ai plein le dos de tes conseils
Malheureusement c'est toi qui signe mon chèque de paie
 
Je manque d'été aux flancs de mon pays
De parler au soleil de goûter aux cocos
Retrouver la famille du tant doux des amis

Tendres les mots de ma bouche
Loin des miens qui se couchent
Sans regret

Je m'en vais parce qu'il faut
Rallumer ces étoiles éteintes
À trop se mouiller aux contraintes
Jeter l'encre du rafiot

Je m'en vais des villes
Échapper à ces solitudes
Mur à mur de visages rudes
Aux chants des coquelicots

Je me rends au calme
Aux chevaux blancs de la Camargue
Écrire au son du creux des vagues
Sous le vent des marais

Je m'en vais
Panser des chutes à la conquête
Loin des feux de paillettes
Pleins d’attraits

Je m'en vais près d'elle
Qui m'a invité à sa table
Je sais les châteaux sont de sable
Sans attendre je m'en vais

Je m'en vais au chaud
De la fenêtre de sa chambre
Toucher les levers de lune ambre
Changer d'heure et de peau

Vivre en beauté les choses
Rimer avec la prose
À l'ombre du silence
M'accrocher à la chance

Que je l'aime pour la peine
Qu'il fait bon d'être là

Danser dans ses bras",Je M'En Vais,2007
Edgar Bori,"T'as lu St-Exupéry, allumé les réverbères
Cru les journaux tout cru ce qu'on y écrit
Dix mois tu t'es battue pour ton emploi perdu
Bourrée, tu bois d'atrocités tes nouvelles

Les chats écrasés, le sida, les présidents sales
Hier au large un pétrolier a coulé, ils vont ramasser, crois-les
Leurs droits financiers, les partis de Monopoly
Les promesses en bidon, la star d'un soir au raz du bonbon

Mais c'est peut-être autre chose qu'un mot usé la liberté
Autre chose la liberté
Mais c'est peut-être autre chose la liberté
La liberté

T'as mordu aux chauds modèles dans les magazines
Te maquilles belle ne veut pas travailler en usine
Tu veux faire actrice du rouge aux lèvres de gamine
Ce que tu n'as pas te chagrine

Les voitures de sports, les beaux mecs en bijoux, parfum
Les grands hôtels, le luxe des massages, servie à ton goût
Différente comme tout le monde
Différente comme tout le monde
Le look dernier cri 
Avoir vingt ans, cent ans, sans jamais prendre un seul cheveu gris

Mais c'est peut-être autre chose qu'un mot la liberté
Autre chose la liberté
Mais c'est peut-être autre chose la liberté
Pense à Rose Laliberté

Tu n'as plus d'espoir la fête a montré ses limites
Tu fuis les miroirs d'un visage que personne n'invite
Tu ne sais plus si tu es d'esprit sain ou fou
T'as mal compris d'où t'es partie pour aller où

Les premiers pas pour apprendre à partager, oubliés
Les premiers bras les premiers baisers
Les yeux dans les yeux de fragile animée
Aussitôt au monde aussitôt oubliée
  
Mais si c'est autre chose qu'un mot usé la liberté
À l'aventure de s'y attacher
Et si c'est rien d'autre qu'un mot la liberté

L’aphasie, l’autopsie
Chassons le vide immense
L’ambre et la brise 
Nous éternisent

Autrement on se ment
Et l’aventure risque des airs de glace
Entre nous, chien et loup
Inséparables amants fous",Amants Fous,2012
Edgar Bori,"Je te parle d’avril  
Tu me parles chinois
J’en ai connu des filles
Jamais des comme toi

Insolent nid d’amour qui traîne
À l’orée de nos voies
Hors des chantiers de béton blême
Au sommet toi et moi

Tes pieds avaient du style
Moi, je chantais tout bas 
Ton regard sur la ville
Le mien sur le chat

Nos matins ne sont plus les mêmes
Mais restent encore nos pas
Tu verras le printemps s’amène
De rose et de lilas

Rien n’était écrit, tout se racontera
Et la chance, quand j’y pense
Elle est bien la nuit
Le train attendra
Je sais que tu es là

Tu t’enivres d’exil
Moi, c’est le mimosa
Aux années difficiles
S’ajoute l’éclat
De tes câlins coulent des chaînes
Que rien ne ternira
C’est le propre de la vie même
De perdre quelques combats

Rien n’était écrit, tout se racontera
Quand j’y pense et j’y pense
Elle est bien la nuit
En parfums d’émoi
Merci au hasard 
Merci à toi
Et le chagrin s’en va
Et le train attendra",Avril Et Chinois,2012
Edgar Bori,"Avant de jeter l’ancre
Loin des feux de Bengale
C’est toi que j’appelle
Que j’appelle

Épris de vague à l’âme
Lourd d’envie de ne plus avancer
Ho! C’est toi que j’appellerai

Avant l’orage
Avant la fin des rafales filantes
Je t’appelle
Promis, je t’appelle

Devant le rideau d’ombres
Envahi de peines sans appui
Ho! C’est toi que j’appelle avant de m’en aller

Le jour où je n’ai plus d’autres pays ailleurs
Que les murs de ma chambre
Je t’appelle

La Joconde sourira d’un ciel fameux
C’est toi que j’appelle
Promis, je t’appelle
Promis, je t’appelle",C'est Toi Que J'appelle,2012

Edgar Bori,"J’ai marché sur la plage et bon sens sous les nuages
J’ai croisé dans tes yeux un penchant pour être heureux
J’ai dormi dans tes bras, un jour on se reverra
T’as ouvert un pré vert, je n’ai plus peur de l’hiver

J’ai marché en novembre au beau milieu de ta chambre
T’ai donné mon amour comme il y en a tous les jours
Le soleil a triché, j’attendrai à poings liés
T’as porté sur la route un enfant sans aucun doute

J’ai laissé à l’étage les amis et les nuages
Suis tombé dans un creux, un fond noir et ses adieux
Ai crié sur les toits on ne m’y reprendra pas
T’as ouvert un pré vert, je m’en sors mais à l’envers

J’ai gardé de décembre les décombres avec les cendres
Échangé mon amour pour un collier de détours
Le soleil s’est caché, j’attendrai le mois de mai
Retrouver les falaises à hauteur des soirs de braise  

J’ai cueilli avec toi les méandres et les ébats
Oublié mes ennuis les carences et le tout cuit
Ai crié sur les toits j’ai aimé vivre avec toi
T’as ouvert un pré vert, je n’ai plus peur de l’hiver

J’ai marché sur la plage et bon sens sous les nuages

Comme les feuilles s’éparpillent
Après les noirs revers
La jetée des béquilles

Le nez au vent du large
L’horizon des frontières
La pensée dans la marge
Et les rêves de travers

Devant ces marées basses
Sous les couleurs d’automne
Où les amis s’effacent
Dans le fossé des hommes

Au son des coqs truands
À l’ombre des palaces
Au réveil des jours gris
À l’aube d’une petite place

On repart
Dans ce manège de dingues qui nous nourrit
On replie
Les souvenirs bleus dans nos chemises de nuit
On s’évade
Pour mieux retrouver son phare sous la pluie
On apprend
Qu’on apprend peu au tourbillon de la vie

Et on s’égare
Sur des sentiers cernés de paradis
On s’allie
À ces beaux idéaux chargés d’ennui
On s’arrange 
Du merveilleux de cette chance qui nous lie
On apprend
Qu’on apprend peu au tourbillon de la vie

Au fil des nénuphars
Au son des voix ferrées
Au plancher du placard
Au cœur des déportés

Encore une journée
Sans être incinéré
Encore le grand défi
De préparer sa sortie

Coulent les muses à coups de ciseaux secs
S’offrent les rires, les doux délires
Les hauts les bas ne se monnayent pas

Aux idées folles d’autrefois
Une chanson vert guacamole
Pour finir mes jours dans tes bras

I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place

But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me

We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face

Edgar Fletcher,"I was broke, pocket full of lint now I'm on the bricks
Getting paid like no other dog now I'm stackin' chips
On the road like a trucker man had to take some trips
Doing shows for my brothers but strapped with extra clicks

Just in case any sucker would wanna run his lips
A female I don't trust her 'cause women like to trip
I stay all by my getty green hell with some time
There some crime that was petty seem still getting mine

All this hate trip I'm hearing, though you I ain't fearing
Better try to be growing old man with your children
Escalate what a nigga staring his last days nearing
Trying to get it right with God only one who I'm fearing

Hopin' I'ma make it, keep it real
Never knew I get the chances for a nigga to get paid
So I take it living like a player should
Wishin' that you could knowin' it's all to the good
Still down with the hood

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Last year my cousin took a fall, a sad song
Seem like we were just on the phone now he gone
People use to try to judge him sayin' he was wrong
But you can't try to judge a man you do you wrong

Smokin' out on a daily base I'm in the clouds
Drinkin' liqour fallin' on my face
Wondering how I survive all this foolishness
Up in the street ridin' dirty I ain't new to this
I'm packin' heat but the streets very hazardous
To a niggaz health watch your step you ain't Lazarus

You'll meet your death
I'm the man from the North, North site of the town
With the will to support me and keep 'em found
Stayin' down got your gold grills dro in the air
Barbecue on the grill sun cool for a player
When I ride through the streets hoes are plentiful
'Cause the life that we live so beautiful

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Gotta take the good with the bad
Smile with the sad, love what you got
And remember what you had messin' with the ones
Who help me in the times
When I was flat broke didn't even have a dime

My family they was there, my niggaz they was there
The rest of ya'll left me for dead didn't care
I use to have dreams livin' large in this thang
And by the grace of God I'm still alive in this thang

I strive in this game to get all that I can
Never said I'm the man, respect me as a man
To you ones think I owe you somethin'
Now that's a joke, think you bad come

And get you somethin', how low to dope
Either treal either fake, you can love you can hate
Either go and get your own or you can't sit and wait
On the next man to come up you can peep this
You can do what I do handle your business

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful

Oh, so beautiful

Herzen deiner menschen hearts of your people
Und entzuende in jedem das and light in everyone the
Feuer deines ewigen lebens fire of your eternal life

Edgar Froese,"Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my sense reeled
A fatal attraction holding me fast, how
Can I escape this irresistible grasp?
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied & twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to guide my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied & twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Gould blow this soul right through the roof of the night

Suspended animation, a state of bliss

Edgar Lustgarten,"By strange coincidence, a thunderstorm had been brewing, 
When Mahon doing his grisly work at the bungalow, 
Was dealing with the most grisly job of all,
The head, the woman's head. 

He had severed it from the trunk, 
Built a huge fire in the sitting room, placed her head upon it, 
Then, then the storm broke 
With a violent flash of lightning and an appalling crash of thunder. 

As the head of Emily Kaye lay upon the coals, 
The dead eyes opened, and Mahon fled out to the deserted shore.
When he nerved himself to return, 
The fire had done its work.

Down the hill out in back
Late every afternoon, I go there and sit
And all of the neighbors, they see a nice old man

And the girl there across the street
She sits there on her front porch swing
She never realized
But I told her with my eyes
Back in the Second War, I killed 20 German boys
With my own bare hands

She just keeps talking
She never says a thing
She just keeps on talking

Edgar Meyer,"Claire had all but given up,
When she and Edwin fell in love.
She touched his face and shook her head,
In disbelief, she sighed and said:
""In many dreams I've held you near,
""Now, at last, you're really here.

""Where've you been?""
""I've looked for you forever and a day.""
""Where've you been?""
""I'm just not myself when you're away."" 

He asked her for her hand for life, 
And she became a salesman's wife.
He was home each night by eight,
But one stormy evening, he was late.

Until his key turned in the door. 

""Where've you been? ""
""I've looked for you forever and a day.""
""Where've you been?""
""I'm just not myself when you're away.""

For sixty years, she heard him snore.
Now they're in a hospital,
In separate beds on different floors.

Claire soon lost her memory,
Forgot the names of family. 
She never spoke a word again,
Then one day, they wheeled him in. 
He held her hand and stroked her hair,
In a fragile voice she said:

""Where've you been? ""
""I've looked for you forever and a day.""

Edgar Meyer,"Oh  the snowflakes fell in silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Belleau Wood,1997

I never invited them in 
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired 
They are illusions 

They're not the solutions they promised to be

We are together 
I shall want no-one else

Half a moment 
I shall treasure,

With just this moment 
In my mind 
I shall capture it anew, 
Like some picture 
Taken in my childhood

Spent with you.

On fleeting lovers 
They can turn the briefest hour 
Into a day 
Turn a moment

Making it to last 
Blending future with the past.

What to do, how to move him
I've been changed, yes really changed
In these past few days, when I've seen myself

I seem like someone else

I don't see why he moves me
He's a man. He's just a man

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love

He scares me so
I never thought I'd come to this

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened

Edgar Villarroel,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

And we go on

So we look to the miracle of love
So we look to the miracle of love

Panic screams for order
But no one hears the cry
Film is on the water
Hate is in the sky

Organized confusion
Is working out it's plan
Though we try to stop it
It spreads throughout the land

And we who understand it all
Do nothing more than say
That there is no other way
And we go on

Will we look to the miracle of love?
Still we look to the miracle of love

Will we look to the miracle of love?
Still we look to the miracle of love

Will we look to the Miracle of Love?
Still we look to the miracle of Love.

Will we look to the miracle of love?

That it had to be

To understand
Showed me what it was
To be your man

And lord knows if I hurt you
I hope you understood
That I was just trying to do
What I thought was good

Edgar Winter,"A long, long time ago I had a dream
Somehow things work out much different than they seem
All the things that I tried to find, givin' me no peace of mind
So now I leave it all as memories behind

My time come at last
My day is coming fast
My love is gonna last
When it comes, I feel a whole lot better

No love within your mind if nothing is said
No love within your heart if you don't really care
There's something deep inside
That you can never hide
And though you shine you'll find it can't be denied

Your time will come at last
Your day is coming fast
Your love is gonna last
When it comes, you'll feel a whole lot better

Just let yourself run free
Be what you wanna be
And when we finally meet
I know you're gonna see

Our time will come at last
Our day is coming fast
Our love is gonna last
And when it comes, we?ll feel a whole lot better

Abe said, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on"" 
God said, ""No""--Abe say, ""What?"" 
God say, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but 
The next time you see me comin', you better run""

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose

He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?"" 
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know"" 
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run"" 
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun 
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61"" 

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King 
""I got 40 red-white-and-blue shoestrings 
And a thousand telephones that don't ring 
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"" 
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a moment, son"" 
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done 
Just take everything down to Highway 61"" 

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night 
Told the first father that things weren't right 
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white"" 
He said, ""Come here and step into the light"" 
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done"" 
But the second mother was with the seventh son 
And they were both out on Highway 61 

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored 
Trying to create a next world war 
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor

Crawling in the night.

Anger and hate. 
fear and despair fills up his mind. 
In search for answers he can't find. 
What god would end a life so pure.

Her destiny is in my hands.

Is this the answer to where the secret lies. 
And in her eyes I see a light is shining through. 
I feel that there is hope for a world so brave and new. 
Many seasons have changed and the king is old and weak.

In this vault of souls to reap.

The darkest night the enchanted skies were united in a storm. 
Unholiness and all that's unblessed appeared in another form.

The time has come for the king to die. (Lead Guitar: Mike) 
A whole world is mourning the loss of their king. 
In sorrow a new day dawning.

And with death came disorder, who were they now to obey? 
No leader, no followers. 
No trust, no faith.

In search for such a man of trust there will be contradicti-

Coming forth on desert ground, the incarnation of a king in 
sleep profound. 
Another self-proclaimed king, set to rule in the new empire. 
On a mission to save the forsaken ones and to re-light the 
dying fire. 
The crowd was confused and divided in two, a battle was about 
to begin. 
Another man with a will as strong declared a war to win. 
His army of believers was faithful, mighty and brave. 
Set to capture the liar, to forever enslave. 
His troops were marching on to the battlefield to set this

press the rebellian lie. 
He is the one, the self-chosen son, master of the throne he 
rules upon. 
The sacred child awakened from her crystal sleep. 
And the earth was shaking, and the people prayed for their 
souls to keep. 
The light of day is flowing into her virgin eyes. 
Oh, the sun is stolen. 
A dark formation in the skies. 
Unites the powers in her eyes. 
Her soul's inhaling all the living light. 
Bringing on the dark, eternal night. 
Gathering evil in all its might. 
Seven years. 
Purity. 
Innocence. 
Dignity. 
Hail, hail the queen! 
Ruling supreme. 
She is queen alone in the human zone, dethroned the king unpure. 
The masses were assured, she fought without a sword. 
She regained their hope and faith. 
Draining the liar in the crimson water. 
To bring him eternal pain. 
His soul is slaughtered. 
Eternalizing bane. 
Scream in silence, no one shall hear his cries encaged. 
The unroyal king, surrended to the child of life divine. 
A hundred fortnights passed but still no signs of aging. 
Her endless youth... amazed, the world was raging. 
A shattered race in this broken land this child came to resto- 
re, like an order from the gods. 
The queen and all the children gathered around the chambers 
where the elder ones are joined 
in sleep profound. 
In wrath she crush the tanks of crystal glass. 
The crimson water gushed on to the ground in the unholy mace- 
cration. 
Their souls no longer cried. 
Die! 
Their gift are denied. 

[She drinks the life-blood from the feebled man. 
Empty bodies, soul-drained by the vrigin queen. 
Finally given the pleasure to die. 
She aligns the hate inside their hearts. 
Her chosen knights will make sure all life departs.

She heard her master call.] 
""Live my words, oh, sacred child. You're soon to leave this 
world defiled."" 
""Then what awaits me my lord?"" 
""Trust me my child, your wishes shall not be ignored"" 
And then he spoke his mind, now his will is hers. 
""The earth shall fall. The eternal curse is cast on the sands 
they walk. 
Now you must use your power. Show the human race you are the 
one. 
Use their trust forever and then deceive their weakened minds. 
Fool them to destroy themselves in hopelessness. 
Belie their seeds, belie their dreams. Hope has ceased to be."" 
The people worshiped their queen. 
Such beauty before her time was unseen. 
Their were fooled by her presence and disguise. 
Faithfully they listened and swallowed all her lies. 
""The times are changing, re-arranging he pattern of our lives. 
So let your heart stop beating beneath this twisted sky."" 
They were embraced by sadness, but not afraid to die. 
""So pass this sacred dagger and let yourself fly free. 
So pretend you're dreaming and rise above this world of you 
and me."" 

[Liar! 
All those who died with you by their side were denied access 
to the higher ground. 
Betrayal. 
Eternal detest from the ones left unblessed, so possessed. 
Their last caress was your knife in their hearts. 
Fed from her deed, watching them bleed. 
In her own conceit, a world to delete, lies at her feet. 
Her demon inside do no longer hide. 
Showing its face of hate and disgrace leaving their saviour 
unpraised.] 

The ones who didn't follow. 
Now sharing this moment of grief. 
The end of their own existence? 
In death they had no belief. 
Despite all the faith in their queen they couldn't believe 
what they had seen. 
What was the reason for this sacrifice. 
Nothing is gained from this great demise. 
After the ordeal we know she has the powers to decieve us all. 
But their dream of sons and daughters has made them standing 
tall. 
For the king had showed them it could be done when his woman 
gave birth to the sacred one. 
But is she of man, made of flesh and blood, or is she the 
offspring of the unholy 

[God?] 
A leader was chosen to unveil the hidden truth. 
The brave ones were gathered, the strongest were sent to the 
queen. 
Her reason to be must be known. 
After many moons the troopsreach the temple of their majesty. 
Guarded by a hundred faithful knights. 
There is no escape, there's no entry to her sacred halls. 
Is our vision true or false? 
They rtied to find the answer but they were led astray into a 
maze of slumper far from the light of day. 
The riddle remained unanswered. 
The queen could read ones mind, make sure that no one will find 
the reason for her mission here. 
The highness writhe in anger, her trust had been betrayed. 
The queen was filled with langour, her decision has been made. 
She would unleash her hate. 
Destined to devastate. 
She heard her demons roar, marching into war. 
The spirit of their beloved king ho spoke unto his men, he 
came to bring a message 
of great importance and trust. 
""The gift from the gods has come to cover the world in dust. 
Her forces are closing in to your sanctuary. 
So use your imagination to end her reign. 
Remember these words, and be strong!"" 
The chosen few were sacrificed for the others life. 
They were the bait, they would seal the soldiers fate. 
A massive grave, to break the soldiers spell. 
The forces fell into the abyss, never to rise again. 
Towards the queen the last of the brave ones wandered, 
to terminate this creature non-divine. 
The loss of troops forced her powers to release the magic 
uncontrolled that had wasted a thousand soul. 
The palace controlled by demons is the heart of all evil pos- 
sessed by the queen and her unholy servants. 
""If we destroy it, the earth will be ours and it will bring us 
eternal existance. 
We'll pray for the gift of breeding. This is a game we can't 
concede, 
it is worth all the blood we may bleed. We must close the gate 
so she can't return. We'll seal her fate, watch her temple 
burn and 
we'll capture her soul in the chambers of crimson sleep. 
And there she will suffer eternally for what she has done to 
man. 
We fought our way into her dwelling-place, we searched the 
corridors 
of this infernal maze, to seek our enemy the one to slay. 
We are the ones, we will not obey. 
A disillusioned servant with great knowledge in her secrets, 
we found him walking aimlessly trying to find his peace. 
He said: 
'Cover her eyes, they are the root of her inhuman forces. 
Then she's just the child you thought she, 
disconnect all her sources.'"" 
They found a way to blind her and it could cost some lives. 
But they must seal the entry from where all evil derives. 
Two of the brave ones were sent to distract her while the 
others made their way 
to behind her throne. 
She saw her enemies for the last time 
as their leader covered her eyes. 
We saw the return of innocence, the symbol of purity we once 
knew. 
We carried her to the chambers to forever lock-up her soul. 
And now the reborn earth, blessed with the gift of birth can 
see her in this cage 
that eternally preserves her rage. 
They captured all her soldiers and forever encaged their 
cries. 
They had found a new leader to worship.

Unify all evil. Deep inside, the unknown quest, the sphere is so depressaid, 
a harp with broken strings, and the ground, this mazy world do still exist, 
then ghouls arise fromthe mist.

From the tenebrous depths of history, who will divulge the mystery.

When I thought that my mind was free

Speak prayers our god don't want to hear. But listen:
Wherever you are, I will get you! Well, you don't know who
I am? I am the inquisition and I am your heretics

Bright eyes and blissful but they thought
That she went astray
Too late to escape, she seemed to be insane
She got imprisoned because she got her own way

What have you done?

Believe me, I'm innocent. I've done no wrong!

But you are strange! You are guilty I guess!
And after the torture you will confess and burn!

Ending in the flames, burning down her fame
Prayers to the saints, their end of an evil game

Run to your last refuge
Maybe the silence of your voice
Lie but be true to yourself
Sometimes you've got no choice
Follow a king called silence
Live in his kingdom of disguise
There is a temple of shelter
Where God forgives you your lies.

And then look to the past
Tell me who you are
And then tell me what's gonna last

And as you take off your disguise
As you dare to open your eyes

To behold the panacea
Embracing your life
Oh, and then you realize

You gotta reach out
To find it all inside of you
As the spotlight fades away
You gotta reach out

Where they say you belong
If they say don't you break the rules
You just got abandon them and then go on

And there won't be anything missin'
There won't be no grief or regret
Oh, let the child inside break free
I'll find the time to be stiff when I'm dead

Don't wanna be trapped in a disguise
I want it all and I wanna rise

And I dive in the panacea
Embracing my life
Open my eyes

Contando cada sombra no seu sonho atormentado acorrentado sei lá, drogado se pá
Enfraquecido, injustiçado, se afogando no mar eu to lá, lado a lado com a fé no coração
Nem que pra isso eu amanheça dormindo no chão, meu irmão!

A polícia é racista, mais do que ninguém a favela entre o céu, e o inferno, jerusalém
Lamenta, aguenta, enfrenta a batalha violenta, é a vida, no fio da navalha
A falha mundial, espiritual e um fuzil

Qual o valor verdadeiro pra se encontrar a paz
Será que é fugir será que é se esconder ou será ,que é lutar, trabalhar, e depois morrer
Pode crer, veja você, vários limites na disposição, situação e no apetite
Acredite que você pode chegar no fim do arco-íris e um pote de ouro encontrar

Everything, and he had been everywhere
Til he turned his gaze her way, longed to see it every day
Heard a voice inside him say you'll never never never be the same

Once in a blue moon

They got fire and they got fever
He was more than fine; she was more than young
And the orange setting sun was beautiful
Ever so at ease, in the summer evening breeze
They would talk and they would tease
And never never never want to leave

And you thought that you chased her

Waiting on the cool quiet night

Edie Carey,"Just when I had lost my sense of humor
My heart was just a tangle of barbed wire
You could get to me but I'd get to you sooner
I quit before I'm fired

Tried every trick to stop you in your tracks
Shot off my gun to run you off my land
You just stood there trying not to laugh
And held up your hands

That's when I knew your aim was steady
That's when I knew, but you knew it already

That I need you, just a little, just a little
I need you all right

I was taking pride in being lonely
I was busy making friends with myself
There's nobody else who really knows me half as well

I know how to rock me like a baby
And know how to sing myself to sleep
But I'm starting to think maybe, just maybe
Surrender can be sweet

That's what you do, you make it so easy
That's what you do, you got me believing

That I need you, just a little, just a little
I need you all right
I need you just a little, just enough

Edin Karamazov,"Can she excuse my wrongs with virtue's cloak?
Shall I call her good when she proves unkind?
Are those clear fires which vanish into smoke?
Must I praise the leaves where no fruit I find?

No, no, where shadows do for bodies stand
Thou may'st be abused if thy sight be dimmed
Cold love is like to words written on sand
Or to bubbles which on the water swim

Wilt thou be thus abused still
Seeing that she will right thee never?
If thou cans't not overcome her will
Thy love will be thus fruitless ever

Was I so base, that I might not aspire
Unto those high joys which she holds from me?
As they are high, so high is my desire
If she this deny, what can granted be?

If she will yield to that which reason is
It is reason's will that love should be just
Dear, make me happy still by granting this
Or cut off delays if that I die must

Better a thousand times to die
Than for to live thus still tormented
Dear, but remember it was I
Who for thy sake did die contented

Better a thousand times to die
Than for to live thus still tormented
Dear, but remember it was I
Who for thy sake did die contented

Edin Karamazov,"Come again! sweet love doth now invite 
Thy graces that refrain 
To do me due delight, 
To see, to hear, to touch, to kiss, to die, 
With thee again in sweetest sympathy. 

Come again! that I may cease to mourn 
Through thy unkind disdain; 
For now left and forlorn 
I sit, I sigh, I weep, I faint, I die 
In deadly pain and endless misery. 

All the day the sun that lends me shine 
By frowns doth cause me pine 
And feeds me with delay; 
Her smiles, my springs that makes my joy to grow, 
Her frowns the winter of my woe. 

All the night my sleeps are full of dreams, 
My eyes are full of streams. 
My heart takes no delight",Come Again,2007
Edin Karamazov,"The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall
The fly her spleen, the little spark his heat
And slender hairs cast shadows though but small
And bees have stings although they be not great
Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs
And love is love in beggars and in kings
Where waters smoothest run deep are the fords
The dial stirs, yet none perceives it move
The firmest faith is in the fewest words
The turtles cannot sing and yet they love
True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongues to speak
They hear and see and sigh, and then they break",The Lowest Trees Have Tops,2007

Her clothes are kinda funny
Her hair is kinda wild and free
Oh, but Love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

She talks kinda lazy
And people say she she's crazy
And her life's a mystery
Oh, but Love grows where my Rosemary goes

There's something about her hand holding mine
It's a feeling that's fine
And I just gotta say
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well
That I can't get away

I'm a lucky fella

That I love her endlessly

Edison Lighthouse,"I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time
When you take you gotta give so live and let live
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine
There's gotta be a little rain some time

I beg your pardon
I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

Along with the sunshine
