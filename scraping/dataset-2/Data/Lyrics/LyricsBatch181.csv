Dúo Dinámico,"Oh Carol 
I am but a fool 
Darling I love though you treat me cruel 
You hurt me and you make me cry 
But if you leave me I will surely die 
Darling there will never be another 
'Cause I love you so 
Don't ever leave me 
Say you'll never go
I will always want you for my sweet heart
No matter what you do 
Oh Carol I'm still in love with you 

Oh Carol I am but a fool

Dúo Dinámico,"Confieso que a veces soy cuerdo y a veces loco
Y amo así la vida y tomo de todo un poco
Me gustan las mujeres, me gusta el vino
Y si tengo que olvidarlas, bebo y olvido

Mujeres en mi vida hubo que me quisieron
Pero he de confesar que otras también me hirieron
Pero de cada momento que yo he vivido
Saqué sin perjudicar el mejor partido

Y es que yo
Amo la vida y amo el amor
Soy un truhán, soy un señor
Algo bohemio y soñador

Duo Duo,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,2007
Duo En,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

Duo Evocacion,"Cuando yo llegue
A mi Oriente querido
Cuando yo asome
Al balcón de la capital
Cuando yo sienta sonar
Las campanas de la catedral
Doy un salto de alegría
Y les digo a los viajeros
Estamos en Santiago
Como custodia dejo atrás
La virgen de la Caridad
La que me vio partir
La que me vio llegar

Ya te diré, te diré mis penas
Ya te contaré, te contaré mis alegrías

Adiós adiós

Cuando me vaya te diré

Duo Salteno,"Vidita, ya me voy 
De los pagos del Tucumán
En la Aconquija viene clareando

Vidita, triste está 
Suspirando mi corazón

Vidita
Paloma, adiós adiós

Vidita, ya me voy 
Y se me hace que no hei volver
Malaya mi suerte tanto quererte 
Vidita
Y tenerte que perder

Malaya mi suerte tanto quererte

Al clarear yo me iré 
A mis pagos de Chasquivil

Duofel,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

Duologue,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1988
Duologue,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1988

Duotang,"With... inside
And a warm, caring smile
She was drawn to his world
And he swallowed her whole
He devoured her soul
But she glanced the wrong way
It's another bad day
And I'll never keep inside
All eyes hurt before
I'm wrapped in a uniform
I've got the world by its horns
I'll never leave it alone
He's just broken

Dupree Bolton,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2008

Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome there's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing wile you're dancing in the rain

Where is all you angels now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over secrets they could tell

Thought I heard you talking softly.
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?

Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
Left me in the vacuum of my heart.

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say,
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Feared today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

Swim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle

And tears will dry as you're leaving
Who knows you might find something to last..
Emotion's a game , saved up for a rainy Monday
But you laugh just the same, 'cause it's been pouring on Sunday;
Call up your numbers and never let the zeros let you down.

Do you believe in shame?
And if love can conquer all then why
Do we only feel the pain?
I heard you speak my name.
Heard you singing The Stones
Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static
On my telephone.
So why your eyelids are closed
Inside a case of rust?
And did you have to change all your poet's fire
To frozen dust.
I try to justify it
To learn from your mistake.
But where's the stupid lie that has to make its point
With such a pointless waste?
Come out

Do you believe in shame?
Do you believe in love?
And if they taste the same would you love again
Or abandon both?
I don't think I ever can believe my friend is gone
Keep saying it's all right, I'm gonna bring you back
But I know I'm wrong.
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing left to do
It's just that lately I've been so damn lonely when
I think of you.
And it may seem selfish now but I'll hold on to
The memory until all this fear is washed away.

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in life?
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die.
Cause I believe a little part of you inside of me

But only briefly and that life is very brief

Come up and see me, make me smile
Or do what you want, running wild

Where everyone is coming from, is coming to
And birth is just a breath after breath.

anyway they treat you like an ace that can't be betrayed
I know you's know with no use people if your life is on the line, 
then you're dead today

They are the kings 'cos they swing amputation 
lose your arms your legs the famous compilation

The reason that I say that 'cause they flick you off like fleas
They be laughin' at ya while you're crawlin' on our knees
And to the strength, so go the length 
thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor 
cause 911 is a fake life saver

Cars were stood still
And a gleaming metal tube
Would stretch all the way from the highlands
Back to La Brea.
And she met under Los Angeles sunshine
Young man was sitting at the wheel
On his way to make a pickup
Turned off the air-con
Rolled down the window
And began to sweat
Out over the Hollywood hills
He saw the clouds building 
Like great dark towers of rain
Ready to come tumbling down

Not a day too soon

From other cars

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inchy stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd browning beast you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knees
I'm sure you're not protected
For its plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers
And they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will
Mannequins with kill-appeal

Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch a death in the fog
Young girl they call them the diamond dogs
Young girl they call them the diamond dogs

Now Halloween jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh tarzie go man, go

Meets his little hussy with his ghost-town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a 
Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent something Mother 
Used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed
Diamond dogs are sable-ized

Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone

(chorus)

In the year of the scavenger
The season of the bitch
Sashay on the board-walk scurry to the ditch
Just another future song lonely little kitch
There's gonna be sorrow try 
And wake up tomorrow

If you knew what she was after

And she laughs in her frustration

The reason for this strange behavior

The medicine we desired

So big deal it's what rules

Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why

Until we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you, is the view to a kill
Between the shades, assassination's standing still
The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die

But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need

Did it all go wrong?

They lay back laughing at naivety's star
Awaken all those whispers
The dusty shadow of a passing favour
I wouldn't say that you were ruthless or right
I couldn't see from so far

Was I chasing after rainbows? 
One thing for sure, you never answered when I called
And I wiped away the water from my face
To look through the eyes of a stranger

For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of the stranger

Can't tell the real from reflection
When all these faces look the same to me
In every city such a desolate dream
Some days are strange to number
Some say the seventh sounds a little bit stranger
A year of Sundays seems to have drifted right by
I could have sworn in one evening

And I'm not seized in desperation
No steel reproaches on the table from before
But I still can feel those splinters of ice

For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger

A kinda' strange light you emit,
I hear you're gravity pull me in,
Now your getting me out of it!

Wasted, there's nothing gonna ace this,
And were gonna go to space it,
'Cause I'm leaving with an astronaut!

There, feat for quantum leap,
Because space is hot and deep,
And we follow giant footprints,
As we fall in, falling like the twins,
Through Saturn's holy rings,
And if they can't hold us, where it's gonna end up,

The ghosts are creepin' in
Are gathering around me
Like starlings in the wind

Dark shapes gather round

Voices like my brother's
Are whispering to me
But I don't know these others
Who want to set me free

Come home you're out of time

But the life cannot let go
It's a chain cuts across my soul
Anchoring in this world

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

The door is standing open
But I'm too tired to be afraid
My whole life's in this moment
I've been fighting all the way

Just need a little more time

'cause the life just can't let go
It's a chain cuts across my soul
Anchoring in this world

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

My senses sharpen
But it always takes so damn long
Before I feel how much my eyes have darkened

Fear hangs in a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb, with a thought, with a whisper
With a careless memory, with a careless memory

On the table, signs of love lies scattered
And the walls break, with a crashing within
It's not as though, as though you really mattered 
But being close, how could I let you go
Without some feeling, some precious sympathy following

Fear hangs in a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb with a thought, with a whisper
With a careless memory, with a careless memory
With a careless memory, with a careless memory

I walk out into the sun, I try to find a new day
But the whole place just screams in my eyes
Where are you now 'cause I don't want to meet you
I think I'd die, I think I'd laugh at you
I know I'd cry, what am I supposed to do, follow you

Outside the thoughts coming flooding back now
I just try to forget you

Duran Duran,"God created the world
Then created the devil to blame for his mistakes
I closed the door of my hotel room behind me
It was like closing a chapter in the book of life
Outside 30 floors below I could hear the police
Using their sirens like wolf whistles to pick up young girls
On TV Oliver North his 15 minutes of fame
Ticking steadily away was being fuzzy about crucial events
Which had happened a year earlier- what a flake
But then who isn't
That was Reagan's defense at least
The worst thing is how politics begins to leak into your life
Back in our innocence we used to simply stick two fingers up
Say ""fuck off"" that was about all you had to say anyway
And then go back to the more important business of making music
So why was I sitting there feeling angry about covert operations
And illegal aid to the contras
I mean I'm not even American
But maybe we all are a little bit
And then I realized it was just the thought
That in this particular democracy
And probably every other one in the world
There is somebody in power who thinks he is more right
Then all the people who put him there
All the people who for once in their lives took an interest
Outside the wind was howling the who-who's
From sympathy for the devil
Round and round the concrete hotel walls and corners
That was then- this isn't",God (London),2004

Concrete beach to scrape my head
Inside the subway stinking fear and shame
Becomes the violent breath

Nothing to protest
Learn to love your anger now
Anger here is all you possess
Welcome to the edge

They seemed far below.
Then I came to where there had been a fire
And was shaded
From the sun by the trees.

Where's the real life, in your illusion
On the dark side - of power and confusion
Do the dance,
Do the demolition.
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen
Where's the real life, in your illusion

Hear it when you listen..
You can't hear if you don't listen..

Got to see the water flow, try to understand
Got me trapped, playing with me like a cat
Scrape your fingers down my back
Pin me to the ground

All along the water baby
Take me to your water baby
All along your water babe

When you come and turn it up, higher every time
If I stay , oh the end is near
Come and get me out of here
Come and get me now

Is there time
Could I find someone out there to help me?

Caught inside its own motion
How I wish it was somebody else instead

Howling at all this corrosion

Laugh in my face, so pleased to desert me
Why do the cruel barbs fly?

A chance to die

But can we dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, to fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire, that fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire, when all we see is the view to a kill",Rio [Instrumental],2008
Duran Duran,"Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Every one
Is my world, (I will learn to survive)
Any one
Is my world, (I will learn to survive)
Any one
Is my world
Every one
Is my world",Ordinary World [From Layer Cake],2008

Is rolling closer
Lighting up this holy smoker
And if this drinking
Could ease the thinking
I toast to my home truth with this glass

All rise you promises broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words
That are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain

Little pin-pricks
And how my ears bleed
On the bomb ticks that is my heartbeat
In every life-flash
In every car crash
I hear the silence waiting to fall

All rise you promises broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words
That are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain

For all I carry
Are murdered secrets
The price of my blue
Star-eyed weakness
And so we travel
And we unravel
Towards the place
Where all loose ends go

Call my lovers by their names

Under suspicion of entrapment of a wild animal.

Discovered a caged leopard in the building! 
The fully grown feline was said
To be surprisingly domesticated? 
Before preparing her for relocation. 
A large crowd is gathered outside 
To watch the beautiful creature as a giant
Cage was lowered slowly onto the street by a crane. 
From here, the leopard 
Was transferred into the back of a truck 
For the journey ahead. A thoughtful
Onlooker said it's extraordinary to think 
That any human being could have
Lived so?silently? with such a dangerous animal. 
Police are saying the captive has simply befriended? 
The creature and barely left her side. 
It's alleged that he hunted her in the wild 
And expertly forged documents to facilitate 
Her illegal export to the United States of America. 
The incident has already created much controversy 
And is now likely to lead to a major international investigation 
Into the life of the man who stole a leopard.""",The Man Who Stole a Leopard,2011

Gave him some and took some more, made him their slave, became a whore.

Last year today you turn and you say
Here's a dream for me
You close your eyes, the moon starts to rise
And you scream for me
I calm you, I'm with you
What did they ever give you

Memories in future tense
Memories don't make much sense

Last year today a radio plays
Such a simple song
The music surreal and you almost could feel
That there's nothing wrong
They bought you, they sold you
And all the things they told you",Memories in Future Tense,2005
Düsseldorf Evangelical Church Student Choir,"Lying alone, isn't that you
Drifting away 
Is the only thing left to do
Such a sad place, such a lost world
But nothing is sadder 
Than the tears of a make-believe girl
Who is this child, who is this man
Only two people
Who are doing all they can

Düsseldorf Evangelical Church Student Choir,"I'm not exact but I'm not insane
I clutched at someone in the dark again
It's so hard to remember her name she never said

It was in a story that I wanted to write
The details weren't important, the plot was slight
No-one asked what happened that night she never said

Get out of bed, pull on a shoe
I've got a notion what we ought to do
Here's a number you can try to ring
I'm still thinking about all the things she never said

I parked my car by some memories
And told my story to the laughing trees
They don't know what's wrong with me, she never said

Did you notice who cleared up the mess
What the date was is anybody's guess she never said",She Never Said,2005
Düsseldorf Evangelical Church Student Choir,"Night-time is so lonely
When you hear a sound
But it's only an empty heart
Beating on through the night
A sad sad drum
And I'm lying here listening
And the raindrops are all glistening
In my dreams
And it seems
That the sun never comes
And I want my sad reflection
To go drifting through the skies
To be in your eyes
And I'm waking to this aching
And it's breaking me in two
All the space
All the waste
All the distance between me and you
And the people with their voices
Random choices will they ever learn
To really see
Really be on fire when their spirit burns
I want the person inside me
To be someone I'd recognise
If he was in your eyes
So I'm waiting, contemplating
Relocating a faded image in my thoughts
But the memories are like clouds
Try so hard
But they never can be caught
But I'm trying, yes I'm trying
But I'm only lying in the dark
So alone
On my own
No one home
And if love was worth a fortune
Then I'd need a rise

I want these words to be the things
I hoped you'd realised 
To be in your eyes",To Be in Your Eyes,2005

So long, long between mirages
I knew you'd find me drinking
Tell those men with horses for hearts

On a world like this, a hundred turns left to go
Deep in a room, which I've never seen
Outside it's so cold but I'm waiting for time

Rocks break the boats of the painted face men
And they drown, and they're born

And the world is like an apple spinning silently in space

In the windmills of your mind 

Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own 
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone 
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half-forgotten dream

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes on its face

Words that jangle in your head

Was it something that I said? 
Lovers walk along a shore 
And leave their footprints in the sand 
Was the sound of distant drumming 
Just the fingers of your hand? 
Pictures hanging in a hallway 
Or the fragment of a song 
Half-remembered names and faces 
But to whom do they belong? 
When you knew that it was over 
Were you suddenly aware 
That the autumn leaves were turning 
To the color of her hair?

Gripped by every limb it could hold, the lifeless ideas it grew onto its own.
A much needed surrender.
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed like a lifeless neck...

From a monster to a beauty in quick months...
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom.

So courage for the givers
Do what must be done
To deal out truth and justice
With swift and sober guns

For years you met our thirst
Still deserts we have roamed
We'll be done with dust and dirt
When the ocean calls us home

And fall into the arms
Of a cool and sweet embrace
And under stars and waving palms
Shed our sin like snakes

But time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns

Time will cease to stalk us
Death will be undone
We'll shine with the light of
A thousand blazing suns

I'll be so blue just thinking about you

That's when those blue memories start calling

Come Lord Jesus, come

Come again to claim your own
Come to reap what you have sown

It's to you that we belong
It's to you we lift our song
How our spirits look and long for you

Dustin Kensrue,"Even when it seems the answer's no
The promises of God all find their Yes
In Christ who worked the Father's will below

We look to Christ who suffered in our place
That one day all our suffering would end

God is good, all of the time
All of the time, God is good
God is good, all of the time

And towers of ivory rose beneath my feet
Were palaces of pleasure mine to wander

Though every soul would hold my name in honor
And truest love was always by my side

My soul would never still be satisfied

I could walk the world forever
Till my shoes were filled with blood

Exhausting every avenue of sin

Turning agony to praise

Dustin Kensrue,"Rock of Ages, cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee
Let the water and the blood
from thy wounded side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Save from wrath and make me pure

Not the labors of my hands
Can fulfill the law's commands
Should my passion never fade
And my efforts all be weighed
All for sin could not atone
You must save and you alone

Rock of Ages
No one takes your life
Yet you died that I might live
Costly grace you freely give

You have paid the price
You were cleft to cover me

Simply to the cross I cling
Naked come to thee for dress
Helpless look to thee for grace
Wretched to the fount I fly
Wash me, Savior, or I die

And while I draw my final breath
I'll rest upon your grace
And when I close my eyes in death
I'll wake to see your face",Rock of Ages,2013
Dustin Kensrue,"His appearance was so badly marred
He could not have been recognized
So disfigured, so beyond all human likeness
That we hid our eyes

Though he carried all our griefs and bore our sorrows
We esteemed him not
But despised him and considered him afflicted
And as one reviled by God

Though all of us have gone astray
Though all have turned to their own ways
The Lord has laid our wickedness on him
His punishment has brought us peace
And crushed for our iniquities
He died to save his people from their sin

He was stricken, and though pierced for our transgressions
He did not lash out
But was silent, like a lamb led to the slaughter
So he opened not his mouth

The might of Yahweh stands revealed
And by his wounds we are all healed

He offered up his soul to death
He poured it out till none was left
He died but now shall rise and surely see

The many he has righteous made
And satisfied, his work surveyed
The man of sorrows evermore shall be

On high, exalted, lifted up
The righteous servant raised above
His might hand shall work the will of God

Just popping them tops, yeah we were shooting off like a shotgun shell saying

Beer before liquor, yeah you've never been sicker
Cops were pretty quick, yeah, but we were always quicker
Burning up the road 'til the tank ran dry
Just down home boys staying up all night

Fake ID, worn out boots
And they can't tell me nothing kind of attitude
Got a styrofoam cup, gonna fill it on up with a little bit of whiskey
Just talking that smack, gonna take it out back, who's coming with me?

The fields are dry and dusty, there is no sign of rain
It floats out a kitchen window, somewhere in the south
If the river gets much higher, they'll float away no doubt
You can almost feel it in the air, an American prayer

They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong
I got faith in us, I got faith in Him
The clouds will part and the sun will shine again, amen

It echoes through the factories up in Michigan
It bounces off the levees, and rides out on the wind
Clear out to California, and back on up to Maine
It don't matter if you're rich or poor, a sinner or a saint
Every night, everybody, everywhere
Is praying their American prayer

They're gonna be alright, they're gonna carry on
Help from above will come back strong

If I woke up in time after parties you'd catch me in class
I moved back home, stayed out, slept in
'Til one Monday morning I heard Daddy scream

Just tryin' to take what the day has to give
Everyone wants but they don't always get what's expected of me
They say act your age, don't break no mold
Be young when you're young and old when you're old
They say I'm in the prime of my life, hell if I know what that means
In the back of my mind I'm still going on eighteen

Got the wife, got the kids, got the job, got the cars and the house
In life's little rulebook it falls under ""all settled down""
But give a handful of friends a handful drinks
It's like riding a time machine
A bunch of thirty-something-year-old guys going on eighteen

Now I preach to my boy be a kid just as long as you can
But he's hell-bent and determined
To be his old man",Going on Eighteen,2003

Ain't no easy way to cross that river
When it's draggin' you under
Ain't no sure thing you can count on

Break down these walls
I'll beg, I'll crawl
I'd risk it all to get to you

I fall in love, the hard way
And I fall in love, the hard way
Straight to your heart, the hard way

I got nothing left to lose
But I got everything to prove
To prove my love for you
I know just what I've gotta do

And I'll walk the wire
Above the fire
My one desires to get to you

I fall in love the, hard way
And I fall in love, the hard way
Straight to your heart

Ain't nothing worth havin'
If it comes too easy
'Cause if it comes too easy
You might lose that love someday, the hard way

With you and my heart

I just can't take the whistle or the wheels

The way that silver arrow cuts a dawn horizon,
Just like a knife it reminds me of you 
And that night we broke through the ice

Colorado all aboard and you rolled out like a storm
Without goodbye

Dusty Drake,"

Clock radio wakes me up from my dreams

This bathroom floor's feeling cold on my feet

But I keep the rhythm by brushing my teeth to the radio

The nest thing I knew, that toothbrush in my hand

Was a microphone and I was staring back

At ten thousand screaming fans through my radio

Back to Earth, off to work, that is the deal

I'm not a star, but I know how it feels to be on my radio

Well I pulled into work and heard ""Born To Be Wild""

I reached for the knob and I cranked it up loud

And I blasted that Harley straight on through the town on my radio

No, these aren't handlebars, it's just my steering wheel

And I'm not a rebel, but I know how it feels on my radio

Music carries hearts away

Turns then 'round and makes then stay

Proves there's nothing you can't do

And by itself, makes dreams come true

We pulled off the road just to talk for a while

I pulled her closer, then I saw her smile

Lit up by the soft amber light of the dial on my radio

And somehow the DJ knew just what to play

And the singer knew just what to say

To make her melt in my arms that way by the radio

Two innocent hearts and an automobile

I'm not a stud, but I know how it fels, thank God for that radio

I've learned how to love and I've learned about life

And I've done it all staring straight through the eyes of my radio

Dusty Drake,"My fondest memories didn't happen on sunny days
Cause when that summer sun was a-beating down
It was all work and no play
Daddy wasn't the only one who used to pray for rain
When the smell of a storm would fill the air
I'd put that farm in my rear view mirror
As the rain soaked the ground, it was too wet to plow

I'd drive down that muddy road, wipers barely keepin' up
She'd be waiting on the front porch, watching for my truck
We'd head for that old boxcar abandoned on the tracks
While they were riding out the weather back on the farm
There we were on a bed of straw
Breaking new ground, it was too wet to plow

And with the rhythm of the sound of the rain that was pounding
On that big steel door
Two lovers in the dark were learning by heart
What rainy days are for
Now when I hear thunder I still wonder
What she thinks about when it's too wet to plow

The strangest thing happened to me just the other day
I saw a storm from moving in, when my telephone rang
On the other end of the line was a voice I'd heard before
She said if you wanna know who this is talking
Meet down by the railroad crossing
Baby, look at those clouds, oh, it's too wet to plow

And with the rhythm of the sound of the rain that was pounding
On that big steel door
Two lovers in the dark were learning by heart
What rainy days are for

And dreaming 'bout the things that he could do

Kicking dirt and pitching fits

For the world I love is dying   And now I'm crying 
And time is not a friend (no friend of mine)
As friends we're out of time
And it's slowly passing by ....right before our eyes

We are a rock revolving
Around a golden sun
We are a billion children rolled into one 
What will I think of me the day that I die

Who understand the soul of a man
They're always on the talking end
Never giving, never offering a helping hand
But baby, I can count on you
Whenever trouble calls
You see me through 
You show your love in so many ways
And I'm gonna love you for the rest of my days

That I can't give back the love I feel for you

The taste of life was sweet
As rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze
May tease the candle flame

The thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the time ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many lovely songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation that I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
And only now I'm left alone to end the play, yeah

Oh, yesterday when I was young
So many, many songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me

The more I find

Are times that are few

Nights are twice as long

Stand out so clear
No matter where I am
Or what I do

To the things I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
And everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom's all we're lack
So catch me if you can

You're the someone I dreamed I would find

It's the way you make me feel
The moment I am close to you
It's a feeling so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true
The pounding I feel in my heart
The hoping that we'll never part
I can't believe this is really happening to me

And when I open them you're still here

And tomorrow was just, I don't know

Makes today seem so unreal

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

You look my way
With innocent expression
Just as if to say
It would be easy

To weaken the music's strong
My conscience speaks, I know it's wrong

It had to end
So why this indecision?
When you're close again

I can't deny
With those old memories stealing
Back across my mind
I thought by now that the flame had gone
I realize that I'm still holding on

Begin to measure you

And as I watch you framed in sunlight
In a sky of blue
I know what my life's been leading to

They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
The people worked the land together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have the time to think about another man's coulour

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing and everybody would mess around
And Daddy bring on his guitar, we'd play all through the night
And every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
'Hey you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)

I remember the best times of all when Saturday came around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
'Do y'all need anything from town?'
He'd say 'No, but why don't cha all stop on your way back through
And I'll get Laura Mae to cook us some barbecue (you know, they good)'

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine (yes it was)
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land, and took back what they'd given
We all knew we'd have to move if we were gonna make a livin'
So we all moved on and went about our separate ways
Sure it was hard to say goodbye to Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

Dusty Springfield,"Spoken : Somehow, it seems the love I knew was always the most destructive kind

Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet
As rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze
May tease the candle flame

The thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the time ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many lovely songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation that I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
And only now I'm left alone to end the play, yeah

Oh, yesterday when I was young
So many, many songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung

Should have let you go

I can't disguise
See all her faces
Ah, ha, see all her faces

I'm looking for someone
Of the gentle kind
Knowing that looks can lie
Looking for someone
Is he there to find? 
Or should I run on by, ah, ha

Here she comes
Here she comes
Shadows sadly chasing
Every step she takes
Look at her now
She needs love so much more somehow
See all her faces
See all her faces

Look at my life
The wasted years
Each a knife
See all her faces, ah-ha
See all her faces

Waiting for someone
Who will set me free
Passing the time too fast
Waiting for someone
Is that where he'll be? 
Or should I run right past? , hmm

Flowers sparkle with a dew of morning
Feathers float from her dance

She may not be the latest rage 
But she's singing and she means it 
And she deserves a little silence
Quiet please, there's a woman up there 
And she's been honest through her songs 
Long before your consciousness was raised 
Doesn't that deserve a little praise 
So put your hands together and help her along 
All that's left of the singer's 
All that's left of the song 
Stand for the ovation 
And give her one last celebration 
Quiet please, there's a person up there 
And she's been singing of the things 
That none of us could bear to hear for ourselves
Give her your respect if nothing else 
Quiet please, there's a lady on stage 
Conductor, turn the final page 
And when it's over we can all go home 
But she lives on -- on the stage alone.","Quiet Please, There's a Lady on Stage [Live]",2000
Dusty Springfield,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,2000

Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet
As rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze
May tease the candle flame

The thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the time ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many lovely songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation that I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
And only now I'm left alone to end the play, yeah

Oh, yesterday when I was young
So many, many songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday

Than I've ever been lifted before

Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

Now once, I was downhearted
Disappointment was my closest friend
But you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again

Ohh I'm so glad I finally found you
You're that one in a million man
When you wrap your lovin' arms around me
I can stand up and face the world again

Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

Show me a reason and Ill soon show you a rhyme.
Cats fit on the window sill, Children fit in the snow.
Why do I feel I don't fit in anywhere I go? Rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Eagles belong where they can fly.
Ive got to be where my spirit can run free.
Got to find my corner of the sky.

Every man has his daydreams, Every man has his goals. 
People like the way dreams have of sticking to the soul. 
Thunderclouds have their lightening. Nightingales have their song. 
And don't you see I want my life to be something more than long?

So many men seem destined to settle for something small,

To the things 
I learned so well 
In my youth
 
I think I'm returning to
Those days 
When I was young enough 
To know the truth
 
Now there are no games 
To only pass the time
No more coloring books
No Christmas bells to chime
 
But thinking young 
And growing older
Is no sin
And I can play 
The game of life to win
 
I can recall the time
When I wasn't ashamed
To reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than 
A skipping rope to lend
 
Now there's more to do 
Than watch my sailboat glide
And everyday can be 
My magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years
 
Let everyone debate the true reality

You're the someone I dreamed I would find

The moment I am close to you
It's a feeling so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true

The pounding I feel in my heart
The hoping that we'll never part
I can't believe
This is really happening to me

I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them you're still here
I close my eyes and count again
I can't believe it but you're still here

With a few dreams but nothing to show
The world was a place with a frown on its face
And tomorrow was just, I don't know

Makes today seem so unreal

Dusty Springfield,"Broken windows
In empty hallways
Pale dead moon
And the sky streaked with grey
Human kindness overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to keep love away
Human kindness overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
I think I'll kick it down the street

Dusty Springfield,"It isn't the way that you look
And it isn't the way that you talk
It isn't the things that you say or do
Make me want you so

It is nothing to do with the wine
Or the music that's flooding my mind
But never before have I been so sure
You're the someone I dreamed I would find

It's the way you make me feel
The moment I am close to you
Makes today feel so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true
The pounding I feel in my heart
The hoping that we'll never part
I can't believe this is really happening to me

I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them you're still here
I close my eyes and count again
I can't believe it but you're still here

We were strangers a moment ago
With a few dreams but nothing to show
The world was a place
With a frown on its face
And tomorrow was just, I don't know

But the way you make me feel
The moment I am close to you
Makes today seem so unreal
Somehow I can't believe it's true
Tomorrow will you still be here?
Tomorrow will come but I fear
That what is happening to me
Is only a dream

I close my eyes and count to ten
And when I open them you're still here
I close my eyes and count again
I can't believe it but you're still here

Dusty Springfield,"Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky, love
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down

The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone and the past is unknown
And there is no easy way down

No, it isn't very easy when you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy when each road you take
Is one more mistake, there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home, yeah

We all like to climb to the heights of love
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end when it's time to descend
That there is no easy way down

You know you're gonna find
There is no easy way down",Wasn't Born to Follow,2010

Baby, I need your lovin'

'Cause I'm so lonely
 
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'

This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside, darling

How real is this, how real is this
Uh-huh huh, Inspect this here, check

I'm from where the hammer's rung, New's cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt some more something and you nothing check
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, So everything you said you'd do
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own

I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale
Your laughing, you know the place well
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well
And Government, fuck Government, niggas politic themselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, god strike me
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?
We'll never know
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, Let 'em know
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done

I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street
From where the Pimps, Prostitutes, and the Drug Lords meet
We make a million off of beats, cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether your four-feet or Minute size, it always starts out with
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas will show you love, That's how they fool thugs
Before you know it your lying in a pool of blood

Remain to love until they droop and die

DV Alias Christ,"Wild Cowboys and you know this 
Lookin at a Cowboy and you know they're dead 

A lot of niggaz stepped up to the bad man 
Chest bucked out with your head wide open 
Hopin  to spot  a chip in this frame 
I lived and died by the burnin flame 
Of the OK Corral  Cowboy style 
From the Quarters on down to Colorado's 
Big niggaz from uptown  ridin into Tahoe's 
Saloon settin  kids is walkin round 
Drinkin whiskey and scotch, strictly out of shotglasses 
Lookin screwfaced at the next nigga who passes 
There's women in garter belts and ciggarettes 
And on the side there's the price game 
Niggaz is playin the price game 
Indian Red, was bangin niggaz in the head 
With his man Apache Joe, they take your money off the floor 
They side-bettin for a better, they makin cheddar 
That tribal shit is work ya sound the wompom drums 
Cause my Indian man'sll break your great dick, UHH 
Walk in the New York terrority 
On the back of a tree, there's a picture of me 
It says I'm lawless, flawless, a hustler plus gun rustler 
Wanted in Carolina, for sellin some of New York's finer 
Marshal Cooper say he want me, Marshal Cooper gotta get me 
Marshal Cooper say beat me, Marshal Cooper better wet me 
I gather alla y'all, all of my trusted men 
All of my baddest niggaz, niggaz that's quickest with the triggers 
There's distrubin news on the wire 
That my dome piece is done sent to piece out for hire 
I ain't goin down over no money exchange 
You late for say I, who reigns as King of the Range? 

In this land of wildness 
Yo you better pack your vest 
In the streets there's nothin but crime 
So you best to watch your behind... 

Meanwhile saloon settin is back to full swing 
Bar's gettin money people doin they thing 
There's strictly Boss Players with this kid named Minnesota 
As women start to fill up, turn the notch on the grill up 
And add mo' stakes to the house banks for gamblers 
Half-pipes to scramblers, and free for Wild Cowboys 
You never bring decoys if you want to make real nouse 
The bigger the stick, the bigger the fire 
I never hit a man in the back, a coward acts like that 
Lay out my black hat cause I feel like the bad man 
Who on the rise, the D's to Manhattan 
Let's walk the thirty paces on the Now Rule races 
Oh it's the Marshal Cooper, and I love how he doin this 
Women sayin don't get hurt, and I ain't plannin on it 
Ten steps taken as I hit the blam factor 
His dick to act up, was death the benefactor 
Leave him twitchin in the dirt like Cousin Harold from the Menace 
I'm in this to win this on the great wide trail 
I'm ten times as bad as John Wayne, could ever be 
Plus I'm down with the Indian, and need high to get the shit again 
I'm responsible for that body in the alley 
I'll Louisiana Purchase that ass with with Remi's spurs 
And hard shots of Tequila, where the dancin girls 
Let's get right as the story unfurls 
Piano man keep playin, keep them keys bangin 
Single man get three graves there's gonna be a hangin 
Now this right here ain't for the youth to see 
A grown man assed out swingin from a tree 

In this land of wildness 
Yo you better pack your vest 
In the streets there's nothin but crime 
So you best to watch your behind 

Joe Tex was the biggest hombre from the projects 
Had all the work locked down, so he thought 
But he drank and got loose lipped, let a lot of news slip 
Stripped of his game and got his self murdered 
Thoughts of him are passin like the buffalo 
Got his self rocked in the ninety-six brand new Acura 
Niggaz said it was lightning BLAOW blew out the back mirror 
Hah, youknowhatI'msayin? Dig, check it out 
They say that Cowboys never die they just ride off into the sun 
A little tale from Sadat X of how the WORLD was won 
Check it out, remember this 
Gun-slingers, dead-ringers with presidents 
Is found tied with no explanation of how they died 
Yo the great Sadat X, the High Plains Drifter 
No question 

In this land of wildness 
Yo you better pack a vest 
In the streets there's nothin but crime 
So you best to watch your behind",Hang 'Em High,1996

I ain't no thug son, my name is Plug Won
I drop a certified gem, for him and her
Knockin on your radio, like the Crash Crew
ask whoever you want - I'm managin the funk on the paper
Outside of that we pull capers for days
Ridin throughout the maze of street, while we blaze the beat
Watchin the sweet things wiggle they butt
to Plug Three, on the cut, movin on ya what-
-ever ya got, we gon' get, bringin our point, to ya position
Rippin stages with my thought coalition
Carryin on, eradicate all your stress mode

Everywhere I go I touch a tenderloin

We ain't walkin on a yellow brick road
These streets stay red and bloody kid
Study your code, so you can easily pass
I stash a little love when I'm on the visitation
If you crossin my lane, nigga do the same
I guaranteed to run through and prove the game
ain't bigger than the pieces in it
You see the pieces in it had me stuck travellin one side of map
Clappin hands with rap cats who ain't deserve dap
Long hauls and livin out a suitcase man
Chickenheads and gangs of fruitcakes man
Ain't nuttin better than explorin the outskirts
especially when she ain't got no pantyhose on, and it's on
