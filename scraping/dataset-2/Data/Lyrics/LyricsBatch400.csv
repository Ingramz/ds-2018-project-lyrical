Jaheim,"Oh yeah

I met this girl named Donna
From B.M Alabama
I really like that smile
Those legs, they went for miles

I asked her what's her name
While sizin' up her frame
Feelin' some type of way about her

She was all up on me, couldn't say no
Got a plane to catch but she won't let me go
I really love my life, but I'm missin' just one thing
That woman by my side, forever and always

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Ain't nobody here, it's just you and me baby
Ain't nobody here, I say we get a little crazy
Let's take it to the room, so many things I wanna do

Girl your kisses just like caramel
Smooth like ice-cream, straight from ""Carvel""
Can't control my hands (I can't control my hands)
I hope you understand
I want you to

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Can't nobody tell me, that I don't love this girl
It's drivin' me crazy, I'm tryna offer her the world
And when I think about the past, don't wanna bring it back
Lonely missin' heartache is all I ever had
Come closer, come closer
To me

I want you to

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you

Come, a little bit closer
Spread out, like you were a poster
Girl I want to, put it on you",Closer,2010
Jaheim,"Lights out,
Sucker punch, syked out.
Caught a love wave,
Rode it then I wiped out.
Two ships just passing in the night now,
Offshore, looking for a light house.
Reveal you said that it was painless,
Down and out drowning in a sea of my anguish
Funny, you always said hope floats.
Comprehended but I can't cope
So I

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby.
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby.
Gotta find my way back, way back to you, to us, to love.

Man down, my heart's in your hand now.
Hate to love, draw an X in the sand now.
No clue, no map, damn.
So I'm digging until I end up in Japan now.

Reveal you said that it was painless,
Down and out drowning in a sea of my anguish
Funny, you always said hope floats.
Comprehended but I cant cope
So I

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby.
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby.
Gotta find my way back, way back, to you, to us, to love.

We go lost lines got crossed
And the light turned to static baby.
And your ship got caught up the current
And carried both of us away
We were so much better
When we were together
And just cant let you slip away.

Gotta find my way back, way back to you baby.
Tryna find my way back , way back to you baby.
Gotta find my way back, way back, to you, to us, to love.",Finding My Way Back,2010
Jaheim,"Who walks in a room and fills the room with perfume
She leaves, it seems much too soon
Who uses the moolight to highlight her features
What a beautiful creature, it’s a pleasure to meet ya girl.
Tell Me Who can help you grow and change ya clothes.
Can take ya bank account and add some O’s.
And make your propose, got ya nose open,
Open the door for her that’s what she deserves.

Her, just her, I’m Better with Her
With Her, Indescribable the feeling but undeniable
The feeling I got for her (for her, her)
And only her (just her)
Everyday it gets crazier, amazing her,

The way my hands fit over her curves..
Its perfect like a hand fits in the glove, it’s love
I don’t wanna b without her,
How can someone’s smile take you away
From the days, stays in your mind on replay
And this ain't no movie, you move me my darling,
Your number on my cell, im excited ya called
How can someone know just how you feel,
Like a better man I swear, the sex appeal
Bringing the man up out of ya boy toy.
This ain’t no game, all I'm just trying to say it’s all about her.

How can I say it, too hard to describe it
So what can I call it, must be heaven sent.
Wings on her back, He cracked open the sky
And he let the sunshine, now she’s mine, all mine.
(Gotta Be Gotta Be) cus I need Her
(Gotta Be Gotta Be) She’s meant for me yea

Jaheim,"I named you Ja Jr. or Caron or Jayliah (A Daughter)
I can't wait to meet ya and I hope you got your mother's eyes
I'll b right here dear, waiting on the outside
Already got it all mapped out
Already buying baby bibs, cribs, and the bedroom (Baby Bedroom)
Already love you more then myself, 
More then I've ever loved anybody else so

[Chorus]
Hurry up into my life.
My Life, My Life
Baby let me bring you into?
My Life, My life
Told me she was eating for 2 and the date u were due
I cried, even if even if you were only 2 pink lines
Only 9 months and you'll be mine
Its only the best day of my life, simply as a plus or minus sign
Love you were even with 2 pink lines

Going to be a Dad, cant pop or brag, IÃ¢??m so excited.
I remember the moment, it felt so right
I can't believe we conceived
It's a blessing that finally I could be a proud pops
All the playing stops, tucking in my shirt, gotta go to work now
And put it on the table; make the situation more stable for my baby

[Chorus]

Only 9 months and you'll be mine
Its only the best day of my life, simply as a plus or minus sign.
Loved you even when you were 2 pink lines.
Honey what are you thinking, Baby Blue or Pink?
I can't tell, sonogram reveals it all, Berets over Basketball
Handsome in a room standing tall or in the crowd
You're the pick of the pageant and lookin' for your daddy, 
In 6 months we'll see.
I don't care as long as you're here with me
Told me she was eating for 2 and the date u were due.

Jaheim,"I woke up on top of the world today
Holding her hand she don t mind me leading the way
As long as I never let her fall
She wouldn't have to pull away
Gipy's woman can you read my palm
Is my love line broken or is it lost
Long as yours is inside of mine
Words cannot define how it feels to be in love

My finger tips touch you soft girl
My two lips kissed truer then this
I doubt I find a love of this kind
Cause when I hold your hand
I've got the whole world in my hand
Ever since the day you came across my path
Oh baby that was the plan
What else could a man with all love his heart could stand
Ever want for if the richest all around the land don t 
Compare to the woman he has
I've got the whole world in my hand

And here we stand the two of us face to face
Staring at each other
Me smiling you crying away
So long ago we both made plans to be together among days
And with those two words I vow to be
Your protector your provider unconditionally
And never let go of your hand
You are my destiny

My finger tips touch you soft girl
My two lips kissed truer then this
I doubt I find a love of this kind
Cause when I hold your hand
I've got the whole world in my hand
Ever since the day you came across my path
Oh baby that was the plan
What else could a man with all love his heart could stand
Ever want for if the richest all around the land don t 
Compare to the woman he has
I've got the whole world in my hand

Beautiful in every way
Promise not to let my heart ever stray
To give you piece of mind and never lie
And baby if you ever cry
Every tear will dry
I am grateful and I'm reminded
That I see clear more precious than any diamond
Cause something way bigger then us finds us
Together we are classic and timeless
Cause when I hold your hand",In My Hands,2010
Jaheim,"As I clearly remember, it was the end of December,
In fact, it wasn't long ago
Just before we took it down, do you remember now?
Said a lot of disrespectful things, still in my head
And I been up stressing since,
Hoping and prayin'.
I ain't walkin' out, I just wanna talk it out
I got nothing but love for u baby,
But you're breakin' my heart, driving me crazy.

That's when my palms start sweating
And my brain starts thinking that,
I start chasing the Henny V-S-O-P (Hennessey),
Blood shots in my eyes from all the tears that I've cried,
Duckin' Jacob in the 2-door coupe
What we have is as real as it gets, I don't want to live with regrets..
Ain't ate all week and im losing sleep
I'm trying hard to get you to see
That there's no you without me..
The love we built built from the ground
Is all coming down now, and aint no cookin' at home
Since my baby's been gone..
I've done lost all kinds of weight
Still im keeping my faith, I just want you to know that
You're the other half of me

I don't know where we're headed
Now all I know is that I got it really, really, really badÃ¢?Â¦
Now it's been 3 whole months since we both split up
And ever since that day I been having bad luck,
I really didn't mean it I know sometimes I can be crazy
Baby but you're the one that drives me crazy.
But I can't see myself without you now,
Tell me how the hell that would sound..
Tell Me

Jaheim,"You wouldn't believe it, no
Til that right somebody comes along, you fall so strong,
Now your gone floating out of ya body
Plans y'all making, trips taken,
But you can't even remember your life before them
But you won't believe that it's true,
Until it happens to you, to you to you,
Til that Sunday morning and you heard that callin'
Gots to preach that sermon, choir, organ,
Palms start sweating, knees shaking
And you fall to your knees saying
Thank you Jesus (Thank you Jesus)
You won't believe its true til it happen to you

And may your life be forever changed,
May you find your voice be forever brave
And on that day may you finally find that happiness that you pursue
May your eyes be open
And may you see more vivid colors,
Green and blue when it happens to you.

To every other women that looks good
Even though your wife'd up
And on the side got a sweet lil' thing, still playing games
Protection pop and you just couldn't stop.
Then your junior drops. Then you're wondering,
Could this really be happening to me? (happening to me)
This morning didn't go like it was supposed,
House foreclosed, third time for this interview
Resumed that afternoon thought you froze
Until they shook ya hand and welcomed youÃ¢?Â¦
Your hopes restored and renewed
And it happen for you (Yes it can, Yes it can)

And may your life be forever changed,
May you find your voice be forever brave
And on that day may you finally find that happiness that you pursue
May your eyes be open
And may you see more vivid colors,
Green and blue when it happens to you

I can recall the days of hearing myself say
If walk, talk, think a little differently,
All those things that happen to them
Would never happen to meÃ¢?Â¦
Until I found that girl, Til I found the truth,
I found out you pay for everything you do..
Until I found out im no different from you

And may your life be forever changed,
May you find your voice be forever brave
And on that day may you finally find that happiness that you pursue
May your eyes be open

The first thing I do as soon as I get home
Is call my darling baby on the telephone

But now there's nothing left to say baby

Go and hand me that white coat

Doing time like a locked down in prison
Staring at the wall, I know I made some bad decision
Get me out of this hell hole don't wanna be here
Blame me, go ahead and blame me
Because I said you could
Blame me, go ahead and blame me cause I knew you would
You say it's me, I say it's you
Now we're taking shots like we're bulletproof
When you point the finger, three point at you?
Remember that next time you're trying to blame somebody

When you fall out of love you gotta blame someone
Say hello to the bad guy (bad guy)
You try to paint the picture like you're such a victim
Well I guess I'm the bad guy (bad guy)
Hello, hello, say hello

I've been getting bad with some good
It's the misunderstood
You think I'm always up to no good
Making me out the villian, when I'm only chillin'
We're talking stick, stick to the plan
I been good to you girl, put the world in your hand
Didn't appreciate the man you found, well check it out
It's getting hard for me to stick around

When you fall out of love you gotta blame someone

Jaheim,"Now I've got a story that I want to share with you
Of a young man name Tray he was on his way
Till that fatal day, well well well
It was 7:12 PM Travon’s girl call to speak to him, yeah yeah yeah
He was standing outside his daddy's home
He was all alone, on the cellphone
About 7:16 the call goes dead
Travon’s on the struggle now
He was lyin' on the ground
Fighting to save his life, and as the gun went off
He got hit in the chest and the neighbor who shot him confessed
And the saddest part about this he was only 17
He didn't even lived his dream.

Ohh, (no) Florida something's very wrong (aw Yeah)
Need to know, what's going on?
(What's going on?) Can we make this house a home,
Oh (oh) Florida can I talk to you?
Can we walk and have an interview
(Every time I turn around something is going, is going down)Florida this land is overdue

Did I, did I say that he was unarmed
How could a baby cause any harm,
With no weapon insight now you know that ain’t right
All he has was his candy in hand (his skittles) candy
What about the family (his brother)
His father, sister and Manny
It's so hard to let go, what you can't control
May his soul rest in peace
But I hope and pray (I hope, I hope and pray) on judgement day
To have it all your way
And I know, I know, I know it won't bring back your baby
Sebrina and keep your head up lady
Brother Tracy be strong
For Travon,
And the worst part about is
He was only 17, didn’t even live his dream.

Ohh, (ohh) Florida something's very wrong (they didn’t have to take his life)
Need to know, what's going on?(Please tell me)
Can we make this house a home,
Oh (oh) Florida can I talk to you? (Can we march all over this land)
Can we walk and have an interview
Florida this land is overdue

So Florida don't make me cry
For I got leave your way bye bye
White sandy beaches and wind,
Where the sun doesn't' burn my skin
I talk with your first cousin Georgia
Heard what happened from the news reporter
You're surrounded by clouds, thunder and lightening sounds and now the sun is falling down

Tell me why you don't love your black babies the same
Why you be calling them out of the name?
Where the son of a judge can hold a grudge and take a life away
And be free the next day
Feels like a hurricane
The weather so strange.

Ohh, Florida something's very wrong
Need to know what's going on?
Can we make this house a home,
Oh oh Florida can I talk to you?
Can you walk and have an interview

Never ever gonna help you to figure out
Forever be a mystery what love's all about
You gotta read between the lines and see
You gotta go where no man's gone before
You gotta reach real deep inside her dreams
And that's when you'll find out what she really means",What She Really Means,2013
Jaheim,"All right
Ooo yeah yeah ooo ooo ooo

I've seen the ocean in the morning while it's calm
And I've seen a baby sleeping in his mother's arms
And I've seen couples find each other in the dark
And I see us together again, even if only in my heart
I, I've seen colors on a canvas turn to art
And I've seen people who search for answers in the stars
And I've seen days when no one talks to me but God
I can see us together again, even if only in my heart

Before the heavens open up
We might just find that we're still in love
Oh oh oh If you let me
I believe that one day you'll be back in my arms
Love I don't care how long I just keep holding on until you are
Oh oh oh If you let me
I believe that we're not over while we're apart
It might not be smart but you're still my lady if only in my heart
If only in my heart
Only in my heart
If only in my heart my heart
You're still my number 1 if only only only

I keep a photo in my wallet of us too
I keep on dreaming every dream I have is you
Keep saying I throw it away but never do
Keep wondering when did I become the shameless fool
Keep saying do you ever think of me at all
Keep praying that it's you each time when someone calls
Keep thinking why the hell is we even apart
I keep holding out hope for us, if only in my heart

Before the heavens open up we might just find that we're still in love
Oh oh oh If you let me,
I believe that one day you'll be back in my arms
Love I don't care how long I just keep holding on until you are

If only in my heart
Only in my heart

Tears on the pillow of the man that let the finest stock of diamonds slip right out of his hands.
Call me a fool.
And I don't know what to do without her here next to me
Oh no no
Whe her body use to keep me warm
I'm gonna wait everyday until you're right back in my arms

Yeah.. wife in law, my bitch for the triflin whore
Type of bitch to make a nigga get the right things for
Bitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden
Love to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen
My lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass
Slim bitch stackin like a muhfucker with a fine ass
Word to mother; bitch nasty like me
Love to fuck a nigga in places where people could see
The bitch send a chill like cold freezin a nigga
The way she holdin and bitin and suckin and squeezin a nigga
Down and dirty bitch never dick teasin a nigga
Got her own paper and focused on pleasin a nigga
She ain't out for gettin a nigga or fuckin my life
She only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin his wife
There was nuttin she couldn't achieve
In the mornin bitch was across the street waitin for wifey to leave
Called me on the cell while the wife was runnin a bath
She can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass
Just a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past
She love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last
It be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib
The bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib
Bitch I always knew ya ass was a star
In the daytime, whippin the droptop, givin me head in my car

[Chorus - Jaheim]
When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that you don't
Cuz she will fool around, just like you do
Ohh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that she won't

C'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong
And put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song
I love the little freaky shit you be approachin me on
Dick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on
The way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck
All outside busy, givin me the balcony fuck
Hold on get up off of me quick
Bitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick
So quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt
Fuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work
The bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend
And fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin again
Straigh nasty little bitch no horsin around
The bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin around
Hold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin the caper
She ain't only good for pussy, she be givin me paper
Wife-in-law, my bitch be always keepin it raw
Always slidin out before the wifey walk in the door
They way she fuck me on straight for the night
Wifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin late for tonight
Wifey actin funny style but I ain't fuckin with that
She ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at
Hmmm.. shit kinda had me buggin before
But now I laugh because wifey had a husband-in-law

How about I break all the rules
And tell you what I really been thinkin'

There's gonna be some fuckin' tonight
Take your panties off

Will bring the freak out ya
But if you eat it and don't get cheated
The first off I beat the breaks off her
No sense in half-steppin'
Get serious
Get the titties suckin' like
Clit rubbin' and ass grabbin'
I eat that pussy ass backwards

Should make the pussy cum

I can't eat I can't sleep
My knees weak makin' me keep shakin'
I need a real nigga to come save me
One who pamper me and bathe me
And make me wanna swallow his baby
Talkin' thug shit like fuck me crazy
From the back or in the butt
I'm like fuck me baby fuck me baby

I can get you wet again
Suck you fuck you better than

Gettin' rid of back spasms
And do it all without Viagra
I'll fuck you all night
Make you sleep all day
Treat you to breakfast then
Eat you for breakfast
I know baby
I'm so unselfish
But you're lovin' it besides
I'm a freak so I can't help it
All I need is old slow songs
One cold shot of patron
See you walkin' around me in a thong
And it'll be over before the chorus come back on
You'll be leaving and I'll be ab libin'
And we'll be singin' our damn song
It's like the first time we made each other cum
We'll be suckin' and fuck each other
Taste each other cum
No soul alive can erase what we done
All our horny sticky memories you are stuck to me permanently

Jahkoy,"Girl, what part of life can I avoid the pain
To free my heart and let my mind astray
This feeling that I feel is hard to trace
It takes my soul right into outerspace
So lost but almost found in misbelief
The tenderness of being in between
An ego that I force myself to feed
Ignoring what I want for what I need
I wanna emphasize on your blessings
Loving you in your sections
Doing full time when I check in

Yeah

Tempted by feelings that feel so familiar, uh
Blinded by love and all of the above
Taking by wishes with no permission permitted
I hate that my lifestyle has caused you to think that I'm not committed
The more that I say I don't want it, I know that I need it
You take it away and let me do all the fiening
You know how much I crave you
You know how much I hate to
But you give me that discipline then put some cinnamon on it
Girl damn you're so sweet to me
Do what you wanna
I could kiss on your feet you got all of the heat on me
Your winning me over
I hate being sober just doesn't feel the same anymore
It's felt in my vein I'm so over the games
But there's no one to blame anymore

If you could tell me now, baby tell me what it is
I been looking for an answer, yeah
You done put me through the test, we couldn't be just friends
Got me thinking about the masses
How far could we take it if we lifted off
Would you hold me down when things start to pick up
So far left I would hope to get it right this time
Hate to think I barely ever cross your mind
But I think about it way too much
How you gone get fucked up and tell me it's nothing
Inside it kills tell me how it feel when you really can't feel nothing
Stuck on my words why does it hurt
Every time I say something 
Sometimes it hit so hard you aim to be numb, but

If it doesn't feel the same anymore 
It's all on me, it's all on me
There's no one to blame anymore
And it's all on me
It's all on me

God damn girl, got got god damn girl
Use your angel wings, no hands girl

Go ham in the Lam' girl
You know skirt skirt
And if you skirt skirt
Give me work work

Legs open like pearly gates in a thug mansion
Get a thug passion
Without Alize
Bow down to pray
I burn an ounce a day
Puff puff pass
No rosaries like Catholics
Might cop the rolls, just to crash it
You could rock the rollie while I hit it
Hey you could rock the rollie while I hit it

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Jahmal,"What I want is the cream of the crop,
Just what every man's vying for.
But them weaker men, knowing nothing but less,
Who don't see what you are is more.

They know that it's money they got,
'cause this money don't come for cheap.
Like them other girls, who go giving it up,
Thinking what they got gon' get them hearts.

But you, your purity, and your mind, so enlightened, so high,
That you're out of their league.
But you should know, leave them boys with their toys.
Here's a man who can see.

He don't make much of you honey,
But you're beautiful to me.
They don't make much of you darling,
But to me you are a queen.

He don't make much of you honey,
But you're beautiful to me.
They don't make much of you darling,
But to me you are a queen.

I can see them wondering,
What is it about you this man loves?
Break the diamonds out of their cases,
I know this one is the real one because

She's got sugar on the inside,
Honey so sweet that money can't buy.
She's got sugar on the inside,
Loving so deep it never runs dry.

She's got sugar on the inside,
Honey so sweet that money can't buy.

Once again I'm alone 
Facing problems on my own 
All alone, I don't know what I've done 
The pressure just keep on tumbling down

No matter the crisis we'll be alright 
Keeping our goals in sight 
Though the Eden's gight 
Who is our shield and our protector

Fear for your life from prejudice and stereotype
we're all alike, smoke, drink, cuss, fight, all in a night
Yeah right!
It's killers in the mist who share pipes and wear tights
There's healers in the mist who bear light and wear white
There's Jesus in the mist, there's demons in the mist
There's even them rowdy 'Gorillas In The Mist'
Why ya minds so milli, see'mon brethren don't be silly
Ghetto red hot and chilly, and the burnin' inner cities
Ya best might sta', miner 'a flash ya light'a
Mind the 'S' or one night snipers gon' dim out ya life, cha'!

before the youth should realise and raise up, and start to blast!

Would mean, so much
What a difference and we walk hand in hand

Jai,"I'm free from sin
I win! I win!
I'm free! I'm free!
And no more chains are holding me!
I'm free from death
Got power now
Me kill the flesh
I'm free! I'm free!
(tell the world) I'm gone
I'm gone!

I know when you hear this beat it sound like something to step with
But morals and music you want them separate
Like garnish on the side something ya'll don't mess with
That christo-centric rap electric
You might like rap that's wild and wreckless
A soap box for lots young and restless
They got ya head bobbin til ya lose ya necklace
Or betta yet bobbin til it leaves you neck less
You know where death is, where no more breath is and 
3rd graders learn how to leave you chestless
Where god is dissed, dismissed and distant and far 
From their hearts cause they hard and wicked
Sin hates god for real
That's he's rarely talked about and he don't get the mass appeal
You might see sin sharin' a meal that it eats while 
It cheats on the spouse out seeking a thrill

They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds
She came to see him he hopin' to see her
They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either
And over god they choose to feed they fever
See he don't understand that it's christ who bled for
Every second glance every turn of his head yo
And she don't really get that
Jesus did that
For every time she fantasize about his six pack
They sure like al b
To connect like his brows be
And with they bodies spit in god's face so foully
Sin so
Bad it's a liar
It's says we on the throne tells god to retire
It's says he ain't enough
And it says we want more
Is says he ain't just and it says he ain't lord
Sin is the laugh at his power
Rape of his mercy
Mock of his patience
It say he ain't worthy

I been duped and been schemed
Like the lord was cool with my sinning
Mocking the cross living unrepented
My sinful life kept us so
Distant
I know lord and been king
Let him run your life like a
Simmons
Then you'll start loving his righteousness and we start
Looking just like his kids

Live free by his mercy and grace
Live free by his mercy and grace and tell the world I'm gone
Live free by his patience and peace
Live free by his patience and peace and tell the flesh I'm gone
Live free by his joy and love
Live free by his joy and love and tell the lust I'm gone
Live free by his truth and just
Live free by his truth and just and tell the hate I'm gone",Live Free,2008

Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds.
And you knew how I loved you but my spirit was free,
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me.
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to, do you know?

We let so many dreams just slip through our hands.

Jealousy attracts to who's bank's the heaviest/

Plain tired of the bullshit and so confused/
Then i'm noticing mom's barely ever at home/
So I'm wit Denise's family more than my own/
And rest in peace Robert, it's a shame that you're gone'/
The father I never had, If I needed, you had it/
Got on me about school and how I needed my ass kicked/

I was one of the less fortunate growing up/
Getting teased 'cause I ain't have the Nike's or Chucks/
Watchin' the other shorty's chase the ice cream trucks/
No older siblings so I was always getting beat up/
When I was hungry there wasn't much that we could eat up/
Turn on the kitchen light you see cockroach legs/
Scared to eat the noodles 'cause of cockroach eggs/
All my pants just long enough to cover my legs/
Livin' wit 9 heads, just a couple of beds/
The kid in the school that you'd tease alot/
Jean shorts in December so I freeze alot/
The worse haircut and the littlest kid/
And everytime I got a Sega fiends broke in the crib/
Maybe girls didn't like I had no game/
Maybe bullies didn't like I had the brains/
Whoever came to the crib I would ask for change/

And the cold got my lips bout to crack up/
I wish I could back up and change this life/
A trust fund and a home woulda made this right/
Probably not, watchin' mufuckas chase the pipe/
And at night crackfiends come and take my bike/
So in elementary the 1st B to the face/
Then I started getting high like Ko-be from the base/
Using old milk crates for our B Ball hoops/
Getting clowned 'cause I was wearing Bugle Boy's wit boots/
No luxury or loot, just a couple of dreams/
Where to start? 5 shirts and a couple of jeans/
Me and my guys on a scheme 'cause that's all we knew/

Then it went from my heart from my brain to the track/

6 years no home, how the pain popped up/

No ponchos, umbrellas, or evasions/
No equations- most of my middle school/
Kept writing music- Never was a little fool/
Never can you ridicule- me or humiliate/
Circle of a sucka, pimpin' never I'll affiliate/
Vocabulary fine- I ain't even graduate/
Indicted 17- and had to emancipate/
Went and got my GED, but don't think it's good enough/
7 felonies damn- tell me that ain't hood enough/
Screw that silly ish- cause I really wish/
That I went to college where the women is the prettiest/
But I hung with idiots/
Mistakes what they really is/

Mama money grow on trees now, my hustle the roots is

Know you're tired of the lies
They said rap died, but ima make it revive
August 85 fell a star from the sky
Im tryna make it, I ain't tryna make it by

Half these cat's can't even see me, and they ain't even blind
Know ima be a mogul and I ain't even signed
Sayin I ain't gone shine, can't hear it, you're a mime
Nevermind your piece of mind, i'm blowin' up-no mine
Seeing gold, no mine
Cause i'm going for mine and- Hip Hop a jungle-
The microphone is the vine and- it without me you're probably missing the Li-on
Cause I am the truth, you're probably missin' the lying
I am- what the game's missing like the 3rd string
So hip hop' gonna inherit me like a birth gene
Don't feel right being broke like your 1st sling
So these haters lips flap more than a bird wing
Any obstacle you bring- I'll overcome it
That star that you wish on, im gonna become it

The race for the Pioneer face, think I won it

RIP Magic, died in someone else hands
I can see through- these cats that's seafood
Can't understand these shrimps, they speakin in Hebrew
Everything I say cold, I'm speaking in Igloo
Pull my mirror out like ""they don't need to believe you""
These cat's is D2- I'm in a different league
That's why I don't show no fatigue when I breathe dude
I'm just just tryna breeze through- this lil' rap game
While these informants'll remember ya last name
I'm just tryna ""act"" sane- crazy bout the crack game
Cause when the cash came- I was in the fast lane
Cheverlot heavy yay- make the gas the gas drain
Dodged so many snakes- my shirt got grass stains
Relax mane, why u so uptight?
Got my vision at the stars, sitting so upright

I'm fed up I can't get my meals super sized
Wish for a bluer sky
Switched to a new attire
Said this beat reminded me of Kanye Through the Wire
Who am I? Magic In Your Eyes
Like Dwight Howard
5""7 but i'm feeling quite taller
Shawty that like ballers
Tell her that I might call her
Job's not white collar
Doing dirt like nightcrawlers
And all my guts doin' life in the squalor-
Thanks for the light- to my sight -to my power
I'll shoot u a kite when the time get right- and them cats I disliked- don't slip in the shower
I was flipping powder- mother wasn't proud of-
Me- said you'll get booked- why'd I have to doubt her
Fat lady singing, every note get louder

Jai Winding,"During the time of which I speak it was hard to turn the other cheek
To the blows of insecurity
Feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected
Lay dying in the strength of its impurity
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
They've all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery

There I am in younger days, star gazing
Painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be
Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection
My compass, faith in love's perfection
I missed ten million miles of road I should have seen
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
Left each other one by one along the road of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recovery

Rain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream
I search for our absolute distinction
Not content to bow and bend
To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures
Eating us away, eating us away
Eating us away to our extinction
Oh how I wish I were a trinity, so if I lost a part of me
I'd still have two of the same to live
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust we're universal
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift that we could give
Tell all the friends who think they're so together
That these are ghosts and mirages, all these thoughts of fairer weather
Though it's storming out I feel safe within the arms of love's discovery",Love's Recovery,1989

No como, no duermo, no vivo, pensando en su amor
Siempre creí que los celos, eran un cuento
y son el infierno, que arde sin control

Que también a mi me robaría la razón

A medias pero mio, mio, mio
Para siempre mio
Ni te le acerques es mio

Jailhouse,"I thought of how we shared
And how we used to be
I can’t believe
You turned your back to me
Don’t write me off 
'Til I’ve had my say
I built a wall
With my foolish pride
I couldn’t tell you
How I felt inside
Like December
Time slipped away

Now I would do anything
To still hear that you still care
Yeah, I’m willing to bet
Oh lord, I’m willing to pray

Sweet, sweet angel
Take me with you
Won’t you spend the night
Sweet, sweet angel
Take me with you
Find me, see the light

Got nothing to lose
So I’ll lay it on the line
To err is human
To forgive is divine
Just give me the chance
And I’ll forever invest
In the siren song
I learned my lesson
So it wasn’t all in vain
And now I know why 
All the wise men say
You never know what you’ve got
Until it’s gone

Now you won’t get away
Oh no
I won’t let you go again

Yes I know
Now I know
I know that you’re heaven sent
Sweet, sweet angel
Take me with you
Won’t you spend the night
Sweet, sweet angel
Take me with you
Find me, see the light

I’m holding on girl
You need to spread your wings and fly
I pray that you’ll catch me
Oh angel, I’ve fallen for you

Sweet, sweet angel
Take me with you
Won’t you spend the night
Sweet, sweet angel
Take me with you
Find me, see the light",Sweet Angel,1998
Jailhouse,"You kissed your loved one goodbye
On a cold foggy day
I guess you didn’t know
That I’d go so far away
At 1:45
We cried on a runway
I’m not leaving home forever
Only several days

So take my heart
I’ve already taken yours
This bruise won’t heal

I’m alone and cold inside
Is there a moment we haven’t shared
Two hearts drawn as one
Now sit on an empty chair
You said to me last night
I’ll be waiting for your kiss
Now I lie here and cry
As I dream all the things I’ve missed

So take my heart
I’ve already taken yours
This bruise won’t heal

Tell me
Do you miss me
Like I miss you girl
Hold me in your heart
I’ll never be lost again
Tell me
Do you miss me 
Like I miss you girl
Hold me in your heart
I’ll never be lost again

Distance keeps burning 
Inside of me
I need you to wake me
Oh girl tell me

You kissed your loved one goodbye
On a cold foggy day
Guess she didn’t know
That I’d go so far away

Tell me
Do you miss me 
Like I miss you girl
Hold me in your heart
Tell me
Do you miss me 
Like I miss you girl
Hold me in your heart
In your heart
Why can’t you

Tell me
You know I never meant 
To let you down girl
Hold me in your heart
I’ve already taken yours

Would you tell me
Do you miss me
Do you miss me like I miss you girl
I’ll never

I'm representing motherfucking Thugline nigga (1999)
Motherfuckers want to find the real thugs and hustlers, nigga (fucking bitches)
Come to the motherfucking ghetto where we from nigga
Now where the real thugs?

This is how we living these days [x8]
(And this is for my gangster, gangster, gangster)
(And that one's for my thugster, thugster, thugster)

[Krayzie Bone]
Nigga these days we killing much quicker to get us some paper, ya feeling me?
These days you got to be packing a gun everybody your enemy
These days it's every nigga for they self
Cause it ain't no such thing as friends
And well, so nice niggaz get left
And that's cause these days you got to be raw out here on the streets
Tell 'em these days you can't be fucking with niggaz that's weak
And these days no telling when you'll meet your coffin
I seen it too often that's why fuck flossing; I take caution
Don't trip, shit if your rich your rich
Cause if you slip somebody waiting to get
At you grab ya cash and split ya shit
These days stay in the low low and away from po-po
Unless you ready to pull your fo' fo' and blow (OH!)
How come these days niggaz want to be the don of the mob?
They claim it but they never qualify for the job
These days we busting at motherfuckers quicker
Simply 'cause its 1999 nigga (nigga nigga nigga)

[Chorus]

[K-Mont]
Ay yo I'm straight out of the bricks and y'all ain't worthy to serve me
I'm the type that jump out your bushes and bust you with a 30, 30
You want beef? I pack pistol packing utilities
I'm the type of nigga that'll send letter bombs to all my enemies
I can't even walk the airport for being who I was
Police all on my dick because they recognize a thug
Nigga we trying to get money, we don't respect the police
Until us thugs unite it ain't gon' never be no peace
Niggaz be going to school with nothing but murder on they minds
Giving a fuck about teachers busting shot guns and nines
Picture the scenes and screams and everybody running
Get on your knees and pray nigga cause the son of the lord is coming

[Asu]
You know what came in time that's my frame of mind
Now I'm able to separate the deaf from the weak, dumb and the blind
Niggaz can't get none of mine, not even some of mine
Just cause you got on a watch nigga don't mean you know the time
You stagnating, you fags hating my motion
From ocean to ocean my magic potion is devotion
The nerve to hate what I deserve to do wasn't a curse it was a signal
That's why that ass crashed for got to put on your blinker
R-W-I: rolling while infatuated
I graduated, now I want my master
Y'all done agitated disaster
And at every ends I start I slip in the art with my heart and soul
And start to roll but dumb to come
Don't become the one I fold like the lawn chair
You shouldn't have gone there
What's the deal with the long stares?
What's the purpose? Jokers on earth surface to surface
And any problem is handled the same day as service (what what what what)

[Chorus]

[Bam]
We run the blocks stop the clocks turning rocks and dice
Set trip it's our spot gave y'all shots and let the drama pop
Don't escalate the 4-5-9 just try me dead or alive
Point of survival let's get points with real niggaz lives
But you only see raw meat on streets; these niggaz love their heat
Nowadays all busters want to thug like me you see it be
Wasn't way so simple execution style pull the gristle
From the chair heard 'em whistle for my nigga mental
It's money, murder, riding dumping heads back to all of y'all
Since every nigga's all hard and proving they got the bigger balls
Scared of the laws told what he saw and what it looked like
Broke him off in the midnight I spared his life I said this shit is tight

Call me the boos fighter, Frontline rider
Leathaface'll catch a case up in this place, we'll show 'em who bout it, bout
it
How the dealer stole and cut it, police won't even touch it
I'm a rich nigga come to my show and bring your bitch wit'cha
Two Thousand niggaz all screamin out loud ""fuck the law""
And all y'all niggaz mean muggin me and my niggaz is my car
Partna don't get me started
y'all niggaz ain't seen me get retarted in that mode I'm harmless
When her bare arms we far from harmless
This is the bomb shit so ring the alarm
Takin over the yard, nigga Thugline's in charge
On guard a new clique, and we got new shit
These niggaz ain't nobody you want to fool with either, so be cool with it
Then niggaz won't have any problems
357 revolver is all it takes to squash an solve 'em
We all in this business to get paid
But meanwhile, we gotta go fight off the enemies that hate us for these styles
Made us some cheese, now fuck the world
Tell 'em Krayzie said it, will I ever switch?
Get out the thug shit? nigga forget it
I'm real with these niggaz, I chill with these niggaz
I kill for these niggaz, cause these my niggaz...

[Outro]
That's right nigga, just do y'all niggaz know y'all fuckin with

Jaime Camil,"Tan sediento, tan vacio
Tan inmenso es este frio sin ti
Tan desierto, tan perdido
Tan incierto se me a vuelto vivir

Rompen en la noche tus recuerdos
Como lagrimas de hielo en mi sufrir
Y vuelve alzar el vuelo, el veneno de este anhelo
Por tenerte al despertar, y poder una vez mas amarte

Dime
Que puedo hacer con esta vida
Que solo existe la medida de tu piel y mi piel
Solo dime

Cual fue mi error para perderte
Estoy muriendo por no verte
Y no se respirar
Si no puedo tenerte una vez mas

Rompen en la noche tus recuerdos
Como lagrimas de hielo en mi sufrir
Y vuelve alzar el vuelo, el veneno de este anhelo
Por tenerte al despertar, y poder una vez mas amarte

Dime
Que puedo hacer con esta vida
Que solo existe la medida de tu piel y mi piel
Solo dime

Cual fue mi error para perderte
Estoy muriendo por no verte
Y no se respirar
Si no puedo tenerte una vez mas

Dime
Que puedo hacer con esta vida
Que solo existe la medida de tu piel y mi piel
Solo dime, solo dime, solo dime, y no se respirar

Oh, oh, dime
Que puedo hacer con esta vida
Que solo existe la medida de tu piel y mi piel
Solo dime

Y no se respirar
Solo dime, solo dime

Jaime Camil,"Como detienes un remolino
Y esquivas cada trampa del destino
Como conviertes en cruz las pesadillas
Y pones a tus miedos de rodillas
Como es que vuelas aun contra corriente
Y brillas única entre tanta gente
Mi amor te sigue veloz como el sonido
Despierta el sueño que creí perdido
Es muy difícil de explicar, tuve que vivir
En otra piel para saber que eres mi lugar.

Porque por ella soy eva, cada paso es una prueba
Este corazón se eleva y ya no quiere aterrizar
Porque por ella soy eva, cruzo el límite del viento
Crees inmenso lo que siento y tengo un buen
Presentimiento sé que pronto me amaras.

Y que el pasado no es irrelevante
Que la distancia es un error gigante
Y dame un beso que cause un terremoto
Dibuja puentes en mi cielo roto
Quiero tatuarme tus huellas digitales
Desordenar los puntos cardinales
Ganarle al tiempo seguir tus huellas
Beber de golpe todas las estrellas
Es muy difícil de explicar, tuve que vivir
En otra piel para saber que eres mi lugar.

Porque por ella soy eva, cada paso es una prueba,
Este corazón se eleva y ya no quiere aterrizar
Porque por ella soy eva, cruzo el límite del viento
Crees inmenso lo que siento y tengo un buen
Presentimiento sé que pronto me amaras.

Sé que no lo imagine, este amor es todo lo que soy y seré
No hay antes ni después

Porque por ella soy eva, cada paso es una prueba
Este corazón se eleva y ya no quiere aterrizar
Porque por ella soy eva, cruzo el límite del viento
Crees inmenso lo que siento y tengo un buen
Presentimiento sé que pronto me amaras.

Porque por ella soy eva, cruzo el límite del viento
Crees inmenso lo que siento y tengo un buen
Presentimiento sé que pronto me amaras.

Yo sé que
Yo sé que
Yo sé que
Pronto me amaras.",Por Ella... Soy Eva,2012
