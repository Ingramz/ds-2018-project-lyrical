Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now
Don't return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds
I will show you a game where the winner never wins

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Lock away your childhood and throw away the key
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger
Child, you're a woman now, your heart and soul are free
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Your darkened eyes throw mystery
But your lips are void of history
You could not imagine that it could happen this way, could you
I will give you dreams and I'll tell you things you'll like to hear

Let your hair hang down, wear the dress your mother wore
Let me sleep beside you

Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last

You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathing in the city's aqueduct

Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries

Or a decent job or a helping hand
Wherever somebody's struggling to be free

Lying side by side
Used up empty bottles
Remembering long lost wine

Keep our empty bottles
Making empty wine
Marking our intentions
Sadly out of time

And the summer make you lazy
A day at a time
And good company evades you
Passing you by

But I do love you against all odds
Though you don't know what I want
We're much poorer than that bottle
More foolish than that wine

Maybe we can make it
Though we failed before
You keep getting closer
Closer to me once more

And I'll try to entertain you
A day at a time
Try to make myself much clearer

Why lloro porque no te tengo, ya no siento mas
Dime hasta cuando, tengo que esperar porque me siento bien
(Frio), siento un frio que mata why , (Solo), sigo pensando en mi gata
Quiero besarte la boca, lo que me arrebata
Quiero que sepas que como tu nadie se empata
(Y aqui solo me siento frio) si ya lose que el hombre que tu amas soy yo
Why solo (Tu why yo) uy (Haciendolo) si ya lose

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2009

Im nächsten Sommer alles anderthalb:
I'm on my rooftop screaming
Und das hält mich zusammen
And my heart's still beating
Und irgendwer singt leise

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep für days
Und davon bin ich aufgewacht
Aus meinem Traum von Stillstand letzte Nacht",Anderthalb Sommer,2013

Lief uns Zuckerwasser über's Gesicht.
Wir waren das Gegenteil von traurig.
Wir übten den geheimen Handschlag 
Und egal wie's lief, wir blieben in Sicht.
Das war wie „Kitt komm schnell,ich brauch' dich!“

„Verlier die Jugend bloß nicht beim Erwachsenwerden.“
Weil das schon von allein passiert

You're saying that I hide behind 
A wall I'm frontin
And you just want to get through
But what happens when the honeymoon ends
Then you take back all the promises spoken, spoken
But I want to love you I got a wall to breakthrough
And then you leave I'm in too deep to surface again
But what happens when the honeymoon ends

I wanna let you in but I'm so guarded

I'm guarded so guarded

How will I know that you will always be true

I played all or nothing and I kept losing
You said you don't play catch me and then walk away
No more crying and lying and misusing

I need you I want you. You make me cry all the time
What?s the deal with me I know I should know better?
It?s not a fairytale ending happy ending together
I tell my self I got to pull myself through this
Just handle it all push all the pain to me and move it 
You were the love of my life not just a memory getting back together that?s just what I wish for thinking.....

I?d tried to keep her posted it

And I can?t testify cause I ain't got a really feel
But if you ask me to girl 
Let's make it a deal 
So let?s just get the cash and headed for the hills

It's just a tragic story about a young girl
I wanna tell you how she fell

Hollywood girl
Picture in a crowed place
Such a beautiful world
Perfect body with a perfect face

She wanted more yes, she had a dream
She had to be the star on the magazine
She took a turn for the worst
To satisfy her needs. Oh yeah

Chorus
Girl, keep your feet up on solid land
So easy to sink quickly deep into quicksand
Girl, keep on running just as fast as you can
I'm sinking in the quicksand

She signed to a model agency
Said you gotta to get lean
So she worked out her heart and didn?t eat anything
She took her pills, her alcohol
Numbing her mind and feeling nothing at all... But

She wanted more yes, she had a dream
She had to be the star on a magazine
She took a turn for the worst
To satisfy needs
Oh baby what does that mean


Chorus [x2]
Girl, keep your feet up on solid land
So easy to sink quickly deep into quicksand
Girl, keep on running just as fast as you can
I'm sinking in the quicksand

Warning like the room was spinning out of control
To the deep into a demon she was loosing her soul
Her body too thin to pick herself off the floor
They rushed her to emergency
Thank God they gotta her before

It was over in vain in the name of fame
She will never be the same
And the time for a change
She said save me (save me)
Oh ohh... I'm sinking (sinking)
In the quicksand

Chorus [x2]
Girl, keep your feet up on solid land
So easy to sink quickly deep into quicksand
Girl, keep on running just as fast as you can
I'm sinking in the quicksand

Constantly trippin'
Always seems to be grippin'

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.

""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

What a dunce I was before.
What a break!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Lifted out like vine motion I spend time stroking

But now my rhymes open brims a spirituality 
We be giving power that you can share with your family 
Aerodynamically cutting through danger 
Ripping your narrow mentality nothing but flavor

Tuna fish on a Marc seven collision 
We be forever keeping niggas on they P's and Q's 
And the be's who snooze leave diseased and bruised

And gamma rayed your function 
Left you with assumption

Okay, let's begin

Compound, a substance composed
Of two or more elements
Chemically combined
In definite proportions by weight

Mixtures, two or more substances
That are not chemically united such as air
Solution, a uniform mixture of varying proportions
Of a solvent and a solute

For many of our students
This is the lesson you've been waiting for
Lesson 6
Left channel, right channel

Hydrogen, H plus one
Sodium, Na plus one
Magnesium, Mg plus two

Aluminum, Al plus three
Potassium, K plus one
Calcium, Ca plus two
Chromium, Cr plus two, three, six

Any physical difficulty
With a record or a turntable
Is taken care of

Do you think that Led Zeppelin
And Frank Sinatra would go together?
Edit, no combinations of music

You're about to play a soul, 45 rpm recording
But the turntable is set at 33 and 1/3
And the record plays very slowly
Let's pick up the tempo a bit, eh?

Now, let us imagine
That you are in the middle
Of your disk jockey program
This is the mark of a professional

Yeah, if you could throw a couple yeah, uuh
Right, when he's playin' the drum, you know
Let him play a couple beats alone, euh

Uh, oh, I'm sorry I had the turntable at the wrong speed
Aah, listen to this, scratchin', the greatest thing on earth
What do you do? What do you do?
Toggle, wow, drop

Chemical change, a change that alters
The composition of the molecules of a substance
New substances with new properties are produced
Drop

From now until your next lesson
We want you to study carefully every section
Of lesson 6 and to go back over lesson 4

Practice carefully, and you will be ready
For the new techniques and new situations
We will cover together in lesson 5
",Lesson 6: The Lecture,1998
Jurassic 5,"This is the highest quality pressing in the industry
The entire album is manufactured in our own plant
So we know what is happening from the very start
To the second we mail the records to your listeners

Naturally we want to sell the most albums possible
But we also believe it is of utmost importance to establish you
And us together as producers of the highest quality product
And obviously if the campaign proves successful
You will no doubt want to repeat with volume three at a later date
We will be in contact with you in a few days

Jurassic 5,"[Chorus: x2]
It's the J you are A 
Capital S another S I see 
Five MC's in the flesh 
Bound to catch wreck 
Hit the deck 
'Cause we'll pop the trunk 
Plus the tape on your cassette 

I'm from the crew called Jurassic 
Stretch like elastic 
Live and on plastic 
Step and get that ass kicked 
From here to there 
MC's beware 
I represent that real ghetto urban warfare 
Ah yeah 
What you say when you see me in your town 
Bucking off some rounds 
Of that underground sound 
You need to open your eyes 
Realize and recognize 
Throw your hands in the air lick a shot for J5 
I'm all the way live 
I socialize with the wise 
Underprivileged spiritually deprived 
At times in the flesh 
Airwaves getting checked 
The vibe is energized by the way I spit my dialect 

I be the brain cell buster 
Old school style kicking hustler 
That'll rush ya like a wrestler 
Elliot Ness ya 
Bow to my pressure 
Step to J5 you're getting played like Fester 
I be the ever handy 
Hard like rock candy 
Down with Mork and Mandy 
Won't date Sandy brown eyes 
Tale of the physical trait 
Intoxicated by the bomb as I start to sedate 
Your mainframe 
All speaking on running this thang 
Five J's in the house and the styles to blame 

[Chorus]

They call me 2-na 
As in Fish in sea 
Self efficiency 
That's my mission see 
Got me wishing we all 
Could've puffed a spliff first 
Shoot the giff first 
And 2-na Fish becomes a gift horse 
Look me in the mouth 
Tell me what you see 
No matter who I am 
I am you as you see me 

You is still Nity 
COM squared and shit 
I was put here to see if you came prepared and shit 
I'm red as shit 
My head is split from every crazy 
Lazy kid we thought was chill 
They was Swayze 
Soon as they got a taste 
Of what the you-N-I was like 
Their eyes was like BLAM 
From the surprise and fright 

Now it's the vocal enhancement 
Vintage reigning rocks 
A hundred mines swing 
Dig a few chains of black gold 
Plus block the seven holes that froze 
A nigga soul and bust blood through his toes 
For acting like his shit was mega heavy weight 
But he couldn't escape 
The way we wet him down like it was Watergate 
Infiltrate flavor crack skull and stone 
Rip through the carcass spit blood and bone 
For all those 
Who feel their crews forever tight knitted 
When raps emitted 
Islamicly transmitted 
Is the brother a color 
Yes the color's darkly tinted 
No acts or gimmicks 
And when the bullets imprinted it's whipped 
It hibernates till it stretch the yellow tape 
For Mister Doc key is caliber career, yea 
With so many rhymes it can't a crew make me 
Rock for thirty two times like John Wayne Gacy 

You need to put your hands together 
'Cause J5 is in the house 
Because we're guaranteed to keep it live 
When we kick the party vibe 
We came to catch wreck 
We got the fossilized flavor 
For you fools who slept 
And plus we got you sucka crews in check 
Now come correct Nu-Mark 
Hit 'em with the perfect blend 
'Cause it ""don't stop rockin till I say when""

Malignant metaphors and ganja stay herbs 
We conjugate verbs and constipate nerds like you 
I'm hear to end the conspiracy, fearlessly 
So you can really see the real mc's at hand 
I'm tuna fish on the stick shift 
The eclectic hectic, desperate to set trip 

And for the niggaz who feel, that they're 24-karat 
Plus, the way you're livin' get your underwater baptism 
Believe it or not, it's the rugged and raw 
Put a bullet in the head of four in mount rushmore 

Yeah, release the beast from within, baptize gins 
Keep company with friends that repel sin 
I'm out to win ain't no pretendin', fuck the first amendment 
My speech was free, the day that my soul descended 

Earthbound, we might sound various 
Some niggaz can rhyme, but they got no character 
So we preparin' you for war, don't give up the fight 
You need to stand up for your rights 

And grab a mic and get loose, produce the juice that keeps the head on 
Collision with the new world order opposition 
Competition, none, there's only one in the universe 
That knows the final outcome 

We got incarcerated minds, men women and enzymes 
Vibin off the rhymes sent from the di-vine essence 
Presence effervescence, not to be contested 
Some miss the message, go ahead and bless this 

So don't mistake us for a crew that used to hit 
We on some underground certified wild style shit 

We be the crew, guess who, and it'll be 
The jayou, ninety-five a.d.

We keep it heated like stones in Hell's Kitchen 
MC's are wishing that they had a pot to piss in 

Akil is on a mission to smash the competition 
I whip my opposition with words into a sentence 
And combat your verbal attacks with no assistance 
I'm too consistent for you brothers to keep bitching 
Pay close attention to my verbal composition 
I keep it distant like my love for the business 
You ask ""What is this? Is it real or fictitious?"" 
I kill the wise and intelligent rebels with precision 

It's a true conspiracy, battle for world supremacy 
Huh, send me brothers they maybe try to contend with me 
But me and my staff soon shine like a perfect half moon 
And get you open like a public bathroom, paragraph doom

No commission keeping it different for my listeners 
Taking no prisoners, sealing perimeters 
Never singular, giving you something that you remember

How you figure that you can disrespect my art?

And it's the outlaw about to rock y'all, now watch my hands go 
Over the nickle full black tainted pearl handle 
And watch it ricochet, captivate the airwaves 
Hit you with the ever blade connected with the wordplay 
Mister Pro-fessional with the clever flows 
Hear it on your radio, Donnie Brasco 
With the defness, and the ways of the West 
Represent the flavor breathless

Peep the verbal language and the way we arranged it
Now entertainment to make the people applaud

I can say it's partly, all our faults smarty
J5'll bring you more than the shakin' of a body

Ay yo a child is born but no state of mind
But when I first heard it, put words to rhymes
I went from hyper cars, to powder blue All-Stars
To hangin' on monkey bars catchin' spiders in jelly jars

The summer hit, had it burnin' in eighty-six
Class cuttin' and runnin' wit all the neighborhood derelicts

Uh, we never fumble, break down or stumble
Hot mumbo jumbo, just bring it when we rumble

We push it like the Daytona
Fresh rhymes we blaze on Yas
Strictly from California old school public diplomas

Jurassic 5,"Yea yea yea yea, oh yea
It's the late night hype mack be dog in the house
Chillin, like a big ol pimp
Right about now, at 3:01 in the morning
Everything else on is probably pretty faulty and repetitive
So if you're goin through your radio
When you get down to that, you know, far left hand side
Keep it tuned to mack be dog, 'cause you know
I'm keepin it extra extra funky
Know what I'm sayin?

Concentration, concentration is the name
Keep the rhythm
Or you will be out the game

We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters

So lateef [wassup? ]
Let your lyrics heat-seek [all right]
And yo, get on the mic and fuck the microphone technique [here we go now]

Look what we've got
Akil, lateef and mark 7 deliverin the presences
J 5 quannum
Zakir, gab, lyrics born natural as the elements
I jump down and customize
My lyrics to synchronize
And educate the young, dumb, deaf, and blind
And drop a seed in they minds, so they can open their eyes
Realize and recognize we livin in the last times

I pull a spark of shining light out of the glorious fate
Create the lyric arsenals that verbal warriors make
Escape hell temporarily
Merrily vibes carry me to heavenly states
Inevitably rockin steadily

Yea, I represent the underground mc
Even though I move around I'm still down with mc's
Now pound for pound I go the round
I is down, as you see (? ? ? )
I'm from the group, jayou, the j 5 mc's, yea

[chorus]

Oh god, it's so re-al, and then ya, it's ser-I-al
Flowin, like soy milk, over sweetened cer-e-al
Y'all melt, like toys built from cheap material
Reevaluate yourself, it ain't about the here and now

I hold it def for 6
Blazed my way up out an orphanage
Assertive it, poetic scripts blast murderous
The earth shaker, I crack a nigga out his windbreaker
The verbalier, rhythmatic fly commentator

Yo, now if you stumble on a phonograph
To listen to the flavas that you got to have
With lyrics that be perfectly handcraft
All the way from the bay to l.a.
We're tryin to give you all different points of view
To show you our poetic words that we use
From the mc's that you're bound to choose
All the way from the bay to l.a.
[scratching]

[chorus]

Look what we've got
Akil, lyrics born, zakir, gift of gab
Lateef, mark 7, chali, cut chemist, nu-mark
Xl, and dj-shadow

The rhyme ambassador that mastered the ceremony
So passengers fasten up these average cats'll never catch up

Yeah I hot dog the ball behind the yes yes y'all
Fuck hanging on the shore trying to ball ? ? ? ?

No, I don't jitterbug with lyrically idiotic litterbugs
They shit and bug the shit out of me eat em up for dinner so

We imburse to disperse, wish your last was your first bit
Consume the whole room and you wonder where the earth went

So I reduce the risk
Spit words like a journalist
And burnin it in unofficial mic tournaments

I'll play off night watchin trife 'cause we might utilize
The mic as a rightful for the eyes on the prize (? ? ? )
So try to conduct yourself in a manner that's wise
Ain't that right? right right, true, right right
Tell em why

We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters
J 5 quannum kick it live
Orth with the south, civil war with the rhymes
We bust shots like german lugers
On intruders
Violate we activate the ill-style shooters
J 5 quannum kick it live
North with the south other crews flatline

Yo, either you a part of the problem
Or part of the solution
What's your contribution to life
So many people complain, always talk about change yo
But what's your contribution to life
Either you with or ain't with it, if it ain't broke don't fix it
Yo what's your contribution to life
Either you give or you take, make moves and you wait yo
But what's your contribution to life

Your about to witness three of the most common 
Tales of man, woman and human, the difference between the three
Is that there is not difference, just other outcomes
Listen and witness the common tales

Aye yo my momma and a nigga for life
Love carousel, cuss yell and fight
Seven nights a week, no respect when they speak
Disrespect between the sheets, the ends don't meet
No rice beans or meat
My momma was the bread winner plus
She had to cook his dinner
My daddy was a full time sinner
Poppa was a stoner stay gone till November
Off of that, gawk?, that made emack
Like the devil done took his soul and ain't given it back
Remember that, when you play for the bless
Speedy victory for the poor and the press 
I can't stand the stress, its test and time press
Up against my momma and daddy chest, I try and rest
With no stretch of the mind, I can't find no piece
Of mind within this family of mine, yo

[Marc 7even]
She got chips and you don't, that's bottom line
That's just the way love goes, lets rewind 
You really ain't paid, you clocking minimum wage
Now basically you a slave, your wife studies for days
No money for much, just movies and such
The way your two hands clutch, you know its love not lust
Now she's sick of the bus, and using you as a crutch
And on top of this stuff, she graduates in a month
Damn, her new job got her clocking the dough
Now she's buying new clothes, and taken you to the show
You feeling like you the ho, not knowing which way to go
And ultimately you know, you ain't feeling her so
You need to get up, get out and get something
Your job ain't nothing, all these years you've just been frontin
That's the way she played ya, the talked in rager went back
To your days of

[Chali 2na]
She always said I'm out husslin for food, kitchen indeed
While this nigga spend his ends on booze, bitches and weed
I thought that we'd agree, with two kids to feed
That you would slow your own, but instead of switching your seed
You slapped me, you can't attack me thinking I'm be happy
In fact its a packing and we rapidly
After we witness, no love between parents
The father type that was once on the sense vanished
Supreme bamish the couples that match these
Producing generations of kids with latched keys
Her daughter learned from momma
How to reject men, her sons attracts women
That don't respect men, and then
One parental provided can be the plan
But no woman can truly teach a boy to be a man
That's why I'm always telling these many pals of mine
The most that you can spend on any child is time

Look we don't have all the answers, we're victims also
To the same situations, but man, plans and the lord plans
And the lord is the best of planners, 
So what's your contribution to life

I said shut up!
Now are you ready to play the game?
No!
Are you ready to play the game?
Yeah!

The Game
Playing to survive
Aiming to win anyway they can

Yo, yo
Pass the ball, final casting call
First of all, verbal basketball
Off the glass, smash your jaw
Too fast for y'all
You might take a nasty fall
Trying to stick with the prehistoric passenger
(Foul Ball)
All breath, no physical contact
Bounce back, demonstrate invincible bomb raps
Not no hustler no player or speakin no crime crap
I'm vocally trying to score before my time lapse

Uh! Full court press, hands in your chest
Runnin' cause I'm a rebel with the ghetto 
No fouls just checks, make a brother sweat
Word for y'all to earn my reject
Get it out of here, attack from the rear
Y'all niggas ain't nothing but some bitch ass queers
I'll be in your ear, increase the fear
Ripping with the shears as the crowd just cheers

Bring on the opposition
Cause my position is to shut you down
As the basketball pounds on the concrete floor
Envisioning moves to freak brothers every which way
Dominating like Doc J.
Pass me the rock, I know just what to do with it
It's real vivid, I pivot, through the lane
Three hundred and sixty behind my back
I take your monkey ass to the rack like Jerry Stack

I'm saw by most recruiters and heavily recommended
Sticking your best shooters they lower verbal percentage
It's taking its toll, 24-second clock control
Stopping this obstacle, impossible
I was the number one ? project in the city
Prospect, now that's something that you can believe
So be it, whether pro or collegiate, the hit but don't miss
Prime time the offense, switch

Y'all can't ball, y'all can't ball
Yo ref, where's the tech? Man, make the call
The game is getting tight verbal victories in sight
What counts is what you write not concerned about the hype
My rhymes go baseline so why you trying to take mine?
Last man tried just died inside the paint line
I bank rhymes, got a call so I flex
I'm on the foul line with a few verses left
When my flow hits the net, the next brother flex

I put my foot in the pavement
With the brothers I'm raised with
Play with and break dance back in the days with
And still in the game with 12 points, 4 assists
Get up in the game, in your face like swish
Crash the boards with metaphors
In the air like a concord
Hey yo what you out for?
Yo I'm out for the whole score
22 flat seconds for me to win
I can't win for losing with this cheating ass ref

My squad's supreme
So I don't need Clyde or the dream
Next time you play the game boy pick a better team
Your choice is short when you on a concrete court
But my mental cohorts is bout to change the whole sport
Give me the pill boy, crossover with the skills
Wrap around pass, fly right past your grill
Take off from half court, in some J5 shorts
The rap band with the man when my words play sports
Comin' through your lane, with pure skills so stand clear
Vocal charge is a mirage, I still stand here
Damn near, make your shit look soft like Pam Grier
Fans cheer for the paragraph Bill Lambier

Show me the rock, so I can show these fool what I got
(He's heating up) Fuck that, I'm flaming hot
Verbally take you to the blacktop, and wreck shop
Turn my game up a notch, pass me the rock
1 on 1, 3 on 3, 5 on 5, horse, 21
It really don't matter cause son you'll still get done
Yo you should know better than try to barter with this globetrotter
Militious, vicious dunks, I'm Vince Carter
And it's the high draft pick, flashing it
Still can penetrate and slightly overweight

The past depart the present cause the future is near
Anticipation, magnified my motivation
Direct my energy to touch nations
Been entertaining since niggas was really banging
Dancing at the old folks parties, pancaking
I've been waiting for my time to shine

Yo, whether you love to hate it, if it's in or outdated
If I've been overrated or maybe your most favorite
You expect me still to write my verse on time
And I expect you not to front when you hear my rhyme
Don't expect me to smile cause it's in good taste
I know cats that's no mistake smiling in my face
And don't expect to try and guess if I'm mad or not
Or if I'm cold or hot, you would know if not
And don't expect me to come and just bite my tongue
It's kind of hard to forget what some brothers have done
But my mother always said you can forgive and forget
And expect that most promises won't be kept
I guess I gave credit where it wasn't deserved
To brothers must have preferred to not keep their word

And the evil that men do that live life close to kings
And boast supreme, fancy cars, coats, and cream

Is it fame at fault? Entertainers labeled soft
The place where people come to lose their train of thought

Despite the claims of what LA is and what it ain't
The picture the city paints that over exaggerates
Within the circus, if you're filling this service purpose
Some feel it ain't worth it, the city that's got you nervous
And make you injure, and get up out of here nigga
Cause LA never considered for those that need baby sitters
This is the hot bed for singles and newlyweds
Some looking for better gigs or fiending to make it big
It's the only place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn
Out, by any place regardless of the cost

I'm gonna tell you what my crew is all about
We like raw rhythm fusion, real rhyme producin'
Songs for the world's men, women and children
Armed and equipped with much confidence
And this is how we're gonna make our living
Some are known for bein' biters
Non-creative and wack rhyme-writers
Yo, they soup you up but can't rock the jam
Known to the world as a one-hit band
Easy come, easy go, yo you had your turn
Temporary niggas touchin' up your perm
You see a rapper is a kid that brags and acts big
A rhymer is a nigga that can handle his biz

Where life imitate art and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement
Where lights, camera, action is the language

J5 was on the mic so the people was hype
Yo, we like to rock the party with adrenalin and passion
The crowd started screaming ""Action Satisfaction""
Numark dropped the beat and the heat from the fire
We brought the energy and streetcar named desire

We was flipping, they was tripping, how we was old schoolin'
Needle to the groove, hands in the air movin'
And we said to the crowd ""This is the place to be,
Whether you paid a fee or you got in free""

So when you step through the door, the music gets loud
Maneuver through the crowd to get a better view now

To have style and finesse way above the rest
With the strong delivery, vocal chemistry
Street poetry in tune with the beat
So if you think you got the skills come take a test
Microphone check if you truly are blessed
If you can flow like water and can comprehend
You need longevity in this game to win
Now if you want to be the best you got to move and motivate
Watch the money that you make in the industry stakes

Cause some of these people ain't got no class
And some of these folks'll make you beat they ass
If you can believe then you can achieve
Get the loot, live the dream, be on top of the scene
To keep the people in it, and accumulate fans
To be dope in the studio and slam at the jams, so

Welcome party people, while we got your attention
There's a few things we'd like to mention
The name is Jurassic, but they call us J5
We rock bonafide fly rhymes fortified
We got 2 DJs controlling the beat and
Vocal harmonies make it sound so sweet
We're the four horsemen, with words to caution
Expressed and flipped in an orderly fashion
With the rhymin', designin' the music on time and
The fellas saying ""ho"" and the ladies losin' they mind and
The breakin', the scratchin', this thing called rappin'
The cultivated music that keeps your hands clappin
The passion, reaction, the street satisfaction

Shot heard around the world came from our fresh rhymes
The contribution to showbiz, mixed with entertainment
Resurrected rhymes, not the same old same
Now if you like what we came with
And you feel you can sang wit it
Peep the verbal language and the way we arranged it
Now entertainment to make the people applaud
I'm not trying to say my style is better than yours

I'm from the graduating class of one-nine-eight-eight
L.A. Unified School M A H
A gangbanger from the streets taught me how to break
In South Central L.A., ay yo, can you relate?

I'm Chali 2na
The one who puff the buddha keep the Snapple in the cooler
Used to go to junior high with Son Doola
Old skoola - a permanent, element, in ya tournament
Tellin it prevalent never delicate when we burnin it

Now from L.A. to the U.K. we attempt to rock a party
The rhyme and the music you don't hear that no more hardly
I can say it's partly, all our faults smarty
J5'll bring you more than the shakin of a body

Ay yo a child is born but no state of mind
But when I first heard it, put words to rhymes
I went from hypercars, to powder blue All-Stars
To hangin on monkey bars catchin spiders in jelly jars

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
So uh, let's take it back to the concrete streets
Original beats with real live MC's
Playground tactics, no rabbit-in-a-hat tricks
Just that classic, rappin from Jurassic

I bring the noise plus the funk, entertainin like a dunk
From a snotty-nosed prima donna millionaire punk
But uh, I heard a hunch, that somebody might munch
Cause J5 go together just like parties and spiked punch
Your crew's captain crunch, and I'm the seven seas
Bombin on MC's, crushin crews with ease
Brother please you know my steez is 100 degrees
With no era bring it live like the Trio of Terror

Trio of Terror no mascara, at last your brass surpass pleasure
We the last treasure set to entice the cash bearer
Mask wearers who bite my reflection like glass mirrors
Be trash pickers who need to consider the past clearer

Now what you thought was old and out of date
We brought it back alive and changed the shape
We put it on wax for those who think that
The 5 we energize has been extinct

[Chorus]

We takin it back like battles in hallways and bathrooms
And battles in the back of the classroom
And in the bungalows game of death with flows
Lunchtime rhymes you had to prove and show

Never the school type, couldn't pronounce the words right
The class jester, I was flunkin every semester
The summer hit, had it burnin in '86
Class cuttin and runnin wit all the neighborhood derelicts

Within the concrete jungle [huh!] we remain humble
Akil and Akir, bounce, flip and tumble
Uh, we never fumble, break down or stumble
Hot mumbo jumbo, just bring it when we rumble

We push it like the Daytona
Fresh rhymes we blaze on yas
Strictly from California old skool public diplomas
We spittin from every corner we flippin it when we wanna
Beneath the concrete be street word on ya

Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
Where women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips as I scribble my thoughts
On thin strips of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction,
Eruption of passion corrupts it
Life lasting friendships involved
Would love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

CHORUS (Akil)
We've been friends for a long time
A very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine
But respect the thin line
Love you like you was mine
Think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine
But respect the thin line

AKIL
Opposites attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of ya'll
So you respect that
And entertain an idea but get brought
Back to reality
And could you really live with that
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep it distant
Hug and kiss the friendship

MARC 7
An ongoing friendship
We was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked a sentence
Sometimes you're too intense
In your quest to invent
The perfect man
Please understand my rhyme is your repent

CHORUS (Akil/Nelly) X2
SOUP
Too bad that we became friends first
And I'm not an expert on how relationships work
But, from the minute it was known
It changed the whole tone
The way we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune
You let me up in your room (damn)
But to me girl you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted
Infatuation was authentic
But yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song just to say what's up
I want just a touch

CHORUS

NELLY
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just falls out when you walk in the door
Friendship turned into love
On some weak tip
See I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice with these things that I'm feeling
You've got someone else don't want to be caught stealing
Hell, if she knew she would never leave us alone in the room

CHALI
Yo, this was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first
And then slip

Once you cross ain't no turning back

Jurassic 5,"You guys workin' on a new album?
Yeah
Great!
You want to hear a new album?
I want to be on the album
I don't know about that

Check it out yo,
It's clear I'm burnin' out the candles here
The open-toed sandals here
I finesse any way I dress
Capital F-are-E-S-H so fresh

Yo, the mass men who suppress pain like aspirin
Jurass men are the best trained assassin
Your class pins get thrown in the trash bins
You leaches and has-beens get your teeth smashed in
Hot as you'd keep a furnace
We kept it earnest
Poems puncture your epidermis
And swell up enormous
Smoother than candles or flannel pajamas
We raid the city on camels
And dismantle informers
The omen

We blowin' never knowing where we goin'
When we flowin' with the fresh word spoken
Your chokin' 'cause my mikes smokin'
Hopin' that you get a chance to get into the open for some fresh air
But you already there
Ay yo I'm in the clear
West of the hemisphere J5 musketeers
Zorro with the oral editorial
The moral of the story I'm professional

[Chorus: x2]
J5 MC's
Then it's on!

Yo, I'm never cautious on MC's that make me nauseous
I feel that it's important
So Let's write and go record this
No need for applause
If you're kickin' the raw shit
We rotate tracks double back, just like swordfish
Word gifts is given when precision is I
Dominator, illustrator of this lyrical pie
Why you livin' a lie
Just unloosen your tie
So you can check the way we do this
In conclusion we fly

With the view from the bird's eye
With words I flown
I symbolize the skull and the cross bones
S to the O-you, P to the izzay
Sharp like the blade that stabbed the back of the OJ's

Yo, yo, if you had much class
And style like I had
You would be so glad
I see why you so mad
I'm born with it
Like Marvin and Lauren with it

Yo, deform with it
The way we perform wit it
You gon' get it
Your rebuttals are long winded
The song ended
If you satisfy

It's all splendid
Yeah, like Kevin Lockerbie
Rockin' some beige Wallabees
Blinded by the mockery

Time is never stoppin' me
Drop the clue
Connected with Cut and Nu
On the 1-2

[All]
There's only one capable
Breaks the unbreakable
Melodies unmakeable patterns
Inescapable whatever we aim at
We line 'em up
The party is weak from the same rap
Time's up
We payin' homage as well as returnin' favors
Candy for your ears hear us now
Or hear us later

[Chali 2na]
We fully capable
Make no mistake if we
Break a few rules
Make a few moves
And drop a few jewels
On top of your views
Unstoppable dudes
Using third optical tools
To Rakaa few crews
You gotta confuse
Melodically
Use rap to sonically bruise cats
Harmonies move over
Chemically glued tracks the ripper

[Marc 7]
Formulated fax center
Orchestrated back bender
Sign, Post, Date and send ya
And take you out like placenta
When I'm in your eye end ya
Blend with the beat like shadows and black ninjas

[Akil]
Me the epicenter
When I'm rocking the mike
I'm from the earthquake state
Shakin' up your life no aftershock
We blow the spot from the top
We have to rock
Ain't that much time on the clock
Kick rocks
Keep it movin' now pick up the pace
We drop and hit the ground runnin'
Winnin' the race
With limited space and limited papes
At any rate we take your mind
To the realest of states
Cause 

[Chorus:]
The flow gon' shine
We blow yo mind
With vocal rhyme
And music from my DJ in the back
Gon' shine
We'll blow your mind
With vocal rhyme
My DJ in the back is gonna

Yo, we payin' homage as well as returnin' favors
Candy for your ears hear us now

[Soup]
I put the Bob in the Bob Diddy
Spit it for y'all city
Use what Allah give me
Flip it if y'all wit me
Kinda black kinda bold
Ghetto soul beautiful
Still in it for you to hold
Cover girl centerfold
My spot, hot like lava rock
I get busy from Panorama City to Lompoc
You prefer hood medic procedure
Poetical breather with fever
Cause 

[Chorus]

There's only one capable
Breaks the unbreakable
Melodies unmakeable patterns
Inescapable whatever we aim at
We line 'em up
The party is weak from the same rap

Candy for your ear hear us now
Or hear us later

For those listeners who didn't feel that
We just had another one baby",Break,2002
Jurassic 5,"Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin' the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin' up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you want to crash the spot
And unlock explode (boom) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from g. rap to cool moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin', fast rappin'

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes y'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (hit it)
Like operation push, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Casanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to boo and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like joe greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts
On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! we just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d
Spit venom and burn your body like a std

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hand-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight
Murderer worldwide the stage is yo' knife",A Day at the Races,2002
Jurassic 5,"Ahhh!


I look at rappers with maximum equation
X-ray vision invasion
Rhyme connects perfects insects
That crawl and try to bite my rhymes
Pesticides I'm the double D combine the T
That's DDT
A chemical more to better to burn
Roaches, germs, mouse, lice, termites and pernicuious bugs
Or try thugs who perpetrate
Nothing within contaminate
Got my gloves on
So bring turtle doves on
Watch me pluck 'em and pick 'em
Stick em kick 'em and vic 'em
I see you're featherless
You got the birdy disease
Bite any rhymes that I have for ya
The poison is bad for ya stupid
You're equal measure to dirt dust grime and puss
You're just a rappin' infection
Dirtlizin' my section like a six-legga

Jurassic 5,"My name, Zaakir
I'm versatile
Plus I never eat the cow if ain't Halal
Why you rap or bit of styles in the third degree
Myself and 7even tight like cornbread Earl and me
Showcase with the voice that's oh so fresh
And I can still serve em up in a minute or less
I can talk all day but I'm gonna save my breath
And let my nigga Marc 7even just do the rest

I'll do the rest, but I won't rest
Get fresh off of any beat you suggest
High tech with the combination we prepare
Rap concierge behind the rhyme kickin' the snare

That heavenly puts the flavor right where it should be
My words have been connected to the poets of old
The way I utilize the pen I turn ink to gold
Keep it overly creative
Innovator of soul
Check the flavor from the fader
Which my DJ holds

And together we
Will forever be
High Fidelity

Can it be the brothers that you rarely see
Got together for the better
Whether him or me

Our weapons be our vocals
Guaranteed to smoke you

I mean the beat is so right
Damn

Betrayed your heart
The beat that's compliment of DJ Numark

And it's the fifth element
Never repetitive
Highly competitive
Classy and elegant
Super intelligent I'm telling it to ladies and gents
Never irrelevant now do I have to say it again

The fifth element
Never be hesitant
Totally accurate
Present or past tense

I bid the regards to whether whenever
We're clever

Jurassic 5,"Yo, raise the level, bass bottom to treble
Forever keep it ghetto
Funk and heavy metal
Fuck the devil
Unify the rebel
Whistle like a kettle
With a fly acapello
Smooth and mellow
Locked load and settle
Shine through times with rhymes bright like yellow
Taste and swallow, lead and never follow
Break it like a bottle
Inspire like a role model

Say, ""I am"" (I am) ""Somebody"" (Somebody)

Yo, my soul, bounce rock and roll
Tumble with the rhythm
Heat the mic when it's cold
I was told ""Be Bold""
Whether platinum or gold
Keep it solid

Lumberjack the fifth wonder
I never slumber 'cause I keep it on the under

Ghetto M-you-S-I-see (We bring the heat)
That African soul

Who said ghetto rap was all about a dope sack?
A pimp slap or a big black gatt
Fuck around and get jacked
For your rhymes where I live at
Uh, I'm not a gangsta but I boogie wit beats
No gang affiliation in my lyrics or speech
But still I keep it straight hood-hop techniques
South Central Fundamentals J5 emcees
And it's on!

Who's to say if I choose to make moves today
Whether I win or lose or I end up on the news today
Amuse but never confuse
Still got dues to pay
You abuse elegant rules when you use clichÃ©s

They got you sittin' on the edge of your seat

Creatin' beef

Mark of the beast
Code on the street
Cease and decease

Never the least

Let me repeat
The situation gets sticky like the badge on police

We individually driven in the beginnin'
We winnin'
Six men and a venomous independent decision and clear vision
Pretendin' was never a possibility
I got to kill it
Because I want to be it
The poet to win a Pulitzer Prize
Who wouldn?t survive?

The fullest of vibes

Deliberate surprise

When bullets the size

Of quarters arrive

And slaughter your lives

We trying to counteract that

Unifying these ballers and backpacks
With Knowledge-&-Fact-Tracks

Yo, my soul, infiltrate birth control
And control guns Huey P used to hold
I breathe life and through the 60's
Voted most likely to get busy
Inner city flash jiggy burn
Phillies and things
And we boogie to the bang
Sunshine and rain
Why you cats be talkin' that pimp crap in jail
I corresponded with a nigga who can barely spell
I know the situation oh so well (so well)
I done seen it in 3D
It ain't hard to tell
Why you bang for your turf chain girl or your man
I be banging for Islam in a spot in Sudan
'cause I can't solve or stop or put foot to this
The hottest brother on the block couldn't cook to this
J5 drop the verse beat hook to this
And if you want a fly jam you should look to this

Do we spit syllable riddles for bits and kibbles
So chicks can wiggle and shake
'Cause this image is fake

I'm trying hard to relate in a place filled with so much hate

Some brothers debate some love and some hate
Whatever the case its all about the choices you make
That's the reason you balloon or deflate

But do relate we trying to rap back to its primitive state
Wait

No overnight success or running the bets
Just pure unadulterated work progress
I'm willing to bet the farm you'll give you right arm
For a piece of the pie ask yourself why

[Chorus]
If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we've been through
But if you only knew, we real people homey just like you
We humble but don't mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain't used to

No more no less what you seeing is me

Wise intelligent God did bless me

Yes we rock up off all the SP freshly especially
Dangerous rough and deadly

The rum brazen, coming through Guns blazin'
Some of you duns running through ones with none savin'
Complainin', me and my clan are unscathin'
From the soul comes something amazing

[Chorus]

How many times I gotta hear some fanatic in my ear
Tellin me to keep it real when they ain't payin my bills
Or feeding my kids, judging me on how I live
If my crib in the hood or if its up in the hills

Have you forgotten who you are?
O you think you're a star
Why you frontin' (you ain't nothing)
You went from nothing to something
But something means nothing
If your people still wanting

And you got money ain't givin' them nothing

Flossin and frontin

Your game of charades
The way you behave
The image you save
Your brother that's one big parade
I'm sick of your ways
I'm sitting here spitting the praise
The next time they smile and they wave
Will probably be with a gauge

(Yo AK) Yo It's me Zaakir!
I was sittin at the television feelin' disturbed
Hey yo, I just got the word, off Tigram and 83rd
Some cat that got clapped, (gangster rapper?)
Perhaps, But I was lookin at the face of one particular cat
Now I done seen him before, (Can you remember where at?)
Well it was either at the liquor store or laundry mat
Or at a party and shit, the drive through of a Quickie Split
But the fellas he ran wit, they no longer ex- (yo, dude peep this)

[Akil]
Yo I know dude, I been knowin him all my life
Ever since I was young I used to see him shootin' dice
On occasion I would see him once or twice
With all types, many different walks of life
He tried to keep in touch, but i knew what was up
Every time he came around and showed his face I ducked
In the mid-eighties, the nigga went crazy
He had a lot of ladies selling they babies, the nigga was shady
But he had a lot of friends that he would visit on the weekends
Thrill seekin, influenced by his teachings
My daddy knew him, yo, he met him at a hotel
My homeboy Johnny, kicked it with him in a jail cell
a lot of people met him with a female
Doing real well, connected with the drug sales
The rich and the poor, for better or worse
The last and the first, walked the earth, but can't avoid his turf
And it hurts my brain, it's drivin me insane
It's a shame I can't remember his name
I think 2na know dude, Soup, I ain't tryin to be rude
But my wife just cooked, I'm bout to grab on some food

Man, the fuedin is on
Hey, the reason why I called, that was the cat from my building
You seen him?

[2na]
Yeah we met that brother out in Pasadena
Remember 7even, on Marengo?
No my mistake, we were right between Fair Oaks and Lake
Tryin to take us a lunch break

[Marc 7even]
And cop us a success act!

But had to drive right past the place where they rest at

We drove in a hatch back

[Marc 7even]
It was brown and black

Patrollin the hood, lookin for trouble
Saw us purchasing trees
Lurkin with speed, pulled the strap, and was irkin' to squeeze

[Marc 7even]
You jerk and you bleed

Threw it in reverse and we fled

The purest diction
Insures their jurisdiction
I'm kicking it up a level trying to stay in the red
Some stay in the bed, zombie
Like the Day of the Dead
With decay in the head
Playin' instead of stayin' ahead
Steadily portrayin' celebs, delayin' the inevitable

They run down when they touch ground
They climb up the structures unsound

It's like we rolled up a snowball and threw it in hell
See some of us are looted with mail and suited to swell
But still blind like you're fluent in Braille

Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
But love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

[Akil]
Opposite's attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

[Marc 7]
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent

[Soup]
Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not on expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, what you doing after this?)
Infatuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want, just, a touch

[Chorus: x2]

[Nelly Furtado]
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't want to be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the room

Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?

And best friends make a perfect match

Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

I'm tryin' to spit some game, so your ass can prosper
Pay a little dues, do a couple a shows
Put a mix-tape out, man let's see how it goes
My only good advise is to cut your own slice
I mean, the world ain't gon' bite, just cause you think you nice
How can I be diplomatic when this ain't automatic
I'm gonna tell you right, this a roll of the dice
(Let's get it together, for you and me)

[Chali 2na]
Hey, being silent's the first sign
If not, being able to follow my first line
I dirt-grind on my first, it works fine
I'm alert, but I been caught of guard at the worst time. (worst time)
Yeah, I get apparent applause
But do these people know my character flaws? I get embarrassed
And pause, meticulous, but never careless because
I might be the one standin' on your terrace that falls
And you can laugh, but it's therapeutic, to
Talk about my faults of a ? acoustic, bringing dove shit
We ain't perfect, to fight just ain't worth it
Despite a stained surface, we gotta retain purpose
(Let's get it together, for you and me)

[Akil]
I was a pick-a-the-litter, when I was a-little-nigga
My pops would turn preacher once my voice got deeper
Than his. For all the times a nigga would vent
I had to listen, he was payin' the rent and what
He's sayin', he meant. I'll admit, I was tripin' a bit
I was hangin' with different chicks and we be wild'n and shit
But I had to get a grip before time ran out
Or pop starts to trip, start puttin' me out
But now I kinda see what he was talkin' about
You can't live in somebody house and start airin' it out
You got to be your own man and handle your biz
And later on you can tell 'em what time it is

""you might want to say ?"" ""you got to understand""
We trying to tell you the deal from our perspective
The J5 collective will wreck 'cause you
""You got to understand"" keep it together and try
""you might want to say ?"" but you ""you got to understand""
We're more than meets the third eye, words fly
Reppin' from the bird's eye view

[Akil]
I ain't hating I just heard better
Up the ante on the game and apply the pressure
Understand I was a fan
Before I was a member of your favorite rap band
Understand that I'm still a fan

[Soup]
And you can keep playing after the fact
Related to the game and came after crack
'cause every nigga I know is out ta get a plaque
So why you wanna go and do that, huh?

[Chali 2na]
I don't know man 'cause we see fiends who dream c.r.e.a.m
Reppin' the west through special effects and green screens
And it seems you need to be the one to flash that cannon
Or sign the autographs till the last cat's standing

[Marc 7even]
Brother pass that action, and your trashin' is real
Your only way of coming up is probably inking a deal
While your thinking the skills, some are thinking the mills
In a never-ending quest ta get the house on the hill
AND THAT'S REAL

[Chorus]

[Akil]
I need some understanding in this world between me and my girl
She wants the diamonds and the pearls to be a part of my world
Twenty four-sev, but love don't pay the rent
So love me when I'm home and cherish the moment

[Chali 2na]
Uh-Huh
'cause some of you women are men's mirrors
I know some women who dodge balls like Ben Stiller
Please understand, it's not to offend or seem bitter
But every queen, need a king wit her

[Soup - singing]
Ms. Thing I don't know, when ever I leave you ready to go
My Momma told me about how it flow
But I didn't wanna listen but she told me so
Now if it ever came to the bank account
Would ya pack ya things and get up and bounce
These the type of things that I be thinking about
To all my other fellas ""you got to understand""

[Chorus]

[Chali 2na]
In all the times I tried ta do what the smartest guy do
It's 'cause I see the world from the Artist eye view
You live life the next part is you die, too
And there's no one on this earth it doesn't apply to

[Soup]
Now that's true, 'cause every single day I live
I'm obligated just ta say it like it T-I is
And I ain't gonna talk about no cat whose decision is poor
Trust me man my hand is just as dirty as yours

[Marc 7even]
Either they like you, or they hype you, it's a cycle
Choices that we make in the vi-tal
'cause in the blink of an eye it can all go awry
And the next man will quickly take your title

[Akil]
Yeah, between me and myself and all of these things
Understanding is a theme when we doing our thing
From the job to my queen and chasing my dream
The whole world needs a little bit of understanding

Began their quest
To put real hip hop on the radio

[Akil]
Now here's a little story that must be heard
About the brother with the word sounds so superb
It started way back with these emcees
Now here's a little something on the history

[Zaakir]
I'm a H-I-P H-O-P H-E-A-D, been since one-nine-eight-three
Are to the A-P-P-I-N
Eighty-four was the year I picked up the pen
At the same time breaking tryin' to come on in
But I was already in since way back when
One-nine-seven-five, the saga began
Are to the O-be	-O-T-I-N
Eighty-one I was P-O-P-P-I-N
One-nine-eighty-two D-J-in
Eighty-three it was all about Run-DMC man
A gang banger taught me how to break dance then
The same year I picked up the pen
And wrote my first rhyme and got that feelin'
And now I'm here in the flesh still dope still death
Tryin' to get my song (rockin' on the radio)

[Chorus:]
The summertime yo we would hang out
And talk about the new jam that came out
And from the way the beat was laid out
And all the emcees had turned the place out
And we would say our rhymes to the beat
Right but we never indulged in the street
Life and now we all good to go
J5 is rockin' on the radio

[Akil]
Yo I was an inner-city nigga in my room I'd sit
Poppin' off quick cause I could sing a little bit
With my hi-top fade and matchin' outfits
But once the record hit it's like listen to this
Hip hop is the reason that a brother evolved
And I was so involved I ain't gonna lie to none a y'all
By the time I started rhymin' in the late eighties
The drugs in Cali was crazy

[Chali 2na]
Nine-teen eighty
Nine's the number this is the summer
On some get rich come up Quest switch the drum up
Invested some of my best years because of
Then I repped with some of the best kids that done it
My love dates back to show, that's incredible
Brothers who lack revenue spent on they back several
Times It made me know which way to go
And now (Jurassic is rockin' on the Radio)

[Chorus]

I got my mind on back in the day
The style a dress and the records they play
Reminisce I got somethin' to say
Check it out cause it went this way cause it went this way

[Mark 7even]
The year was eighty-two and the block was froze
When I stepped out rockin burgundy shell-toes
A fresh mock-neck and some new Lee jeans
Add a pair a Gazelles and well you know what I mean
DJ Red Alert and Mr. Magic had static
Over Kiss FM and BLS which one is the baddest
Brothers on the block was doin' the Wop
While the cars drove by bumpin' real hip hop
The vibe and the feelin' was oh so real
We held it oh so dear so brother don't go there

All showed me how to really be a real emcee

Where amateur stunts can make a n**** damage your fronts

We shape the minds of kids in every hood
We make your past situation look good
The nights filled with shrugs and I wish you would

Sex, money, and murder, yeah it's all four to five

On the boulevard, known for leaving permanent scars
Many dreams get robbed, real movie macabre
Young heartthrobs get young heart sobs, cause
""Good evening ladies and gentlemen welcome to Hollywood, California""

The city of angel's wings represents people's hopes and dreams
And the evil that men do that live life close to kings
And boast supreme, fancy cars, coats, and cream
Material things provoke more folks to scheme
Whether you paid your cost, Cali green made your call
The smog covers the city like a table cloth
Is it fame at fault? Entertainers labeled soft
The place where people come to lose their train of thought

Despite the claims of what LA is and what it ain't
The picture the city paints that over exaggerates
Within the circus, if you're filling this service purpose
Some feel it ain't worth it, the city that's got you nervous
And make you injure, and get up out of here n****
'Cause LA never considered for those that need baby sitters
This is the hot bed for singles and newlyweds

You talk about trust, I talk about lust
Its not appealin as you truly speak your feelings
I be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever

You thought since I was nice
Since I was blind like some mice

Akward scared to talk to girls
Every flavor even chocolate swirl

Get yo ass up out that bottle girl
Stuck up in some model world

Let me spit this man

Speak my mind
Just to reach your mind
Tap a tempo off the instrumental
Just to get the drum line
You know it's my time
Reel up and rewind
Get off that cheap wine
Swinging on my grapevine
You heard a brother
Worthy to create rhymes
I take it further than a murder
Or I hate crime
Don't hate on me
What have you done for me lately
Beside to baith me assume and mistakenly
Too abstract than a backpack
To super underground with the beats and rats
'Cause I refuse to bust gatts
And wather down my raps
To get me caught up in a trap
And set me years back. Fuck that!

[Mos Def:]
Yeah right from the start
Remember that feeling
The way the hip-hop used to make you feel
So real like
Getting first signed
Then the first time you heard Planet Rock
Word is over, the God
Staten Island, for real, for real

I heard brother say J5, men them niggas ain't shit
Them niggas never slapped no bitch, never inserted a clip
They never claimed thug or a pimp
Them niggas never made the attempt
Hey yo, they ain't all that
Men Six members men and four of them black
What kind of racist statement is that
They need to change their views
Start talking about the clubbing they do
That's the reason we ain't fucking with you
Today's artist is tough
Talking loud, this isn't enough, yeah
Let's talk about the guns you bust
Nigga, the crack you cut
Or all the cars that you bought wholesale
Or the niggas rattling your cold tail
I've been keeping it real
Let's talk about the ash you feel
Now that's the way to get mass appeal
Y'all ain't heard that wow
The brothers ain't feeling your style
You get stoned play over the radio right now

Where we at
Wh...Whe...Wher...Where we at (YA)
Where we at

Don't deny me, diss or austrsize me
'Cause it's likely I'm all up in your sight gee
It's unreal how you deal and threat us
Your bunch of believers
I can tell just by the way you retreat
Cactus is a discreed fact
They heat rap beat gaps but stay of the knee rack
So you could put your seat back
Pick up your feet and bring facts
Rhymes and beats that we create can defeat that weak crap
'Cause your either bling-bliging or your next tails ringing (dring)
Either way it goes, fat baby ain't signing
The game ain't over until we all get shined
I mean you do your thing and I do mine",Where We At,2006
Jurassic 5,"Yo, my metaphor, my musical madness
Move and motivate those with musical talents, uhh
Read it in bold print, we holdin' it down
Lick a shot, hip-hop when we in yo' town
Uhh, master blaster sound
Freak the future far from here and now
With style, release increase the peace, uhh
Bubble with the beat 'til they feelin' the heat in the streets
Now each one, teach one, reach one, young gun
On one, listen to the warrior's drum
Beatin up the block with the ghetto hop that knock
And make you want to crash the spot
And unlock explode (BOOM) the alpha and omega code
With drum rolls and old soul, we uphold
And foretold to scores of six years ago
Fast flow from G. Rap to cool Moe
Supasyllable, major to the minimal
Every individual, bounce to the tempo yo
Lungs collapse and raps be trapped in
The only way to make it happen, jaw-jappin, fast rappin'

Yo, I'm the hot dog that run the hottest monologue
In star poetic inserts and yes why'all s
My speech is like holding two glocks apiece
The outreach that rock police
The super adventure men portend to put somethin' in bitches
Win when we write, the Emmy winner get hyped, off any printer
And I came to get it (HIT IT)
Like Operation PUSH, operate the tush
Black octopus of soul, in inter-planetary patrol
I planted my gold, and low and behold
It's the brother doc, ready to rock-rock
Don't stop Hobbes, I known like the lumberjack chop chop
The wordsmith, I write in block letters of cursive
Curse my circus, serve this surface
And watch how the brother fet over
The fly Cassanova with the frankincense odor

Bear witness
To where riches'll make career bitches share pictures
When the ears get this ya brainses software'll glitches
Splatter your brains
Leave scattered remains of matter and stains
That'll explain how you was battled and slain
I get rude and go, to your show and use a row
Of fans to BOO and throw you off 'til you lose your flow
A pro mean like Joe Greene when I blow theme
Put your whole team on pause like cold cream
Then show laughter when I flow faster, your hoe haveta
Go after her weave from the breeze when I blow past ya
I'm dapper plus ghetto and just pedal
When the dust settles we left in the rubble the crushed metal
Nurses with hearses sealin' conversed with lit purses
Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of D-cepts
On streets of L.A. I'm a whole E-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex
Still that Gucci dressin', still that coochie pressin'
My pimp game smooth be-gets 'em
I don't use discretion; cop tends to be stressin'
Fuck explainin' it, who's he testin'?
Finsta perform all physical forms
Leave your ass shakin' like a Mystikal song
Please Dumb, what type of shit was you on?
Cause man to compress a nigga mean One less a nigga (uh-huh)
All I want is my niggaz all recruitin' a slimmy
All I want is my liver all polluted with Remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin yo' backbone
Attackin you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone
That come back verbal assault rifle (ahhhhh)
We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! We just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the King Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-D
Spit venom and burn your body like a STD

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like King-Kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss 
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Mazeratti engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
OFF to another city where we do our nitty grity
We wild like Serengeti, tear it down let's seek and set it
Get ready, for the ride, verbally hand-glide
Write and stay tight, mission's in sight

Juror 13,"Will these dreams still follow me
Out of dark obscurity?
Can't you see it up in the sky
As it kicks you in the face and sucks you dry

You never had the answers
And now you tell me the facts of life
I really couldn't be bothered with you
Get out of my face and watch me die

Burning inside! burning inside!
Absolution and a frozen room
Are the dreams of men below
I try to grab it but the touch is hot

The mirror collapses, but the image came not
I'm scared of the darkness in the light
I scare myself because I know I'm right
I see the evil in your savage eye

As it cuts right through the sky
Burning inside! burning inside!
Calling a mantra with a blade in the skin
For the demons within

I feel the pain is the death and decay
But the lesson never fades away
Two little shadows, turning away
You saw the man through the window pane

Another slave and a victim of fate
Another lesson in hate

Take a sled and slide down the slope,

Born into the money but would die for glory

Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

(get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know
If she cutting tonight shorty, then I got to go

Get fucked up, chunk up your hood in the club

Now Daily pull up to the spot, at 12 o'clock on the dot
Looking for a chickenhead, bopper to bop
Twenty inches spinning slow, as I crawl in the lot
Gold diggers flag me down, trying to get me to stop

But oh no, a nigga recognized disguise
I looked past that thick ass, and them big ol' thighs
I'm A G, I peep game constantly
So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me

I'm at the bar, taking shots to the head
Trying to find a yellow bone, that give shots to the head
I see a fine looking dime, and she rocking some red
Spit a line and she mine, while she drop in my bed

It's guaranteed, to put a young bitch on her knees
Blue Boyz on the rise, with a mission to see
Slim Thug or Sir Daily, and my nigga Kyleon
We party all night, till six in the morn' ha

[Slim Thug]
I'm V.I.P., in the back of the club
Slim Thee, they call me the best dressed thug
Your misses trying to get a Boss, kisses and hugs
But your misses get nothing, but diss and mugs

I don't give dick to chicks, that give it up to scrubs
Trying to find the finest bitch, up in the club
Make her up that thing, get in her ear
And fill her up, with game

Ten times out of ten, I'ma cut that thang
Got the broad giving up the brain, like it ain't nothing mayn
I'm a P-I-M-P, simple to me
And talk hoes out they clothes, so easily

I rock platinum rings, platinum piece and platinum car
And I'm bout to be, a platinum star
V.I.P. by the bar, is where you'll see me staying
With the Roley on my wrist, and the Crys in hand man

But then jacking our slang
I used to get dizzy spells, and hear a little ring
The voice of a angel telling me my name

Helping me to get through this

Calmer that a Buddhist 
In the newness 
Of a world untouched by 
Human hands

I'm diving deeper to ocean floors afar

Washed clean of the grime and the city sins

You're under threat no longer

And we can navigate by sonar 
Into dark depths where evolution stands still 
And submarine winds 
Blow through the silent chill

Taking care of her ablutions
Hiding myself behind illusions

A thousand times I thought about leaving
Giving all this up

But still scared to death
About the fact you might hurt me
Instead I came here
And became an agony uncle
And now I'm saddled with this
Freaky carbuncle
Who's stalking me forcefully

All the rest seems to disappear
You pull me in with your tractor beams
And wrap me up in your wicked schemes

Your Cadbury's skin uncurve
And in tronic patterned Venetian light
You moonwalk to the bathroom
Well you move across my space without friction
You're so unbelievable you must be fiction
Or perhaps a premonition

I hear your footfall softly
And all my troubles fall away from me

Its time to emerge from camouflage, leaves and twigs,
Time to throw away the fake noses and fright wigs,

Time to face the music, no more metaphor,
Time to decide your fate, will you be cooked or go raw?
Will you be rare and bloody with your soul exposed?
Or well done, a charcoal surface with your insides froze?

And do you feel fear as you hear another door close?
Or will you just turn away and flow where the wind blows?
And are you still satisfied with the pathways you chose?
Or would you like to go back and rewrite the old prose?

And that I do respect

How can we connect 
I realize this is strange love 
But we should let it flow

Don't it feel right dear 
Now we're making eye contact

Just Jack,"Hangin about in the sun
With prozac Annie and the schizo alcoholics
The sharp edged shadows
And these mad electronics
The barbeque's burning
With the moon-ray sensations
I'm lying on my back
And watching cloud formations
Trying to see the beauty
Minus the black inside
She told me people came here
To get drunk before they died
Too many problems
And not enough solutions
Ms. Monroe is in the bathroom
Taking care of her ablutions
Hiding myself behind illusions
Stand back and watch the evolution
Of the secondhand lives your using
So many fucked up souls
In this locality
I need the choice of some
Relative banality
The raw twistings of your mind spewing forth
As you stare at me
Is fucking scaring me

Paradise lost and paradise found
I'm just trying to keep my feet on the ground
Paradise lost and paradise found
And I'm just trying to get lost in my sound
Paradise lost and paradise found
I'm just trying to keep my feet on the ground
I'm just trying to keep my feet on the ground

Storms rage across
Metallic skies
Reflecting in the multi faceted eyes
Of lazy buzzing flies
The heavens collide
In primeval cacophonies
I contemplate my demise
And hope the gods are appeased
A long distance love affair that's alive
But barely breathing
A thousand times I thought about leaving
Giving all this up
And put myself at your mercy
But still scared to death
About the fact you might hurt me
Instead I came here
And became an agony uncle
And now I'm saddled with this
Freaky carbuncle
Who's stalking me forcefully
And I'm begging her
Please let me go about my business peacefully
Let my days flow seamlessly
'cause since you've been around
Everything's got so messy
You stress me
God bless me and test me
Daily

[CHORUS]

Well it's the original tales of the unexpected
You thought I couldn't do it
Now stand corrected
'cause I'm connected
To every nerve ending
Cerebral cortex messages
I'm sending
There's two sides to every story
Black and white
The day and night
Wrong and right
And the paradise lost and found
All inside this sound

Just Jack,"She's got a whole lot of disco friends,

she's got a whole lot of disco friends,
Disco ladies and gentlemen,
Eating their faces from the inside out,
Freaky dancing til the late am,
Music stripping down the wall I swear,
She's catching fishies in her disco net,
Throwing kisses in the powder room,
Slowly sucking on a cigarette

She knows an awful lot of disco kids,
Novelty sun glasses and mullet wigs,
She says she wants to be a stylist,
Or maybe something in the music biz,
Daddies rich, mummies beautiful,
They always said she'd make a top model,
But now she's hiding out in disco land,
A happy clappy trust experience

And there is music in every sight and every sound
No need for headphones
I'll tip my cap to the world even though I don't wear one
Grinnin' at the women in the salon gettin' their hair done

On the outside looking in like an aquarium
Spinnin' with the stars in the planetarium
Deliriously, mysteriously I'm feelin' curiously marvelously
'Super Duper' like Joss Stone

My heart melts like ice cream cones
Grinnin' like a dog diggin' up dinosaur bones
I used to be fossilized but now I'm out of my shell
And I'm happier than whores with chivalrous clientèle

This can't be real, I must be dreamin' could somebody slap me
I'm feelin' so mischievous, original cheeky chappy
It must be ages since I felt satisfied
Just to be Just Jack and just that, still intact

It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those

Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those glory days

I'm so warm, new dawn, reborn, new forms
And I'm thinkin' about my boys Joelly chic and Freshly Sean
And I know you're underrated but one day we'll all make it
And walk around naked with our bullocks platinum plated

Anyway, I'm off track gotta stop that
And get back to the high street, I need somethin' to eat
Stop at the cafe, coffee and a salt beef bagel
Yeah, I know I'm Cain'd but now I'm feelin' Abel

I used to get so paranoid In places like this
Stayed in my house for days with my weed psychosis
My neurosis was thinkin' everybody's staring at my red eyes
And shifty expression but now I'm past carin'

And I can feel that destiny is on my side
And by the looks of things, fate came along for the ride
Behind green skies, I can see my girl's eyes
Damn it, I'm in love with this planet, you gotta realize

It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those

Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepare to be amazed
It's just another one of those glory days

It's time to look to the future
Just when I was gettin' used to the humdrum
I realized in the depths of my depression
That I really wanted to be someone

So let's smash the past like a tacky figurine
On the back page of a supplementary magazine
But for the time being, bump your head to the beat
Sit back, put your feet up and relax

It's just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze
Step out your house and prepared to be amazed
It's just another one of those, just another one of those

Just another one of those glory days
Jump out your bed, shake your head, clear the haze

Ex-dotcom millionaires with shitty jobs in retail
Every ingrown toenail, pile of junk mail
Drivin' test drive fail, vain search for the Holy Grail

Every twelve inch record your dumped girlfriend decided to break
And all the under achievin' geezers getting more lean and peezer
On melon Bacardi Breezers and skinny plastic cached reefers

And every impotent porn star
And the girls with the red lights on, doin' tricks for Mars bars
And all the ravers wishin' they were back in '89
'Cause everythin' was so much better the first time

Every sweepin' saga from the here now to the hereafter
Tall tales around the campfire, tragedies of fallen empire
And everythin' that will and won't transpire
Sometimes it's just too diabolical

Carryin' our stories like DNA in hair follicles
Luggin' chronicles like baggage handlers
I'm not stickin' around, I'm shippin' out with the ramblers
Collectin' chapters of fractures and raptures

High on a cactus with a bunch of backpackers
Toastin' backwards with a shot of Cachacas

Just Jack,"Picture this, 2:30 on the hottest night in June
He awakes for no reason and checks his watch by the moon
And his mouth feels as dry as his eyes as he struggles to rise
And stops to contemplate his wifes thighs as he does up his flies

He finds his slippers where he left them under the chair
Behind the two cups and an old copy of Marie Claire
And he switches on the coffee machine
That of course works like a dream
Catches sight of his reflection in the silver surface sheen

And it's a face he knows well although it should look less abused
With all these moisturizers and the skin products he's used
As he moves through the kitchen, his homage to brushed steel
Across the new pine floorin' that's plastic but looks real

Past the plasma with the wide screen
And the cinema surround sound
And he stops on his favorite spot by the window and looks down
On the orange lit street at the edge of the private car park
Where his Audi TT is waitin' safely in the dark

Keepin' it all inside of you
Somethin' will have to give
And if you could you'll take it back
But you lose your way in the way you live

Now he can hear wind chimes tinklin' out on the balcony
And his phone beepin' out a text message in the same key
He checks it and it?s Jill who used to be his secretary
Before they started an affair and things began to get really scary

Now his wife Mary is gettin' weary of his lies
Like she's read the whole sordid story in his eyes
It doesn't help that Jill?s now sayin' that she's two weeks late
His mental state is really startin' to deteriorate

He never knew how he got so out of his depth
Or why he's broken more than all these promises kept
And it?s been ages since he slept properly
His sleeps now broken by these dreams of extra-marital activity

Tryin' to recapture the rapture he used to get
From his material possessions and endless retail therapy sessions
Shoulda listened to what his dad said before he died
?The best things in life are the ones you can't buy, son?

Keepin' it all inside of you
Somethin' will have to give
Wish you could buy a ticket back
But you lose your way in the way you live

Away from the shouts and the louts and the girls
With the over painted pouts

On rusty mountain bikes

Just let me wash up on a shore
I used to have the strangest dreams
But they don't come here anymore

My duvet's laid out like an atlas
With stains to mark the borderlines
Indentations in my pillow
I hope won't fade with time

Smoke the roach left in the ashtray
On which I choked the night before
Stubbed my toes on dirty clothes
Like mountain ranges on a floor

I pick my way through crusty dishes
And their greasy chemistry
I washed two cups and then remember
That you've left already

I let you go so reluctantly
And I can still hear your lazy symphony
And just when I think I found my calling
It's another mourning morning

They say the devil's in the detail
I'm gonna blind my eyes instead
I put my memories in a landscape
Where only reckless angels tread

And watch the fingerprints you left
Like a secret code upon my skin
And I remember when you told me
A gilded crown won't make a king

I really want you to stay
But I know you have to go

Just Jack,"I must have got up about twenty to seven
Had a shower and had breakfast
And had a couple of pieces of toast
You know, forced it down

Then had a cup of coffee
It was pouring with rain
And I thought oh God
You know, good old England

I get this writer's block
It comes as quite a shock
And now I'm stuck between
A hard place and the biggest rock

In my own head consumed
I sit back in my room
It's like the tapestries of life
Get tangled in the loom

I'm like a butterfly
Caught in a hurricane
My pulse is quickenin'
As my heart plays a new refrain

I'm lovin' Mary Jane
Flyin' with Lois Lane
On board a bullet train
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came

(Obviously this helped me I think)
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
(I always hoped that it would happen)
(But I never thought it really would)

Sometimes at night I think too much
About life and love and music and stuff
I mustn't sort of build
My hopes was too high

I'm livin' in the past
My clock's an hour fast
Should really go and make a coffee
But I can't be arsed

I've lost my mobile phone
You'll have to call my home
On second thoughts, just leave a message
When you hear the tone

My grimy windows show
The early morning glow
Another day, another dollar
In my one man show

I'm lovin' Mary Jane
Flyin' with Lois Lane
On board a bullet train
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came

(Obviously this helped me I think)
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
Don't know yet if I'm glad I came
(I always hoped that it would happen)
(But I never thought it really would)

I fell out with Mary Jane
I don't speak to Lois Lane
And I missed that bullet train
But now I know I'm glad I

I fell out with Mary Jane
I don't speak to Lois Lane
And I missed that bullet train
But now I know I'm glad I

I fell out with Mary Jane
I don't speak to Lois Lane
And I missed that bullet train
But now I know I'm glad I

I fell out with Mary Jane
I don't speak to Lois Lane
And I missed that bullet train
But now I know I'm glad I came
But now I know I'm glad I came

Just Jack,"Drag myself from my bed
Around 20 past 6
Get my kids up make breakfast
1 egg 2 toast 3 weetabix

And as I sit down I look up
And your standing in the doorway sun at your back
In my old brown dressing gown
Well no one can love you more than I love you now, but I

Gotta go running for the bus
Coat flying and I try not to miss it this time
But the drivers waiting and that's strange
Kids on the top deck quiet for a change
And there's no rain and no roadworks
In the bus lane and all my hurts run away
And I'm smiling as I'm punching in

The day I died was the best day of my life
The day I died was the best day of my life
Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
Everything will be alright
The day I died was the best day of my life

Now the secretaries they got a smile for me
And the in tray on my desks almost empty
I get a memo from executive Joe
Saying Rob the gob is getting kicked out
For embezzling funds from the company account
And id be lying if I said I wasn't chuffed
'Cause I always hated rob
And now they'll probably offer me robs old job

And in the park at lunch
There's no whinos on my favorite bench
None of that drunk chatter none of that pissy stench
And the scrawny little pigeons with the gammy legs
Decide to dive bomb from someone elses sandwich instead
And there's something about the city today
Like all the colors conspire to overwhelm the grey
And this close to the fire I can feel no cold
But a rainbow halo around my soul

The day I died was the best day of my life
The day I died was the best day of my life
Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
Everything will be alright
The day I died was the best day of my life

So I leave work get to the high street and I miss my bus
Should I wait for another no I can't be arsed
I begin to walk
And rush hour crowd seem to part like the red sea
And I'm stopping at the offy
20 cigarettes and a 6 pack to relax me
And as I cross back over the street
I guess I never saw that taxi
I guess I never saw that taxi

The day I died was the best day of my life
The day I died was the best day of my life
Tell my friends and my kids and my wife
Everything will be alright
The day I died was the best day of my life

He took the escalator of success
He stepped on the weak
And stole from the strong

He learned how to buy people inside out

Just-Ice,"[El Da Sensai]
I calculate that eighty-five was the year
I first grabbed the pen, daydreamin of the cheers
Ahead from rockin shows, no Girbauds that sag
The windbreaker suits and backspins that was mad
I stress progress roll joints at my rest
til the ill wee hours, and I knew it was the best
I hit mad spots, many crews got dropped
While I was gettin props niggaz was dealin on the block
Stayin in crib on the weekends was Marley Marl
was freakin the cuts Mr. Magic was speakin
That's how I got my first taste, makin tapes
til the rhyme skill was great and my style would escalate
Practice made my perfect tactics
Now my dap gets clap, cause I'm the rap snap fanatic
But now in nine-trey I got the T-Ray track
And my trunks, my roots are growin styles from whayback

..

[Tame One]
I flash back to fat Kangol hats, with plastic
Back when steppin on kicks in eighty-six got your ass kicked
Bombers and sheepskins, were common when I first started rhymin
Still I found time to go bombin
Me and my pals rocked Cazals with no glass
Dark flavored Clarks, Lee Denims off the ass
Back when Mr. Magic had it goin all the way on
the beat with BDP, added flavor like a crayon
Indeed MC's would represent with the skills
But now in ninety-three a lot of them can get the dillz
It seems like a little sumthin missin in the mix
But now I got a deal, so it's up to me to fix
When niggaz put me up on, with funky raps to cut on
Word is BOND, if I hear another wack rap song
I might snap and it's an actual fact
that I'ma kick it like that, cause this is strictly bout the whayback

..

[El Da Sensai]
Aww man damn, whayback, things was kinda fat
Had the Godfather knot, a Starter hat, things are kinda wack
now, packed up, my cardboard and stepped away
I didn't have a choice, the culture was slayed
B.D. had died, and things were dissapearin
The West coast was here and all these wack beats appearin
DJ's were breakin down record store doors
to get the Biz Dance and the Chante Moore's
Peace to Buck Four, Rocksteady on the floor
New York and Dynamic crews plus many more
Remember the time when you didn't pack a nine
Niggaz just came to hear some, funky ass rhymes
But all of that's over, cause brothers want to act up
No clubs to go to, they'll just pack rap up
That's how the media wants it to stop
So peep the verse and last showin of Graffiti Rock
So check it, the brothers want to wreck it
To get what's expected, cause hip-hop, should be respect
Gotta get it back, to get it on track
Artifacts kickin styles illy on the whayback

[Tame One]
Like back when my Timberlands were only size sixes
I used to take pictures shootin spitballs at bitches
Cross New Jersey Transit just to see a rapper kick it
But now I ain't with it, cause niggaz just ain't worth the ticket
Shit man, I remember jams that were slammin
Gettin me and my man in, was harder than backgammon
DJ's would scratch back to back from boom baps
And rappers with real raps, could drop shit real fat
But now kid, as I recollect, rappers out who caught wreck 
respected, just got stuck up in my tape deck
Real deal hip-hop, when Biz used to flip-flop
His fat ass, on stage'd do a dance, in busted Reeboks
Niggaz musta forgot, when real rhymes was hot
Cause now if you ain't gold, you ain't got no props
But fuck that, I'm above that, I don't play that
The Artifacts staff drops math about the whayback

No burden is he to bare, we’ll get there

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by

When ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

That's still untouched by man
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end

This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords

For this tired old man that we elected king

And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales

But I know a place where we can go
And was away this sin

And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense

But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast

But, somewhere back there in the dust

I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss

And let me take a long last look
Before we say good bye

I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin'
It's early morn

Already I'm so lonesome

So many times I've played around

"Justin ""El Niño"" Porée","Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by

When ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

But I know a place where we can go
That's still untouched by man
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end

This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords

For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details

Since daddy had to lie
But I know a place where we can go
And was away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by

And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense

But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast

But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss

And let me take a long last look
Before we say good bye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me

Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence",Perfect Peace,2006

There's so many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song ain't no chaperon's this could be
The night of our dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give your first dance to me
I'm gonna cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a life time

I couldn't ask for more, we're rockin' back and forth
Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor
(I can't deny), so many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song, now we're all alone, here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give your first dance to me
I'm gonna cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night
The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss,
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll
Make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me we'll cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a lifetime

Girl if you see something you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance for your first dance
Yeah you never forget your first dance
So take advantage of the slow dance

If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gonna cherish every moment
'Cause it only happens, once in a lifetime",First Dance,2009

Want so badly for it to be reality

And when you hold my hand
Then I understand
That it's meant to be

Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better

Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Cause this life's to long
And this love's to strong

That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feelin' no pain or fear
(Pain or fear, pain or fear, no pain)
Oh no, don't have a care in the world
Why would I, when you are here

There's a moment I've been chasin'
And I finally caught it out on this floor

Baby, there's no hesitation,
No reservation by taking a chance and more
Oh no, because

It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven

When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never (I will fight)

I can handle him
Hold up, aight?

Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a J-B song with me

I be trying to chill
They try to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)

I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the fliest
Like David and Goliath,
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand,
I was born from two stars
So the moon is where I land

I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter
I said cool, cool
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping

Kelly boy, HBK, I make songs like it's my last name I must be Trey
Ballin' like Dave Chappelle, playin' Princeton, shoot the jay.

Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal
Now speed up, gas pedal, gas pedal, gas pedal

And I hope that she ain't looking for no prince charming
Charm yo ass in the cab on the next morning
Tell the driver gas pedal, yo Suzy I got cash to blow
Follow the leader, in high school I was an under-achiever
Made haters believers, or beliebers, look at me sir
Went from nobodies to 20k for a feature
Eat your heart out used to take the BART out
To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out
When you walk in the building the bitches run out
It should be already platinum before it come out
We should do it major look in the eyes of my haters they say

Slow down, grab the wall

Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over

Showed you how to read a map

Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down

And your legs and your arms just to harness you up

Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied

You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kind of hard to face
Like actual facts and flat-earthers

And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one could change from one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly same, it's macro, micro
Crack your ad and let your light glow
One day you can be the king of pop
And the next one just be wack ol' Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Ooh, don't lose your self esteem
I apologise, for being a man

For a fall, for a flaw, for the end

Could you talk to quiet my fears
Could you pull me aside

Justin Guarini,"How much time has passed since you said goodbye.
Got your message today asking how am I,
Well I'm doing just fine.
To admit the truth,
Hasn't crossed my mind.
All I needed was some time,
Was it always this strong
I remember all how I cried

The night that you said goodbye,
You expected me to die.
But I made a brand new start,
And got on with my life
I did what I had to do,
To get myself over you
I'm not falling apart.
You underestimate the condition of my heart

There was a time
You were every breath of mine
I was ready to give the rest of my life
You walked away,
And now you're saying you can walk right back into my life
Like nothing happened and I won't put up a fight.
No, you left me all alone
I wanna know, where were you when I cried?

The night that you said goodbye,
You expected me to die.
But I made a brand new start,
And got on with my life
I did what I had to do,
To get myself over you
I'm not falling apart.
You underestimate the condition of my heart

I think you said all that you need to say
Cause it's not gonna matter anyway
Am I getting through to you,
I've heard it all before
And now you've changed your mind
You lost your only chance.
When you said goodbye
I wanna know,
Where were you when I cried?

The night that you said goodbye
You expected me to die.

And got on with my life

And you told me we had the power
And you told me this was the hour
That you don't know how
If I could show you now

Well I dreamed last night
You were calling, calling my name
You were locked inside of you secrets
Calling my name

And you told me, lost, was the key
And you told me, how you long to be free
That you don't know how
Oh, let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms, that have found you

Don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Oh, don't be afraid

If there's a time and a place to begin love
It must be now
Let it go, set it free

Oh, I dreamed last night
I was hearing, hearing your voice
Why did you say those things
That have left me, left me no choice?

When you told me, we had the power
Why did you tell me, now, was the hour
But you don't know how
Oh, let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms that have found you

Oh, don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Don't be afraid

If there's a time and a place to begin love
It must be now
Let it go, set it free

Oh, I dreamed last night
I was hearing, hearing your voice

If you could cast a little light on someone
It's not too soon
You took me halfway round the world

My true friend
If you could tell me what it is that keeps you

The less I see you

So far
Cross a wild and windy sea
So far
That our voices are divided by an ocean

Sleepless are the hours
And lonely is the night
For the poor tormented soul
Who is searching for the light

This morning
I opened my eyes
I knew from the silence
That something was wrong
Turning I realised
I wanted to cry
When I knew I was alone

But where will you go
And who will be your guide
And which way will you turn
The waters are so wide
'cause I never told you
No you'll never really know
I need you so

Now the sun is rising on your freedom my child
Is there none of your love alive?

I don't want to leave

'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. 
The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here
'Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, 
More and more people joined the painful exodus. 
Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, 
Their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. 

Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, 
And here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, 
Cutting through bridges as though they were paper. 
Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, 
Had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. 
This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, 
Without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. 

It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. 
I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. 
At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. 
At that very moment, it was raised, 
And I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Justin Hayward,"At midnight, on the 12th of August
A huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth
Across two hundred million miles of void 
Invisibly hurtling towards us
Came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth

As I watched, there was another jet of gas
It was another missile, starting on its way
And that's how it was for the next ten nights
A flare, spurting out from Mars
Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it

A beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight 
Ogilby, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger
He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote
Forbidding planet

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said (ah, ah)
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come

Then came the night the first missile approached Earth 
It was thought to be an ordinary falling star
But next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the common
And Ogilby came to examine what lay there

A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot 
With faint sounds of movement coming from within 
Suddenly the top began moving: rotating, unscrewing
And Ogilby feared there was a man inside trying to escape 

He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him before 
He could burn himself on the metal

The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, he said (ah, ah)
The chances of anything coming from Mars
Are a million to one, but still, they come",The Eve of the War,1981
Justin Hayward,"Where did we go wrong
We had all the magic to put us on our way
And all the tragedy that we ever want to see
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come

Where did we go wrong
Was it so enlightening we couldn't find our way?
All so frightening
We couldn't see which move to make
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come

And if you leave me now
Like you say you might
Oh please don't leave me now
'cause I know, if you do
None of this will come true so

Where do we go now
Now your heart is aching
And leading you astray
Me I'm burning up
Tryin' to get you to stay
'cause you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come
And you know the best is still to come

And if you leave me now
Like you say you might
Oh please don't leave me now
'cause I know, if you do
None of this will come true, so

Where did we go wrong
We had all the magic to put us on our way
And all the tragedy, that we ever want to see
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come
And you know the best is yet to come

Justin Hayward,"Why worry? It's alright, 
I'm with you through the night, 
I've listened to your dreams, 
I feel the presence that you've seen.
 
Step out of the darkness 
And into the light. 
The words of the promise 
That was made were right: 

No tears and no trouble, 
No heartache, no pain. 
I know that we're going to be one again. 

Still waters run so deep, 
The world listens when you speak. 
One nation of the free 
All believing that there'll be 

No troubles, no hunger, 
No heartache, no pain. 
I know that we're living to be one again. 
Walk out of the darkness 
And into the sun, 
And wake to the morning 

When we live as one. 
Step out of the darkness 
And into the light. 
The fire that we've kindled 

Is burning bright. 
The dawn of tomorrow 
Comes back to today. 
We'll capture that moment 
And we'll fly away.",One Again,1985
Justin Hayward,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night

Justin Hayward,"The summer sun is fading as the year grows old
And darker days are drawing near
The winter winds will be much colder
Now you're not here.
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn
'Cause you're not here!",Forever Autumn,1994
Justin Hayward,"Spring was never waiting for us, girl 
It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed 
In love's hot, fevered iron 
Like a striped pair of pants 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took too long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

I still see the yellow cotton dress 
Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
And the birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers and the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the love of my life 
You still be the one
You keep wondering wanna know why

Justin Hayward,"Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls

I guess I've got everything I need
I wouldn't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born

And I need a good woman
To make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
Oh, but I would be if I could

I could tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times I've cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
And how I wish I was in love",Man of the World,1994
Justin Hayward,"We went to the room and we bolted the door,
The bass from the jukebox was coming through the floor,
And out through the walls we could still hear the roar of the trains.
Was this all the comfort we got for our sins?
No candles, no waiters, no soft violins?
A dirty electric convector plugged into the mains.

I had wanted much more for the first night with you,
But the railway hotel was the best I could do.
I knew the Savoy would have suited you well,
But the best I could do was the railway hotel.

Away in the sky were the lights of a jet,
Burning in the night like a slow cigarette.
The lamp in the street threw a soft silhouette on the wall.
And though it was crumbling and rundown and dead
A chair and a sink and an old single bed,
The love we began and the things that we said, I recall.

Justin Hayward,"Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
For once she was a true love of mine

Have her make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without no seam nor fine needle work
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all with a basket of flowers
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Have her wash it in yonder dry well
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
where water ne'er sprung nor drop of rain fell
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Have her find me an acre of land
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the sea foam and over the sand
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Plow the land with the horn of a lamb
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Then sow some seeds from north of the dam
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And then she'll be a true love of mine

If she tells me she can't, I'll reply
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Let me know that at least she will try
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Love imposes impossible tasks
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Though not more than any heart asks
And I must know she's a true love of mine

Dear, when thou has finished thy task
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Come to me, my hand for to ask
For thou then art a true love of mine",Scarborough Fair,1994
Justin Hayward,"People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute

She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up

I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears",The Tracks of My Tears,1994
Justin Hayward,"Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and gray
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue

Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left inside
On that starry, starry night

You took your life as lovers often do
But I could have told you Vincent
This world was never meant for one as
Beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hang in empty halls
Frame less heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

",Vincent,1994
