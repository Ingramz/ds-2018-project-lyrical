Bill & Gloria Gaither,"Sleigh bells ring, are you listening, 
In the lane, snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight, 
Walking in a winter wonderland. 

Gone away is the bluebird 
Here to stay is a new bird 
He sings a love song, as we go along, 
Walking in a winter wonderland. 

In the meadow we can build a snowman 
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown 
He'll say, are you married? 
We'll say, no man, 
But you can do the job 
When you're in town 
Later on, we'll conspire 
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made, 
Walking in a winter wonderland. 

Later on, we'll conspire 
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made, 
Walking in a winter wonderland. 

In the meadow we can build a snowman, 
And pretend that he's Charlie Brown 
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman 
Until all the other children knock him down. 

When it snows, ain't it thrilling 
Though your nose gets a chilling 
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way, 
Walking in a winter wonderland. 
Walking in a winter wonderland",Winter Wonderland,1997
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will save our sons and daughters?

Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will calm a storm with His hand?

Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod?
When you kissed your little baby
You've kissed the face of God

The blind will see, the deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will one day rule the nations?

Did you know that your baby boy
Is Heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the great 'I Am'","Mary, Did You Know? [Version]",1997
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night [Version],1997
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"Jesus Jesus Jesus
There's something about that name
Master savior Jesus
It's like the fragrance after rain

Jesus Jesus Jesus
Let Heaven and Earth proclaim
Kings and kingdoms will all pass away
There is something about that name

We Love the name
The holy name
Your precious name

Bill & Gloria Gaither,"The marketplace is empty,
No more traffic in the streets,
All the builders' tools are silent,
No more time to harvest wheat,
Busy housewives cease their labors,
In the courtroom no debate,
Work on earth is all suspended
As the King comes thro' the gate.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

Happy faces line the hallways,
Those whose lives have been redeemed,
Broken homes that He has mended,
Those from prison He has freed,
Little children and the aged
Hand in hand stand all aglow,
Who were crippled, broken, ruined,
Clad in garments white as snow.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

I can hear the chariots rumble,
I can see the marching throng,
The flurry of God's trumpets
Spells the end of sin and wrong:
Regal robes are now unfolding,
Heaven's grandstand's all in place,
Heaven's choir now assembled,
Start to sing ""Amazing Grace!""

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!",The King Is Coming,1998
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"The love of God has been extended
To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

The love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Oh, the love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

His power is eternal, eternal
His glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love Of God, precious love of God
",The Love of God,1999
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"Shackled by a heavy burden,
'Neath a load of guilt and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
And now I am no longer the same

He touched me, oh He touched me,
And oh the joy that floods my soul!
Something happened and now I know,
He touched me and made me whole

Since I met this blessed Savior,
Since He cleansed and made me whole,
I will never cease to praise Him,
I'll shout it while eternity rolls

He touched me, oh He touched me,
And oh the joy that floods my soul!

He touched me and made me whole",He Touched Me,1999
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed

Through many dangers toils and snares I have already come
Tis grace that has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me on

When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun
And than when we first begun",Amazing Grace,2000
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it can buy
Don't they know, on Judgment Day
Gold and silver gonna melt away?

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
Deny my god and doom my soul

What good is gold and silver too
When your heart is not good and true?
Sinner, hear, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

Sinner, hear, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

Sinner, hear, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray",A House of Gold,2000
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"I am weak but Thou art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee let it be dear Lord let it be
When my feeble life is o'er time for me will be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er to Thy kingdom shore to Thy shore
Just a closer walk with Thee",Just a Closer Walk With Thee,2000
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"There's a line that is drawn through the ages
On that line stands an old rugged cross
On that cross, a battle is raging
Or the gain a man's soul or it's loss

On one side, march the forces of evil
All the demons, and all the devils of hell
On the other, the angels of glory
And they meet on Golgotha's hill

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict
And the sun refuses to shine
There hangs God's son, in the balance
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over
It is finished, there'll be no more war
It is finished, the end of the conflict
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was raging
Not all prisoners of war had come home
These were battlefields of my own making
I didn't know that the war had been won

Then I heard the king of the ages
Had fought all the battles for me
And that victory was mine for the claiming
And now praise his name, I am free

It is finished, the battle is over
It is finished, there'll be no more war
It is finished, the end of the conflict
It is finished and, Jesus is Lord",It Is Finished,2000
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"I've got that old time religion
Got that old time religion
That is why I'm satisfied

Well, you may ask me if I'm happy
If I have sweet peace within
If I'm worried about tomorrow
When I reach my journey's end

Well, I'm satisfied with my Jesus
And when He knocks I'm gonna let Him in
And He'll go with me through the valley
For I know He is my friend

Satisfied, satisfied
No trouble can ever get me down

With my Jesus I'll be at rest
Then you'll know I'm satisfied

I've got that old time religion

If my friends they all forsake me
And they turn me from their door
If they sow no seeds of kindness
Make the thorns in my path grow

Well, it won't matter over yonder
When I reach that other side
Well, I'm gonna sit down with my Jesus
Satisfied, I'm satisfied

Bill & Gloria Gaither,"I'm not on an ego trip I'm nothing on my own I made mistakes I often slip 
Just common flesh and bones 
But I'll prove someday just why I say 
I'm of a special kind 
For when he was on the cross 
I was on his mind. 
 
The look of love was on his face 
Thrones were on his head 
The blood was on his scarlet robe 
Stained a crimson red 
Though his eyes were on the crowd that day 
He looked ahead in time 
For when he was on the cross 
I was on his mind. 

He knew me, yet he loved me 
He whose glory makes the heavens shine 
So unworthy of such mercy 
Yet when he was on the cross 
I was on his mind.

Bill & Gloria Gaither,"There was a holy hush all over 
As I walked into the room
And as I stood to see Him face to face 
I was gloriously made new
There was a great and awesome presence
And a light as bright as any day
And as I bowed to kneel with the angels 
I heard the Spirit say

All rise, All rise
To stand before the throne 
In the presence of the Holy One
All rise, All rise
As we worship the Messiah
All Rise

Then I looked at those all around me
With their hands uplifted high
Then the Spirit laid His hands on me
And I uplifted mine
And He was singing alleluias
And praises to His name
And as I bowed to kneel with the angels 
I heard the Spirit say

All rise, All rise
To stand before the throne 
In the presence of the Holy One
All rise, All rise

Singing holy, holy, holy
Worthy is the Lamb
Who was and is and is to come

Bill & Gloria Gaither,"I was takin' a trip on a plane the other day
Just wishing that I could get out.
When the man next to me saw the book in my hand
And asked me what it was about.
So I settled back in my seat-
""A best seller,"" I said.
""A history, a mystery in one.""
And then I opened up the book and began to read
From Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

He was born of a virgin one holy night
In the little town of Bethlehem.
Angels gathered round him underneath the stars
Singing praises to the great I Am.
He walked on the water, healed the lame and made the blind to see again.
And for the first time here on earth we learned that God could be a friend.
And though he never ever did a single thing wrong
The angry crowd chose him. And then he walked down the road
And died on the cross and that was the end of the beginning.

""That's not a new book that's a bible,"" he said, ""and I've heard it all before.
I've tried religion- its shame and guilt and I don't need it anymore.
It's superstition, made up tales and just to help the weak to survive.""
""Let me read it again,"" I said, ""listen closely, 'cause this is gonna change your life.

""The end of the beginning,"" he said with a smile.
""What more could there be? He's dead.
You said they hung him, put nails in His hands
And a crown of thorns on His head.""
I said, ""I'll read it again but this time there's more,
And I believe that this is true.

Aishiteru
Ani ohevet othka, I love you

The sounds are all as different
As the lands from which they came
And though our words are all unique
Our hearts are still the same

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Love in any language, straight from the heart
Pulls us all together, never apart

Bill & Gloria Gaither,"Deep within the heart has always known that there was freedom
Somehow breathed into the very soul of life
The prisoner, the powerless, the slave have always known it
There's something that keeps reaching for the sky

And even life begins because a baby fights for freedom
And songs we love to sing have freedom's theme
Some have walked through fire and flood to find a place of freedom
And some faced hell itself for freedom's dream

Let freedom ring wherever minds know what it means to be in chains
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
We can be free and we can sing, let freedom ring

God built freedom into every fiber of creation
And He meant for us to all be free and whole
When my Lord bought freedom with the blood of His redemption
His cross stamped pardon on my very soul

I'll sing it out with every breath, I'll let the whole world hear it
This hallelujah anthem of the free
That iron bars and heavy chains can never hold us captive
The Son has made us free and free indeed

Let freedom ring down through the ages from a hill called Calvary
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key

Bill & Gloria Gaither,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,

But I know I can make it, for I trust in thee

For Thee all the follies of sin I resign;
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;
If ever I love Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
(Oh my saviour) If ever I love Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

It is now (if ever I love my Saviour, 'tis now etc)

Why we pull away from each other so easily
Even though we're all walking the same road
Yet we build dividing walls between our brothers and ourselves

But I, I don't care what label you may wear

And we can change this world forever
If you will join with me, join and sing

Oh you're my brother, you're my sister
So take me by the hand
Together we will work until He comes
There's no foe that can defeat us
When we're walking side by side
As long as there is love we will stand

The day will come when we will be as one
And with a mighty voice together
We will proclaim that Jesus, Jesus is King
And it will echo through the earth
It will shake the nations and the world will see, see that

You were there with me
We walked along the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard the angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw a young man
He was smiling as he came

He said friend, you may not know me now
But then he said but wait
You used to teach my Sunday school
When I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One morning when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

As far as the eye could see
Each one somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done, sacrifices made
Unnoticed on the earth, heaven now proclaims
And I know up in heaven
That you're not supposed to cry
But I was almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
And He said my child look around you
For great is your reward

Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress
Watched in pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth

I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

Bill & Gloria Gaither & Their Homecoming Friends,"The marketplace is empty,
No more traffic in the streets,
All the builders' tools are silent,
No more time to harvest wheat,
Busy housewives cease their labors,
In the courtroom no debate,
Work on earth is all suspended
As the King comes thro' the gate.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

Happy faces line the hallways,
Those whose lives have been redeemed,
Broken homes that He has mended,
Those from prison He has freed,
Little children and the aged
Hand in hand stand all aglow,
Who were crippled, broken, ruined,
Clad in garments white as snow.

O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
I just heard the trumpets sounding,
And now His face I see,
O the King is coming,
The King is coming!
Praise God, He's coming for me!

I can hear the chariots rumble,
I can see the marching throng,
The flurry of God's trumpets
Spells the end of sin and wrong:
Regal robes are now unfolding,
Heaven's grandstand's all in place,
Heaven's choir now assembled,
Start to sing ""Amazing Grace!""

The King is coming!

And now His face I see,

Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.

Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone. 
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,

You were there with me
We walked along the streets of gold
Beside the crystal sea
We heard the angels singing
Then someone called your name
You turned and saw a young man
He was smiling as he came

He said friend, you may not know me now
But then he said but wait
You used to teach my Sunday school
When I was only eight
Every week you would say a prayer
Before the class would start
One morning when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

Then another man stood before you
And said remember the time
A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry
You didn't have much money
But you gave it anyway
Jesus took the gift you gave
And that's why I'm here today

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed
Thank you for giving to the Lord

Each one somehow touched
By your generosity
Little things that you had done, sacrifices made
Unnoticed on the earth, heaven now proclaims
And I know up in heaven
That you're not supposed to cry
But I was almost sure
There were tears in your eyes
As Jesus took your hand
And you stood before the Lord
And He said my child look around you
For great is your reward

Bill & Gloria Gaither & Their Homecoming Friends,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.

For an end it all celebration

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I'll keep remembering forever and ever I'll love you dear as long as I live

I haven't forgotten I wonder if you have or if your heart is full of regret

Bill Anderson,"In the twilight glow I see her blue eyes crying in the rain
As we kissed goodbye and parted I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair has turned to silver all my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder we'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting and no blue eyes crying in the rain",Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,1962
Bill Anderson,"I have the invitation that you sent me you wanted me to see yoy change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another I hope that you'll be happy just the same
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel that should be ringing now for you and me
And down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me
[ steel ]
I planned a little cottage in the valley I even bought a little band of gold
I hope someday to place it on your finger but now the future looks so dark and cold
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses a blossom from an orange tree in your hair
And as the organ plays I'll love you truly just let me pretend that I am there
Wedding bells they say will ring in heaven as the angel chorus sweetly sings
But as long as I am on this earth dear those wedding bells for me will never ring

Bill Anderson,"IN CASE YOU EVER CHANGE YOUR MIND
Writer Bill Anderson
RECORDED BY CONNIE SMITH

(I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind
In case you ever change your mind)
She came down from the mansion on the mountain
She kissed you and she handed you a line
I begged you not to go I said darling don't forget me
In case you ever change your mind
Yes the grass grows greener on the mountain
And the berries grow redder on the vine
But the candle still glows in the window in the valley
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind and long to hold the love you left behind
I'll be waiting till the end of time in case you ever change your mind
(In case you ever change your mind)
Are the stars any bigger on the mountain is the sun any brighter when it shines
Would comin' back to me be like steppin' down from heaven
In case you ever change your mind
Just in case you ever change your mind...
Just in case you ever change your mind



",In Case You Ever Change Your Mind,1964
Bill Anderson,"In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
Anyplace is all right long as I'm with you
In a faraway land by the trophic sea sand if your hand's in my hand I won't be blue
Way up on the mountain a way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy anyplace anywhere I don't care
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
Anyplace is all right long as you are there

I could be happy in one little room with only a table and a chair
As happy as I'd be in a kingdom by the sea darling if you were there
And I could be rich or I could be poor in fact if you were by my side
I could be anything in the whole wide world and I know I'd be satisfied
Way up on the mountain...
In the misty moonlight by the flickering firelight
Anyplace is all right long as you are there




",In the Misty Moonlight,1964
Bill Anderson,"In your haste you left and said you'd be returning
In my sorrow I forgot to ask you when
In my lonely room I sit and count the hours
Every minute hopin' I'll look up and you'll come walkin' in
For then and only then will I stop crying
And this aching breaking heart of mind will mend
Not until I feel your arms around me
Will I be happy and I live for then and only then
[ steel ]
All that's left inside my heart is just an echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some day
You'll remember where you left me and come back for me again
For then and only then...
And I live for then and only then




",Then and Only Then,1964
Bill Anderson,"If there's water in the desert sand out in the sea
If you were not an angel sweet as you can be
You could turn the night to day make all my dreams come true
Say how far it is to heaven then I'll stop loving you
If the earth is up above us stars are down below
If there are daisies in the desert roses in the snow
If today can be tomorrow if old things can be new
If you can live without a heartbeat then I'll stop loving you
There's no daisies in the desert no roses in the snow
The earth is not above us the stars are not below
Today can't be tomorrow old things can't be new
I can't live without a heartbeat and I can't stop loving you




",Then I'll Stop Loving You,1964
Bill Anderson,"The one I love found another she ran away with my best friend
Came home last night for just an hour daylight came she's gone again
Well you can have her I don't want her she never loved me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with but all I wanted was love to stay

Well if you get the wrong woman there's only one thing you can do
Just dig a hole crawl right in it and pull the ground in after you
Well you can have her

Life without love is mighty empty when you've got no one that you can hold

Bill Anderson,"I'm five hundred miles away from home
Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
I didn't even have to pack I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home
Away from home away from home cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home

I know this is the same road I took the day I left home
But it sure looks different now cause I guess I look different too
Cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way
Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Bill Anderson,"Love is full of happiness but love is full of dangers
The very best of sweethearts and became the best of strangers

I only knew that your two lips could kiss and whisper sweet
I never stopped to think that those two lips could also cheat
Your precious love was mine at least that's what I told myself
Until I found you in the arms of someone else
I only saw the happiness I overlooked the dangers
Until the best of sweethearts became the best of strangers
And now they see us in the crowd and think we've never met
Each time they introduce us makes it harder to forget
But you keep on pretending I'm somebody you don't know
I'm not the stranger but the one who loves you so
Love is full of happiness...

And I've worked in three all night service stations and drove a truck
Take me home my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
Take me home I don't want to roam no more

Well I've slept all night in a water trough
Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
I had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
And I can't count the times that I've had a cold (and a sore throat)
Not to mention all the times that I've cut my fingers on a sardine can
Take me home...

Well I can just see 'em all gatherin' round
Mama's supper table as the sun goes down
And my dear old daddy when the blessing is said
Fillin' up his plate with black eyed peas (and side meat)
And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's hot buttered cornbread

You don't have to be a baby to cry
All you need is for love to go wrong

Or to lay awake the whole night long
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart full of tears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes what should I lie

And since you've found someone new I think it's best
I don't cry and walk the floor I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you anyless

You drained my heart of all its love with every sweet caress
I keep saying o'er and o'er I don't love you anymore
Trouble is I don't love you any less

Cause while I stayed at home someone else took you out
I cried cause I love you with all of my might
And I missed me how I missed me at your house last night
I missed holding hands walking out on your lawn
I missed the sweet kiss that was mine for so long
Were you happy with new arms wrapped around you so tight
While I missed me how I missed me at your house last night

Did the neighbors say they noticed anything strange
Like a different car parked in your drive for a change
Did they watch as he kissed you beneath the porch light

",I Missed Me,1965
Bill Anderson,"Well I spent the better part of my life on a Mississippi riverboat
I used to be known from coast to coast as the slickest gambler afloat
I've dealt the cards from Minnesota to the harbor at New Orleans

Riverboat riverboat I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart stead of in the Memphis jail

Well a big man got on the riverboat our last time in St Paul
He had a lotta money but his luck went bad and the riverboat won it all

But before that gambler lunged at me my forty-four took his life

Well they came on the boat and they took me to jail when we got to Tennessee

My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many nights he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw Michigan the daughter of a wealthy wealthy man
But he called me that son of a Saginaw fisherman
And he said I wadn't good enough to claim his daughter's hand
That's why I'm up here in Alaska lookin' around for gold
Like a crazy fool I'm diggin' in the frozen ground so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw Michigan

I wrote my love in Saginaw Michigan I said honey I'm comin' home please wait for me
You can tell your dad I'm coming back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondyke history

He gave me a great big party and we drank champagne
Then he said son you're a wise young ambitious man
Don'tcha wanna sell your father-in-law your Klondyke claim
And now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold cold ground
The greedy fool is a lookin' for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missing him

We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw Michigan

I've been a restless reckless run around
Now something tells me you won't let me leave but one time more
So before my feet start walking tie me down
Nail my shoes to the floor...

I guess I really love you and I'd die if we should part
But I'm so weak and so incline to roam

From the words of my every day not a reproach but a song

But most of all I love you cause you're you)

And for laying firm hold on the possibilities of a good in me

And you've done it without a word

As sure as night is dark and day is light I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right because you're mine I walk the line

She read me her Bible like she used to do I dreamed about mama last night
Mama used to never go to sleep at night until all of us were in bed
On party nights till we come home she often sat up and read
We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
Just how much mama worried when children were away
We only knew that she never slept when we were out at night
That she waited just to know that we were all gonna come home alright
Why sometimes we'd stayed away till one or two or three
And I used to think that mama could hear the turning of the key
For we'd step aside and she'd call and we'd reply
But we were all too young back then to understand just why
But up until the last one had returned mama always kept a light
She couldn't go to sleep until she kissed us all goodnight
I think mama just had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
She seemed to fear that the world might harm the ones that she loved the best
One time she told me when you're grown to women and to men
I'll sleep the whole night through I bet I'll be different then
And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's care
Then always when we got back home we'd find her waiting there
And then came the night that we were called together round her bed
The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said
And in her eyes there gleamed again that old time tender light
That told that she's just been waitin' to know that we were all alright
She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to keep
Her children safe from harm throughout the years then mama went to sleep

It's as dark as the night but my eyes see a light just down by the river side
There's a light at the river a light at the river a light at the river I can see
My Lord will stand and hold in his hand a light at the river for me

But the beckoning light leads me on through the night
To the waters where my soul may be cleansed

Then we'll pass o'er deep and you'll never more weep in your home on the other side

(Bill Anderson)
Â« Â© '58 Moss Rose Publications Â»

(It's not the end of everything)
Just because my love has gone
Don't think my life would still go on
Because she wanted to have her fling
It's not the end of everything
The world still turns the sun still shines
There's plenty of girls for hearts like mine
One never knows what tomorrow might bring
It's not the end of everything
Just look at the things I still possess
Like a heart that's filled with emptiness
A life of pure unhappiness
Two arms that hold just loneliness
My rooms overflow with blue blue songs
I think of the nights I can spend all alone
And all of the days I can just sit and dream
It's not the end of everything

Bill Anderson,"When I stood on the top of a high high mountain
And watched the sun rise in the dawn
I walked by aside a cold cold river and heard the nightingale song
I once saw the king of a mighty nation the princess and I had a conversation
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you
I salied many times in a deep deep ocean watched waters roll on many sands
Spent a night just a looking at a high high heaven and marvel that God's mighty hand
I tremble like a baby when I see a snowfall
Or standing in the forrest where the trees're so tall
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you

Through the small port window of a big main whiner I watched the cities rush by
And the gay shining wings of a great steel eagle were just aburn in the sky
Well I walked by myself in the low low valley that every man could do
But the great big thrill of my whole life was falling in love with you

On the mountain side
Where I built a fire and held you close
While it snowed outside
And remember you let me sleep all day

Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right

Up above the bar hung a big guitar like none I'd ever seen
The neck was set with diamonds and though the strings were old
Like Kings of Sound they wound around six keys of solid gold
A man stepped up beside me his breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged to a mighty close pal of mine
He used to play it right here I forget the year around '45 I think
Ha I could tell you quite a story friend if you'd care to buy me a drink

Well I possessed by every weakness that takes a man a fool
I bought a round he drank it down and then he rocked back on his stool
He said yeah I remember now it was '45 alright
He just returned from the Great War that's where he lost his sight
His buddies gave him that guitar at the time it was simple and plain
He added the gold and the diamonds as he played his way to fame
He was doing a show in Shreveport the night he received a call
To come appear on the Grand Ole Opry the greatest show at all
[ ac.guitar ]
I was driving him to Nashville it was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed I swear Mister I never saw that train
I heard the doctor tell him just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm it could have been your life
But he died that night life just demanded more than he could give
I think he couldn've made it he just lost his will to live
But this world's loss is heaven's gain and tonight he's still a star

Of the old homeplace where I grew up of the days both good and bad
My overalls were hand-me-downs my shoes were full of holes

I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed

And yet and yet our homefire never flickered once
'Cause when all these things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)

And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long

And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man

But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)

Oh for ninety-nine years I'll watch the sunrise over that some old sea
Ninety-nine years nothing but an empty cell for company
Yet there's not very much that stands between me and the freedom I hold dear
Just a thousand bars a big brick wall and a sentence of ninety-nine years

I kissed my darling on her tender lips and they took me by the hand
I had a nice little ride on a ferry boat to the rock where the prison stands
The warden said as he locked the door I hope you'll like it here
Just make yourself a home you're gonna be with us ninety-nine years
I've almost forgotten what my real name is been a number for so long
Making little bitty rocks out of great big rocks gets old as the days wear on

Guess I didn't understand please forgive me papa
You can't paint a picture of a man like papa with something as empty as words
'Cause there's no way to measure the thoughness of timber

And compare it to the softness of birds
Papa was both and yet he was neither just a hard working God fearing soul
He gave what he had to the ones that he loved and I guess he loved me best of all
For I was the oldest and we were the closest we worked that old farm side by side

I guess that's the reason it hit me the hardest the morning that my papa died
All I could think of was how hard he'd worked and what little comfort he'd found
I guess that's the reason I hitched up the mule and drove the old buggy to town
I picked out a lot in the big cemetery in the shade of a tall maple tree

Figured it's the least I could do for my papa
After all the things that he's done for me
We gave him a funeral fit for a king and then we laid him to rest in the sod
Somehow I thought that in that big pretty place he just might feel closer to God

The women were crying as they passed by papa the men stopped and all shook my hand
Most of the mourness had gone when I looked up and noticed this white haired old man
He was dressed kinda shabby and he walked with a cane his voice was shaky and low
I had to look twice before I rocognized him he used to work for us a long time ago

They told me this morning that the big boss had died
And I thought that I should come around
I went out to the homeplace to tell him goodbye
They told me that you done brought him to town

He wanted to be burried out dare on that farm
He said there wadn't nowhere else that he could rest

I scooped up some dirt from up near the farmhouse
And thought that I'd just bring it back

And that's what it's like to be lonesome with a heart a broken love taught to cry
And that's what it's like to be lonesome I know cause I'm a mighty lonesome guy

You search to find a tavern where the music is playing loud
You try to lose your heartaches in the laughter of the crowd
But the happy couples make you think of things that might have been
And you have to fight the teardrops till you're by yourself again
And that's what it's like...",That's What It's Like to Be Lonesome,1969

I just kissed the one I love for the last time
Never have her soft lips been so sweet
She's gone away and won't be back forever

Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Not because I'm sad but 'cause I'm weak
I can't stand the thought of life alone without her

Think I'll go somewhere and cry myself to sleep
Just before she said goodbye she called me darling
And slowly ran her fingers down my cheek
I thought I'd die when she said she still love me

With soft words I whispered your name
I held you right on the tip of my fingers
But that was as close as I came

My eyes had a vision of sweet lips
Yielding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands
But I let it slip right through my hands

And I should have known from the start

Plane takes off at eleven and I gotta be there on time

Don't want no one to know I'm slippin' out of town on a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend gonna have a wild weekend
With the pretty little blond haired blue eyed darling gonna have a wild weekend

Well we might go up to the mountains we might go down to the sea
Somewhere off from the big wide world just my baby and me
Baby's gonna cook me breakfast baby's gonna tuck me in
Baby's gonna warm my cold cold lips with kisses on a wild weekend
Gonna have a wild weekend...

I guess we'll talk about the future make a lotta plans and stuff
Mostly though we're just gonna sit by the fire and make a lotta love

Bill Anderson,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

And it's knowing I'm not shacked by forgotten words and boons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted
On their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the back roads by the rivers of my memory
For hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurgling crackling caltron
In some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat
That pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands around a tin
Can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my memory
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind
",Gentle on My Mind,1969
Bill Anderson,"Lost in long and warm ago
I just caressed a memory and took it from my mind it fell around me like a gentle glow
A smile of sadness curved my lips my thoughts rushed back in time
To when you loved me long and warm ago
The breeze that cooled our faces is now an icy wind
It chills me to the bone and makes me know
That nothing is forever and everything must end
And be just a part of long and warm ago
We tasted of the rain we trusted in the sun
We talked of holding hands when we grew old
But you left and now tomorrow like yesterday is gone lost in long and warm ago

Bill Anderson,"Children play ring around a rosie laugh and sing like you always do
Children play ring around a rosie mommy will be home in a day or two
Remember the story I read to you when I tucked you in last night
About the pretty princess who loved the party life

Well that's the way that mommy is but she'll be home after while
So dry your tears my little ones and give your daddy a smile
Children play ring around a rosie...
Mommy's away at the castle now where party people go

Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top lookin' for a moonshine still

Sleep come over me let me rest and dream awhile
I want to dream of two young lovers holding hands

The dreams that I used to dream way back when
All the things that could and should've been before the eternal sadness set in
Sleep sweet and deep let me rest and dream awhile

It's barely twelve o'clock but I've already spent a lifetime

We're man and wife we might as well be friends
You don't kiss me like you used to kiss me
Sometimes I take that there must be somebody new
And when I come home at night you act like you didn't even miss me
Lately honey I've even had my doubts about you

We used to talk of our ambitions and our dreams
But lately we've been takin' our love for granted
We have time for everything except each other it seems

We used to talk together remember
And we used to do things crazy things I guess
Like just walking around lookin' in windows
When we knew we couldn't buy anything
Not with the baby comin' at all
And sometimes when it rained you'd sit beside me
And we'd race raindrops down the window pane
You'd bring me coffee and we'd work crossword puzzles together
We don't do anything together now
And late at night remember we used to sit outside
And we'd watch the clouds scurrin' across the moon
And the fishing trips you never did like fishing but you did anyway
I loved you for it and dreams all I must've had a million of 'em
Big dreams and plans and you used to look at me and you say
You'll make it I know you will and I believed it cause you believed it
You had faith in me and you always gave me the strength that I needed
But now it's over I used to look at your hair
I used to hold you and kiss you I used to
It was a stupid reason for an argument
We'd have a million of 'em before but this time you just ran out
And when the phone rang and they told me
Oh I'd've given anything if it'd be me instead
I'll be back tomorrow honey I'll bring more flowers
You always did like flowers

Bill Anderson,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

A sign on the door read Melinda's and I asked myself if I should stop
For I knew a girl named Melinda when I lived here years ago
And I wondered if by chance it could be the Melinda I used to know
So I peeked in through the window and there to my surprise
I saw my darling Melinda and a tear came to my eyes
For she looked lovely as always as I watched her standing there
Her face was like an angel's with a halo of golden hair

Then I slowly remembered how she suffered the shame
Of being left with a baby and me never changing her name

About the year on the street

[Chorus]
And it's not my fault, I can find my way
Yeah it's not my fault, there goes another day
I've been here too long, do I have to change
Into what it takes
To make it number one? 

I feel out of favour
I don't look like a picture
You think I'm a loser,
But I can see through you
You're running around like you're running the country
I know that you think that you've got one on me
Ear to the ground, like the boy about town
Can't get nothing to fit me 

[Chorus]

Got a call from an old friend, used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Sold his house, sold his car
Bought a ticket to the West Coast

Bill Anderson,"Sometimes I get restless Lord I hate to go home
Tired of livin' with someone and afraid of livin' alone
What an urge to be free now but I'm so used to my chains
I don't know what I want Lord I just want my life to change

And I don't want to stay in the comfort of my empty yesterdays
If I can't find some peace of mind I gotta keep moving gotta keep moving
Yes I spoke of loving but that's all I meant to say
Didn't mean forever no more that I meant a day

I was talkin' about feeling girl not possession of my soul
But you want something more babe you want someone you can hold
And I don't want to stay...

Bill Anderson,"To a boy who grew up walking in the woods and the fields of South Carolina
This big ole city feels hard underneath my feet
And to a kid who ain't never heard a noise a whole lot louder than a freight train
I get scared sometimes just standing here along the street
Concrete concrete everywhere I turn there's concrete
Found in the pavement day after day I wanna go home
Where the sun shines and the tall pines and the earth and the heavens meet
I'd rather starve on a poor dirt farm than to stay here surrounded by the concrete
Cause it's turnin' me into concrete
My kids ain't never gone wadin' in a creek or cuttin' down cane for fishing
They've never seen a blackberry growin' wild
Sometimes I get to missin' it so I almost take to crying
I'm cursed with the body of a man and the heart of a child
Concrete concrete",Concrete,1975
Bill Anderson,"The leaves have changed from green to golden at least one time and maybe two

In an apron or a nightgown or the wedding dress she wore
She's a perfect angel all the time
You know it's funny how when you first meet a girl

And start likin' her you always see her at her best
All made up her hair just right dressed nicely
And you just assume she's like that 24 hours a day
Then when you get married it's face-cream and body-pins and hair-rollers at night

Makeup eyelashes hairspray in the mornin' 
Soapsuds floorwax and bacon grease through the day

And I miss the arms that held me when all the love was there
I wonder if he is sorry for leaving what we begun

I'll be the woman that you want tomorrow I got to many things to do today
Tomorrow I'll have lots of time to love you and I let it go another day

Say all the words you crave to hear me say

And I told him that I didn't want any other lips touchin' mine
I whispered love your kisses are sweeter than the wine
But I'd never tasted champagne at the time
At the time I didn't know your name and I'd never seen your face
At the time I'd never lost myself in your tender warm embrace
If you've never had filet mignon peanut butter taste just fine
And that's the way it was when I loved him at the time
When I found you I started hearing pretty music I'd never heard
And quietly when we spoke of love it was like I'd learned a brand new word
I once thought I'd seen everything but till I met you I was blind
And I wonder now was I even born at the time
At the time I didn't know your name and I'd never seen your face

For I'd be on the first train I could find
But you love someone else the way I love you

It's enough to make a woman lose her mind

How did my emotions get so single
How did my poor heart become so blind
For I'm in love with one I'll never marry

Everything's dry and ready to burn Lord Lord

The neighbors are cooking out in the backyard

And I saw him at the counter looking lonesome at the rain
I sat down beside him and I ordered us some coffee
He smiled and said
Hello city country is my name and I'm here to play your city game
I saw there in his eyes such a pure and simple beauty
That could not have been bred upon these dark and dingy streets
I liked the look he gave me and I asked him if he'd stay
And he said
Maybe for a while till I get back on my feet and I sure could use a place to sleep

Lay lay country lay on my mind

And the nights we spent in each other's arms
But time brought a change that brought him tossed and tumbled sleep
And I heard him mumble somethin' about a baby and a farm
I've gotta go make sure they're safe and warm
I woke up this morning and I opened up my eyes
Just in time to see him walkin' out the door

'Cause I didn't come from a wealthy family
I guess I learned to take it for most of the year
But every December when Christmas drew near

And all the other families were out spreadin' cheer we was sittin' home being po' folks
Our Christmas shopping was thumblin' through the new catalog
Lookin' and a wishin' and a wantin' everything we saw
Little toy trains and little toy boats and sister kept lookin' at the little girl's coats

We all sat down and wrote Santa a note but Santa don't come to see po' folks
And we wadn't nothing but po' folks
Po' folks livin' way in the country we never heard the jingle of the jingle bells
Ho ho ho we was po po po' and if we had Christmas well we just made it ourselves

Daddy took a hatchet and daddy chopped a pine tree down
The only decorations were the ones we made or found
Brother saw some holly in the rich men's yard he picked it up fast and ran home hard
And mama knew he stole it but bless her heart Christmas ain't easy on po' folks
And it ain't no time for whipping po' folks

I remember one Christmas it was blowing and a snowing mean
Wadn't nothing in the kitchen but a few of mama's homecanned beans
Some ladies from the church brought a basket of food
Mama kinda smiled and she said that's good

But why don't you all just take it to the folks that live down the road
They ain't got as much as we do huh why they're just po' folks
She only kept a chicken and enough to make some homemade bread
But you'd've thought we was feastin' from the blessings that my daddy said

And later when kids was tucked in tight
And the fire wadn't nothin' but a flickering light
You oughta heard my mama sing Silent Night
'Cause that's what you do when you're po' folks and we wadn't nothin' but po' folks

Bill Anderson,"When I first heard this song, I was a little boy growing up
Down in the state of South Carolina
The song had been written and recorded by a man named
T. Texas Tyler

The song in it's original form related to something that
Happened during the second World War
Last year, early in 1991, when things were going kinda crazy
Over on the other side of the world, I remembered this old song

And I rewrote the first part of it to fit the situation
The second part of it I left like it's been all of these years
Because you can't improve upon perfection
I'd like to dedicate this tonight to all the Veterans

To their families, their loved ones
And everybody that loves this country

And a young soldier sat alone in his tent, deep in thought
A picture of his wife and children back home in the United States
Rested on a table nearby

Back to other Sunday mornings that seemed so long ago
Now and so far away, he thought of home
And he knew that when this day dawned in America

His family would go to church to pray for his well-being
And his safe return
The young soldier reached into his bag and he took out
A deck of playing cards

He began to spread them out across his bunk
About that time, one of his buddies came by and said
""You gonna get up a game?"", ""No,"" the soldier replied
""I'm gonna spend a little quiet time with the Lord""

""Looks like to me you're playing cards,"" his friend said
""No, you see, I don't have my Bible and since we can't
Display our religion in public, here, I brought along this deck
Of cards"" and with that, the young boy started his story

You see when I look at the Ace, It reminded me
That there is but one God and the Deuce reminds me that
The Bible is divided into two parts
The Old and the New Testaments

When I look at the Trey, I think of the Father, the Son
And the Holy Ghost
When I see the Four, I'm reminded of the four Evangelists
Who preached the Gospel

There was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
And when I see the Five, I think of the five wise virgins
Who trimmed their lamps, there were ten of them
Five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out

And when I look at the Six, I'm reminded that in six days
God made this great heaven and earth
The Seven reminds me that on the seventh day
God rested from His great work

When I see the Eight, I think of the eight righteous persons
God saved when He destroyed this old world
There was Noah, his wife, their three sons and their wives
And when I look at the Nine, I think of the lepers
Our Saviour cleansed

And nine out of the ten, didn't even thank Him
And when I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments
God handed down to Moses on the table of stone
When I look at the King

It reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven
God Almighty
The Queen reminds me of the Blessed Virgin Mary
Queen of Heaven and the Jack or Knave is the Devil

When I count the number of spots on a deck of cards

I find 365, the number of days in a year
There's 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year
There's 4 suits, the number of weeks in a month
There's 12 picture cards, the number of months in a year
There's 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter

So you see, my friend
This deck of cards serves me as a Bible
As an Almanac and as a Prayer Book

And friends, this story is true
I know because I know that soldier",Deck of Cards,1991

We were tunin' up to play a gig just another one night stand
I looked over my guitar and there stood an old man
His cowboy clothes were frayed and worn and his boots were far from new
He said I'd like to sit in with your band I'm a country singer too
Well we just had a big laugh
And when I looked back at the old man there was a tear in his eye
I told the band to cool it I didn't want to see him cry
He reached down and he took my guitar with a determined look on his face
But as he started to play and sing a look of sadness took its place
He said I've sang my songs from Maine to California
Seen the world through the window of a car
I never saved a dime back when I made it I always thought someday I'd be a star
But now my voice is cracked and no one wants me my wife gave upon me years ago
It's been so long my kids don't even know me pickin' and singin' is the only life I know
And then he said

[Roy]
I wonder if God likes country music will there be a place up there to sing my songs
Will he make my fingers nimble like they used to be
So I can play the chords and sing along

[Bill]
I just stood there none of us really knew what to say
He took my guitar and he put it down ever so gently
And then as he started to turn and leave
The band stood up and applauded and I can still hear his words today he said

And I'm throwin' away my happiness by leaving you

Bill Anderson,"A long time ago when the earth was green
Why there was more kinda animals than you've ever seen
And they just run around free while the earth was bein' born
And loveliest of them all was the unicorn
There was green alligators and long neck geese
Some humpty back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the unicorn
[ ac.guitar ]
Now God seen some sinnin' and it gave him a pain
And he said stand back cause I'm gonna make it rain
He said hey brother Noah I'll tell you what to do you build me a floating Zoo
And take some green alligators and long neck geese
Some humpty back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born don't you forget my unicorn
[ ac.guitar ]
Well ol' Noah was there to answer the call
And he finished up makin' the ark just as the rain started to fall
He marched in the animals two by two and he called out as they went through
Hey Lord I got your green alligators and long neck geese
Some humpty back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants but Lord I'm so forlorn I just can't see no unicorn
[ ac.guitar ]
And then Noah looked out through the driving rain
And them unicorns were hidin' playin' silly little games
Kickin' and a splashin' while the rain was pourin' oh them silly unicorns
Green alligators and long neck geese some humpty back camels and some chimpanzees
Noah cried close the door cause the rain's a pourin'
And we just don't wait on an ol' unicorn
[ ac.guitar ]
Well the ark started moving and it drifted with the tide
The unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And the waters came down and just sorta floated 'em away
And that's why you've never seen a unicorn to this very day
You'll see green alligators and long neck geese
Some humpty back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants but sure as you're born
You're never gonna see no unicorn",Unicorn,1991

You know I never did make my fortune and I guess it's a little late now
But I never did worry about that much
No shoot I was happy anyhow cause you see
As I have journeyed down life's road
I have reaped a lot more than I've sowed
And I'm drinking from my saucer cause my cup has over flowed
No I'm not a man of riches
No sir and sometimes the going gets kinda' rough
But I got me a good family an old horse and a dog

I thank the Lord for all these bless the mercies he has bestowed

I could feel my faith get well just a little bit thin
But the rain would stop and dark clouds would roll away

So Lord don't let me gripe too much about the rough row I've hoed
cause I'm drinking from my saucer my cup has overflowed
I'm drinking from my saucer my cup has overflowed
And now Lord if you can just give me the strength I need
And the courage when that old road gets steep and rough
I'll not ask for any other blessing cause I have been blessed more than enough

Bill Anderson,"You know friends are never earned they are a gift from the loving God
They're precious beyond human evaluation
You dare not take them for grant it or they'll drift away like smoke
And the warmth of there caring will vanish into the chill of the endless night
Most of my friends are unknowns they probably won't even rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in a small town some where
Where nothing much ever happens
But some of my friends are big people
They are famous sensitive and talented
Their names are household words
And yet they are no more precious in God's eyes or in mine
Then those wonderful nobodies who live and die in obscurity
Who is your friend? 
He's someone who warns you with a nod 
Or with an unspoken word in hard times
When you are hurting beyond words
She's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair
When no other medicine could possibly stop the pain 
A friend is someone who clinks a glass against yours
Or answers the phone at three in the morning
When you're lost and with a few words of encouragement
And concern makes you realize your not really lost at all
Friends come in both sexes in all shapes and sizes
The most important thing they have in common is 
Their ability to share with you your most sky splitting joys
Or your' deepest most awesome sorrows
I think of all the things I have in this world
I'm most grateful for my friends",Friends,1993
Bill Anderson,"'Twas battered and scared and the auctioneer thought it hardly worth his while
To waste much time on the ol' violin but he held it up with a smile
""What am I offered good folks?"" he cried
""Who will start the bidding for me?
A dollar, one dollar, two, only two
Two dollars who will make it three
Three dollars once three dollars twice going for three
But, no from the back of the room a gray haired man came forward
And gently picked up the bow
And then wiping the dust from the ol' violin tuning the loose strings,
He played a melody as pure and sweet as the caroling angel's sing
The music stopped and the auctioneer with a voice quiet and low said
""Now what am I bid for the ol' violin?"" he held it up with the bow
A thousand dollars, who will make it two
Two thousand who will make it three
Three thousand once, Three thousand twice and going going and gone.
The people cheered, but some of them cried,
""We don't understand what changed its worth?""
Then someone replied, ""The touch of the master's hand.""

Bill Anderson,"Rock of Ages clef for me let me hide myself in Thee
It was a stylish congregation you could see they had been around
And they had the biggest pipe organ of any church in town
But over in the amen corner of that church sat Ol' Brother Ire
And every Sunday he insisted on singing in the choir
His voice was cracked and broken age had touched his vocal chords
And nearly every Sunday he would get behind and miss the words
Well, the choir got so flustered the church was told, then fine
Brother Ire must quit his singing or the choir is going to resign
So the pastor appointed a committee I think it was three or four
They got in their big fine car drove up to Ire's door
They found the choirs great trouble sitting there in a big armed chair
The summers golden sum beam lay up on his snow-white hair
Said York, ""We're here with the Vestry's approbation
To discuss a little mater that affects the congregation
Now it seems your voice is interfering with the choir
So if you will just lay out are you listening, Brother Ire?
The old man raised his head a sign he did hear
And on his cheek the three men caught the glitter of a tear
His feeble hands pushed back the locks as white as silky snow
And he answered the committee in a voice both soft and low
""I wonder if beyond the tide that is breaking at my feet
In that far off heavenly temple where my Master I shall meet
I wonder if when I try to sing the songs of God up higher
Will they kick me out up there for singing in Heavens Choir?""
A science filled the room the old man bowed his head
The committee went on back to town, but Brother Ire was dead.
The choir missed him for awhile, but it soon forgot
A few church goers watched the door, but the old man entered not
From far away his voice is sweet now and he sings his hearts desires
Where there are no committees and no fashionable choirs

Bill Anderson,"Soft as the voice of an angel whispers our comforting way
You know all entertainers get mail from their fans
And sometimes folks even write to us for advice
For example; I got a letter not long ago
From man that worked in a factory
The factory had been forced to close down
And sadly the young man had lost his job
He'd been out of work for about a year
When his wife gave up, took their three kids and left him
He'd been looking for work all this time
And now he's facing the situation all alone
He says that sometimes the depression takes over
And he doesn't know how he'll find the strength to go on
Well, I'm not a professional counselor and certainly not a philosopher
I am a country singer, but I do know from experience
That sometimes there is only one thing that will keep your heart from breaking
And that's what I'd like to offer to this young man
Some words of wisdom from a great old hymn
They call me Whispering Bill
Well today what I want to whisper is hope
Whispering hope oh how welcome thy voice
I got another letter from a single mom
Telling me she and her two children are just barely getting by
The child support payments come late and sometimes they don't come at all
The cost of sending the kids to school is growing every day
She is working two jobs just to make ends meet
She says sometimes there is just no light at the end of the tunnel, only darkness
And sometimes she feels like ending it all
I just hope she will remember these words
Wait 'till the darkness is over wait 'till the tempest is gone
Hope for the sunshine tomorrow after the shower is gone
No matter how dark and how turbulent things may seem
The darkness will turn to light and the storm will calm
I hope these folks are listening as I whisper these words of hope
Not just for them but for any one
Who finds himself in a seemingly hopeless situation
It may be the homeless, the sick, the broken family
The business man even the leaders of our country
Anybody can be overcome by sorrow and desperation
And while I am just one man with one voice
I can lift it up in a hopeful message
That wherever there is life there is hope
Whispering hope oh, how welcome Thy voice
Bathing my heart in it's sorrow rejoice Whispering Hope",Whispering Hope,1993
Bill Anderson,"Where have all our heroes gone what's come over our great land
America is still my home sweet home but where have all our heroes gone
I saw a group of boys the other day standing in the corner of a playground
Looking and laughin' at a magazine

And I overheard one of the boys said man is he ever cool
And he pointed to the man who's picture was on the magazine cover
And everybody kinda said under their breath yeah he's cool alright
And I got sick to my stomach

Because I'd seen the cover and the man that they were talking about 
Had instigated a riot in one of our major cities last summer
And the magazine was writing about how the police were unkind to him
The judges were not fair with him

And how he talked back and slung his long hair about and cussed
And did his things and they made him into a regular hero
And inside this magazine was the story of a baseball player
Who got involted with the gamblers

Of the football player who said that football was not the end
Just a mean to an end meanin' the girls and the good times
And a story of a folk singer who proudly claims 
To be both a member of a party ailen to our government and a nontax payin' citizen

These young boys read with open eyes and open minds
And I thought to myself my God
Are these the people that these young boys look up to
Are these their idols are these the heroes of the now generation

(America is still my home sweet home but where have all our heroes gone)
I had heroes when I was a kid we all did and our heroes did their thing too 
Like General Douglas McArthur who returned like he said he would
Like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers who chased the bad guys right off the screen

Like Lindberg who flew the ocean and Jesse Owens who showed Hitler
And John Wayne and Gerry Cooper after all didn't they really win the war
And General Ike bless your soul cause he made us feel safe
We've killed some of our recent heroes the Kennedys and Kings 

And even as great as their space feats are
How many of the astronauts can you name huh how many
My heroes were people like Joe DiMaggio who proved that nice guys can finish first
And Stan Musian who never had an unkind word for anybody

And Winston Churchill who's two fingers raised together meant victory
Not just a let-your-enemy-have-it-all kind of artificial peace
This country needs a lotta things today friends
But it doesn't need any one thing anymore than it needs some real heroes

Men who know what it means to be looked up to by a griny faced kid
Men who want to sign autograph books and not deal under the table
Men who are willing to play the game with the people who made them heroes
Men who don't mind putting on a white hat and saying thank you and please

A grinder in the city, 
Hustlin' day in day out just tryin' to survive,
He bought his wife the finer things,
And sent his kids to college, 
That always took what little bit 
He tried to put aside,

But through it all he had one thing 
That seemed to keep him going, 
A dream that someday he could leave 
This city life behind, 
I watched his hair turn thin and gray, 
But his dream never faded, 
He told me all about it 
At least a thousand times.

[Chorus]
He always wanted, a place out in the country,
Where the birds sing, in the morning, 
And the grass is emerald green,
A place where, he could feel the mornin' sunshine, 
And sit out in the evenin',
Where the air is, fresh and clean.

It took lots of overtime 
To keep his wife up with the Jonses, 
And more to get his son out of 
His run-ins with the law,
The more it took the more he gave, 
Never once complaining, 
I don't know how he ever stood 
The pressure of it all.

I never thought he'd make it, 
But he finally left the city, 
And now he's got that special little place 
To call his own,
Today I took a ride out in the country 
Just to see him, 
It wasn't hard to find 
Because his name was on the stone.

And how great it is to make love to a married lady
Tonight I fell in love with a married lady
She held me in her lovin' arms and she called me baby
And she made me feel all the good things I've missed lately
Tonight I fell in love with a married lady
My life's been pretty crazy lately

Now the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road once again it seems
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
How I wish this love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign should be keeping us apart
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
If only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you
But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent got to leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years ago
Now this traveling life is the only life I know
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you
But you know I love you yes I love you oh I love you

With the initials SS on the front

And she nodded
And I said, ""What are you drinkin' Double S?""
She said, ""Scotch'n'Soda.""
And I said, ""Okay Double S one Scotch'n'Soda comin' up.""
""You live around here?"", I asked
""No she said just killin' time till the morning.""
""I got an early plane back to California.""
""I live near San Simeon.""

""Oh, and you'll be flyin' on a 7-0-7 no doubt?"", I said
""How did you know?"" she asked
""Oh, I guess I'm just super-smart.""
""You gonna spend the rest of the night in this bar Double S?""
""No,"" she said,
""I have a motel room I'm at the Surfing Sand.""
""Can I give you a lift?""
""Thanks, I rented a car but I don't drive it too well.""
She answered
""It's a stick-shift, haha
""Double S you are something-special."", I said.
And paid the man and we walked out
In the cool evening breeze.

She slid across the seat and snuggled up close to my side
And I began to run my fingers through her hair
It was soft'n'silky. I opened the door to her room
My lips found her lips and I held her close
And whispered, ''You are a super-sexy lady
She simply smiled.

I could feel her body slowly soften as her sensuous soul
Swiftly swept me into sublime serenity
Her plane left just as the morning sun
Began to softly streak the starry sky
She kissed me a soft so long, waved a sultry
So long from the window
And I never saw Double S again

Right now she's soaring somewhere above the clouds
And I'm walking home on one
And I just realized I never did find out
What Double S stood for
All I know is our time together was short and sweet...",Double S,1996

And don't she look good when she smiles?

Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her own?
Did you really think losing you would destroy her
And that's why she kept hangin' on?

She did all she could for a while
Then she picked up the pieces and she started livin'

I did a lot of crazy things back when I was young
And I've still got her footprints on my heart and on my mind
She's a mistake I made when I was twenty-one
And twenty-four and twenty-eight and twenty-nine
She thought my heart was a revolving door she came and went as she pleased
For every night I spent in her arms I spent two on my knees
Begging her to stay and live in my world needing her desperately
Look up fool in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of me
She's a mistake I made
There's no fool like a young fool I've heard 'em say
But I'm not sure that I'm mature enough to walk away even today

When a man can't shake a memory he runs hot and cold and blind

He hates he then he loves her then he hates her one more time

Bill Anderson,"My Christmas list grows shorter every year things just aren't the way they were before
My Christmas list grows shorter every year it's almost not like Christmas anymore
I guess it's 'cause I came from a pretty big family
Christmas was always a big happy time
We used to swap presents with aunts, uncles and cousins
Course most of the presents just came from the five and dime

I remember how I used to get such a big kick out of wrappin'
Just a simple little box and placin' it under the tree
Everybody at my house used to laugh and said that I was born
With a little too much of the spirit of Christmas in me

I left home a few years ago now and it seemed then that things started to change
Mom passed on now daddy's gone, Christmas' seem sorta strange
Sister ran off with some weird kinda guy I never did understand him too much
My kid brother's off somewhere in the service
And he never was the kind to stay in touch

Course I started my own family a few years ago
My wife and I had two of the cutest little girls
I ha ha remember last Christmas I really went wild
I bought them just about everything in the whole wide world
And I remember on the Christmas Eve night I took 'em upon my lap
And I told them the story of Jesus
And the Santa Claus and the eight tiny reindeer

All I wish now is the spirit of Christmas could have lingered throughout the whole year
You see my wife left me back in September the kids are with her I don't know where
I'd love to just send them a small Christmas card
To let them know that daddy does care
'Cause Christmas is a time for sharing your gifts and your heart
With the ones that you love the best

But sittin' here tonight lookin' at this big sheet of paper
I don't even have one single address

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

RECORDED AS A DUET BY BRAD PAISLEY AND ALISON KRAUSS

She put him out like the burning end of a midnight cigarette. She broke his heart: He spent his whole life trying to forget. We watched him drink his pain away, a little at a time, But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind, Until the night: He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away her memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength he had to get up off his knees. We found him with his face down in the pillow, With a note that said: ""I'll love her till I die."" And when we buried him beneath the willow, The angels sang a whiskey lullabye. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la. The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself. For years and years, she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath. She finally drank her pain away, a little at a time, But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind. Until the night: She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. We found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life. We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullabye. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la La la la la la la la. La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la.

In fact I've lost just about everything since you went away
Everything that is except the memories you left me
And that's one things that no one can mar

My only hope is that some day you might hear this song
And you'll know I wrote it especially for you and I love you wherever you are
(Still) after all this time (still) you're still on my mind (I love you still)
This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire
For every day it burns hotter and every day it burns higher
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker not even with all these tears

A DJ in a little country station

Everybody loved him dear cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late and his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive

She warned against his loss of sleep and driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five.

BJ the DJ you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways don't see how you can last.

Every morning just past four from the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again.

Then at breakneck speed he'd drive to sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin.

His mom said by the radio until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright

Then she'd say a little prayer, giving thanks that he was there. And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn all the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time.

BJ had a lot of nerve but he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio the voice she heard she didn't know
BJ'd never been this late before

But with the road so bad and all she'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

BJ the DJ only twenty four a wreck at ninety miles an hour he'll spin the hits no more. ",B.J. the D.J.,2009
Bill Anderson,"I've got a sad sad story friend that I don't like to tell
I had a home and fam'ly when they locked me in this cell
I've been in here eighteen years a long long time I know
But time don't mean a thing to me cause I've got life to go
Well I went one night where the lights were bright just to see what I could see
I met up with the old friend who just thought the world of me
Well he brought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
Then words were said and now he's dead I just had to bring him down
Well it's been a long long time now since I've heard from my wife
I know I'd be there with her yet if I hadn't used the knife
Well I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years and still got life to go
Well I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell
No I can't be free to go and see the ones that I love so
I've been in here eighteen years I've still got life to go
Yes I've still got life to go oh I've still got life to go

Bill Anderson,"I'm just a guitar in the pawn shop on the corner 
And I'm waiting for someone to play me now and then
My strings are kinda rusty and I'm a little dusty
Oh but you'd be to if you've been where I've been
I did some shows with Haggard back in 1967
And I'm just dying for someone to play me back home

I'm just a guitar in the pawn shop on the corner
Hey come on by and listen to my song

I've seen at least a million of those tiny smoke bar rooms
And I've help to heal some heartaches 
And I've helped to sell some beer
And the last one that held me
Just couldn't wait to sell me
And for twenty eight dollars and left me hanging here
But I dream about the spotlight 
And the roaring of the people
And I wonder if I'm ever gonna hear 'em sing along

I'm just a guitar in the pawn shop on the corner
Hey come on by and listen to my song

I've got a lot of memories
And a song or two left in me
And some day someone'll pick me up
And play me back home

Bill Anderson,"You told me that you'd love me until the end of time
But you are only human and humans change their minds
You left me without warning and the storm brought me pain

Heard that old jukebox a playin' song about a truck drivin' man
The waitress then brought me up some coffee
I thanked her then called her back again
I said that old song sure does fit me cause I'm a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee for it is the best in the land
Put a nickel in the jukebox and play the Truck Drivin' Man
[ steel - fiddle ]
I climbed back aboard my old semi and then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a rolling now I'm on my way to San Antone
When I get my call up to glory they'll take me away from this land
I'll head this old truck up to heaven cause I'm a truck drivin' man
Pour me another cup of coffee...

Bill Anderson,"The bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabaretes and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights

(Lights that say forget her name) in a glass of cherry wine
(Lights that offer other girls) for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights

(Lights that say forget her love) in a different athmosphere
(Lights that lure are nothing) but a masquarade for tears

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

No, I never felt like this before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you

I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall 
And we felt this magical fantasy
Now with passion in our eyes 
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each others hand 
'Cause we seem to understand the urgency
 
Just remember
You're the one thing 
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love

Because I've had the time of my life
No, I never felt this way before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door 
Till I found the truth
And I owe it all to you

Hey baby, oh yeah yeah yeah

With my body and soul 
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no
 
Yes, I know what's on your mind when you say
""Stay with me tonight"" (stay with me)
And remember
You're the one thing 
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love 

Because I've had the time of my life

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me

Above all, I want these arms about you

Song: ""How Deep Is the Ocean?"" Lyrics
How can I tell you what is in my heart?
How can I measure each and every part?
How can I tell you how much I love you?
How can I measure just how much I do?

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
>From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean,1995
Bill Broughton,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [From Sleepless in Seattle],1995

Bill Brown & His Brownies,"There's a boy that's in our band
And how he blows that horn
Finest since you're born
When he starts you're gone
They all call him ""Hot Lips"" for
He blows real red-hot notes
And ev'rybody on the floor just floats
(That's what they say)
 
He's got hot lips when he plays Jazz
He draws out steps like no one has
You're on your toes and shake your shoes
Boy, how he goes when he plays Blues
I watch the crowd until he's through
He can be proud they're ""cuckoo,"" too
His music's rare you must declare
The boy is there with two hot lips
 
He's got hot lips when he plays Jazz

I watch the crowd until he's through
He can be proud they're ""cuckoo,"" too
His music's rare you must declare
The boy is there with two hot lips
 
Heard him play the other night
And old man Oscar Clive who is eighty five
Sure as you're alive
Got so frisky when he started out to do his stuff
Was told to sit right down for being rough
(And then he said)
 
He's got hot lips when he plays Jazz
He draws out steps, like no one has
You're on your toes, and shake your shoes

When I'm alone, I still feel this way about you

Here am I dreaming, I stand by myself
Look and it's easy to see that
I'm not the only one reaching for a new kind of wealth
Reaching with nothing to hide and you by my side

Bill Bruford,"First time I met Angel
Up on the bridge of an ocean-going liner
She was virtue, vice and 
Can't give her up now for all the tea in China

Here comes a knock on my door
Angel face with teeth like a tiger's claw
Morning comes she'll soon be back begging for more
Angel knows that truth has a sliding floor

No use asking me why
Some people snicker like a downtown Bowery wino
If experts, preachers, mystics can't find the answer

Then how the hell should I know?

Lost in a world breaking apart
Angel shines her mystery light into the dark
She's not wasting blame on the rich or the poor
Angel knows that truth has a sliding floor

Does a a shadow come between us in the winter
Is the movement really light
And I heard a million voices singing
Acting to the story that they had heard about
 Does one child know the secret and can say it
Or does it all come out along without you
 Along without you
 Along without you
Where does reason stop and killing just take over
Does a lamb cry out before we shoot it dead
Are there many more in comfort understanding
Is the movement in the head
And I heard a million voices singing

Counting the broken ties they decide

Relates to all the words sung

Bill Candy,"Here we are
Alive and free
Far away in time from our darkest day
That took our young and brave

From the cradle to the grave
70 years ago on July one 1916 on the Somme
The enemies had never seen fighting like this before
Such a simple plan--

How could any German man
Survive through that ordeal?
Company 'A' to Company 'be	'
""Morale is high here, sir, but I don't think it's safe to go""

Company 'A' from Company 'be	'
""Mister you have your orders and you must obey""
So the first line rose, and the first line fell
And a poet who survived later wrote about

A ""Sunlit vision of Hell""
And ""Larks singing""
Because after all it's just another summer's day in France
And the Tommie's on the Somme sang

""We are fighting to turn no-man's land into a common ground""

Bill Carrothers,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand

For the little dark star on the wind down there
