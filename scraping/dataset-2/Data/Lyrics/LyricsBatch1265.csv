We the Kings,"When heaven seems so far away
And dreams are just a memory
Without the dark the light won't show
Remember that you're not alone

When you watch the world just turn away
And break the promises it made
When love is all too hard to hold
Just take a breath and let it go

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing

Two a.m., too tired to sleep
When what you want's not what you need
And when these walls don't feel like home
Remember that you're not alone

The beginning's just another end
It's not too late to start again
When hope is all too hard to hold
Just take a breath and let it go

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

When heaven seems so far away
And dreams are just a memory
When love is all too hard to hold
Just take a breath and let it

And go whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Just keep breathing, breathing, breathing",Just Keep Breathing,2013
We the Kings,"I was just a kid then skipping stones
Innocent and so alone
And I sense we were all alone
You could take my heart and you could take my home
But you'll never ever break my soul
No you'll never ever break my soul

But you know me
I wanna go back but I can't back down
And you know me too well
'Cause

I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall

We were just two kids thrown into the flames
We would never ever be the same
We would never ever be the same
We were just a spark that lit the change
They could never ever bring the rain

We the Kings,"I wanna feel your everything
I want it more than the same routine
We both know we've gone too far again
I wanna hear your every breath
All you secrets laid to rest
We both know it never has to end

'Cause we could make the same mistakes
We could turn and run away

Don't let go
I'll never let you be alone
Tonight we're gonna get high or fall together
Die young or live forever
Don't let go
I'll love you till our hearts go cold
Tonight we're gonna get high or fall together
Die young or live forever

Young love don't mean a thing
With eyes wide we live our dreams
They don't know it's not the way it seems
We live fast until the crash
Leave here we won't look back
They don't know, they think it's meant to last

'Cause we could make the same mistakes
We could turn and run away

I'll never let you be alone

You know that we're the same, no need to know our names

We the Kings,"We’re all alone watching shadows on the ceiling
I've gone numb but I can’t forget the feeling

So stop time right here in the moonlight
'Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes

Without you, I feel broke
Like I'm half of a whole
Without you, I've got no hand to hold
Without you, I feel torn
Like a sail in a storm
Without you, I'm just a sad song
I'm just a sad song

With you, I fall
It's like I'm leaving all my past and silhouettes up on the wall
With you, I'm a beautiful mess

We the Kings,"And tired eyes just lay your head on me,
And I'll be here until you fall asleep.
The storm is getting closer, I won't leave.
All the words I sing are whispers in your dreams.

When I said I wanted it all, I wanted it all.
It hurts more than ever, I won't give up now.
And all that you are, is all that I need,
I promised forever.

So tell me it hurts, tell it burns,
Tell me it's love and that you're ready to fall
Into my arms or into the ground,
It's lost or it's found,
Whatever you need to say, say it now.

Clouds are clearing up, I see the stars,
Like underneath your pain, I see your heart.
Laying hand and hand beneath the sky, forget the world,
It's only you and I.

When we said we wanted it all, we wanted it all.
It hurts more than ever, we can't give up now.
And all that we are, is all that we need,
We promised forever.

So tell me it hurts, tell it burns,
Tell me it's love and that you're ready to fall
Into my arms or into the ground,
It's lost or it's found,
Whatever you need to say, say it now.

Say it, tell me that you love me,
Say you want to leave me,
Tell me that you need me.
Say it like you mean it,
You know that I can take it.
You that it won't break me.
I just wanna know.

So tell me it hurts, tell it burns,
Tell me it's love and that you're ready to fall
Into my arms or into the ground,

Whatever you need to say, say it now.",Say It Now,2013
We the Kings,"Tonight I believe
That you are the reason I dream
Wrapped up in sheets
I’m wrapped up in everything
But here comes the light,
Stealing me back from you
Leaving the night
Leaving me so confused

I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake

'Cause I wanna close my eyes and sleep
Run to the place we used to meet
'Cause I’d rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you
'Cause I’d sleep forever if you’d leave
Give up the world so you would see
That I’d rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you

Without you

Come to my dreams,
Daylight won’t find us here
We’re finally free,
Free to go anywhere
So give me the strength,
Strength just to say goodbye
Goodbye to the world,
The world we could leave behind

I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake

'Cause I wanna close my eyes and sleep
Run to the place we used to meet
'Cause I’d rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you
'Cause I’d sleep forever if you’d leave
Give up the world so you would see
That I’d rather have you in my dreams
Than wake up without you

Don’t give up, I’ll never let you
Don’t give up, I’ll never let you
Don’t give up, I’ll never let you go

Don’t give up, I’ll never let you
Don’t give up, I’ll never let you
Don’t give up, I’ll never let you go

Wake this land and stop the sea
Show me love, unlock
All doors
I'm yours""

God this is boring

So you think we're done, just wait and see
Tell me is it fun to get back what you gave to me
And if you want me gone and we're at the end of our road
So long and see ya, finally there's one thing we agree on

I know it's going down tonight
I know you know you know
We're not going to be alright

Just give me a minute

Maybe I know something you don't want to admit
Saying I'm just losing it

Everyone knows it's time to back down
Drop the act, no more sound

So don't you dare come home
Don't tell me it's alright without telling me where you were last night
And everyone knows, so don't you dare come home

It's not hard to see it
And every time I try to ask you tell me I'm dreaming
But no one sleeps enough for that

Like a noose tied around my neck, so what's next?
'Cause I might be falling but I'm not down yet

I swear I saw your name in letters on a license plate last night
I must be losing my mind
Every song I've heard this week was written about you and me I think
I really should have called you, I just couldn't bring myself to

You give up on us every time I leave, thought this was love
But once again I have been deceived

I was lost, but I found that I never needed you
Till I come home to see you crying

Your love is just like a trap, the way it's pulling me back
You've lost it all, your sanity, to think that you'd end up with me
Go play all your selfish games and know that you're the one to blame
Don't you come crawling back for help, go fall in love with someone else

I fought for so long, why did I hold on

Middle of the night still lying alone
And did I drink too much again, can I get out of my head?

We could talk but what's the use, I always say too much too soon

I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand up
I'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand

Can we find our way back and live the past again
Cold rain in the summer
Can we find our way back and live the past again
Not dressed for the weather, but you never looked better

Moving on like it's real to me
Playing the role even when the scene ends

I'm doing fine
I've done my time
There's no turning back

Forgive and forget, I'm not there yet
It's hard to do when you're sober
Rehearse my lines to cut all my ties
It's hard to say that it's over

Next time you come around
Bring a glass and a bottle maybe we get to the bottom of this
Or check the lost and found
To see if anyone picked up the rest of our relationship

I'd rather have an umbrella than be staring out the window

So tell me
Why I can't live my life this way
And tell me
Why I should stay

Sometimes I feel like a boxer
And I'm just beating myself up
I can't let it be my fault I'm still here
I've been trying for months and failing for years

I just want to get out of this place
I'd hit the road with the change in my pocket
I don't care if it rains everyday
I'd rather have an umbrella than be staring out the window

And I’ll wonder why I ever tried to listen to ya

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year

There, running my hands through her hair

Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

Weatherbox,"Last summer things got hazy 
And I ended up in a band
And I slept well through the daytime 
On my stomach in the back of a van
And I was shouting beneath a roof of trees 
With my new friends surrounding me
And I came into my body 
And things were swarming that I’ve never seen

And I can't abide by rules which are not my own
There's a wolf on my lawn and my bravery is gone
And suddenly I'm a child again
I ran the bases round 
But I fell and I scraped my knees
Is that bad luck for me? 
Is there any bad luck for me?
And I almost fell in love 
But I tore and you tore in two
Is that bad luck for you? 
Am I bad luck for you?

And I watched her across the table 
As the dreams and the drugs left my brain
And it is awkward to meet new people 
And watch our perceptions of them change
But I wished I still felt the same now 
But I am emptier than ever some how
I need to learn how to keep my mouth shut 
To keep friendly things from coming out

And I can't abide by rules which are not my own
There's a hawk on my fence 
And it's warning me again
And suddenly I become a man
The days are winding down 
To what I'm a bit confused
Are they winding down to you? 
Am I winding down to you?
I will keep on riding front 
Until it's time to record again
And I'll be crazy until then 
Yes I'll stay crazy until then

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1966
Webb Pierce,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone

I wanna go home I wanna go home oh Lord I wanna go home

From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
Now you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride and put it on a Southbound freight and ride
Go on back to the loved ones the ones I left waiting so far behind
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh Lord I wanna go home",Detroit City,1993

Of the Rock And Roll Justice League busting
A locking tremolo in your community
Or are they merely paying lip service
To your local guitar authorities?

These and other questions
Are raised in the following excerpt
From Webb Wilder's Motivational Tips
For Teens Manifesto And Rock And Roll Pamphlet

At this juncture, let us deviate from the
Preferace to these illusory comments
To clear our minds of all secular
And non ascetic questions and answers
Which all will be covered in God's good time
And play the electric guitar

All right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right ha, ha, ha, ha

Come on little baby, don't you think its time to dry your eyes?
Something got you down and Lord knows I can sympathize
But why'd you even come If all your gonna do is mope around?
Save it all for Sunday 'cause tonight we're gonna rock this town

Let you feet lose their mind
Do the dog, do the swim, do the Frankensteins

Well, all right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right don't sweat it, flat out get it
I got a hunch you're gonna like it a bunch

Come on everybody, don'tcha be a sittin' on your hands
Pick a wall flower start a swingin' like old Tarzan
Make a monkey of yourself, be the best you've ever felt I know
I'm a monkey man myself, I'm makin' peanuts after every show

that's all right I'm doin' fine
You gotta stop and smell the dandelion

Well, all right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right don't sweat it, flat out get it
I got a hunch you're gonna like it a bunch

Well, rock and roll is gettin' old now, they got it sellin' soap
But its my only vice, I don't need liquor dice or dope, no
What the heck I hit the deck and burnin' rubber off your soul
Radio the woman don't forget the mist will knock you cold
Just honky tonk all night long 'cause tomorrow we'll all be long gone

Well, all right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right ha, ha, ha, ha
All right don't sweat it, flat out get it
I got a hunch you're gonna like it a bunch

Webb Wilder,"Why you let me get this close I can't say
Close but no cigar, it's still too far away
If I reach for you, will you run?
If I tag along, will I spoil the fun?
If I play it cool, will you think I'm playin' dumb?

My mind tumbles when I talk to you
You wouldn't think it would be so hard to do
You're a nightingale, I'm a mockingbird
Every song I sing is a song you've heard
When it comes to love, guess, I just ain't got the word

I'm no great shakes at reading your mind
No great shakes at sayin' my lines
Show me a sign, give me a clue
Tell me what it takes to get through to you

The crystal ball ain't all it's cracked up to be
The psychic hotline, hell, that's way too deep for me
But there's no lip service I won't pay
No cliche that I won't say
There's no rhyme that I won't lay on you

Still I'm no great shakes at reading your mind
No great shakes at standin' in line
Give me a sign, show me a clue
Tell me what it takes to get through to you

No great shakes at reading your mind
No great shakes at standin' in line
Give me a sign, show me a clue
Tell me what it takes, no great Shakes

At readin' your mind
No great shakes, no great Shakes
Bidin' my time, tell me, what it takes
Cause I'm no great shakes",No Great Shakes,1996

Ever wondering why I dream my dreams away

Man, I blew the folks away
Now, the job's a little risky
But I'm my own boss
I got to tell ya, Jack
It really gets me off

I live in a tent with
The world's strongest man
When I met the mother
Like to broke my hand
My baby, she's a lady
In the high-wire act
When I'm feeling tense
She walks on my back

The benefits are great

Well I'm a hot shot
I'm a cool breeze
Underneath the big top
I'm the big cheese
I lay it on the line
Let it all hang
When I go, least I know
I'll go with a bang

I reckon I'm living
Every kid's dream
It's a buzz, it's a gas
It's a real scream

Ah ha
I'm the human cannonball
I'm the human cannonball, y'all

Yeah

Alright, folks
Just make yourself at home
Have a snow cone and enjoy the show

They put me on the cover
Of the U.S.A. Today
Tell the world what the human cannonball got to say
On the Carson show
They sayin' ""HC, what you do, you got to be
Right outta your tree!""

Well, it's a little risky
But I'm my own boss
I got to tell you, John

Now I admit I've been a fool sometimes
I believe I may be losing you
It's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed
Under your spell and over my head
You took me in your arms, and you told me
We don't need to worry, but you
You never say you're sorry

And to get in them jeans everybody be wishing
But she only want players who far from rookie
And if you ain't got the cake
Can't play with the nookie
Her titties sitting pretty and she soft as a cushion
If you try to holla she might holla she tooken
And she walk like a bad bitch talk like a bad bitch
And go and get her hair and shit fixed is a habit
Now bad bitch go and buy Finch more than average
And bad bitches get to take trips with the savage

But shit I can tell from her lips that she nasty

And she ain't hard-headed
Can listen and respect it
And you ain't a bad bitch if you got bad credit
A thong and press-ons and know how to cook neckbones

Don't like to get dirty and don't mind working
And she don't mind giving me some mouth and lip service

How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see

I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city,

Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable,

Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

Chew up cheese then throw up grants,

One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay, 
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed,

Sip syrup, and smoke fire
And I'm wilder than the average thug
I'm hardheaded, my mama told me that
And you gots to be real, all this drama showed me that
Lose your mind if you want to

Cause if you beef with my n****s, then we gon' really squad up
From choppers to a six, b****, you can't avoid us
Rapping bout smoking that killer, don't even smoke killer
Even if you did, I wouldn't even smoke with you
Ya b****, ya fraud, ya fake, ya motherf***ing fluke
P**** all wet, your f***ing booty all loose
You and them other two n****s, duck, duck, goose

Gangsta s*** jump off, boy you know you finna run out
Close your f***ing mouth, before I rip your damn tongue out

Gunned down when he was 12
Ever since then it been hell
Webbie, and they don't live like we live
They don't deal like we deal
They ain't real like we real
Look, I'm from that track light, that bottom of that SSB
Whatever you call it, that s*** lives in me
Them n****s kill for free, like Lil' Trell on the love
Cause these n****s ain't my equal, and they hating on this lil' thug
A lot of n****s scared of y'all, but not me
This for them n****s in the rap game, who knock me, but can't stop me
And my posse is full of thugs, like Head Busta', Baby Junior, and my n**** Chubbs
We dumping slugs on the enemy
I thought you was my closest friend, but now on you just a frenemy
And this f***ing penitentiary make n****s think they real
And when they get out, they got a nerve to pop a pill (but look here)

And goin' get her hair and shit fixed is a habit
And a bad bitch go and buy fits mo' than average
And bad bitches get to take trips white ""The Savage""

How much your paint cost? Look like it just got rained on
Tell me this when you stop do your rims stop or they keep goin'

You finna take off them twenties and put them big 23's on

Like to shake her ass like Ciara real fancy.
Wonder if Ciara can shake her ass on this nine piece,
Betcha Jada Pinkett shake that ass real classy

Cook soul food bake cake straight out the projects.
A female savage straight bad bitch prospect,
Baby Phat, Apple Bottem big booty Gucci and Prada.
I be lookin' for the kinda lil' mama that's bout some dollars,
350 dollar bottles that's all she want to swalla.
And if you ain't a big balla she ain't even trying to holla,
She gone take ya lil' measly dollas and walk off like a model.

Bend over like Halle Berry on that part when ole boy knocked her off.
I'm a dog I like it soft I like to rub I like to grip,
To tell the truth I like them loose cause me and my thugs we like to flip.
I like the friends who get involved all the broads say I'ma trip,
I like the picture takin' pictures while you catch it on ya lip.
I like to sneak and take ya shoppin'' when ya niggas start to trip,
Drink my liquor out the bottle on his couch and watch you strip.
Stick a couple fingers in ya make it tickle make ya drip,
Make ya holla like I'm robbin' ya like a pimp and then I dip.
I want to get an ounce of hydro get Alicia eyes low 
Take her to the suite and make her hit all of her high notes.
Strapped up fa sho' cause I don't trust no hoes anybody can go Eazy E perfect example.

A bad ass bitch make the big dog proud
Which one is the baddest
That's the one I'm having
The with no kids or just one baby daddy
And she ain't hard-headed
Can listen and respect it
And you ain't a bad bitch if you got bad credit
A thong and press-ons and know how to cook neckbones
I want the MVP with that throwback dress on
Don't like to get dirty and don't mind working
And she don't mind giving me some mouth and lip service

[Chorus]
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)

Them bad bitches with them bad bitches attitudes

But they burnin' my CD's (thats fucked up)
Niggas and bitches
Please
Won't you get me help
Get your ass up off the computer
And buy this shit up off the shelf
Cause I wanna ride candy man
Just like the others
Sometimes I wish I shoulda take the good route
Like my brother
These niggas say they love ya
But they get dope
How you a rat like that
And try to steal ya ho
I still cope
And these niggas wanna rap about you
Know you a soldier
But they still wanna bring that savage out you
To get exposed
And these hoes they for the money
Tell your old lady dirty lies
But they know they frontin'
Check this out
In baton rouge
It's real wicked
And you can't go platinum now here
Cause this ain't New York City
And all my cousins doin' time
Thuggin' in the pen
I'm thinkin' bout em
Everytime I take a sip of henn

They hatin' cause I'm VIP
Ride through my city
With my hat bent like TIP

They got a niggas signin a deal
But they can't talk like I be talkin'
Cause I spit the real
Till I get killed
These niggas changin' like a weather
Think he your nigga
But you lookin' at the fuckin' devil
Who want your bezzle
And that voice that he wish he had
Jealousy got niggas creepin' down to bust ya ass
We livin' fast
But you notice I got em B
Money cars clothes and hoes
Till they pocket me
This for my niggas down in Texas
All the fuckin' swingers
Who got the whole other side of town
Wanna thank em
I'm stressin' cause the things I did
Not wearin a rubber got me stuck now with three kids
This shit is real
Wish I had a real friend to holla
They tend to laugh 
When I tell em bout my fuckin problems
But I be stackin' the feds
So I be straight when I'm gone

Blowin' dodo in a different city
Thinkin' these niggas tryin' to do me
But they rollin' wit me
My ho da sickest
But she listen to what the streets say
That got me stressin
Cause she might be leavin' anyday
I try to pray
But when I holla he ain't holla back
That's why I'm missin' prayer daily
Tryin' to get these stacks
Why that
The situation that I'm in
The judge tryin' to send me to the pen
And give me ten
And do me in
Got me stressin' on some major shit
My mama agin'
And my grandma and my baby's sick
This hatin' shit
Got me one step away from clickin'
This me against the world livin'
Got all my people bitchin'

Told her respect the game

Concert after concert mayne we kept fighting. 
We struck tha' world real quick, like lightning.

Now she suck me till that pussy get wet. (uh huh) 
I remember way back when I used to fuck plats, 
When wore them daisy dukes and had that pussy sittin' fat. 
Now a nigga gettin' stacks, I do whatever I like. 
I hit em Asian, Black, or White. I have my pleasure wit dykes. 
I'm first class on every flight. I'm a big dog nigga. 
At tha' super bowl on the front row. Where is ya'll niggas, look. 
I used to fuck wit hoes who like to cut
Yo tires up. Now I'm breaded and they can't even get a nut.

White 2 seat, or I might be new SUV, doing 90. 
Lookin' for tha right weed, for tha right fee. 
Hit it once or twice my eyes tightening. 
I go faster, I swerve slightly to the left of the lane I came back right. 
Grab that clutch tightly 'cause it might be my night, 
You know we got niggas dying nightly. 
Tonight I'm wit a nice freak. She half white, 
She clean up, lick a nigga nuts 'cause she like me. 
Finding another me up in the streets is unlikely. 
Don't hit me on the phone later on 'cause I might be gone.

I want a face like Beyoncé, a smile like Ashanti
Boosie and Paris Hilton, a caramel sundae
Bust it back, wide open, lemme see yo' inside
And lick yo' tongue at me (ooohhh!), that make my temperature rise
Lookin for Teairra Mari, I can ""make you feel good""
Ciara can get it too, Olivia I'm feelin you
I need lips like Fantasia, put me to sleep
Talk nasty like Trina (ooohhh!), I need me a freek
I like to lay back, fuck bitches with two or three Georgia Peaches
They argue before they eat it, like Puffy they need Jesus
Like to smoke a purple blunt while you play with that cock
And while I knock off yo' top, I want Lil' Webbie to watch
Yo gon' let Webbie see my candy, yeah? Girl that's how we play that there
Eve? I better not see yo' tail nowhere
'Cause I'ma talk that koochie out the drawers (say what!?)
You want me to be Santa Clause, you gon' have to break it off like...

Like Beyoncé, like Trina (bounce that ass like that)

I like 'em tall dark, skin, thick and fine ass
Nice around, pants size 7, 8 or 9
And when she walk, she walk like she on the run way
And the paparazzi taken pictures of that booty

And when them flashes go to flashin' she go to shaking that ass
Faster and faster, big ol' ass just clapping
And when they put her song on it's like 'Girls gone Wild'
'Cause she the headliner and the girl poor and proud

But if they break it down she'll slow it down
And look back at it dat's if she's a real vet wit it
But she gotta have hips wit it
And know that one flat ass can make a whole clique look bad

To all you li'l booty bitches eat ya biscuits
Get thicker bitches, I know some niggas wanna fuck wit cha

No time to fuck around it's goin' down in my room

A whole thang of ice 5th of brown and a thang of goose
Man, call trick and tell them niggas to bring the juice
And a couple more boxes of rubbers 'cause she the truth
I'm sayin' she a bad ass bitch and she'll prove it

Ass and some fat ass titties, yeah, they juicy
Dancin' just like one of them bitches that make movies
Bust my nut quick she was ready to take boosie
She bent over and told him she want it in her booty

Shackle handcuff her da sucker, hell give that girl some love
But not you ya like it when her booty do
She like it too and likes what it do to you

She playin' her mind games, flirtin' wit you havin' conversations
While she playin' wit her tongue ring
She lookin' mean in the low cut fitted jeans
The finest thing you ever seen wearin' a belly chain

Plus her man, he gettin' a lil' change doin' illegal things
And she expect for you to buy her things

All of 'em try and steal my underwear (Wipe me down)
Like to floss like Rick Ross 
Got a hit called set it off 
When I sing it, everybody set it off (Wipe me down)
Black mink, I'm, yeah, I'm on play wit' me 
I bust ya dome, eight whips on chrome; you can (Wipe me down)
Fresh fade, fresh J's on the corner
Playin' spades, I'm an ordinary person, but I'm paid (Wipe me down)
Foxx flippin', Webbie smokin', and we chokin' off a whole pound 
Of purple famous like the Ninja Turtles (Wipe me down)
Just left New York City, hooked up wit' P. Diddy 
Finna blow past fifty; you gon' have ta (Wipe me down)
We the best; I'm a fool, I'm the hemi man 
Red light, green light, yellow light; get it, man?

Hot drop, drop top, top drop hos drop it like it's hot
Yeah, nigga, I'm the shit (Wipe me down)
You see this ice on my wrist, how it glist?
Soon the light hit you; can't lie, the ice sick (Wipe me down)
Purple got me smellin' funky, red monkey 
Five hundred dollars on 'em; you ain't seen these yet (Wipe me down)
Beatin', you can hear me way around the corner 
Paint wet wit' the twenty-fours on 'em; that's bet (Wipe me down)
Ol' lady's baby mama's few fiance nigga's wife 
Savage life, who I'm gonna fuck next? (Wipe me down)
And I don't use the Lifestyle or the Magnum or the Trojan
I'll go 'head and use the barrel of the tech (Wipe me down)
Man, this chain hit me for a couple grand 
Oh no, I ain't complainin'; just watch how you wipe my chest (Wipe me down)
A bad bitch wanted me to stay lil' longer 
I put that dick up on her, but I had a flight to catch (Wipe me down)

Looking for a gutta bitch if I see her I'm a snatch her

Man a nigga had a blast last night man 
I was smokin' big blunts, counting big money all last night
Got on that ass last night from something tight 
An' right way she suck pipe, I think she was mix with white

Why that shit so little and all the diamonds missin'?

Show me where the G shit
Where the gutter holes be and nobody gone see shit
Hit the purple main up, man I need a complete zip!
And if I catch you anywhere I can hit, you gettin' ripped

I had to meet her at the club
And I didn't even know her
I just looked her in her eyes
And I could tell that she was sober

That's a problem, bought some bottles
We started blowin' and pourin'
She got to bouncin' and twerkin', my dick it start gettin' hard
The lights and 'em got 'em movin' my shit it start glistening' hard

Told niggas that got to lookin' I'm muggin' them bitches hard
Already smoked about a half of that shit I was trippin' hard
So I made sure my niggas was straight
And kept her goin'

[Chorus]
First night! Watch this nigga do it every time
First night! Probably get to even let my nigga get a try
First night! Oh come on suck it I know it's your first time
First night! I just hit 'em and forget 'em I ain't lyin'! [Repeat: x 2]

Ugly hoes stand wide bad bitches come and talk to me
I don't really talk a lot a shit my appearance talk for me
I don't like relationships 'cause I dun really wanna fuss
I love me thighs and hips to grip when I be cuttin' some

Me, I'm quick to nothin' some
I know you clowns trippin' out
Until you find out that it's yo bitch mouth I'm talkin' bout
Real feel this shit 'cause

On the beach just chillin' out
Six puerto Rican hoochies just me, Boosie, and Rick Ross
Bet a hundred on that Saints game
Kinda pissed off I just lost

She ate nuts I cheered up
Nigga feel her this bitch soft
I call soon as you go to work
I leave right when you get off

I stay there when you ain't home
I'm the nigga behind them prank calls
I fuck hoes, I touch them, I'm out shit, I'm bout that
I count toes, I flow hoes, I slang hoes, these skank hoes

Head first, a for sure, and bread first, a no no
To the room after my show, don't wanna go then don't worry

[Chorus: x 2]

I met a cutie with a booty, and she was kinda groovy
She woulda gave it to me if I took her to the movies (Yup!)
Then I met Pam, straight out of Birmingham
She says she wasn't a fan but she did the whole fam (Yup!)

Can't forget Ashley, yea she get nasty
Chopped her on campus right before she changed classes (Yup!)
Freaks by the bundle, yea they act humble
But when they let the liquor in em, shit they will rumble

When I work that lumber, big cucumber
Hit you and forget you, you's a one hit wonder
When I work that lumber, big cucumber
Hit you and forget you, you's a one hit wonder

But if you work it good you can leave me your number
Hit the bedroom and make it shake like thunder
That girl ass phat but yours much more plumper
Girl don't waste a minute go on lemme hit it on that

You know lil' boosie go and get skeet

Now god know my situation, he know what I be facin'
He know I'm so impatient when it come to money makin'
From school, to the blocks, from the tool, to the rocks
For the lil' nigga with that glock ridin' around in somethin' hot
Now it's bout time we hit our knees and tell god truth
Can't stop the way we livin' just help us make it through
When I die take me through, up to heaven up with you
Gotta holla at my daddy and my nigga griles to
And god know
And god know I'm thug life, u fuckin' right
So if nigga play with me of the op I gotta get him right
And god got my back so, when I act wow
I'm comin' home safely through the back do
The murder rate is sky high, nigga holla ride or die
These youngin' sling that iron it ain't no mo takin' pride
So put yo fist up in yo pockets and them bullets in the chamber
Cause niggas slingin' iron like the lone ranger
Mayne it's murder murder kill kill on the corner where the marijuana followed by the bill
Some niggas cut by delja, some niggas cut by chill, 
some niggas eat them delpids and some niggas eat them pills
Gotta get it how I live in the south side
I'm thuggin' with my cow hide
I'm fresh when I come outside
You talk shit got hog tied

Don't make me show these niggas
Pray for these niggas keep me away from these niggas
And I

God know all the killas
He done walked with all them niggas
He done talked with all them niggas
Before they went sparked them trigger
He ain't tear ya up in church, but god pretty eyes done covered up some dirt
Plus he kept a thug alert
For these bitch ass niggas, these haters these rapists
These niggas in the swamp swear to god they alligators
Me an my niggas paper chasers (shit) we ain't stuntin'
We do what we gotta do, to get that money
And god know my past
I'm itchin' to kill, gimme a reason I will
I'll end up grippin' a steal
And god know my temper
My temper like a bubble
You bust it you in trouble
Only god know, it's hard yo, I'll lay up in ya yard wow
I'll camouflage myself with my camouflage cargo
The street ain't promised to us niggas in that dirty south
That's why I'm ridin' with that nine I'm tryin' make it out
And it's hard to live, I'm a community where ain't no f**kin unity
They always say I'm dead they try to ruin me
So boosie be on other shit
Like jew-el-r-is and poppin' chris
And mac on u a model bitch
Had a hoe that swallow dick
Since 12 I saw alot of shit god know I know
Witness a man get straight sprayed right in front of the store
So I get a blunt and I roll it, hit the block actin' a donkey
Killin' my own people, servin' my own uncles
And I

Our father who art in heaven
Hollow be thy name
Thou kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven

But we stay reppin'
But we stay they got beasts up in my section
I was raised bysome thugs, got rich off the d
80 grams took my nigga, I'm missin ya petey
God kno I need to send my niggas some pictures this
And som change to keep nigga fresj kicks on his feet
And god kno he raised me
When donkey went jonsin
Bronson kept me wide open
And that's a fact
But I kno they gon hate tho
Cause I got blocks and raps and blocks of work so u can call me lego
It's consequences, jumpin fences
Cause the narcs tryin lynch us and they missin us by inches
The judge the one who sentence make a nigga out a menace
Commisary low so we take a nigga tennis
A black eye is just like a scratch where I was raised
Niggas handle they business if they ever felt played
The beasts is crooked, the preacher crooked
Saw my teacher at the strip club, damn, the teachers crooked

He right on side u

And let wateve fuck him up to come and fuck with a boss 
Wat you think savage don loss it, now you don laid round and loss it 
And came across to da valter now dat shit jus' gonna cost ya time
To kidnap some children, time to shoot up some houses girl
It's all about Webbie 2007 I'm out 
And I'm too little to hit and I'm too big to forget 
And I'm too slippery to hold and I'm too out of control 
I'm a phantom you lac, I'm a choppa you mac, I'm too fast of da casket 
I wipe my azz with a stack and it ain't nobody fresher who gonna wipe me down 
'Cause I'm on should've left dis bitch on da dresser

All a nigga can do is hope it'll be good

Him, big head that's my thug [unknown]
So where you art (I'm in the hood) just stay dere I'll through it
When I'm riding it's high 18 ft Or some hit with some heat
Told my peeps I'm a die in these streets
I'm a million dollar nigga why am I in these streets?
I don't know nigga shit I got love in these streets
8th grade found a plug in em and I ain't turn back
Ain't no love in em thugs gonna have to learn dat
I'm a tell ya'll the real doe money what we here foe!
Cause say he was coming home Monday, that was a year ago
Tell me stop I blow, My tolerance is real low
If it wasn't for baby bopper I would a died from pounds a some years ago
Young savage I be hearing you doe, You got some tiger in you though
Nigga sounding like you on the cool but I don't know

[Chorus: x 2]
I make it just so sick that they gotta (bite my shit)
Man I got so many hoes and bitches (like my dick)
Man I ain't never goin' stop it's just like pimpin' (just like this)
And get it (just like this) and win it (just like this)

[Verse 2:]
I ain't never had shit but dis rap wish
Big whips but no money for the chap stick
But I was real since a nigga hit back flips
I'm real in thugin' I don't need no practice
Girls under the mattress
Start Fucking a bitch look like a actress
I workin' for the magnum stead of plastic
Everywhere I go I got hoes so attracted
Don't be hating just be brave and get yo ass whipped
I'm a bust him if his ass trip

[Webbie] 
The 'lil soldier wit nothin' clear to see wasn't nobody handin' him shit
Ridin' round town glamor and glistenin'
Ya don't won't my position, I'm spittin facts
Couldn't relax, the whole time I had weight up on my back

Be black goin' back, I got pistols on deck
They gave cuz seven flat, how many niggas goin' rat
Check my tats, ya never heard of dis ya suppose to man
It had to fair, now I meet the family and them, it packed at Madison Square

I had career, I supposed to be right back there with them
I owed it to him, I know it I show it
Don't wanna blow it or pour it
For the streets, give me a beat i'm a roll it

Show it wit them, leavin' magic
But I knew I had it in savage
It got crucial I ain't panic, when yall want it, I ran it
I remember when my granny said anything was to happen

From slangin', hustlin', to trappin'
Laugin', prayin', jackin'
I'm blowin' on granddaddy and all my kids happy its a miracle

[Chorus: x 2] 
It seem like I'm dreamin', ah somebody pinch me
Am I supposed be in the spot that I'm in, is dis really real
All these years, am I really here
Have I really live what they call a miracle

[Birdman]
How u shoot clips, put it in the air
Mean mug them niggas and have no fear
Play the game wit them stripes, put it in his life
Ten on the mic, nigga do it the same night

It's a miracle, the way I bend them corners on them
Get up early on them, get dis money on them
A miracle, a lot I bought on, crib I paid on, thangs I got on
A miracle, fresh crush to diamond ice, place in one price, did it for one night
A miracle, I don't lived the high life

Shined in high lights, did it with gun fights
A miracle, nigga it was hell we came in
Money didn't come in, hell we went in
A miracle, no time lyin' homie
Time for crime homie, time for dyin' homie

[Chorus: x 2]

[Rick Ross] 
It's truly a miracle, that boy still a live
'Cause I was sellin' bo in '95
Ridin' wit my boys dealin' dope gettin' high
Crackers tryin' to give me time, and we ain't talkin' 5

Niggas talk fly so that pistol by my side
My baby mama fuckin', all my homies on the sly
I see all through the corner of nigga eyes
So I keep my shades on, and my face up at the sky

Pistons get the power, snitchin' is for cowards
I got plasmas in the shower, and my bitches snortin' powder
I'm a g, my life a movie, I got rubber Uzi's in my jacuzzi
They think I'm biggie, I'm bumpin' juicy wit several groupies

I got beamers and business, bitch they all on deuces
I got the product, and when ya drop it, it never loses
The prey get prayed on, killers get prayed for
It dis a dream, I pray I never wake up

My girl ask me why I like it loud like this

You neva seen a nigga with tha' pound like this

He was tellin' me sumthin' but I couldn't much hear it
'Cause the music was bumpin', I could barely much see em
'Cause we was smokin' on sumthin' that we just got from Korea
All the hatas was watchin' as they was checkin' the paint
All the bitches was jockin', they look at us and faint
We done came to the top but niggas thought that we cant
Man this lil nigga trippin', he done waste all his drank

I block around the club, they be like oohhwwee god damn
Every body lookin' tryin' to see who I am
Cut that numba 9 on when I play that trill fam
Two supa charged amps with the air conditioner fans
The pipes sound good and the motor is a man
Lil mama wanna ride but I sorta made plans
I gotta go get my cousin 'cause he fresh up out the pen
Then I'm goin' scoop Webbie, he goin' park the drop top
Just got my 94 caprice up out tha' chop shop
Six pioneers mounted up in a block box
Me and shell buckin' give a fuck if the cops watch
Old jams make then old folks wanna pop lock
Check me if you want, get yo stupid ass glock popped
Every wipp a nigga ride gotta be top notch

Then that month turned into a year
And I turned straight to them streets

Then my dog gave me that b
I turned the shit to that heat
Them school fights turned to that beef

This rap shit was just a dream
Wasn't nobody mad at me tellin' me about how I need to come see em

Just tell ole boy he just got a new Benz
My daddy used to tell me that I needed some new friends
I guess back then, it just didn't make sense

For the lil nigga with that glock ridin' around in somethin' hot

Now it's 'bout time we hit our knees and tell God truth
Can't stop the way we livin' just help us make it through
When I die take me through, up to heaven up with you
Gotta holla at my daddy and my nigga griles too

And God kno, and God know I'm thug life, you fuckin' right
So if nigga play with me of the op I gotta get him right
And God got my back so, when I act wow
I'm comin' home safely through the back do

The murder rate is sky high, nigga holla ride or die
These youngin' sling that iron it ain't no mo takin' pride
So put yo fist up in yo pockets and them bullets in the chamber
'Cause niggas slingin' iron like the lone ranger

Mayne, it's murder, murder, kill, kill
On the corner where the marijuana followed by the bill
Some niggas cut by delja, some niggas cut by chil
Some niggas eat them delpids and some niggas eat them pills

Gotta get it how I live in the southside
I'm thuggin' with my cow hide
I'm fresh when I come outside
You talk shit got hog tied

God know I know these niggas
Don't make me show these niggas
Pray for these niggas keep me away from these niggas
And I

God kno all the killas
He done walked with all them niggas
He done talked with all them niggas
Before they went sparked them trigger

He ain't tear ya up in church but
God pretty eyes done covered up some dirt
Plus he kept a thug alert
For these bitch ass niggas, these haters these rapists

These niggas in the swamp swear to God they're alligators
Me an my niggas paper chasers, shit, we ain't stuntin'
We do wat we gotta do, to get that money
And God kno my past

I'm itchin' to kill, gimme a reason I will
I'll end up grippin' a steal
And God kno my temper
My temper like a bubble

You bust it, you in trouble
Only God kno, it's hard yo, I'll lay up in ya yard wow
I'll camouflage myself with my camouflage cargo
The street ain't promised to us niggas in that dirty south

Thas why I'm ridin' with that nine, I'm tryin make it out
And it's hard to live, I'm a community where ain't no fuckin' unity
They always say I'm dead, they try to ruin me
So Boosie be on other shit

Like jew-el-are-is and poppin' Chris
And Mac on you a model bitch
Had a hoe that swallow dick
Since 12 I saw a lot of shit, God kno I kno

Witness a man get straight sprayed right in front of the store
So I get a blunt and I roll it, hit the block actin' a donkey
Killin' my own people, servin' my own uncles
And I

Our father who art in heaven
Hollow be thy name
Thou kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven

But we stay reppin'
But we stay they got beasts up in my section
I was raised bysome thugs, got rich off the D
80 grams took my nigga, I'm missin' ya petey

God kno, I need to send my niggas some pictures this
And som change to keep nigga fresh kicks on his feet
And God kno he raised me
When donkey went jonsin'

Bronson kept me wide open and that's a fact
But I kno they gon hate tho
'Cause I got blocks and raps
And blocks of work so you can call me lego

It's consequences, jumpin' fences
'Cause the narcs tryin' lynch us and they missin' us by inches
The judge the one who sentence make a nigga out a menace
Commisary low so we take a nigga tennis

A black eye is just like a scratch where I was raised
Niggas handle they business if they ever felt played
The beasts is crooked, the preacher crooked
Saw my teacher at the strip club, damn, the teachers crooked

Now if don't nobody now
God kno
Nigga you a hood rat
God kno
A nigga try to bring you down

He right on side you
God kno
Nigga tryin' steal yo girl you had fears
God kno

I ain't been home but a few days, I miss you
I know you do, I ain't gon' lie, I miss you too
Come on kiss me through the phone, I'ma kiss you too
Now I'ma hit you in a minute, gotta get this loot

Girl, we got us somethin' special, I know it ain't nothin' better
You can trust me 'cause I'm tellin' ya, I don't want nothin' else
You get lonely, you can just use the pictures up on the dresser
I ain't never think a woman could have me this lil' feelin'

Girls'll walk up on me, flirtin', I be tellin' 'em, ""Nah, I'm chillin""
Hug you tight, go to sleep, just to squeeze you like my lil' pillow
Then I wake up Monday mornin', don't come back till Friday
And my whole 'nother whip, sittin' on 6's with tinted windows

Baby phat bags, all the purses with matchin' slippers, you done heard
I fucked this dumb bitch, now you mad trippin'
Tears in ya eyes, yellin' you tired of my fast livin'
I'm just happy for to see ya, goddamn, I miss you

Since you went away, I've been down and lonely
Since you went away, I've been thinkin' of you
Ooh, I'm missin' you, ooh, I'm missin' you

From rags to riches, if that shit was to hit me again
I'd have to bring you with me again
It done been a lot of stuff I found myself in
And you stuck by a nigga like my left hand

It wasn't all this at first, till we just kept prayin'
Now I'm on, you a bad ass bitch, yes, ma'am
And oh yes ma'am, as soon as I get home it's gon' be work time
And you know us, we like to fuck like it's the first time

You tell the first time for some reason
I knew that I was stayin' and I figured you wasn't leavin'
I know that I don't need ya but be feelin' like I need ya
When it come to certain people, I act like I got a meetin'

But I just wanna please ya, trust me, they just wanna be ya
Whenever I ain't with ya, baby, I can't wait to see ya
I gotta keep it G and say I love ya, 'cause I'm for real
Now what's with all the tears? We been doin' this shit for years

Since you went away, I've been down and lonely
Since you went away, I've been thinkin' of you
Ooh, I'm missin' you, ooh, I'm missin' you
Ooh, I'm missin' you, ooh, I'm missin' you

Ya, everything I need, couldn't have asked for more
Boy, you know you were waitin' for
I know you wonder why I'm standin' at the door
To let you know, I miss you

You're the completion to my life
Ain't even a question, you already know
But I'll remind you that, I miss you, ooh

Be black gon back, I got pistols on deck 
They gave 'cause seven flat, how many niggas gon rat 
Check my tats, ya neva heard of dis ya suppose to man 
It had to fair, now I meet da family and dem, it packed at Madison Square 
I had career, I supposed to be right back there with dem 
I owed it to him, I know it I show it 
Don't wanna blow it or pour it 
For da streets, give me a beat ima roll it 
Show it wit dem leavin' magic 
But I knew I had it in savage 
It got crucial I ain't panic, when y'all want it, I ran it 
I remember when my granny said anything was to happen 
From slangin', hustlin', to trappin'

Get up early on dem, get dis money on dem 
A miracle, a lot I bought on, crib I paid on, thangs I got on

My baby mama f**kin, all my homies on da sly 
I see all through da corner of nigga eyes 
So I keep my shades on, and my face up at da sky 
Pistons get da power, snitchin is for cowards 
I got plasmas in da shower, and my bitches snortin powder

I Like to play tha songs with alotta slap in em
The amp turned up so it sound like this
My girl ask me why I like it loud like this
I got the by 9s cross the back and I bet


You neva seen a nigga with tha pound like this
I ride by the club and evry body get loose
The hoes get to tootin, all the niggas get to bootin
Don't nobody try me know I'm quick to get to shootin
I'm known around town as the lit nigga with the music
And I'm doin all good, and the cake not bad
I ain't lyin if I tried I could break my glass
The police pull me over and they raid my cash
Man they be wishin they could take my a**

And we blowin and all, I got warrants and all
Done looked down at the phone, I done missed a few calls
Me and boosie was thuggin, ballin out on the rent
He was tellin me sumthin but I couldnt much hear it
Cause the music was bumpin, I could barely much see em
Cause we was smokin on sumthin that we just got from korea
All the hatas was watchin as they was checkin the paint
All the b***hes was jockin, they look at us and faint
We done came to the top but niggas thought that we can't
Man this lil nigga trippin, he done waste all his drank

Cut that numba 9 on when I play that trill fam
2 supa charged amps with the airconditioner fans
The pipes sound good and the motor is a man
Lil mama wanna ride but I sorta made plans
I gotta go get my cousin cause he fresh up out the pen
Then I'm goin scoop webbie, he goin park the drop top
Just got my 94 caprice up out tha chop shop
Six pioneers mounted up in a block box
Me and shell buckin give a fuck if the cops watch
Old jams make then old folkes wanna pop lock
Check me if you want, get yo stupi a** glock popped
Evry wipp a nigga ride gotta be top notch
We don't play a song in that bitch if it ain't got knock

woke up from a long night of sex this mornin
Brushed my teeth, got fresh this mornin

Hit the hood got a bag of that this mornin
Know I'm livin' good all them dog hoes on me
Good dope sells all over my phone

Got my hands all over this chrome
Nigga act hard all day long mayne fuck that
Mayne I'll put it on my chain you won't bust a gat
Mayne let me take you to the backyard
Different color lacks boy
Half a mil' cash in ya hand ya'll don't understand
Bricks in my pants say lil dude this grown man shit
Why is you sayin shit, who is you playin wit

If you knew what I was worth boy I bet you would flip
And the majority of these bitches I done already ripped
These hoes rippin off a pimp (what!)
Tell that bitch stock earings hit me for a block to the wrist watch
Got a couple niggas up in jail, they ain't gettin out
Webbie young savage trill fam we ain't sittin out
Had my wife beater and my braclets and my pants on

Think I ain't demonic gettin on then ya damn wrong
Play with me, I wouldn't even take a chance on it
Bitch put ya pants on, get ya ass gone

And I just got tha new J's, these go good with my new shades
Stopped by the shop, got a new fade, gotta thank god for (?)
Straight to the hood to see some new cake

Sing it to me girl

Soon as I seen her, shit told her I'd pay for it
Lil mama the baddest thing `round here and she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her this supposed to be yours
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it
First time I [called ?] her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil bustie baby cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whenever I wanna get off she know how to get me right

Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her

If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat [her under ?]

Ain't gotta sell crack no more still on my grind
Got a lot of kids at home gotta get it on late nights
To the early morn 50 grand in my pocket like Ivan Smith
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown neck kinda freezy boy
Believe it you can playa hate but take it easy
We done got the streets me and jeezy learned from the game
How to stack the breezes got love from the hood
So it's all good er both goin eat me
And jeezy riding down the highway (zoom, zoom)

Me my records selling out the stores
Now my money on 4s now you best believe it

From the east to the west coast I smoke
What the best smoke we pushing Lambos, Phantoms,
And Bentley coupes now people hollerin' out
The window ay boosie you got the juice now

Brick on top of brick laid my foundation
And I built my house and it was mixtape after mixtapes
And next thang you know I was running the south streets
Introduced me to the trap see that wasn't enough
I wanted the world that was round time my album dropped
And the next thang you know I was running
The world it it what it was was one of the girls
Jeezy wanted one of the girls ima super nigga need a cape
For me real street niggas can relate to me it
Would be a big disappointment
I would hate to be at the wrong place at the wrong time wrong line,
Wrong name, right car but the wrong thang, can't tell me shit
I'ma grown mane 16 years ols wit a old thang didn't eat for days
And months 2 A.K's and a box of blunts if money you want
Then it's money you get hanging wit blow it's money you get ever
Believe that I'd ever believe that I'd ever achieve what I ever achieve

Stop this bitch let me tell the world some
From the bottom to the top shoulda seen that shit me
And my lil' thug gotta it from the mud every thang
I spit I really mean that shit it's crazy
Ain't it hard to explain it I done got famous
All I did was brang it savage life behind the mic now
Everybody hollerin' bout trill entertainment rest in peace

And I ain't forget so for my nigga
I gotta fuck 2 hoes whateva y'all mean I ain't got cream

I ask you to make my heart cold tonight
From all strangers, all bustas, y'know what I'm talking about?

Father God I've been betrayed ('cause I've been betrayed)
Feel like they beat me like a slave 
How many niggas been betrayed out there tonight? (Plenty of times, nigga)
Nigga don't keep it real no more (put your middle finger up!)

After all the fucking shit we done been through,
All the pussy niggas we done tend to,
But it don't mean nothing when a nigga money low,
Nigga'll shoot you in the back and cut yo fucking throat like Rich and alpoe.
Now it's hard for me to trust somebody, family need it they'll steal if they know you got it,
God forgive me I been hurt by a couple niggas 
That's why I wake up say my prayers and be like fuck a nigga,
Bitches want riches so they trying to slide the rubber off trying to get pregnant
When you stupid hoes gon' learn yo' lesson, man it seem like the mo' love you show a nigga,
When it fall off you be like damn did I know this nigga?
I'm glad I rap 'cause these days they testify, nigga ain't catch you wit nuthin' and he got 25,
Just 'cause he say he gon' ride don't mean he loyal dawg, its Cain and Abel again forgive us father God

Father God I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted

I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted

They criticize me huh
They talk about me bad
Ain't nobody wanna sign me
I had to show my ass
If I love you ain't no question I'd give my last
One day this heart gonna get me zipped up in a bodybag
What about ya first love? Huh she played it cold didn't it?
Made a nigga shed a tear and she changed a nigga
So we fuck 'em and dump'em, never trust'em or love'em
No need for friends, fuck friends, friends turn into bustas
Momma gonna tell ya when that nigga ain't right (momma know!)
Momma know because she pray every night

I done and wash my hands with all this pussy shit
Niggas be hating but boosie boo he hood rich
On top of that I'm a scorpio so I'm unforgivable
First time you fuck with me dog I let them killas go
I'm down and dirty 'cause a nigga heard me
Chief was supposed to be dead but I let him slide 'cause he ain't worthy

Father God I've been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted

I've been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted, cold hearted

Feel like somebody burning candles on me
That's why that choppa and my Phantom and my house got all them cameras on it
Know I'm standing under the light
So I just try to do right
Ain't been in church, but I pray every night
It's like I used to didn't give a fuck
But over the years I dun learned and I dun got out here
And earned so much to live for
My niggas tell me slow it down for real, you need to chill bruh
Stay up on your grind, take your time, bring your kids up
My grandma told me look at you look what the streets done did to ya
Alot of niggas done changed on me, I came up they switched up 
My daughter almost died, man it all seem wrong
The only thing good is my dog came home
My mind gone, my heart mad, my soul so pissed
I think my niggas tried to rob me, that's some fucked up shit
Blowing killa when I ride, in my mirror when I ride by
Can see some niggas doing a coward-ass drive-by
Some of these pussies really think that they got nine lives
You might as well don't even bust back, this bitch a hunnid shots
And we been getting it by the pound
You know we blunted out
Something fancy stunted it out, throwin' money out

Father God I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted

I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
But I learn from my mistakes
We living in the last days, pray for me and make me cold hearted, cold hearted",Betrayed,2010

Verse so slick make my video marvelous
Polo to the floor Ralph down like Carlton
Try the CEO they gone put you on a carton
I didn't mean no harm but my diamonds are dumb plenty rocks on my arm
Me and Rocko the Don, East Atlanta the slum
Where I'm from got a gun in the club havin' fun

Webster,"(Webster)
Il est dit que l'homme sage
apprend toujours de ses fautes
Que l'être encore plus wise
apprend aussi de celle des autres
Puiser la Lumière
jusqu'à ce qu'il ne reste plus qu'un faisceau
Aller du tronc vers la racine
et que l'artère devienne vaisseau
Naviguer à l'estime
La Vie se répète tel un fractal
Souvent la tête se fracasse
au pied des idées réfractaires
Mais qui les fera taire?
On veut éviter le récif
Le courage a quitté les frères
devenus frêles et puis chétifs,
...
Ils sont bel et bien craintifs
quand agressive devient la grêle
Ils se révèlent être plaintifs
God knows
C'est une bande de vauriens
Soit que t'avances pour quelque chose
ou qu't'abandonne pour rien
Le plan est simple 
mais l'appliquer est difficile
Est-ce que t'oses vaincre
ou bien tu t'esquives
Si le devoir appelle
Connais-tu la marche à suivre
Ou t'es juste un poids dead
Y allant de manière passive
À toi de voir


(Guillaume Boutet)
T'auras grandi dans l'game...

mais sans l'truc des trentes vies

I'll be around...

Vise toujours la tête 
au pire plus bas tu frappes le coeur 
Faut qu'tu parcoures des kilomètres,
correspondances avec Le Caire
Escale à Dakar?...
Dis wassup à Matador! 
Si tu vois La Case 
dis à Nokti qu' je l'adore 
Pretty soon tu débarques 
dans presque tous les pays 
Au nom du boom et du bap...
tu seras béni! 
T'as pris naissance dans mon rêve
j'étais couché sur une plage 
L'essence de quand j'rhyme 
tu peux toucher sur une page 
On t'pousse dans un tunnel 
en tout cas dans d'quoi d'noir... 
Avant c'tait moi tes yeux 
maintenant c't'à toi d'voir!

Life’s a teacher, hope you’re ready for the test
Si tu dis “life is a gamble”, hope you lucky with your bet
C’est dans les temps durs qu’on devient chummy avec le stress
Si on t’envoie sur le bench
Il faut pas bouder mais faut press
Dans le game of life, prends les épreuves comme des manches
Ici le monde est froid, man, il se retrousse comme des manches
Je sais, des fois c’est dur quand les tentations se déhanchent
Mais si le mind est pur, toutes ces tentations, c’est mort
Mais le mien ne l’est pas trop
J’exorcise avec des flows à faire couler les bateaux

Et quand le calice passe, t’as le choix ou pas de le boire

dans les années 1830
Une ville effervescente
demandez le à Alex Grant
D'où était-il originaire?
On ne l'a jamais su
Mais peut-être bien que sa mère
a fuit les plantations du Sud
Ce que l'on sait
C'est qu'il nous venait de New-York
La même année ouvrait un shop
au 80 de la rue Saint-Paul
« Économie et Élégance »
C'est ce que disait son ad
Le premier Black à Montréal
a publier dans un journal
Apparemment le swag
Il vendait perruques et parfums
Il nettoyait et reprisait
les vieux vêtements presque parfaits
« Un homme industrieux »
« Intelligent » « et respectable »
« Un ami de l'Humanité »
écrivait un journaliste local
Et pas n'importe lequel
C'était pour Le Vindicateur
Un journal bas-canadien
aux accents revendicateurs
Parce que tu vois
Alex Grant était un activiste
Positif agitateur
19e siècle activiste

Alex Grant, il était là, un point c'est tout
Alex Grant, sur la vie, il a misé le tout pour le tout
A bossé avec la tête et le coeur, était-ce un leurre, non, non, non
Alex Grant, il était là, il était là, un point c'est tout

Au printemps
de l'an 1833
Le Parlement britannique
tente d'entériner cette loi
où partout sur son territoire
quiconque possédant des esclaves
devra les émanciper
d'ici août 1834
Alex Grant
un fervent abolitionniste
convoqua un meeting
chez lui en face de chez le barbier Rollings
23 juillet
12 personnes y assistaient
Ce qui n'était pas une tâche facile
car 2 d'entre elles se détestaient
Jacob Abdella
et Peter Dago
Ce dernier fût poignardé par l'autre
près de three years ago
Unis par la cause
ils signèrent 3 résolutions
voulant la fin de l'esclavage
et sa totale abolition
Telle était leur devise:
Lumière, Vie et Liberté
Une communauté s'organise
La première fois que c'est imprimé
Ce jour béni
celui de l'Émancipation
Tout les Noirs de l'Empire
en firent une grande célébration

Refrain

Betsy Freeman
devait avoir à peine 14 ans
Quand elle vint au Canada
avec sa maîtresse Ann Gelston
En provenance de la Caroline du Nord
Toute la communauté noire
se demandait: « Est-ce une esclave ? »
À Alex Grant
elle répondit à l'affirmative
Alors son épouse Célia
offrit de lui donner l'asile
Le lendemain
le constable Benjamin Delisle
se présenta au domicile
afin d'en ramener la fille
Tous les suivirent
et les surveillèrent jour et nuit
afin de les empêcher de fuir
avec la petite aux États-Unis
Grant et 2 autres
sont accusés de causer un riot
Il embauche Perrault l'avocat
fidèle à la cause patriote
Une fois en cour
Betsy changea son témoignage
relatant qu'elle était servante
Retourna donc en esclavage
Et Alex Grant
Il fût trouvé non-coupable
Purent prouver hors de tout doute
que l'occupation était calme
Encore une chose
Il porta plainte pour assaut
contre le Dr Arnoldi
qui l'avait kické dans les côtes
Celui-ci fût condamné
à lui verser des dommages punitifs
Et puis démit de ses fonctions
jusqu'à décembre 1836
Intéressante 
application de la justice
étant donné la position
de l'accusé en tant que juriste

quand son cheval se cabra
et il se fractura le crâne",Alex Grant,

imbibe l'opacité amande
Le tracé spirituel
d'un sentier initiatique 
se faufilant à l'Ombre des Feuilles
jusqu'à la hutte d'un ascétique

aux formes diffuses et hermétiques

par les doigts frêles d'un moine copte
et puis enterré dans une jarre
vers les abords de la mer morte
Révélation occulte
sortie de l'ombre par un berger
On dit que tout est un fragment
Combien de pommes dans un verger?
Forger une idée en cursif
Un caractère bien polissé
Laisser une marque tel le graphite
Un bout de pierre carbonisé
Poétique estampe
C'est un haïku qu'on débroussaille
L'âme submergé par les flots
sous la grande vague de Hokusai
Et puis se détache une pétale
Jadis un cerisier en fleur
que le vent pousse vers la surface
unie d'un lac qu'elle effleure,

C'est calqué sur le floor
La mosaïque d'une cathédrale
Profonde énigme que l'on déflore
La proportion divine
relie micro et macrocosme

J'suis pas dans le bon train

Faudra descendre au prochain arrêt

Malgré tout
Je me rends toujours à bon port
Chaque school après school
Je leur dévoile mon art en bar
On discute de poésie
Étudiants et scholars
dans une classe à M.I.T.
ou dans une salle à Howard
6 AM dans le métro

et me rendors à Providence

à celles et ceux qui m'ont reçu
Souviens toi l'allitération

Faut forcer full fort
Pour que les faits se fullfill

Break it down en segments
Projection Powerpoint
C'est du rap enseignement
Faut reconnaître la base
Celle du ...
Kick, Snare et puis Hiat
Tu peux placer ta rime
sur 2e et 4e
Mais ça c'était 1 et 2
Faut manipuler la formule
Et puis comment tu rap
Tout est dans comment tu parles
Est-ce que tu articules clairement
ou tu mâches les syllabes?
L'un et l'autre sont efficaces
ça dépend de ce que tu envisages
À chaque outils sont ouvrage
Tue pas une mouche avec une hache
Ce qui nous amène à l'image
et l'emploi des figures de style
Par exemple une métaphore
découle souvent de l'impossible
Quand on dit un cœur de glace
On ne parle pas d'un cœur en glace
Mais bien d'un manque émotionnel
chez qui on ne décèle aucune trace
Il y a aussi la rime
et puis tellement d'autres choses à dire
J'voulais écrire un sixteen
Faire ça classique so that's it

et puis courir le long des pores
Quitter ton corps
et continuer vers autre part
Une sentence à recevoir
Acquitté après ton Trebar
Et puis l'esprit
redevient électron libre
continuant sa course en ligne droite
du point d'origine
Crois ce que tu veux
mais ce fait est indubitable
Il s'agit de les rejoindre
si jamais tu ne peux les battre
Quand les yeux ferment
c'est ton troisième qui s'écarquille
et puis le reste de tes atomes
à travers la Vie s'éparpillent
T'as pas le goût
Rien à voir avec tes papilles
C'est comme naviguer en eau trouble
muni d'un navire de papier
Un jour ou l'autre
t'auras pas le choix il faut y aller
Tous vont traverser le Seuil
De l'homme sage au fou à lier
Riche ou pauvre
ou bien malade ou en santé
Il faut avoir du cœur au ventre
quand les battements vont s'arrêter
Idéalement
Faut siroter l'instant présent
Avant de sillonner le Temps
sur un sentier incandescent
Ramasser les tessons
des relations pulvérisées
Tu réalises qu'auparavant
T'aurais bien pu le faire easy
Car du Néant
souvent les perspectives changent
La Terre vue de l'espace
passe pour un grain de sable, 
Et tout devient insignifiant
Un avant-dernier mot
pour mon ptit gars Lion
Souffles le vent dans tes voiles
et vogue tel un galion
Depuis le début tu t'es battu
Faut pas cesser
Garder une attitude têtue
car les problèmes sont possessifs
T'apprendras seul
les vertus de l'humilité
Respect et Discipline
Un grand homme sait se limiter
Le dernier mot
va à ma petite Ella
qui est une enfant aussi sweet
qu'une tartine de Nutella
Respectes toi
Respectes ton corps
Respectes tes parents
même si parfois t'es pas d'accord
La vraie beauté
est celle qui rejailli de l'âme
Faut cultiver l'esprit
Trouver l'équilibre idéal
Dans la vie
ils vont tout vous proposer
C'est en sautant sans parachute
que tu voles de tes propres ailes",Dernier mot,
Webster,"Je marchais sur la 3e ave
J'ai vu cette fille 
à mi-chemin entre l'écueil et l'épave
Ce qui m'a surpris d'avantage
devait être son âge
18 max semblait déjà avoir vécu 2 lives
Si tu me demandes
Mister Web qu'est-ce qu'elle faisait là
C'est pas sorcier
Tentait de vendre son fuselage
J'aurais voulu la prendre
et puis regarder son visage
Lui dire t'inquiète ça sera Ok
mais j'ai pas eût le courage
Je le regrette et le répète
je n'ai pas eût le courage
Et si l'occase se présentait encore
le pourrais-je?
J'ai trop vu de regards vides
sur la rue du Parvis
Âmes dépourvues
souvent victimes de ce que leur père fit
Elle s'est fait un chum
mais sa langue est perfide
Les abus s'accumulent
avec le nombre de bières vides
Il ne reste que la fuite
Vers où? Vers en-dedans
Geler les sentiments
si bien verrouillés en-dedans

Si tu trouves que mes propos sont durs
Demande à celles qui l'ont vécu 
Elles te diront c'est sûr
C'est arrivé près de chez vous
presque dans ta cour
L'indifférence et la rancœur
blessent autant que les coups
Et dans tes heures les plus sombres
N'oublie pas reste debout
Garder l'espoir n'est pas si simple
surtout quand tu doutes
Dans les moments où tu te sens seule
Dis toi qu'ils écoutent
Parfois faut prendre la main tendue
et puis se dire c'est good

2 enfants, 1 loyer
chèque de BS c'est pas assez
Même si tu tentes de te débrouiller
à la fin du mois du reste cassée
Prends les mesures nécessaires
C'est pas que tu le veuilles mais il faut
au moins tes kids iront au school
avec un belly full
Voler pour soi
c'est pas comme prendre pour nourrir sa famille
Qui peut comprendre
quand t'as pas vu ton enfant affamé?
Prise dans l'engrenage
Plus que 3 mois de probation
Tout dépendra de ton agent
et de son approbation
Un autre ticket
Tu passeras l'hiver en Floride
en sandales dans wing
Un tout-inclus à Orsainville
Aujourd'hui t'es pressée
Faudrait peut-être même te dépêcher
Encore en retard 
pour ton meeting avec la DPJ
Il faut se battre
contre vents et marées
Même si la bureaucratie stagne
comme la vase d'un marais
Mais tu sais que t'es apte
Il n'y a rien comme l'âme maternelle
Nul ne peut te le prendre
C'est bien une flamme éternelle

Refrain

Celle-ci vécu un différent parcours
Fallait étudier fort
pour get ses 3 crédits par cours
Service social
Tout ce qu'elle veut c'est pouvoir aider les gens
Son père lui dit:
« C'est pas un choix ben ben intelligent »
Fille de région
Ils l'ont placée directe à Limoilou
Sa première leçon
C'est pas tous qui possède un lit moelleux
Elle est issue d'un milieu
qu'on dit quand même aisé
Elle doit encaisser
leurs propos et commentaires biaisés
Mais toi tu sais
T'as regardé dans leurs yeux
T'as compris la différence
qu'un petit geste peut apporté
C'est dur pour le moral
comme le soir rendu à table
Tandis que ta famille se régale
Tu penses à celles qui mangent quedalle
Quand tu les verras demain
Elles n'ont auront pas mangé plus
De là l'importance d'un muffin
un bon café, des pamplemousses
Faut assurer le service
Pluie, neige ou bouette
Elles agissent comme des béquilles
pour ce système qui boite

Webster,"Je le jure devant Dieu
J'aime mieux être prêt qu'être anxieux
Irrévérencieux
Ce sont de vrai prétentieux
Je garde mes pensées enfouies
Jamais de gossip j'm'en fout
J'ai le silence du bambou
avant un fight de kung-fu
Des dards fly
sous le couvert d'un battement d'aile
Bouge en dark knight
comme un chauffeur de Batmobile
Et tu connais le leitmotiv
Pour le cœur rien n'est impossible
C'est le mantra qui les motivent
Seule la paresse est elle fautive
Godspeed
Et pour le reste on improvise
Pis encore on a beau dire
Si tu tombes il faut rebondir
Maintenant tu piges
toute l'importance de la souplesse
Avec un caractère rigide
Quoi que tu fasses demeure hopeless
Rien n'est flou tout est focus
Pousse dans le froid tel un crocus
On a traversé l'hiver
Tu parles d'un crew de muthafuckas
Une belle chose
vient son lot de peine
Regarde la rose
Pour chaque pétale combien d'épines?

Oh God
Il faut qu'on burn Babylon down
Au côté des natty dreads
Nuff a them tryna wear crown
Prions pour un happy end


Franchement c'est pas le même level
Tu veux savoir? Concrétisons
On foutait le feu
Tu n'étais qu'encore qu'un tison
Depuis le début j'ai tout donner
Mais ils en veulent toujours plus
À avaler mes paroles
Ils en sont devenus tout joufflu
On me dit c'est fat tels les lipides
T'amènes des faits clairs et limpides
Une tête dure et puis ça tue
Serais-je la pierre qui les lapide?
Ou encore un fléau d'armes
Quand je suis high ma tête tourne
Je les ai observé downtown
fredonner tous la même toune
Tuer en eux ce qui est unique
Pour se contenter de paraître
L'équipe on garde un esprit libre
Un peu comme au temps des pirates
Apparence effroyable
Des mèches brûlent dans ma black barbe
On cause le vacarme
Calico Jack Rackham
Les mots d'une danse macabre
L'âme des voyelles mortes m'accablent

Je vois tous ces pessimistes

appareiller au loin
De la sûreté du rivage
ne peuvent que me railler au loin

Et ils ont cru
que c'était juste du « yo yo man »
Tirer les cordes avec gravité

Céder aux jeux des apparences
Obsédé par le mirage

plus ton bien-être en sera fissuré

constamment avec autrui
Juste pour se réassurer

Don't have to worry
Just be yourself
Just be yourself

De l'humiliation et du mépris est née la honte
La colère s'en est mêlée après quelques jours de macération
Elle complote avec l'angoisse pour lui tordre les boyaux
J'ai vu la passion bailler, le bonheur brailler
Les doigts jaune à force de smoke sa déprime, Effexor, caféine
Le déni tue les remords, paraît-il
L'estime sans l'espoir ne peut garder la tête haute
Même l'orgueil a besoin d'une main pour sortir du sinkhole
Et si la bienfaisance est trahie par l'ingratitude
Sache que l'humilité de l'homme de foi en a l'habitude
Il redonnera sans hésiter, t'aimera en toute sincérité
Seule la peur, en vérité, distortionne la réalité
Ce n'est pas par soumission que tu portes le voile des déceptions
C'est que sans introspection, il y a déflection de la réflexion
À quoi s'attendre de la lâcheté, autre que la défection
Savoir se regarder prend le courage de la rébellion
Une mère abdique, elle vous dit:«Élevez-le!»
Dans l'incompréhensible se cache les lettres L-O-V-E
Amour-propre, beaucoup en ont payés le prix
Pour avoir cherché dans l'autre la clé de la paix d'esprit",Paix d'esprit,
Webster,"Hey yo ma job

Dans le marais jusqu'au cou
Au coude à coude on bouge forward

veulent tout savoir mais rien n'apprendre
Ne rien donner mais recevoir
Ils ont déshonoré le temple
Fièrement arborer l'étampe
de l'ignorance elle est rampante
Serait-ce enfin la Fin des Temps
où chaque personne devra rendre compte
Si tu crains la Mort
c'est que tu n'as pas compris la Vie
Accepte le moment où ton Âme
exit ton corps sans préavis
Ainsi t'avance d'un pas libre
en faisant fi de tout obstacle
Abrite une pensée de calibre
détachée free de tes obsèques

à vouloir tenir le coup

Reste vaillant
Sinon qu'est-ce t'attends?
C'est pas normal qu'à 15 ans
T'as déjà fait ton testament
Reste vaillant
t'enlèves le canon de sur ta tempe
Pis il faut toujours rester devant
va jamais vers la file d'attente
Ton inconscience
tu te l'ai fait tatouer sur le bras
La tête haute plus persévérance
égal des résultats
Ya toujours un peu de moi
qui meurt quand un frère déraille
J'ai plus de fleur de lys dans le cœur
que de feuille d'érable
Tu veux des sous
mais t'as jamais fait tes devoirs
C'est beau savoir donner des coups
mais faut savoir en recevoir
C'est les Origines du Mal
Et vous connaissez l'histoire
On est fort on est capable
On n'a jamais cessé d'y croire
Il faut qu'on mange
Il faut qu'on monte le ton
Remonte tes manches
au lieu de cracher sur ta propre tombe
Si tu savais
comme la vie ça passe vite
Quand t'es considéré
comme un oubli de la basse-ville


Refrain


À marcher dans les pas des autres
on ne laisse jamais de traces
Sortir des sentiers battus
demande de l'adresse et du courage
Ya que dans le dictionnaire
que Succès vient avant Travail
les Dividendes avant l'Effort
et Glorieux avant Honorable
Dans le cadre d'une vie normale
Tout gain est proportionnel
à l'énergie insufflé
Une logique propre et rationnelle
Si ton écorce est comme le roc
Alors t'es opérationnel
Bombe le torse mais reste humble
jusqu'à ce que ton heure est sonnée
Navigue en haute-mer
qui pourra t'arraisonner?
À l'abordage tel un corsaire
avec paroles qui résonnent
Si l'Esprit persévère
le reste du corps se résigne
Focuser de tout son être
jusqu'à ce que l'Âme deviennent visible
Et les basics
c'est que nul n'est invincible

Webster,"C'est une journée plutôt froide
en 1944
Un train approche la gare
La foule s'amasse à grands pas
Sur le quai des accolades
Les arrivées les aux-revoirs
Un soldat se faufile
béret au bras et sac en toile
Son fils le reconnaît:
« Hey maman! C'est papa! »
Tous les deux se précipitent
Ce beau moment il est palpable
Robert Madison
a combattu les Allemands
à Vichy lors d'une embuscade
ils l'ont amoché salement
Le côté gauche du visage
arraché par du shrapnel
Un pensionnaire pendant 6 mois
de l'hospitalité germaine
Au premier coup d'œil elle l'a vu
Elle stoppa net dans son élan
Son regard lui semblait vide
Elle qui l'attendait patiemment
Le retour vers la maison
s'est fait sous l'enseigne du silence
Seul le vent soufflait aux branches
et 2-3 corbeaux qui s'élancent
Les derniers rayons du soleil
s'effaçaient derrière la cime
quand: « Papa, on arrive! »
Ils approchèrent leur domicile
Toujours sans mots dire
Robert empoigna sa poche
Il pénétra sa chambre
et puis en referma la porte
Il y resta
au moins une semaine
L'enfant s'inquiétait
souvent il questionnait sa mère:
- « Tu sais Jimmy
papa vit un moment difficile
- À cause de là-bas en Europe?
- Oui, il en souffre encore ici
- Mais pourquoi il cri la nuit?
ça commence à me faire peur
- Va va...
- Maman, j'aime pas ça quand tu pleurs »


Bel après-midi de mars
Jimmy joue à la rivière
Sur le cours d'eau fait des splashs
Quand y flotte une forme familière
« Ha ha! Ben là maman
faut pas se baigner toute habillée!
Mais pourquoi tu nages pas?! »
Il vit son message tuméfié
Il comprit l'inévitable
et vit son père sur le rivage
« Hey Jimmy par ici! »
Dans les mains il tenait une hache
Du haut de ses 6 ans
le petit essaya de fuir
mais c'est la peur qui s'en saisie
Il ne put que s'évanouir


Jimmy s'est réveillé
au son d'une bouilloire qui chauffait
Il vit son père et le shérif
du comté à son chevet
« Désolé garçon
mais j'ai repêché ta maman
là un peu plus loin en amont
Vraiment navré de te l'apprendre »
Il remit son chapeau
salua le père et le fils
et à demi se retourna:
« On se voit au Palais de Justice »
Semaines après semaines
Depuis l'automne le procès dure
Enfin l'enfant défile au stand
le juge entame la procédure
« L'État du Missouri
contre R. Madison
Accusé au second degré
du meurtre de sa femme Allison 
En dépit du témoignage
accablant de votre fils
Je vous déclare non-coupable
de tous les chefs ci-inscrits »
En vérité le magistrat
était un ancien combattant
Fraternité en G.I's
est dans un sens plus importante
Le retour vers la maison
s'est fait sous l'enseigne du silence
Seul le vent soufflait aux branches
et les mêmes corbeaux qui s'élancent
tout redevint normal
dans la villa vieillissante
Sauf la présence envahissante
du lourd secret les unissant

fut un parcours des plus classiques

Comme ces massifs à l’Ouest
We’re most definite
My massive all of us
Des rimes so smooth
Comme la feuille de l’aloes
Aussi classique que slick
À la Cab Calloway
Une musique incorruptible
Appelle moi Sean Connery
Une âme de guerrier
Demande au cousin Eddie Roots
On a parcourut du chemin en sale
Depuis qu’on quitté l’utérus
Des histoires glaciales
Je te les étale
Comme un vieux papi Russe
Des textes inscrits dans les temps
Écrit sur papyrus
En tout et pour tout
C’est le code du combattant
Un esprit vif et des lyrics qui t’assomment
Vas-y tombe à terre",Combattants,2010
Webster,"Un jour au carrefour
De la lune et la Grande Ours
Deux masses titanesques
s'affrontent de toute leur force
Pour nous les gens d’en-bas
On dit que le ciel s’assombrit
Un grand bruit retentit
Car chaque action a son prix
Les fruits de cette collision
Se précipitent vers le sol
Chacun choisit sa cible
De longues cordes de violoncelle
Qui tonnent, tombent et vrombissent
Suivant la force du Souffle
Et l’ombre de l’ondée
Piétine les pays d’en-dessous
Pouce après pouce
Elles couvrent et recouvrent tout
Un céleste allaitement
C’est comme la louve pour le louveteau
Car tous on dépend de cette matière nourricière
Les hommes, les plantes
Nos fermes et nos rizières
Tous les êtres de la forêt
N’étaient qu’une petite pousse hier
L’eau est à la gouttelette
Ce que la terre est à la poussière
Car si elles disparaissent 
Il ne faut pas croire qu’elles se meurent
Elles s’en retournent vers le ciel
Comme Jésus-Christ en sa demeure

Man wooy na la borom Touba
(Louangeons le fondateur de la ville de Touba)
Hila lahòo Fall!
Man beugue na léen wòolu na léen (2x)
(Qu'il soit ici vénéré et respecté)
Wòolu na léen siyaaré na léen
(Et devant qui nous nous inclinons avec piété)
Hila lahòo Fall!
Man beugue na léen wòolu na léen (2x)
(Qu'il soit ici vénéré et respecté)

C’est le cycle de l’eau
Et le siècle de l’or bleu
Tous on appréhende le jour
Où le ciel ne pleure plus
Où les nuages et la brise
Nous retirent leur appui
Et qu’on passe l’après-midi
Au musée du parapluie


Avant que ne disparaissent
Chacun des glaciers de la Terre
Il faut vraiment arrêter d’être
Des gens silencieux comme la carpe
Si t'es anxieux
Je te tends la main les métacarpes
On a besoin de Superman
je t'en conjure mets ta cape
Vas-y et propage
Le message comme des prêtres-moines
Celui de la sauvegarde
De nos rivages et du patrimoine
Les voisins d’en-dessous
Lorgnent nos kilowatt / heure
Ça fait longtemps qu’ils demandent :
« Mais c’est à qui le water? »
Il faut bien comprendre
Les enjeux de la nouvelle ère
Où nos lacs et nos rivières
De plus en plus prennent de la valeur
Il faut en prendre soin
Comme on traite sa propre mère
Car tous proviennent de l’eau
De la matrice, la Grand-Mer",L' Eaumélie,2010
Webster,"J’ai commencé à faire du rap
Je devais avoir autour de 15
J’ai porté mon backpack
Jusqu’à m’en faire un tour de rein
Avec Loki au Sénégal
Un beatbox de Fadhel
On a posé nos premiers rhymes
Et le contact nous fût fatal
C’est comme tomber dans le métro
Et que la rame t’électrocute
Composer j’aimais trop
Séduire la rime elle est trop cute
Je l’ai abordé en Viking
Comme un barbare du Grand Nord
J’ai voulu devenir King
Suivre mes rêves de grandeur
Dans le temps c’était intense
Avec Assass et Andréas
Showme et des punchlines
Qui te vont direct au pancréas
Kryptonight’s on fire
9-7 c’était le anthem
Notre boy Snyder
Disparaissait dans les mêmes temps
Aucune liste ne serait complète
Si j’oubliais Northern X
Avec mes frères d’arme
Félix et Languette Dj Def
Je les ai de graver dans le cœur
Et de tatoués sur le bras
Le papier on a gratté
C’est comme des galles pour un lépreux
On rappait en anglais
Parce qu’en français ça ne se faisait pas
Qui aurait crut qu’un de ces jours
Je changerais mon fusil d’épaule
On a sorti Winter Walk
En l’an 20-0-0
Donc l’auditoire à pu voir
Comment nos skills se resserraient
C’était des beats de Boogat
Fabriqués sur Fast Tracker
Dans les shows des cassettes DAT
Parce qu’on n’avait pas de graveur
Les gens étaient trop live
Come on faut se lever maintenant
Il y avait même des bodyslams
Genre de vibe Heavy metal
Back then c’était hardcore
C’était dans le temps du 2.1
Imagine une vingtaine de bums
Débarquer en titubant
Pour nous c’était sérieux
Sur le coin de rue un freestyle
Des cyphers dans l’autobus
Et on s’impose dans l’open house
« Hey vous êtes qui?!? »
Bof, les potes d’Untel
Ya des Mcs dans la place
Son c’est un cas de battle
De vrais L.Landers
Il ne peut y en avoir qu’un
Pour nous les 3/4 des rappeurs
N’étaient que de petits avortons
Des chasseurs de têtes
Comme ce chien de Boba Fett
Dans notre jeunesse wildin’ out
Ya à peu près rien qu’on n’a pas fait
Limoilou c’est le son
Des ruelles et des bas-fonds
C’est pour les L’s qu’on a puffés
Et puis les verses que l’on peaufine
J’ai connu S.h.o. 
Il avait 2 ans j’en avais 4
Dans la rue c’était Shoddy
Il n’y a que nos mères qui l’appelaient Carl
En 2002
On a sorti Limoilou Style
À cause de la popo bande de sales
Il a fallu gérer les scandales
L’Album Double drop
En 2000-03
Le premier projet du genre
Dans le Hip-Hop québécois
Ensuite 2006
Sort les Boss du Quartier
Malgré tout ce qui s’est dit
Demeure les Boss du Quartier
Les vets, les anciens, les doyens
Les Elder Gods
Il faut que tu paies tes dues
Écoute quand un des gars du L te cause
Un travail assez sick
Kill à chacune de mes rimes
Genre de pendant artistique
Du Français Jacques Mesrine

Septembre précisément
Sagesse Immobile te magnétise
Comme le font 6 aimants
Aujourd’hui au présent
Encore on continue incessamment
T’a vu après 15 ans on ne peut pas dire
Que c’est assez sommaire
Au moment même
Où je te parle album en main
C’est une autre étape
Nouveau départ comme un bambin
Tu connais mon passé now
Presque de A à Z
Jamais je ne le renierai
Commence par me faire boire de l’acide
Comme le dit le sample
It’s a long long way
Même meurtri on s’en sort
Comme un rôle de John Wayne
Tout ce que je dis est vrai
Si je mens allez diss moi
Tu veux corroborer
Demande aux frères Baptiste",Est. 1995,2010
Webster,"À chaque jour que God fait
Pour nous c’est le same song
On s’allume un hi-tech
Et j’te parle pas de Samsung
Si le rap avait du poil
On m’appellerait Samson
Depuis le temps j’ai pris du poids
Je deviens balaise ça me semble
Si le Hip-Hop avait une âme
On m’appellerait Shang Tsung
Malgré tout je suis bien content
Surtout depuis que je chante souvent
Haute-ville Basse-ville
One love Québec All-ville
Ou bien One hate
Quand ça pop comme Orville
Redenbacher
La haine s’infiltre comme un hacker
Ce n’est pas parce qu’ils sont derrière toi
Qu’ils ont ton back up
Tu roules avec tes boys 
Jusqu’à ce que l’un d’eux te vende
Et tu te sens comme Kennedy à Dallas
Un 22 novembre
J’ai 1200 raisons 
De ne plus truster personne
Même seul je tiens mon flag
Comme Lester B. Pearson
But still c’est ride or die
LS jusque dans le hearse son
On vit la vie en live
Et il n’y a pas de rehearsal
Tué à l’ouvrage
Maintenant je sue une couleur sang
J’ai tracé mon sillage
Et il ne passait pas par Orsain
Protège tous mes angles
360 comme un oursin
L’essence d’un rap étrange
Un être hybride comme un ours-singe 

If you could see what we saw
If you knew what we know
If you could walk where we walked
In the dark Everyday
If you don’t know how it goes
Then listen to what we say
Cuz this song is the song
That we live Everyday

Notre lien avec en-haut
Se fait dans de drôles de circonstances
On évite Babylone
Dès qu’on voit le cirque on s’tasse
Ils nous empêchent d’avancer
Comme Katie Bates dans Misery
Avec une bûche entre les jambes
Et deux coups de masse sur les chevilles
Les gros beats ont tuent trop
Mais pourtant on reste discret
Pour tracer leur contour
Il leur faudra au moins 10 craies
Fait le bodycount
Des corps qu’on a laissés sur l’asphalte
Si la musique avait des fesses
La tienne a sûrement un ass flat
Ils visent le palmarès
À la T.I. et Lil’ Flip
Reste qu’on n’est pas comparable
C’est comme un tuba avec une flûte
Comme le Sida avec une grippe
Ou un foulard avec une tuque
Comme un Jedi avec Sith 
Ou Godzilla avec un tigre
Un chinchilla avec un pit
Ou bien des bas avec un slip
Un pain pita avec une frite
Ou l’un de tes bras avec ta …
Est-ce que là où t’habite
Tu vois les mêmes phénomènes
Ici il faut faire ses preuves
L.Land les faits nous mènent

Refrain

À chaque fois qu’on m’entend
Ton boy il dit Amin
Hip-Hop fou commandant
À la Idi Amin
Reste droit devant les tanks
Comme à Tienanmen
Des balls de pétanque
Quand je tire la mine
La nature est la même
Des couilles trempées dans le fer
Crache un rap qui t’écorches 
C’est comme ramper dans le four
Man j’te dis c’est so bad
Même les troupes d’élite chient
Entre les doigts on t’écrase
Comme un fruit un litchi
Et la vérité 
C’est que même assis on run shit
C’est Limoilou autour de la table
C’est comme si on brunchait
Je me fais du rap un festin
Et en déchire la carcasse
Faire face au Destin
C’est comme dans un car crash
Je me rappelle des bars crasses
Où les gens te regardent croche
Une couple de batailles trash
Où on te refait la tronche
L.Land c’est du Hip-Hop
Un moment clé dans nos vies
Garde l’oreille sur le sol
Pour mater la panoplie 

Refrain",Everyday,2010
Webster,"J’exprime ma gratitude
Pour tous ces héros oubliés
Restés vaillamment au front
Tandis que les autres se repliaient
Les fondations de l’éducation
C’est les racines du peuplier
Des jardiniers attentionnés
Que le sablier ne peut plier
Il faut voir grand
Et je ne parle pas de chausser des échasses
Plutôt réussite pour tous
Et puis l’égalité des chances
Le rôle n’est pas facile
Difficultés et exigences
Entre élèves démotivés
Et qualité d’apprentissage
Classes pleines, surcharge
Manque de temps, les profs stressent
Chaque jour suffit sa tâche
À l’avancement du progrès
Il faut contrer l’échec
Élever le taux de diplomation
Parfois c'est plutôt complexe
faut être héro de formation
La mission de la profession
Est de cultiver les connaissances
Ce sont les gardiens du Savoir
Qui perpétuent nos renaissances
Des passeurs culturels
Qui ne font qu’honorer l’essence
De nos prédécesseurs anciens
Et ce depuis la nuit des temps

  

Question éducation
On ne peut le remettre à demain
Comme on dit pour réussir
Il faut se donner les moyens
C’est la Force de la Multitude
De la stagiaire jusqu’au doyen
Car seul on avance vite
Mais tous ensemble on va plus loin
(2x)

Les matins durs où il faut se lever
C’est jour de garde à la récrée
Le souffle du vent est acéré
Et la petite Léa saigne du nez
Braver les éléments
Pour que chacun des élèves montent
De grade assurément
Le stimulant de l’enseignante
Et puis le sentiment unique
Du devoir accompli
C’est d’avancer patiemment
Et de voir qu’un enfant a compris
C’est le rôle de la lanterne
Éclairant le chemin qu’ils ont prit
Car la route de la réussite
Ne s’achète jamais à bon prix
Il nous faut être reconnaissant
Envers Orthos et T.E.S.
Qui nous encadrent à viser haut
à compléter le D.E.S.
Et puis les spécialistes
2e période du jour 8
Qui veulent passer la matière
Mais les aiguilles elles courent vite
Plans d’intervention
Et compétences transversales
Le faire sans les ressources
C’est comme un sceau transpercé
Sur ce je lève mon chapeau
À toutes celles qui en ont vu d’autre
Et tout ceux qui ont fait le choix de vie
De changer la nôtre",La  Force de La Multitude,2010
Webster,"On dit que se poser la question
C’est en partie y répondre
Il s’agit de nettoyer son âme
Avant que la Haine ne s’y répande
Pour purifier ma tête
J’emprunte le style de l’alambic
Distillée goutte à goutte
Au bout du stylo à l’encre Bic
Mais qu’est-ce que être un Goodman
Je ne pourrais dire mais tout de même
Je sais faire la différence
Entre un coup de main et un coup de poing
Si parfois tu doutes, friend
C’que tu penses écoute bien
Faut déchiffrer ta Life
Parce que c’est pas des réponses toutes simples
La Vie pour l’homme 
Est un sentier semé d’embûches
Et si ta volonté est molle
Tu ne vaux pas mieux qu’un ours en peluche
Tu t’es dit Life’s a bitch
Automatique baisser les bras
Voilà une optique défaitiste
C’est une éthique de scélérat 
Aie la discipline morale
D’admettre tes torts et tes bons coups
Se respecter ça vaut de l’or
J’en connais trop qui font banque-route
Est-ce que tu fais ce qui est bon
Ou bien t’es bon dans ce que tu fais
Soit que tu craches ou que tu ravales
Le dilemme de l’homme qui s’étouffait
C’est comme

Bro if you really wanna know
Have you ever wonder how the world is gettin’ cold
Too much people willin’ to sell their souls
If you only knew for how cheap they let it go
Didn’t you know that what you hold is golden
It’s the only thing that you will bring when it’s over
There’s only a few man you can call a Goodman
Life is pretty fast so you have to take it slow

Ils veulent faire une corrélation
Entre bonté d’âme et relations
Comme si les gens que je connaissais
Sont responsables de mes actions
Je te l’ai dit très souvent
J’ai la déviance politicienne
Tu veux me prendre de mauvais poils
T’es mieux de call l’esthéticienne
J’ai côtoyé beaucoup de gens
De tous les types et acabits
Certains étaient cools
D’autres aussi stiff qu’un macchabé
J’ai connu des gens d’affaire
Qui habitaient une demeure de rêve
Mais j’ai aussi connu des bums
Des vrais tueurs des murderers
Et puis des dope dealers
Hope killers, gros kilos
Que si t’as pas la tune
Ils t’envoient des mosquitos
À l’inverse j’ai vu des mayors
Des ministres, des enquêteurs
À la base je ne suis pas bad
Mais ils ne m’ont pas rendu meilleurs
À chaque fois qu’on me dévisage
J’ai l’impression qu’on se fout de ma gueule
Et quand je débarque pour régler ça
On me répond : « Hey mais c’est Webster! »
Oh shit j’ai pas pensé
J’ai oublié que j’étais à la télé
Mais t’inquiète j’suis un bon gars
Je peux prendre 2 sec pour te parler
C’est comme 

Refrain",Goodman,2010
Webster,"Si la vie te regarde
Et tu sens qu’elle s’esclaffe
C’est insultant comme cette fille
Qui pendant le sexe laugh
Life’s a bitch
Mais pas le choix faut que tu roules avec
Gars quand tu tombes
Ta seule option c’est de te relever
Man c’est tout ce qui te reste
Un goût amer une cicatrice
Amorcer la remontée
En l’honneur de ceux qu’on trust
Ceux pour qu’il faut rester droit
Surtout quand le vent souffle
Pour qui tu irais au front
Seul contre l’immense foule
Tu peux me croire il y en a très peu
Qui cultivent l’art de l’être en paix
Le poids du monde sur mes épaules
J’ai pris la forme du trapus
Pour moi la frime
Est un signe de faiblesse
Pourquoi vouloir à tout prix
Que l’on t’estime si fabulous?
En vérité 
C’est se voir dans les yeux de l’autre
Negga j’en ai rien à foutre
C’est comme un arbre pour un cyclone
Côté gear
Tu sais très bien que je n’ai pas de style
Mais sur le sentier de la guerre
J’avance d’un pas stable

Oh Lord
Je rêve de comprendre de tout prendre
Sans oublier
Le rap je sais que c'était ma destinée
C'est profond
Ce rêve ce cauchemar
Mais on marche droit sur le chemin
Maintenant je sais j'avance les yeux fermés

Je fais un rap franc
Honnête et vrai sans artifice
C’est malade et ça tue
J’ai baptisé mon art : typhus
Et quand je kick
C’est comme un coup de Tony Jaa
Aiguisé imprévisible
C’est comme un couteau de ninja
Quand ça pénètre dans la tête
On dit que ça brûle tel un gunshot
Avec un flow qui vient d’en-haut
C’est le débit de la grande chute
Rafale de métaphores
Tu n’en catch que l’une sur quatre
Moi je crache des météores
Avec l’impact d’un lance-roquette
Man on spit fire
J’ai un arrière-goût de cendre
Rap des textes qui te flagellent
Comme 200 coups de sangles
J’ai fait le tour du sun
De janvier à décembre
J’ai entrevue la cime
Et j’en viens à redescendre
Sans même changer de cap
J’évolue dans l’espace-temps
021 SKY 
J’te laisse mon adresse posthume
La Terre n’est qu’une étape
Dans l’immensité de la vie
Fils il y arrive c’qui arrive
Il s’agit d’aller de l’avant


Refrain

Et tant qu'il y a de l'espoir
Quoi qu'il arrive moi je fonce
J'arrête pas d'y croire
Je fais ma route et j'avance


Si le rap est dead
Il reste le corps pour qu'on l'embellisse
Le fil de ma pensée nous relie
Tel le cordon ombilic
Faut rester tight
car la jalousie s'accroît
Un Prince parmis les Voleurs
comme Jésus sur la croix
La New Jerusalem
est beaucoup plus près que tu ne le penses
Si c'est un lieu géographique
Elle se situe au-dessus de la panse
Si parfois t'as l'impression étrange
que la Vie te boude
C'est qu'il y a des gens qui rampent
et puis d'autre se tiennent debout
Plie comme le saule
ou bien brise comme la branche
Dépendamment de la force du vent
Modifie ton approche
Est le cœur généreux
et la tête dure comme le coude
Si jamais j'abandonnais
Alors que Dieu m'envoie la foudre
Et au final
Je parle deux fois mois que j'écoute
car c'est inscrit dans mon corps
J'ai deux oreilles mais une seule bouche
Everyday of my life
Je parle deux fois moins que j'écoute
car c'est écrit dans ma tête
Deux oreilles une bouche",Prince Parmis Les Voleurs,2010
Webster,"Je vous ramène dans le temps
Pour quelques instants
Vous dévoiler des faits
Qu’on n’apprend pas forcément
Je vous entretiens d’une autre histoire
Celle qu’on ne voit pas dans les cours
Amérindiens et les Noirs
Celle qu’il faut remettre à jour
Par où commencer
Pour vous dire comment c’est
D’abord faut nuancer
L’Histoire est romancée
Manipulée
Elle est écrite par les vainqueurs
Dont une partie dissimulée

C’est tout ce que j’ai peur de devenir
Quand on y pense 10 minutes
L’ignorance diminue

Au 19e siècle
C’est pas du tout fini
Ils ont envoyé les Chinois
faire les chemins de fer dans tout le pays
Détonateurs vivants
On les envoyait creuser la roche
Avec de la nitroglycérine
Et ça sautait à leur approche
Le pâté chinois
ça vient de là
Bœuf, maïs et patate
Tout ce qu’on retrouve dans le Westside

Ça n'a rien d’oriental
C’est une mixture qu’on leur donnait
Pour les nourrir en tas

À trop grande échelle

Done deal le shit est set
J'vais aller jusqu'au bout
la tête droite et les yeux secs
Plus rien ne peut m'arrêter
Pas même ma mom ou mon father
Pas même babyluv ou ma soeur
LS ou Raf le manager
Pour de vrai j'm'en crisse
Focus sur l'objectif
J'me sens comme dans l'autobus
avant de détonner l'explosif
Si c'est moi contre le bunch
alors le bunch a un problème
Je persévère jusqu'à la fin
Abandonner est peu probable
Et même si je die
le message vit encore
Porte le à bout de bras
Affiche le haut comme Viacom
Si tu t'opposes t'es un obstacle
Que je contourne ou je surmonte
Tu ne le feras qu'une fois
One time comme juste une montre
Je viens laisser ma marque
Indélébile la scarlatine
Rien à foutre de ma life
Imagine donc c'que vaut la tienne
En paix avec  moi-même
Est-ce que tu peux en dire autant?
C'est l'ascension vers Heaven
ou bien descends rôtir longtemps

Nothing's gonna stop me
Rien ne pourra m'arrêter de milliter, manifester pour l'égalité
Sans cesse harcelé par les cops, me
Intimidé, médiatisé, humilié par la société
Mais je persévère avec mon hip hop, me
Pour répliquer, m'expliquer, m'exprimer 
En guerre contre l'humanité
Nothing, nothing's gonna stop me no
Nothing's gonna stop me no

J'ai les sentiments d'une pierre
et une volonté de glace
C'est encré dans mon être
Deep down d'au moins 20 brasses
Esprit volatile
N'essaie pas de jouer les émotions
Car j'aurai zéro pitié
pour quiconque veut léser mon son
Je vais aiguiser mes ongles
T'arracher le cœur de la poitrine
L'âme teintée par la peur
Tu portes l'odeur de la latrine
Ne laisse rien ni personne
Se mettre en toi et ta mission
Surtout toi car tout s'écroule
Si tu gères mal tes ambitions
Si à la base tu sais 
à quoi ressemble ton pire ennemie
Tu traverseras l'impossible
comme Hannibal au Pyrénée
Mais aussi réalise
tu es ton plus grand allié
Soit une force indéfectible
quand sortent les armes du râtelier
Ce peut-il être si simple?
Can it be so simple?
Une révélation soudaine
comme la vécu Saint-Paul
Ce peut-il être si simple?
Can it be so simple?
Une révolution humaine
C'est la Vie qui s'impose

Refrain

Je me sens comme une star déchue
sans cesse descendu par les paparazz
Devant la foule crucifié comme Jésus 
Battu par Barabas
J'ai presque plus de carapace
devant tous ces préjudices
Ils ont pendu ma carcasse
devant le palais de justice
Depuis tout jeune, la popo
veut me radier 
Ils se sont moqués de mes propos
dans les radios
Ma tête est coupée, accrochée sur un pic 
devant le parlement
Ils font la fête tous ces flics
Chaque fois que les journaux de moi parlent mal
J'ai  perdu mon permis, mes autos,
ma compagnie, mon condo
Depuis 2005 mon album est repoussé
Ils sont sans cesse sur mon dos
Font annuler mes shows
en appelant les promoteurs
Leurs disent que je suis trop chaud
Un gars de gang d'être relié au motards
Mais j'aimerais savoir
quelle est ma couleur, mon territoire
Je suis ni bleu, ni rouge
ici c'est déjà assez dur d'être Noir
Plus rien ne peut m'atteindre 
Mon cerveau est braindead
J'ai purgé ma peine
mais pour eux je reste prisonnier du système",Rien Ne Peut Nous Arrêter,2010
Webster,"J'suis sortis de chez moi
il devait être 21h15
un soir à la mi de décembre
à ce moment il faisait plutôt froid
J'ai mis mon capuchon
et puis j'ai traversé la rue
son, j'ai à peine aperçu
l'auto partrouille qui accélérait
Une fois dans mon char
j'démarre et puis tourne à gauche
directe j'rentre dans la ruelle
me stationner derrière la piole
Je check dans mon rétro
Qui que je vois pas? La popo
deux faces de bananes
comme s'ils voulaient me prendre en photo
À peine le pied au sol
on me crie: “Reste dans ton auto!”
“oui mais...” “Reste dans ton auto!”
“mais qu'est-ce que?” “Reste dans ton auto”
Ok j'ai compris
c'est toujours mieux de rester poli
mais pourrais-je bien m'enquérir
de vos motifs pour me coller?
« Écoute on t'intercepte
parce que t'as une capuche sur la tête »
Pour ma part de rétorquer:
« mais c'est l'hiver pis il fait frette
J'vais te donner un indice
présentement il fait -10 »
Difficilement il acquiesce
mais bon il fallait qu'il insiste

« En fait à vrai dire
on a aucune idée t'es qui
On veut seulement t'identifier
pourquoi se sentir attaqué? »
« Tu veux savoir pourquoi?
First tu m'dis que tu me connais pas
mais connais-tu le voisin d'en-face
ou bien la petite madame d'en-bas? » « Non » 
« Connais-tu chaque citoyen de la ville? »« Non » 
« Alors pourquoi susciterais-je plus ton intérêt?
Qu'est-ce qui me différencie
entre telle ou telle personne ici
qu'est-ce qui dans mon apparence
fait que tu me demandes mes IDs »
Apparemment perplexe
il me répond: « j'sais pas trop »
Profilage live in effect
avec l'aval de ses patrons
Ici à Québec ça fait partie de la tradition
Laisse toi coller ferme ta gueule
surtout faut pas poser de questions

Souvent ils s'excitent
dès qu'ils pensent que tu hausses le ton
Va demander à Big Ceaze
Ta face repose sur le béton
Pourtant une ville tranquille
Donc il n'ont pas grand chose à faire
Beaucoup de jeunes loups policiers
sont bien trop chauds à battre le fer
Tous frais sortis du four
22 ans et demie
une badge une arme à feu
mais si peu d'expérience de vie
Ici ya pas de gang
Juste un prétexte politique
Tout ce qu'ils veulent c'est le budget
afin de payer les temps sup
C'est tellement irresponsable
de la part de l'état-major
ils stigmatisent Hip-Hop et Blacks
Je leurs envois le doigt majeur
Adeptes de la répression
Ils pensent qu'ils vont tout régler seuls
Ne leur parle pas de prévention
C'est un concept qui déboussole
Mais bon pour être honnête
Ce ne sont pas tous des brutes ignares
Il ne faut pas généraliser							
même si c'est plutôt dure d'y croire					
Et ce que j'te raconte là						
Les gens l'ont vécu par milliers					
Lève ton poing dans les airs
si jamais ça t'es familier",SPVQ,2010

Que j'en suis devenu quasiment sourd
Ça fait 15 ans que je push
Sans hésiter sans aucun doute

Des bombes chargées de sale son

Oh! why must my heart keep on singing it?

I've got the urge and now I want a taste.

I left a trail from Hollywood to hell,
Destroy the world while you sleeping,
And I won't fail.

The body count remains unknown,
Remove the flesh from the bone,
Dismemberment is an art of it's own,
Just face the moon and put your death mask on.

They always remind me of all the things that I've done wrong

Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

They cursed and buried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning Hell-unholy one
But now he's returned to prove them wrong

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

And when he finds who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Wee,"When the life inside no doubt has died 
And you've turn your head away 
You tried to pay, but at the end of the day, it's you again, alone 

Alone, confined the mess in your mind 
When you can't relate to them 
You've reaped and sown, but little is known by those who aren't alone 

Why should a man learn not again what he has learned before? 
He's overcome but must succumb to what he's living for 

He tried and tried all those survived he missed, he's fallen short 
The little known, his heart of stone, will make him feel alone",Alone (Reprise),1977

Ich öffne n Bier mit dem Zippo und zieh an einer kippe, während ich pisse
Wird da jetzt endlich mal ein Film drüber gedreht bitte?
Das ist Guck-ich-hab-es-wieder-aus-dem-Bett-geschafft-Rap
Ich bring Pfandflaschen weg und alle „Mach is back!“
Meine Eltern hatten Sex, ich hab die Props verdient
Ich spreche fat perfekt Deutsch, wo ist mein Doktortitel?
Ich liege rum, vier tage Mittagsschlaf, keinen Zeitdruck
„Cool, dafür darfst du auf mein Album, wenn's sein muss“

Gib mir Props alle anderen sind der rede nicht wert
Gib mir nen Preis ich hab noch immer nicht das Lesen verlernt
Ich will Applaus Achtung, Achtung, einmal bitte klatschen
Denn ich habe mich heut morgen freiwillig gewaschen

Denn ich hab da mal die Wohnung gewischt
Da kann man auch applaudieren als Belohnung für mich
Ey und wieso nur zum Fick bieten die Labels mir kein Signing an
Dafür dass ich mit Mitte 20 schon die Schleife kann?
Ihr könntet auch nachdem ich dusche vielleicht
In meiner Bude erschein und alle Zugabe schrein
Ich mein ich verlang dafür ja keinen Pulitzerpreis
Doch fänd ich es völlig angebracht, wenn da die Juice drüber schreibt
Und warum lobt mich die Kassiererin im Supermarkt
Nie dafür wie souverän ich meine Kiste Sprudel trag?
Ich will, dass man mal an der tankstelle zu mir sagt:
""Benzin, äußerst kreativ, eine gute Wahl!""
Ey, niemand kann mich ficken gehts ums lange Schlafen
Da könnter auch mal ruhig bei mir nach Autogrammen fragen
Ich kann schon seit ich acht war laufen
""Cool, dafür darfste auch nen Machpart kaufen""

Weekend,"Das ist ein Lied für meine Freunde: Ich hab euch alle lieb
Ich bin schon so gespannt auf mein Überraschungslied

Christoph meinte immer: „Komm, ich geb deiner Karriere einen Ruck!“
Doch zwei Jahre als sein Backup und mein Leben ist kaputt
Alter Wiegand, warum gibst du mir die Kamera?
Ich mach kein Bild von dir mit dieser eingeölten Schlampe da
Und manchmal wünsch ich mir der Hurensohn kriegt AIDS
„Emkay, trag mal mein' Merch'"" Dein Wunsch ist mir Befehl
Ohne Weekend wär' ich nicht mal Untergrund, das seh' ich ein
Doch das ist kein Grund, dass er andauernd seinen Penis zeigt
Bei Widerworten wird der Dobbo auch mal angeleint
Nur Upset hat es gut, weil Christoph nicht mal seinen Namen weiß
Und Upset fragte ihn einmal was Freundschaft für ihn ist
""Du hast die Schlüssel für den Proberaum, sonst bräuchten wir dich nicht""
Sagte Wiegand dazu
Er ist ein Tyrann, doch ohne ihn wird von uns niemand gebucht
Und liegt irgendwann mal dieses Deutschland in Trümmern
Steht er auf meinem Rücken und schreit: ""Freunde für immer""

Na klar passen wir zu sechst in den Viersitzer
Klar bist du schon da, denn du fliegst wieder
Klar leih ich dir gerne meine Jacke aus
Weil du eben draußen bist und meine halbe Schachtel rauchst
Ja, na klar schreib ich dir die Texte für dein VBT
Klar trag ich dich nach Stuttgart, liegt doch auf dem Weg

Hallo Weekend, wer hat dein Zelt aufgebaut?
50 Euro, okay, wann werd ich die mal sehen?
Alter, niemand verlegt so lang sein Portemonnaie - ne
Doch ich komm schon drauf klar
Ich hab T-Shirts gedruckt mit Marcs und meinem Namen
Vielleicht wusstest du nicht, wem du auszahlen sollst
Doch du hast ja gewollt
Jo, und Rolf, ey, der ist der andere von uns
Der der die Beats immer pumpt
Ey und der die Gage besorgt nach den Gigs
Ey und der wo das her kommt mit ""kenne ich nicht""
Wir haben gemacht, dass dieser Weekend keine Fans mehr sucht
Und das seit neuestem seine Gigs auch Chimperator bucht
Aber als Dank gibts'n Schlag auf die Fresse
Hallo liebe Juice, er hält euch für die Backspin

Ich freu mich, dass die Jungs bei jedem Gig an Bord waren
Noch so ein Jahr und ich merk mir eure Vornamen
Was würd ich machen, würdet da nicht ihr sein?
In erster Linie nicht mehr durch vier teilen
Ohne euch, was hätte ich für Nachteile?
Na, allein sein, also gar keine
Das mit dem Merchkarton kriege ich noch alleine hin
In dem den Emkay tragen muss sind meine Steine drin
Die nehm ich immer mit, wenn ich auf Reisen bin
Falls ich meinen DJ mal spontan damit beschmeissen will
Ja ok, das ist echt nicht fair
Keiner drückt so schön Play wie er
Die letzte Zeile ist für Dobbo, du hässliche Schlampe
Ich hab gehört, das hier war deine Trackidee - danke!

Sie glaubt, dass ich sauf‘ und danach mit dem halbvoll’n Glas
In der Hand in ‘nem Hauseingang schlaf‘

Ey, weder bin ich reich, noch gibt es irgend’ne Veränderung
Für mich in mei’m Leben, die sich zeigt
Ich bin immer noch der Typ, der oft verschläft und darum meist
Viel zu spät im Büro zum vor’m PC Sitzen erscheint
Manchmal stehe ich versehentlich vor’m Mic
Drück‘ auf irgendeine Taste und erzähl‘ irgend’n Scheiß
Doch die Dinge, die um mich herum geschehen, bleiben gleich

Und geh ab heute nicht mehr ohne Sonnenbrille weg

In dieser Zeit ist die Szene voller Rattenfänger
Und all die anderen Sänger vor ihrem Scheiß Computer
Ich hatte Hits Kids ohne irgendein' Producer

Der ganze Hype ist das eigentliche Scheiß Problem
Und reine Skills will keiner mehr sehen

Du kommst hier nicht durch als ob ich Gandalf wär

Ich hab bis heute keinen Plan wie man mit Geld umgeht
Und meide Angelegenheiten wo man Hemden trägt
Ich bin nicht der Karrieretyp

Ich fall noch jeden Montagmorgen nach dem Gig
In ein tiefes Loch sobald ich wieder auf der Arbeit sitz'
Schon Jahre bevor ich das erste Mal am Mic war
Hing' wir im Park und hörten ""Gottes Werk und Creutzfelds Beitrag""

Für mich ist das Erfolg

Weil wir sind so schlecht mit dem Bus zu erreichen

Und, ob mich irgendetwas stört? Ich glaub, nö
Schatz, du weißt, Spaß find' ich auch blöd
Immerhin willst du, dass ich bei der Musik bleib
Vorausgesetzt, dass ich nur Lieder über dich schreib
Ja, ich find', wir beide passen gut zusammen
Ich hab Angst und du weißt wie man es furzen kann
Und, ob ich von dir denke, dass du eifersüchtig bist?
Aber Schatz, nein, natürlich nicht
Du sagst, Vertrauen ist der Grundstein
Der Privatdetektiv muss zu meinem Schutz sein
Dass ich mit anderen Frauen nicht reden darf, das geht doch
Ja, ich weiß, das zählt auch für die Stimme meiner Mailbox
Natürlich darf ich mich mit meinen Freunden treffen gehen
Wenn sie es schriftlich geben, dass sie nicht auf Männer stehen
Du fragst dich, warum ich das alles hier noch mach, Schatz?
Ja, weil ich Angst hab

Und es geht weiter wie gewohnt
Denn ich hab Angst, dich zu verlieren,
Also vor deiner Reaktion
Ich bleibe bei dir, denn alleine sein ist doof
Und davon abgesehen, weißt du, wo ich wohn

Ich hab gedacht, ich sag dir das noch
Schatz, du Arschloch!
Ich hoff, dass du mit deinen High Heels auf die Fresse fliegst
Und achja, ich hasse Grey's Anatomy
Und natürlich wird man fett, wenn man nur rumsitzt
Katzenbabys sind nicht süß, die sind unnütz

Es klingt vielleicht danach als würde ich hier stehen und prahlen

Ich war außen vor, ich war ein Fan wie jeder
Ich habe aufgeschaut zu Rappen, aber seh' das jetzt als Fehler

Was ne Nacht, denke ich als mein Bett in sich zusammenkracht
Ich betritt die Küche, kipp den Kaffee in den Toaster
Stoss mir mein Kopf und mach ein Brandloch in das Sofa

Da geht der Akku leer, ich hab gedacht der hält noch was
Ich mach den Laptop an, wieso ist Google down?
Wasch mir das Shampoo aus dem Haar und mach die Dusche aus
Und ich brenn eine CD
Doch irgendwie brennt am Ende mein PC
Darum versuche ich das Feuer auszupissen
Dann reisse ich wegen der Rauchentwicklung
Erstmal die Fenster auf, hier drinnen stinkt der Rauch
Am besten mache ich den Brand mit meinem Deo aus
Na klar das geht doch auch, auf einmal brennt das Haus
Ich renne raus, das Feuer geht bestimmt von selber aus

Damit es das Feuer nicht bis nach draussen schafft

Ich glaub der Typ da oben plant sich sein Leben zu nehmen
Lass uns doch reden Kollege, dann kriegen wir deine Probleme geregelt

Die seit Jahren über Jugendzentrumsbühnen springen

Weekend,"Meine Mutter meinte mal, das Leben wär kein Ponyhof
Doch ich hörte ihr nicht mehr zu, denn im Fernsehen lief Pokemon
Ein dummer Junge ohne Hobbys oder Leidenschaften
Alles was ich machte, war in die Glotze hineinzustarren
Diese Kiste im Wohnzimmer hat meinen Kopf gefickt
Alles war gut, doch dann hab ich den Fernbedienungsknopf gedrückt
Seitdem hab ich kein Bock mehr auf die echte Welt
Mein Horizont beschränkt sich jetzt auf Pro7 und RTL
Ich polierte meiner Babysitterin die Fresse
Und plädierte vor Gericht für sieben Jahre stille Treppe
Nein danke, ich möchte kein Eminem anhören
Der spielt die Titelmusik von „Lenzen & Partner""!
Leute sagen mir, dass ich zwar asiatisch aussehe
Doch es vielleicht nicht bin, wegen den quadratischen Augen
Wirfst du einen Blick in mein Familienfotoalbum rein
Sehen alle Bilder von mir aus wie das Cover von „Poltergeist""
Realität ist zum Kotzen, Ich meine
Ich krieg jedes Mal gottverdammtes Kopfweh bei 3D
Weißte, diese Welt ist doch eine Scheibe
Und die führt zu meiner Steckdosenleiste. (Yeah)

Das Leben sollte wie im Fernsehen sein
Denn dann wär ab und zu auch mal ein Happy End dabei
Warum soll ich zur Schule, wenn die einzigen Prüfungen, die für mich relevant sind
Stattfinden im Dschungelcamp?
Das Leben sollte wie im Fernsehen sein
Denn dann wär ab und zu auch mal ein Happy End dabei
Ich hab keine Lust mehr auf ein Leben in der echten Welt
Ich schlafe nicht, ich überbrücke Werbeunterbrechungen

Das Allerwichtigste am Fernsehen ist
Dass es da immer jemand gibt, der hat es schlechter als ich
Da muss ich nur so meine vier, fünf Stunden zusehen
Und dann kommt mir die Erkenntnis, dass es mir ja doch ganz gut geht
Die toughe Teenie-Tuse Tanja ist allein
Denn ihr Gemahl, der gewaltbereite Gary, der sitzt ein
Jetzt muss sie sich um die Kinder kümmern, waschen, putzen, kochen
Dabei ist sie doch für das alles zu besoffen
Und nach der Werbung schellt's bei ihr
Da steht so'n Typ, bei dem hat Gary sich wohl Geld geliehen
Bis morgen will er Kohlen sehen, wenn nicht
Dann nimmt er Fridolin, den farbenfrohen Fernseher, mit
Die Tanja ist am Boden und fragt sich:
„Warum sind wir nur nach Pakistan gezogen?""
Sie hat gedacht: „Wir wandern aus und fangen neu an.""
Woher hätt' sie auch wissen sollen, dass hier keiner Deutsch kann
Am Ende sehen wir Tanja in 'nem guten Jahr
Sie trinkt nicht mehr und hat jetzt einen Job als Superstar
Mann, das Beschissene am Fernsehen ist
Dass es da immer jemand gibt, der hat es besser als ich

Das Leben sollte wie im Fernsehen sein
Denn dann wär ab und zu auch mal ein Happy End dabei
Ich muss hier immer diesen Rotz essen
Während andere beruflich Restaurants testen
Das Leben sollte wie im Fernsehen sein
Denn dann wär ab und zu auch mal ein Happy End dabei
Ich leb auf meiner Baustelle hier
Pro7 soll kommen und mir das Haus renovieren

In Lampukistan ist so ein Terrorfuzzi Bus gefahren
Und hat sich in die Luft gejagt und 50 andere umgebracht
Was für ein guter Tag, denn ich war da nicht
Hab kein Geld für Ticket und bin sicher auf meinem Fahrradsitz
Mir geht es erst gut, geht es euch ganz schlecht
Heißt: Mein Glück definiert sich über euer Pech
Ich will sehen, dass ihr aufsteht und auf die Fresse fallt
Gebt mir mehr Gründe, mich an der Couch hier festzukrallen
Hahaha, wie du aussiehst, du fettes Schwein
Saugt der mal kein Fett ab, sondern pustet mehr rein
Ich hab keine Geduld, ist eure eigene Schuld
Nein, ihr Penner sollt nicht raus, sondern rein in die Schulden
Gibt's für mich kein Happy End, dann gönn ich es auch keinem anderen
Tanja kriegt 'nen Heiratsantrag und sieht dann den Scheidungsanwalt
Gehts nach mir, reicht als Sendungskonzept
Einfach nur, Anderen Menschen geht's schlecht
Ich will sehen, dass Edgar Wasser jetzt die Super Nanny knechtet
Weil die Tante schlechten Charakter mit Pubertät verwechselt
Schade! Das Leben ist kein „Wünsch dir was""
Doch mit Fernsehen reicht es immer für ein Fünkchen Spaß. Dankö!

Das Leben sollte wie im Fernsehen sein
Denn dann wär ab und zu auch mal ein Happy End dabei
Ich nehme 20 Tüten Chips zu mir
Während diese Loser da im Fernsehen ihr Gewicht verlieren

Den Stress danach zu Hause war uns diese Scheiße wert
Ich stand mit großen Augen in der Crowd
Dich danach anzusprechen, haben wir uns nicht getraut
Du hattest irgendeinen Sweater an, der dreckig war
Bedruckt mit deinen Tourterminen aus dem letzten Jahr
Oberflächlichkeit hast du gehasst
Deine Frisur sah komisch aus, doch hat dazu gepasst
Und jedes Jahr wanderte eine neue Platte ins CD-Regal
Und als dann irgendwann die neue Platte doch nicht kam
Da hörten wir die alte Platte einfach noch ein Jahr

Ich weiß noch, wie ich damals in der Schule saß
Die anderen waren Fan von irgendwelchen Superstars
Genervt hing ich dort, den Kopfhörer durch meinen Ärmel im Ohr
Und ich weiß heut’, es wird nie mehr wie zuvor
Denn du hast deinen Flavour verloren
Deine richtigen Hits, die kennt keiner mehr
An dir hab ich das Fansein verlernt
Vielen Dank!

Die meisten Wochenenden bist du zu den Gigs gereist
Doch die Gage hat so grade für den Sprit gereicht
Du hattest auf diese Gelegenheitsjobs
In abgefuckten Kneipen an der Theke keinen Bock mehr
Keine Kohle ohne Image
Statt Alben schriebst du nur noch potenzielle Singles
Von der Musik zu leben, das klang damals nicht verkehrt
Der große Hit ist immer nur 'nen Hit entfernt
Was musst du sagen? Wann verkaufen sich die Alben gut?
Was wollen die Kids? Und was ziehst du am besten an dazu?
Die nächste Platte kam, es lief für dich
Das Drumherum war gut, die Lieder nicht

Sind leider zehn
Doch nur für dich heben sie alle ihre Arme
Während ihre Eltern da am anderen Hallenende warten
Deine Band bewegt sich so, als hätt' sie vorher noch nie Rap gehört
Und schält sich vor der Show noch aus den Heavy-Metal-Shirts
Den Kids, die vor der Bühne stehen, ist das egal
Denn du sagst das in deinen Liedern, was man grad so sagt
Du hast die Anziehsachen an, die man halt grad so trägt
Aber an dir wirkt diese Rockabilly-Sache fake
Deine Lieder sind so weichgespült
Du schaust ein bisschen so, als würdest du dich verkleidet fühlen

Weekend,"Ein paar Momente noch, bevor wir auf die Bühne gehen
Keinen Plan, ob sie da trotz oder für uns stehen
Es läuft das letzte Lied der Band davor
Wo jeder zehn Instrumente spielt, aber scheiß drauf
Soundcheck, Soundmensch, mach' mir das Mic laut
Irgendwann hört der Hype auf, sieh
Vielleicht heute oder morgen, vielleicht auch nie
Das Intro läuft, ich seh' ein Meer aus euren Armen
Was ist mit euch? Die Luft brennt
Ich hab' so unfassbar Bock und nur noch das im Kopf

Und egal, ob's für uns ein Zurück gibt
Wir denken nicht nach, wir sind süchtig
Flucht nach vorn, die Tür ist zu
Nie wieder Zweifel, nie wieder „Wie geht es weiter?“
Und egal, ob's für uns ein Zurück gibt
Wir denken nicht nach, wir sind süchtig
Flucht nach vorn, wir wollen nicht wissen, was wird
Ab heute lassen wir die Dinge passieren

Die zweite Platte soll am schwersten sein
Ach, als wär die erste leicht
Keine Ahnung, was dagegen spricht
Ich denk', das alles wird schon laufen, weswegen nicht?
Ich bleib' wach, bin tagsüber K.O. und schreib nachts
Doch wenn nach sieben Jahren rappen plötzlich das hier geht
Dann ist vielleicht die Zeit gekommen, das alles anzunehmen
Es gibt kein geileres Gefühl als die erste eigene Venue
Die erste Tour, das erste Mal, dass alles still wird danach
Fuck, ich will das noch mal

Und egal, ob's für uns ein Zurück gibt
Wir denken nicht nach, wir sind süchtig
Flucht nach vorn, die Tür ist zu
Nie wieder Zweifel, nie wieder „Wie geht es weiter?“

Weekend,"Die aus der Schule leben heut in einer anderen Welt
Als Antwort auf „Wie geht es dir?“ gibt's hier ein „Danke, selbst?“
Wir treffen uns durch Zufall und haben uns nichts zu sagen
Euer Horizont reicht von zu Hause aus bis in den Garten
Spontan verlasst ihr nie das Haus
Und wollt ihr eure Freunde sehen, macht ihr Termine aus
Ihr fangt Gespräche über's Wetter an
Weil ihr Dinge mögt, an denen man eh nichts verändern kann
Die Zeiten mit den Partys, sie sind lange her
Man ist mit 25 schließlich keine 20 mehr
Ihr könnt die Dinge nicht genießen, ihr wollt fertig sein
Und darum lebt einfach schon mal so als wär's vorbei

Und wenn ich euch so sehe, dann will ich nicht erwachsen sein
Denn ihr seht alle aus, als hättet ihr keinen Spaß dabei
Ihr seid geworden, wie ihr seid, immerhin!
Wir sind sind geblieben, wie wir sind, für immer Kind

Und wenn ich euch so sehe, dann will ich nicht erwachsen sein
Denn ihr seht alle aus, als hättet ihr keinen Spaß dabei
Ihr seid geworden, wie ihr seid, immerhin!
Wir sind geblieben, wie wir sind, für immer Kind

Wir treffen uns bei Rewe oder in der Stadt
Ich frag, was ihr so macht
Doch alles, was bei euch, seit unseren Zeiten in der Schule, geschehen ist
Passt in ein 30-Sekunden-Gespräch
Ich weich so Gesprächen lieber aus
Ich will nichts hören über das Leben auf der Couch
Es ist traurig, doch ich denke, eure Pläne gehen auf
Häuser bauen mit euern Frauen und dann geht ihr nicht mehr raus
Ich bin nicht stolz auf dieses Rapper-Ding
Auf keinen Gig und auf kein Booking bei 'nem Festival
Nicht auf die Charts, nein, ich bin stolz auf gar nichts hier
Eher stolz darauf, dass ich nicht so geworden bin, wie ihr

Und wenn ich euch so sehe, dann will ich nicht erwachsen sein
Denn ihr seht alle aus, als hättet ihr keinen Spaß dabei
Ihr seid geworden, wie ihr seid, immerhin!
Wir sind geblieben, wie wir sind, für immer Kind

Und wenn ich euch so sehe, dann will ich nicht erwachsen sein
Denn ihr seht alle aus, als hättet ihr keinen Spaß dabei
Ihr seid geworden, wie ihr seid, immerhin!
Wir sind sind geblieben, wie wir sind, für immer Kind

Ihr habt Erwartungen immer tiefer geschraubt
Und heute geht ihr hin, begrabt all eure Ziele und baut
Dann auf dem Grab ein Einfamilienhaus
Und kommt nie wieder raus

Ist schon okay, Kleiner, leb einfach
Ich hab die gleiche Scheiße durch, ich versteh's leider
Ganz allein durch den Nebel, kein Wegweiser
Aber glaub mir, hinterm Horizont, da geht’s weiter
Da ist der Platz, an dem du ankommst, da liegt die Antwort
Ich weiß, da hast du jetzt noch Angst vor
Aber die Zeit wird schon richten, alle Zweifel vernichten
Und dann seid ihr, wie ich bin
Und dann wisst ihr, wo ihr hingehört
Dann habt ihr Kinder, doch seid zum Glück keine Kinder mehr
Und junge Leute schauen mich an, wie 'n Ufo, ich geb's zu
Ich bin erwachsen und das ist gut so

Und wenn ich euch so sehe, dann will ich nicht erwachsen sein
Denn ihr seht alle aus, als hättet ihr keinen Spaß dabei
Ihr seid geworden, wie ihr seid, immerhin!
Wir sind  geblieben, wie wir sind, für immer Kind

Und wenn ich euch so sehe, dann will ich nicht erwachsen sein

Heute ist dein Ehrentag, und so wie jedes Jahr
Sind deine Verwandten, ja und auch deine Kollegen da
Heute kann es regnen, stürmen oder schneien
Aber ob ich dich auch so besuchen würd'? Ich denke nein
Nein, keiner von uns mag dich
Aber heut' behalten wir für uns, was du für'n Arsch bist
Jeder bringt sich Bier und was zu Essen auf die Feier mit
Denn sie wissen ganz genau, dass du dafür zu geizig bist
Wir nehmen widerwillig auf der Couch Platz
Wir sind die von uns, die du nicht gut genug vergrault hast
Du sollst wissen, was wir heute feiern bist nicht du
Denn wir finden ja, du feierst dich genug

Happy Birthday, wir kommen jedes Jahr zusammen
Und hoffen heimlich, dass dir die Geschenke nicht gefallen
Wir trinken auf dich und was immer du dir wünscht
Und das sich diese Dinge nicht erfüllen, lebe hoch!

Es ist wieder einmal einer von den jährlichen Besuchen
Weswegen reagierst du nicht allergisch auf den Kuchen?

Du denkst wir wären die besten Kumpels auf der Welt
Ich wär halt nicht gekommen, aber du schuldest mir noch Geld
Und dann wär da noch der Typ auf deiner Couch, der mir gesagt hat
Ich kam aus dieser Nummer nicht mehr raus, ich bin sein Vater
Du reißt mit deinen gierigen Händen
Bunt bedrucktes Papier von Geschenken
Jeder weiß, es wird den selben Kram wie jedes Jahr geben
Socken, ein paar Bücher und 'n Gutschein für Sozialtraining
Yeah, wir trinken auf deine Geburt
Und schauen dabei dauernd auf die Uhr
Ja ich sag zu dir 10.000 mal, dass du hochleben sollst
Obwohl wir bloß gehen wollen

Weekend,"Es war ein Scheißkind, das nicht einmal die Mama mag
Rein von der Optik her ein Babyklappen-Kandidat
Die Leute auf der Straße liefen schreiend weg vor ihm
Dass ein Mensch allein so hässlich sein kann, erschreckte sie

Überall, wo er seinen Fuß hinsetzte, wuchsen Erdbeeren
Der Sand, den er am Spielplatz berührte, wurde zu Perlen
Seine Eltern bekamen Angst, brachten ihn zu einem Arzt
Nach dessen Anruf haben sich Bundesagenten ihn geschnappt

Ja, wobei er dabei nochmal Glück hatte
Weil sie ihn sahen und direkt wieder zurückbrachten
Er flog von der Schule, nahm dann Drogen und wurd' kriminell
Schon bald verkauft er seinen Körper für ein bisschen Geld

Zuerst schlug er die Kohle aus
Doch die Eltern der nierenkranken Helene bestanden darauf
Wieder gesund, traf sie sich mit ihrem heldenhaften Spender
Ein paar Gläschen Schampus älter
Sieht man sie Händchen haltend schlendern

Er war ein schöner, schlechter, großer, dummer, starker Typ
Alle mochten ihn, sie zeigten es durch Spucken und durch Schläge
Und er hatte keine Lust mehr auf sein Leben
Ja, er war ein
Schöner, schlechter, großer, dummer, starker Typ
Alle mobbten ihn, er zeigte ihnen tiefstes Verständnis
Um die fiesesten Herzen mit Liebe zu retten

Er wusste, dass sie nicht nur mit ihm spielte
Ja, er und die Helene, die erste große Liebe
Doch dann kamen sie und wollten es verbieten
Denn er war 28 und Helene, die war sieben

Äh und 40, der Altersunterschied war nie ein Thema
Sie sei eine Milliardärin, beichtet sie ihm auf 'ner Seefahrt
Er war sehr erleichtert
Endlich konnte er es ihr gestehen
Hinter der 3 auf seinem Konto kann man sieben Nullen zählen

Helene fiel von der Reling und verschwand in den Wellen
Sie ertrank, das Testament in ihrer Hand
Er saß an Deck und er weinte, worauf der Kapitän erschien
Er rief „Eisberg voraus!“

Das Schiff fuhr durch den Eisberg wie durch Butter
Er wusste doch, dass die Erderwärmung für etwas gut war
Helene tippt ihm auf die Schulter und sagt „War nur Spaß
Das Deck ist voll versteckter Kameras“

Er war ein schöner, schlechter, großer, dummer, starker Typ
Alle mochten ihn
Sie zeigten es durch Spucken und durch Schläge
Und er hatte keine Lust mehr auf sein Leben
Ja, er war ein
Schöner, schlechter, großer, dummer, starker Typ
Alle mobbten ihn, er zeigte ihnen tiefstes Verständnis
Um die fiesesten Herzen mit Liebe zu retten

Auf einmal ging der Himmel auf und alles war gefickt
Sie standen Arm in Arm und da traf die zwei ein Blitz

Der Superheldenkräfte in den beiden weckt
Sie fliegen um die weite Welt und werden gefeiert von allen Menschen

Apropos Menschen, es gibt Grippe auf der Erde
Voll beschissen, alle sterben

Außer er, denn er war ein

Er war ein schöner, schlechter, großer, dummer, starker Typ
Alle mochten ihn, sie zeigten es durch Spucken und durch Schläge

Sie will chillen, ich will weggehen
Ich warte, bis sie sich ins Bett legt
Fahr für 'ne Stunde noch mal in die Stadt
Und komme sturzbetrunken wieder, mitten in der Nacht

Ne gute Schachtel Kippen und 'ne Staffel irgendwas
Ein paar von meinen großen Plänen sind gestorben
Ich wollte noch zu Rewe, doch das regel ich dann morgen
Sie sagt, sie mag nicht, wenn ich rauch'
Denn sie findet, aus dem Alter sind wir raus

Heute bring ich doch die Mädels mit
Und die müssen ja nicht wissen, wie deine Kollegen sind.""
Die Freunde von den Mädels haben echte Jobs
Sie fahren BMW und tragen jetzt Lacoste
Sie findet das okay, ich bin ein Rapper
„Doch warum schreibst du nicht mal so was Ähnliches wie Casper?“
Sie würde gerne öfter essen gehen
Und ist der erste Mensch, der findet, dass mir Hemden stehen
Ich finde, T-Shirts mit Bandnamen, die tun es auch

Kaffee und kalte Pizza mit Ketchup
Ich will Partys und Bier

Keine Freunde, reiche Eltern und gute Noten
Alles in allem ein beschissenes Kind
Deine Geburtstagspartys waren so „Da will ich nicht hin.“

Wenn sie dich ärgern, ja, dann musst du eben petzen

Dass die Versicherung die Schäden nicht ersetzt
Einen Rohrbruch in der Villa und beim Klempner ist besetzt

Denn ich hab wieder diesen einen schlimmen Traum gehabt
Von einem Deal und 'ner Platte in den Charts
Hallo Underground, das war’s, alles ist im Arsch
Ich kam zu mir in einer Welt, wo Rapper Geld verdienen
In einer Welt, da hat die Sonne auf dem Splash geschienen
In einer Welt ohne Struggle, ohne Herz
Unsere alten Ideale hatten alle keinen Wert
Der ganze Scheiß wurd immer schlimmer
Denn Rapper waren nicht mehr über dreißig und verbittert
Ey, Talente und Nachwuchs
Keine vier Elemente, bezahlt durch ein Leben in Armut
Wir haben unsere Seele verloren
Gefaltete Hände, wir beten zu Torch
Gib uns Kraft und zeig uns einen besseren Weg
Lass es Rap wieder schlechter ergehen

Ich hasse deinen Rap, aber für Gästeliste komm ich

Schön, der hundertachtzigste, der heute back ist

Ah, ja

Um mich herum macht jeder Pisser grad Karriere
Und ich so jeden dritten Tag zu Rewe
Ich Trottel, ich füttere sie grad nicht mal Selfies
Ich sitz' da, hör' den Beat im Loop und warte auf den Welthit
Nur das Thema soll doch bitte nichts Banales sein
Nicht so ein Party-und-jetzt-lass-mal-alle-tanzen-Scheiß
Nicht so ein Möchtegern-Scheiß
Will den Gedanken formulieren, mit dem sie aufhören, Arschlöcher zu sein
Ich gebe alles, gib du mir nur eine Chance
Mein Herz sagt mir, dass da vielleicht noch irgendetwas kommt
Aber mein Kopf, der sagt, „Schreib einfach das da mit dem Tanzen
Sei einfach so ein Bastard wie die andern!“
Die letzten beiden Jahre waren scheiße
Nicht meine, unsre, deine
Und mit Musik dagegen anzugehen ist glaub' ich Mist
Ich hätte jeden Song zu diesem Thema auch geskippt
Trotzdem schreib' ich dieses Lied hier grad zum zehnten Mal
Wahrscheinlich war's die erst Fassung, die am besten war
Started from the bottom, doch danach kam nur noch Bottom
Da kann man wohl nichts machen

Started from the bottom, doch danach kam nur noch Bottom
Heute, gestern, morgen, alles Bottom, alles Bottom

Eh-eh-eh-ey, Peety, ah

Meine Geschichte interessiert mich nicht mal selber
Junge, Ende zwanzig, möchte irgendwas verändern
Keine Action und kein Glamour und kein Leiden, nix ist los
Von Zeit zu Zeit ein pseudo aufgebrachter Twitterpost
Sag doch einfach, was dich ausmacht
Guck in den Spiegel, jeder zweite, den ich kenne, ist genau das
Ich wollt's noch lassen mit dem dummen Realismus-Scheiß
Dieses Konzept ohne Konzept, mit einfach Christoph sein
Such dir doch einfach mal ein spannenderes Leben
Dann kannst du was erzählen und dann kann da auch was gehen
Also nächstes Leben, Straßenrap
Dann sieht der arrogante Redakteur in deiner Existenz was wie Sozialkritik
Ich bekomm' kein Fazit hin
Bin zwischen „Lass uns was bewegen“ und
„Bewegen können wir lassen, weil es gar nichts bringt“

„Alter Vater, Wochenende, bester Rapper vor dem Herrn
Sorry für den Stress, doch ich hab' mir gedacht, ich hol' dich her!“
Ich so: „Danke, aber Scheiße, ich bin tot“

Er will halb Battlerap, halb Imagefilm
Zwei geile Engelchen als Stripperinnen
Und gut, wenn du die hinterher noch ficken willst
Da klopft so 'n Engel an die Tür
Gott schreit: „Die Männer reden hier
Ab an den Herd zurück mit dir“
Ihr Blick hat was Verängstigtes
Sie sagt: „Mein Herr, oh du Allmächtiger
Vergessen sie das Meeting gleich mit Nestle nicht“
Gott sieht mich an und sagt dann: „Kommen wir zur Sache, Kleiner
Zehn Millionen auf die Kralle und dein Arsch ist meiner
Du gehst zurück und dann verbreitest du den Willen Gottes
Die genauen Instruktionen schick' ich dir bei WhatsApp“

Dritte Woche, keine Meldung, vierte Woche, keine Meldung
Meine Seele ist weg
Doch von der Kohle hab' ich keinen Cent gesehen bis jetzt
Er hat das Handy aus oder ich werd' einfach weggedrückt
Es kam keine Reaktion auf meine SMS zurück
Jeder, mit dem ich aus der Branche sprach, meinte, „Ja
Der ist jetzt eh nicht so für Kommunikation bekannt“
Irgendwann ruf' ich mit unterdrückter Nummer a
Er geht ans Telefon und meint dann: „Du bist dran!
Schh, Autobahn, Schh, kack Empfang
Für 'nen Termin ruf einfach kurz in der Zentrale an“
Dann legt er auf und dir Moral von der Geschicht

Ach, und wegen diesem Ding in meiner Hand
Hier für den Anlass und die Rede auch noch irgendwas mit Danke
Also danke für (ah), danke an
Naja, jeder macht und tut hier halt so, was er kann
Danke an deutschen Hip-Hop, bist grad auf jeden geil
Ich feier' das auf Twitter, wo ihr so mit Fehlern schreibt
Danke für Beef und danke, dass es dazu Interviews gibt
Und danke für die Comeback-Alben, Alter, die sind lustig
Und danke auch für diesen Movement-Mist
Alles ist cool soweit, solange wir die Guten sind
Wer etwas anderes behauptet, Mann, der soll sich ficken
Wir hassen Vorurteile fast so sehr wie Polizisten
Danke, dass Missgunst oder Neid hier keine Rolle spielen
Wenn's bei dir läuft, die deutsche Hip-Hop-Szene gönnt es dir
Alle sind nett, ist ja nicht selbstverständlich, ohne Scheiß
Bleibt wie ihr seid, ich mein', wo ihr seid
Also voll schön, wie deutscher Hip-Hop so zusammensteht
Wir haben eins auf unsrer Seite, das ist Quantität
Ich will mich auch für euern Output bedanken
Und erkenne neidlos an, das sind sau viele Alben
Ein paar Worte noch an Böhmermann, erstech' diese Pfeife
Fängt er plötzlich an zu rappen, klar auch besser als die meisten
Aber ohne Scheiß, ich schwöre dir, wir ficken diesen Bauern wegen hier
Weil, weil, weil, warum sind wir nochmal sauer?

Scheiß mal auf Rap, jetzt kommt der wichtige Scheiß
Das hier geht raus an meine Gang, yo, ihr wisst, wer ihr seid
Im Umkehrschluss nochmal für alle, die jetzt nicht wissen
Heißt das, ihr seid nicht in der Gang, yo, wisst ihr bescheid
Wir sind ein bisschen so wie Ritter
Zwischen all den andern eher so die lieben Mutterficker
Meistens bin ich da ganz froh
Vielleicht sollten wir für Promo öfter andere im Internet bedrohen
Aber das ist nicht unser Ding
Wo andre Kies machen, weil sie Beef machen, müssen wir Musik machen
Harte Arbeit, wo andere für Promo dissen
Also irgendwie haben wir bisschen ins Klo gegriffen
Vielleicht spielen wir nicht immer ganz vorne mit
Aber Ritter ist 'n Job, der bringt Verantwortung mit
Darum bleibt alles, wie es ist, wir lassen uns nicht aus dem Kurs lenken

Nur blöderweise nicht den Partyspaß, mehr so den Tag danach
Ich lieg im Bett und ignorier mein Handy, ich komm grad nicht klar

Aber frisst mich doch schon so ein bisschen auf, dass keiner es merkt
Yo, ich verlier mein' Verstand, sieben Euro Finderlohn

Früher machte ich was ich will, heute lass' ich was ich will
Freestyle nicht gern und kann mir leider nichts merken
Aber bin wie Jay-Z, denn ich schreibe nicht mehr
Und das liegt nur daran, dass ich kein' Bock habe
Es ist keine Schreibblockade, solange ich noch ein Reimwort habe, oder?
Man sagt, ein gutes Pferd springt nur so hoch wie es muss
Ich bin ein freies Pferd und lieg auf dem Boden wie Müll

Aber nun ist jede Hoffnung erloschen

Life turns another page
But I don't feel lonely cuz I'm numb from pain
Your voice on the phone don't sound the same
I try to sleep late just to pass the day
It's a waste of time so I find a way

To hold you in my dreams
Some times its all I need
Someday you won't be so far from me
Till that day, you'll be the girl of my dreams

Here's to the nights
I thought I'd never miss
Smiles that were taken for granted
And the taste of your last kiss

The grief in our eyes
As we tried to hold back our goodbyes
Feels like I'm raining inside

But you're my blue skies
My perfect little lullaby
If times get rough

I let go, told you the truth, took off my disguise
And when I opened up my eyes
I saw you realize
And much to my suprise

You felt that way, too
Never knew that I could mean so much to you
We were so foolish spending all those nights, I never tried
To open up to you

Wrapped up in a coat of love that's keeping us warm

I can hear a melody only fate could write

And let you in from the start

meet someone just like you

For when you take the wrong turn, get your fingers burned
And when you're losing ground, lost the day and don't know what to do

And you labor in vain, losing the game
When worry drags you down, wear a weary frown
And when you're feeling blue, when your worst nightmare comes true

And only heaven knows which way to go
To share the heavy load down the long and winding road
And when the sky falls in and you don't know where you've been

Pluck the finest flower of them all, twill wither to a stalk

Go fetch me a nun from the dungeon deep
And water from a stone
And white milk from a maiden's breast,
That babe ere never known

Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep as quickly as you may
I'll lie down in it and take one sleep for twelve month and one day

Cold blows the wind over my true love
Cold blows the drops of rain
I never had but one true love

He measures about four foot two

Well my ole aunt Jill bought some brand new perfume
It had such a sweet smellin' pew
But to her surprise when she had it analyzed
It was nothin' but good ole mountain dew

Well the preacher rolled by with his head heisted high
Said his wife had been down with the flu
And he thought that I ought just to sell him a quart
Of that good ole mountain dew

Well my brother Bill's got a still on the hill
Where he runs of a gallon or two
Now the buzzards in the sky get so drunk, they can't fly

Lock their doors and stay in the house

Can the father's love reach the child above the clouds

So as to dance the day up high

Way up high, above the blue balloon

See her bounce along the banks of Buckinow

She's a sweet surprise and odd why accepting all

Beating along the paths, boulder caps and icicles

She melts into the earth and blows the air back to the central

I do not steal. Don't breathe another sound or I'll take that fish and return it to the ocean.""

Holding the jacket of another man

Like a knife in the dark
Through the secret place in my heart
Where my future life would start
But I didn't know
No I didn't know
That it would hurt so much
To finally see you go
Into the night I crept back again
An animal wounded hiding in pain
I didn't know, I didn't believe
That I'd feel so lonely
Watching you leave

When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said ``Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown''
She said ``I gotta go but my friend can stick around''

Go down Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgement day
``Well, Luke my friend, what about young Anna-Lee?''
He said ``Do me a favour son, won't you stay and keep Anna-Lee company?''

Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said ``I will fix your rat if you'll take Jack my dog''
I said ``Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man''
He said ``That's okay boy, won't you feed him when you can?''

The Slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right
Smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes, I saw a light

You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn't like B-B guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard, to let them use the pool all day for free

Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
And I said girl!
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to
So make a move, (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night

The rest of the summer was the best we ever had
We watched Titanic, and it didn't make us sad
I took you to Best Buy, you took me home to meet your Mom and Dad

Your Mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent, his eyes were fixed on what was on TV

Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you, and you were right there next to me
And I said girl!
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to (I want you to)
I swear it's true (I swear it's true) without you, my heart is blue
Girl!
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to
So make a move, (Make a move) 'cause I ain't got all night

So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops, and we're facing our defeat
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me

Then I'll say girl!
If you're wondering if I want you to, (I want you to) I want you to (I want you to)
I swear it's true (I swear it's true) without you, my heart is blue

Seas would rise when I gave the word

Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead long live the king
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castle stands
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
Missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing

Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Well, it's time to celebrate your birthday, it happens every year
We'll eat a lot of broccoli and drink a lot of beer
You should be good and happy that there's something you can eat
A million people every day are starving in the street

Your daddy's in the gutter with the wretched and the poor
Your mama's in the kitchen with a can of Cycle Four

Enjoy it while you can, we'll soon be blown to bits
The monkeys in the pentagon are gonna cook our goose
Their finger's on the button, all they need it an excuse

It doesn't take a military genius to see
We'll all be crispy critters after World War III
There's nowhere you can run to, nowhere you can hide
When they drop the big one, we all get fried

There's an Arab on the corner buying everything in sight
There's a mother in the ghetto with another mouth to feed
Seems that everywhere you look today there's misery and greed

I guess you know the Earth is gonna crash into the sun
But that's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun
So if you think it's scary, if it's more than you can take
Just blow out the candles and have a piece of cake

Hash browns, and instant flakes
Baked or boiled or french fried
There's no kind you haven't tried

You planned a trip to Idaho
Just to watch potatoes grow
I understand how you must feel
I can't deny they've got appeal

Whoah
You like them whether they are plain or they're stuffed, oh yeah
Better face the facts, it seems you can't get enough
You know, you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to spuds

Your greasy hands, your salty lips
Looks like you found the chips
Your belly aches, your teeth grind
Some tator tots would blow your mind

And you don't mind if they're not cooked
You need your fix, I guess you're hooked
And late at night you always dream
Of bacon bits and sour cream

There's music in the air
The sleigh bells are ringing and the carolers are singing
While the air raid sirens blare
It's Christmas at ground zero

Everywhere the atom bombs are dropping
It's the end of all humanity
No more time for last minute shopping
It's time to meet your final destiny
It's Christmas at ground zero
There's panic in the crowd
While we dodge debris let's trim the tree
Underneath the mushroom cloud

You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill
But if someone's climbing down your chimney
You better load your gun and shoot to kill
It's Christmas at ground zero
And if the radiation levels OK
I'll go out with you and see all the new
Mutations on New Year's Day
It's Christmas at ground zero
Just seconds left to go
I'll duck and cover with my Yuletide lover
Underneath the mistletoe

Doctor, listen to me, tell me what this means
First I'm goin' shoppin' in my underwear
Then all of sudden I'm floating in mid air
My lips fall off and everybody starts to stare
Donuts and hot dogs are flying everywhere

Now Doctor, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet
Next comes the part that I won't ever forget
Now I'm bein' followed by these Russian spies
They give me some velcro, and an order of fries
Suddenly I'm bowling on the Starship Enterprise
I fall down a hole and that's when I realize

I am stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after night after night after night

All right!

Doctor, won't you tell me, am I going insane
Was it something I ate or something wrong with my brain
See, I'm naked in church when I meet a dinosaur
Try to run, but my feet have been nailed to the floor
Then a midget pushes me through a revolving door
And I'm back in the very same place I was before

Now I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
I'm stuck in a closet with Vanna White
Night after night after night after night

And I can't bust out and I can't break free
And it's gettin' just a little too stuffy here for me
And I can't go home and I can't get loose
And I try to escape but it's just no use

And I can't ever leave and I can't ever win

Weird Al Yankovic,"Well, I had two weeks of vacation time coming
After working all year down at Big Roy's Heating And Plumbing
So one night when my family the I were gathered 'round the dinner table
I said, ""Kids, if you could go anywhere in this great big world, now
Where'd you like to go ta""
They said, ""Dad, we want to see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota""
They picked the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

So the very next day we loaded up the car
With potato skins and pickled wieners,
Crossword puzzles, Spider-Man comics, and mama's home made rhubarb pie
Pulled out of the driveway and the neighbors, they all waved good-bye
And so began our three day journey

We picked up a guy holding a sign that said ""twine ball or bust""
He smelled real bad and he said his name was Bernie
I put in a Slim Whitman tape, my wife put on a brand new hair net
Kids were in the back seat jumping up and down,
Yelling ""Are we there yet?""
And all of us were joined together in one common thought
As we rolled down the long and winding interstate in our '53 DeSoto
We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
We're headin' for the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Oh, we couldn't wait to get there
So we drove straight through for three whole days and nights
Of course, we stopped for more pickled wieners now and then
The scenery was just so pretty, boy I wish the kids could of seen it
But you can't see out of the side of the car
Because the windows are completely covered
With the decals of all the place where we've already been

There's Elvis-O-Rama, the Tupperware Museum,
The Boll Weevil Monument, and Cranberry World,
The Shuffleboard Hall Of Fame, Poodle Dog Rock,
And The Mecca of Albino Squirrels
We've been to ghost towns, theme parks, wax museums,
And a place where you can drive through the middle of a tree
We've seen alligator farms and tarantula ranches,
But there's still one thing we gotta see

Well, we crossed the state line about 6:39
And we saw a sign that said ""Twine Ball exit - 50 miles""
Oh, the kids were so happy the started singing 
""99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall"" for the 27th time that day
So, we pulled off the road at the last chance gas station
Got a few more pickled wieners and a diet chocolate soda
On our way to see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
We're gonna see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Finally, at 7:37 early Wednesday evening as the sun was setting
In the Minnesota sky
Out in the distance, on the horizon, it appeared to me like a vision 
Before my unbelieving eye
I parked the car and walked with awe-filled reverence towards that 
Glorious huge majestic sphere
I was just so overwhelmed by its sheer immensity,
I had to pop myself a beer
Yes, on these hallowed grounds, open ten to eight on weekdays,
In a little shrine under a make-shift pagoda,
There sits the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I tell you, it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Oh, what on earth would make a man decide to do that kind of thing?
Oh, windin' up twenty-one thousand, one hundred forty pounds of string
What was he trying to prove, who was he trying to impress
Why did he build it, how did he do, it was anybody's guess
Where did he get the twine, what was goin' through his mind
Did it just seem like a good idea at the time

Well, we walked up beside it and I warned the kids
""Now, you better not touch it, those ropes are there for a reason""
I said, ""Maybe if you're good, I'll tie it to the back of our car
And we can take it home"", but I was only teasin'
Then we went to the gift shop and stood in line
Bought a souvenir miniature ball of twine, some window decals,
And anything else they'd sell us
And we bought a couple post cards, ""Greetings from the twine ball,
Wish you were here""
Won't the folks back home be jealous

I gave our camera to Bernie and we stood by the ball and we all gathered
'round and said, ""Cheese""
The Bernie ran away with my brand new Insti-Matic,
But at least we got our memories
Then we all just stared at the ball for a while and my eyes got moist,
But I said with a smile, ""Kids, this here's what America's all about""
Then I started feelin' kinda gooey inside and I fell on my knees
And I cried and cried
And that's when those security guards threw us out
You know, I bet if we unraveled that sucker,
It'd roll all the way down to Fargo, North Dakota
'Cause it's the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota
I'm talkin' 'bout the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

Well, we stayed that night at the Twine Ball Inn
In the morning we were on our way home again
But we really didn't want to leave, that was perfectly clear
I said, ""Folks, I can tell you're all sad to go""
Then I winked my eye and I said, ""You know, I got a funny kind of feelin' 
We'll be comin' back again next year""
'Cause I've been all around this great big world
And I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather go to 
Than the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota

If Drano's a joke and your plunger is broke
Baby, call the mensch with a monkey wrench

Ba-ba ba ba ba, kitchen's flooded, too

If he works for one day, costs you half a year's pay

So if you've got cash, he'll be there in a flash
Makin' service calls in his overalls
(Baby) He'll do his best for you

Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Leaky pipes are a bummer
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby
Time to call the plumber
Maybe call a few

Got a problem with plumbing?
Gotta blame it on something
Blame it on the drain it was cloggin', cloggin'
Blame it on the faucet that drips all night
If hairballs, grease and goo
Won't let the water through
Blame it on the drain, yeah, yeah

When I flush the john, now when I flush the john
It turns your shower on

When you pushed me down that elevator shaft

Doing in my underwear drawer?
Sometime I get to thinking you don't love me any more

You slammed my face down on the barbecue grill
Now my scars are all healing, but my heart never will
You set my house on fire
You pulled out my chest hairs with an old pair of pliers

Oh, you think that I'm ugly and you say that I'm cheap

You drilled a hole in my head

I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said ""yoda""
Y-O-D-A, Yoda

Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green
Oh, my Yoda

Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I left home just a week before
And I've never ever been a Jedi before
But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course
He said, ""Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force""

Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again
With my Yoda

So I used the Force
I picked up a box
I lifted some rocks
While I stood on my head
Well, I won't forget what Yoda said

He said, ""Luke, stay away from the darker side
And if you start to go astray, let the Force be your guide""
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

""I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed
But remember, if you kill him, then you'll be unemployed""
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess
So I'm gonna have to leave Yoda, I guess
But I know that I'll be coming back some day
I'll be playing this part 'till I'm old and grey

The long-term contract that I had to sign
Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time

Swore that one day she would be a figure skating champion

And so she hired some guy to
Club her in the kneecap

Weird Al Yankovic,"As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the morning I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at a discount price

A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude?
You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree
I really look good in black fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Caruso
It's as primitive as can be

We're just plain and simple guys

There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish Paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice

Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise anutter
Think you're really righteous?
Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million time as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes want to be like
On my knees day and night scorin' points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie

We're all crazy Mennonites

Buddy, if they ever figured out where you were callin' 'em from

One day the phone police will be there at his door

Only dial the seven-digit numbers you're used to
Swear someday I'm gonna yank that phone cord right out from the wall
How long is this phase gonna last?

Uh, yeah, hello, is Mike there?
Last name Rotch.
Hold on. I'll check.
Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch!
Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch lately?

One of these days, I'm going to catch you,
And I'm going to carve my name on your back with an ice pick!

Hope that you grow out of this fast

Weird Al Yankovic,"It's been one week since we got to see 
Cheatin' lovers and cousins that marry 
Five days since they had the show 
With the hermaphrodite, the slut and the crack ho 
Three days since we heard the tale 
About the guy who learned his woman was a she-male 
Yesterday it occurred to me 
That I've been watchin' a bit too much Jerry Springer 

Holy cow, d'you see it last week? 
Well, they had this one freak 
Who sucker-punched his whole family 
Do you recall when the brawl 
Became a total free-for-all? 
And Jerry's in the middle tryin' to be the referee 
Hey, see the stripper with the implants? 
She likes to lap dance 
And date the boyfriend of her mother 
Now here comes Jerry's next guest 
And it's a slugfest 
Cause it's her trailer trash brother 
Nymphomaniac is back on crack 
It's like ""When Animals Attack"" 
They all exhibit reprehensible behavior 
Hit 'em in the nose, tear off their clothes 
Step on their toes, that's how it goes 
They get so violent they have to sign a waiver 

They're always swearin', cursin', kickin' butt and pointin' blame 
On the air? They don't care, they've got no shame 
There was one guy who I'm sure felt a little strange 
When he found out that his wife had a sex change 
They have a tendency to scream and yell constantly 
They have a history of ripping off their shirts 

It's been one week since they had the fight 
With the Siamese twins and the transvestite 
Five days since that awful brawl 
They still haven't got the blood off the wall 
It's been three days since the bitter feud 
Between the KKK and that gay Jewish black dude 
Yesterday, finally dawned on me 
I'm spendin' way too much time on that Jerry Springer 

Baby, I've been sleepin' with your sister. 
Oh, which one? 
All of 'em. 
Ah, well, I've been sleepin' with your best friend Jake. 
Yeah? W-Well, me too! And, I've been sleepin' with your dog Woofie! 
Woofie, you bitch! Well I'm also sleepin' with your pet goat! 
That goat doesn't love you! 

Once you start watchin', there's just no stoppin' 
Your brain shuts down, then your IQ's droppin' 
Jerry's the king of confrontation 
He's a sensation 
He puts the 'sin' in syndication 
It's totally worthless, like a bad check 
It's like a train wreck 
Don't want to stare, but you can't look away 
Like Sally Jesse he does talk shows 
But with more weirdos 
The ratings jumpin' higher every day 
If you've seen the show, well then you know 
It's just as low as you can go 
The guests are tacky and they're lacking in their hygiene 
And pretty soon some ugly goon 
Comes in the room and then it's BOOM 
In the face of some unsuspecting drag queen 

Well, it's the kind of show where people scream obscenities 
Yankin' hair, throwin' chairs at their hubbies 
""Jerry! Jerry!"" Now the crowd starts their favorite chant 
Should I turn off my TV? I just can't 
I have a tendency to watch it religiously 
I have a history of taping each one 

It's been one week since the show about 
Psycho killers with problems they should work out 
Five days since the big surprise 
When some loser's wife said that she's still dating twenty guys 
Three days since he interviewed 
A bunch of psychic porn star midgets who were all nude 
Yesterday, it occurred to me 
That I've been watchin' a bit too much Jerry Springer 
Tired of wastin' my time on that Jerry Springer 
I've got way too much class to watch Jerry Springer 
Come over here and pull on my finger",Jerry Springer,1999
Weird Al Yankovic,"A long long time ago
In a galaxy far away
Naboo was under an attack
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
Could talk the Federation into
Maybe cutting them a little slack
But their response, it didn't thrill us
They locked the doors and tried to kill us
We escaped from that gas
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass
We took a bongo from the scene
And we went to Theed to see the queen
We all wound up on Tatooine
That's where we found this boy

Oh my my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""

Did you know this junkyard slave
Isn't even old enough to shave
But he can use the Force they say
Ah, do you see him hitting on the queen
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen
Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday
Well, I know he built C3PO
And I've heard how fast his pod can go
And we were broke, it's true
So we made a wager or two
He was a prepubescent flyin' ace
And the minute Jabba started off that race
Well, I know who would win first place
Oh yes, it was our boy

We started singin', my my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""
""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""

Now we finally got to Coruscant
The Jedi Council we knew would want
To see how good the boy could be
So we took him there and we told the tale
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale
And he might fulfill that prophecy
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course
Could he bring balance to the force?
They interviewed the kid
Oh, training they forbid
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear
And Qui-Gon said, ""Now listen here
Just stick it in your pointy ear
I still will teach this boy""

He was singin' my my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""

We caught a ride back to Naboo
Cause Queen Amidala wanted to
I frankly would've liked to stay
We all fought in that epic war
And it wasn't long at all before
Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day
And in the end some Gungans died
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried
A lot of folks were croakin'
The battle droids were broken
And the Jedi I admire most
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost
I guess I'll train this boy

And I was singin', my my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin' ""Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""
We were singin', my my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye

Weird Al Yankovic,"Uh huh, extra cheese
Uh huh, uh huh, save a piece for me

Pizza party at your house
I went just to check it out
Nineteen extra larges
What a shame
No one came

Just us eatin' all alone
You said, ""Take the pizza home""
""No sense lettin' all this go to waste""
So then I faced

Pizza all day
And every day
This cheese 'round the clock
Is gettin' me blocked
And I sure don't care
For irregularity

Tell me
Why'd you have to go and make me so constipated?
'Cause right now I'd do anything to just get my bowels evacuated
In the bathroom, I sit and I wait and I strain
And I sweat and I clench and I feel the pain
Oh, should I take laxatives or have my colon irrigated?
No no no

I was feelin' pretty down
'Till my girlfriend came around
We're just so alike in every way
I gotta say

In fact, I just thought I might
Pop the question there that night
I was kissing her so tenderly
But woe is me

Who would have guessed
Her family crest
I'd suddenly spy
Tattooed on her thigh
And son-of-a-gun
It's just like the one on me

Tell me
How was I supposed to know we were both related?
Believe me, if I knew she was my cousin we never would have dated
What to do now? Should I go ahead and propose
And get hitched and have kids with eleven toes
And move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated?
No no no no no no no
No no no no no no no
No no no no no

I had so much on my mind
I thought maybe I'd unwind
Try out that new roller coaster ride
And the guide

Said not to stand
But that's a demand
That I couldn't meet
I got on my feet
And stood up instead
And knocked off my head, you see

Tell me
Why'd I have to go and get myself decapitated?
This really is a major inconvenience, oh man, I really hate it
Such a drag, now
Can't eat, I can't breathe, I can't snore
I can't belch or yodel anymore
Can't spit or blow my nose or even read Sports Illustrated

Oh no
Why'd I have to go and get myself all mutilated? (yeah, yeah)
I gotta tell ya, life without a head kinda makes me irritated
What a bummer
Can't blink, I can't cough, I can't sneeeze
But my neck is enjoyin' a pleasant breeze now

Just when I thought I said all I could say I came up up with more secrets to tell you today
These are my confessions
Slip my mind the last two times
Silly me, so now I gotta give you part three of my confessions
First I told you about the skank that I was cheating with,then I mentioned she's having my kid
That's not all, now I recall more you see, so I'll give you part three of my confessions

Now this is gonna be the hardest thing I ever had to do,
Gonna tell you everything I left out of parts one and two
Like remember when I told you I knew Paulie Shore (Paulie Shore)
That's a lie, I don't know what I said that for
I borrowed your chapstick (from you)
I tried out your nose hair trimmer (too)
And by the way your diamond ring is cubic circonium,
I killed your goldfish accidently, just replaced it with another one

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say I needed to get some things off my chest right away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions
I threw up on your dog last time I had too much to drink
There have been times when I've peed in your sink
Don't know why, but you and I should agree that belongs in part three of my confessions

Baby forgive me I'm still trying to figure out why 
I used your toothbrush to clean off the bathroom grought
Oh and sometimes in private, I really like to dress up as Shirley Temple and spank myself with a hockey stick (hockey stick)
My boss thinks I'm a jerk, I didn't get that raise.
I haven't changed my underwear in twenty-seven days!
And when I'm kissing you I fantasize you as a midget
I'm so sorry Debbi! I mean Bridget!

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say I got a few more secrets I'd like to convey
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions
Gave you buttered toast I dropped and then picked up off the floor
FYI it was not a cold sore
Ooops my bad, but you'll be madder at me when I finish part three of my confessions

You don't know how hard it is for me to tell you this, 
But remember that shirt that you got me for my birthday?
Well, I returned it for store credit. That thing was hideous, what were you thinking?
O and by the way, I wasn't really sick last week,
I just didn't wanna go to your stupid office picnic
Oh and when I told you at breakfast we were all out of rice krispies,
What I meant was that there was only enough left for me. Sorry.

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say, I thought of some more things that should scare you away
These are my confessions
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part three of my confessions
Once I blew my nose and wiped it on your cat
And I lied, yes that dress makes you look fat
Anyway, I shouldn't say anymore 'til I give you part four of my confessions","Confessions, Pt. 3",2006
Weird Al Yankovic,"I know that you
Don't know me very well
We've barely met
But I can surely tell
No one will ever
Love you like I do

I like to feel
The warm spot on your chair
Sometimes I drool
And usually I stare
My precious one
I saved that gum
That you threw in the garbage

You're the one I dream about
But the only question with me now
Is ""Do I creep you out?""
Everytime I shake your hand now
Wanna stick your fingers in my mouth
Do I creep you out?

Call you every night and hang up
Gonna carve your name in my leg
In my leg, oh-oh!

Somethin' I should ask about
Can I sniff the pit-stains on your blouse?
And do I creep you,
Do I creep you out?
(Your restraining order's out)
(Still the only question with me now)
Oh the only question
(Is ""Do I creep you out?"")
Is ""Do I creep you out?""

Follow you from work right to your house
Well, do I creep you out?
Do I creep you out?

Weird Al Yankovic,"Seven O'Clock in the evening
Watchin' somethin' stupid on TV
I'm zoned out on the sofa
When my wife comes in the room and sees me

And she says ""is this 'Behind the Music'
With Lynard Skynard?""
And I say I don't know
Say, it's gettin' late, watcha wanna do for dinner?

She says ""I kinda had a big lunch
So I'm not super hungry""
I said, well you know, baby, I'm not starvin' either
But I could eat""

She said ""So whadya have in mind?""
I said I don't know what about you?
She said ""I don't care, if you're hungry, let's eat""
I said that's what we're gonna do!

But first you gotta tell me
What it is you're hungry for!
And she says ""let me think,
What's left in our refrigerator?""

I said well, there's tuna, I know
She said ""That went bad a week ago!""
I said is the chili okay?
She said ""you finished that yesterday!""

I hopped up and I said
I don't know, do you want to get something delivered?
She's like ""why would I want to eat liver?
I don't even like liver!""

I'm like no, I said 'delivered'
She's like ""I heard you say liver!""
I'm like I should know what I said
She's like ""whatever, I just don't want any liver!""

Well I was gonna say something
But my cell phone started to ring
Now who could be callin' me?
Well I checked my caller ID

It was just cousin Larry
Callin' for the third time today
My wife said ""Let it go to voicemail""
I said okay

Where were we? Oh, Dinner, Right
So what d'ya want to do?
She said ""why don't you whip up somethin in the kitchen?""
Yeah, I said why don't you?

And then she said ""baby, can't we just go out to dinner, please?""
I says no
She says ""yes""
I says no
She says ""yes""
I says no
She says ""yes
Oh, here's your keys""

I step a little bit closer
Say okay, where ya want to go?
She says ""how about The Ivy?""
I said yeah, well I don't know

I don't feel like gettin all dressed up
And eatin' expensive food
She's says ""Olive Garden?""
I say nah, I'm not in the mood

And Burrito King would make me gassy
There's no doubt
She says ""Just forget about it""
I said no, I swear I'm gonna take you out!

Then I get an idea
I says I know what we'll do!
She says ""What?""
I say, guess?
She says ""What?""
I say we're goin' to the drive-thru!

So we head out the front door
Open the garage door
Then I open the car doors
And we get in those car doors

Put my key in the ignition
And then I turn it sideways
Then we fasten our seat belts
As we pull out the driveway

Then we drive to the drive-thru
Heading off to the drive-thru
We're approaching the drive-thru
Getting close to the drive-thru!

Almost there at the drive-thru
Now we're here at the drive thru
Here in line at the drive-thru
Did I mention the drive-thru?

Well here we are
In the drive-thru line, me and her
Cars in front of us, cars in back of us
All just waiting to order

There's some idiot in a Volvo
With his brights on behind me
I lean out the window and scream
Hey, Whatcha tryin to do, blind me?

My wife says ""maybe we should park
We could just go eat inside""
I said I'm wearin' bunny slippers
So I ain't leavin' this ride

Now a woman on a speaker box
Is sayin' ""Can I take your order, please?""
I said yes indeed, you certainly can
We'd like two hamburgers with onions and cheese

Then my wife says
""Baby, hold on, I've changed my mind!
I think I'm gonna have a chicken sandwich
Instead, this time""

I said you always get a cheeseburger!
She says ""That's not what I'm hungry for""
I put my head in my hands and screamed,
I don't know who you are anymore!

The voice on the speaker says
""I don't have all day!""
I said, then, take our order,
And we'll be on our way!

I wanna get a chicken sandwich
And I want a cheeseburger, too
She's like ""you want onions on that?""
I'm like, yeah, I already said that I do

Plus we need curly fries
And don't you dare forget it!
And two medium root beers
No, just one, we'll split it""

Then I said I'm guessin' that
You're probably not too bright
So read me back my order
Let's make sure you got it right

She says ""one, you want a chicken sandwich
Two, you want a cheeseburger
Three, curly fries, and a large root beer""
Stop, don't go no further!

I never ordered a large rootbeer
I said medium, not large!
Then she says ""we're havin' a special,
I supersized you at no charge""

""Oh"" and that's all
I could say, was ""Oh""
And she says ""now there is somethin' else
That I really think you should know

You can have unlimited refills
For just a quarter more""
I say, great, except we're in the drive thru
So what would I want that for?

Then she says ""Wait a minute
Your voice sounds so familiar hey, is this Paul?
And my wife is all like ""no, that ain't Paul,
Now tell me, who's this Paul?

She says ""Oh, he's just some guy
Who goes to school with me
I sat behind him last year
And I copied off him in Geometry

I said I know a guy named Paul
He used to be my plumber
He was prematurely bald
And he moved to Pittsburgh last summer

He also had bladder problems
And a really bad infection on his toe
And she said ""Mister, please, you can stop right there,
That's way more than I needed to know!""

And then we both were quiet
And things got real intense
Then she says ""next window please,
That'll be five dollars and eighty two cents""

So we inched ahead in line
Movin' painfully slow
I got a little bored
So I turned on the radio

Click, turned it off
Because my wife was getting a headache
So we both just sat there quietly
For her sake

Then I looked at her
And she looked back at me
And I said umm,
I think you have somethin' in your teeth

She turned away from me
And then turned back and said ""did I get it?""
I said yeah well, I mean, most of it
But hey, ya know, don't sweat it

Then she said ""how about now?""
I said yeah, almost
There's still a little bit there
But don't worry, it's probably just a piece of toast""

Now we're at the pay window
Or whatever you call it
Put my hand in my pocket
I can't believe there's no wallet!

And the lady at the window's like,
""Well, well, well, that'll be five eighty two""
I turn around to my wife, and say
How much have you got on you?

She just rolls her eyes and says
""I'll pay for this, I guess""
So she reaches into her purse
And pulls out the American Express

I hand it to the lady
And she says ""oh, dear
It's gotta be cash only
We don't take credit cards here""

I took back the card and said
Gee, really? Well that sucks
And that's when I found out
My wife was only carryin' three bucks

I said I thought you were
Going to hit the ATM today
She says ""I never got around to it
So where's your wallet anyway?

And I said never mind,
Just help me to find some change
Now the lady at the window
Is lookin' at me kinda strange

And she says ""Mister, please,
We gotta move this line along""
I said now hold your stinkin' horses lady,
We won't be long

So, we looked around inside the glove-box
And check the mat beneath my feet
I found a nickel in the ashtray
And a couple pennies and a dime in the space between he seats

Before long I had a little pile
Of coins of every sort
The lady counts it up and says
""You're still about a dollar short""

And now my woman's got this weird look
Frozen on her face
She screams, ""you know
I wasn't even really hungry in the first place""

And so I turned around
To the cashier again
I shrugged and said okay
Forget the chicken sandwich then

So I pick up my change
Pick up my receipt
And I drive to the pickup window
Man, I just can't wait to eat

And now we see this acne ridden
Kid about sixteen
Wearin' a dorky name tag that says
""Hello, my name is Eugene""

And he hands me a paper bag
I look him in the eyes
And I say to him, hey, Eugene,
Could I get some ketchup for my fries?

Well he looks at me
And I look at him
And he looks at me
And I look at him

And he looks at me
And I look at him
And he says ""I'm sorry
What did you want again?""

I say ketchup!
And he says ""oh yeah, that's right
I just spaced out there for a second
I'm really kind of burnt tonight""

And then he hands me the ketchup
And now we're finally drivin' away
And the food is drivin' me mad
With its intoxicating bouquet

I'm starvin' to death
By the time we pull up at the traffic light
I say, baby, gimme that burger,
I just gotta have a bite!

So she reaches in the bag
And pulls out the burger
And she hands me the burger
And I pick up the burger

And then I unwrap the paper
I bite into those buns
And I just can't believe it
They forgot the onions!",Trapped in the Drive-Thru,2006

A minor celebrity
And so it only makes sense
The world would be
Obsessed with every
Single thing you do

They're running 'round
With their camcorders in the night
They're lurking patiently
And hoping that they just might
See something real embarrassing
You do

The bad hair day and sweat-stained t-shirts
That's the story that
They are gonna feature
With exclusive pics
Of your flabby behind
You think you're all alone
But that's right when you'll find

A bunch of paparazzi
Popping out of nowhere
Cameras in your face
And then suddenly
You're on TMZ
You're on TMZ

Following you
When you're walking down the street
And asking stupid questions
While you're trying to eat
So you cover your face
Thinking to yourself
""Hey, isn't this creepy?""

And they're out there praying
You'll have a big meltdown
And take them on a little car chase
Through this whole town
They'll be there with you
When you're going to jail
First on the scene
For every wardrobe fail

You just picked up some transvestite
Seconds later
It's up on the website
Get a Vegas wedding
A quickie divorce
And they'll be
Sneaking in
Snapping pictures, of course

And if they ever catch you
Picking your nose
Or storming down the street
On a drunken spree
You're on TMZ

Stalking you
Just waiting by a front door
Trailing you through
Airport security
They were TMZ
They were TMZ

We caught this Oscar nominee picking up dog poop
Is that a baby bump?
I pronounce you guilty, of leaving the house while fat
Look who's drinking coffee
Everything celebrities do is fascinating

Oh, let me tell you
It's getting to the point
Where a famous person can't
Even get a D.U.I
Or go on a racist rant
Those guys are all around
So you really shouldn't dare
Go to every club in town
If you've lost your underwear

Seems that every single time
A star decides to shave their head
Or ram their car into a tree
They're on TMZ

If they catch you peeing in the bushes
Later on, that night
Well, I guarantee
You're on TMZ

Knows they're gonna be

Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda
S-O-D-A, soda

I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said ""yoda""
Y-O-D-A, Yoda

Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I left home just a week before
And I've never ever been a Jedi before
But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course
He said, ""Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force""

Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again

I picked up a box
I lifted some rocks
While I stood on my head
Well, I won't forget what Yoda said

He said, ""Luke, stay away from the darker side
And if you start to go astray, let the Force be your guide""
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

""I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed
But remember, if you kill him, then you'll be unemployed""
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-yo-yo-yo Yoda

Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess
So I'm gonna have to leave Yoda, I guess
But I know that I'll be coming back some day
I'll be playing this part 'till I'm old and grey

The long-term contract that I had to sign
Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time
