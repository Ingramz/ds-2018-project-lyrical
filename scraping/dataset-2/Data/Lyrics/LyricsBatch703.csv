Maze,"There was a man I knew
Who was smooth as smooth can be
His music his smile
And his sweet sweet melody
Do you recall that mentor
And the voice with the velvet touch
I'll never forget how he moved us all so much
Do you remember
That special one that very special one
I do remember
How much he's done
I can still here his sweet song
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
Silky silky soul singer
The man was smooth as silk

As he danced across the floor
His music that style
Made you want to see much more
And most of all was inside
Was a heart as pure as gold
I do believe that magic
Lives and never can grow old
Do you remember
That special one that very special one
I do remember
How much the man has done
I can still here his sweet song
Silky silky soul singer

After the night before
When all of the fun is over
Would you not want me no more

Oh I, I want you in the worst kind of way
I would be lying to you if I said I didn't want you to stay
I've got somebody and you've got somebody too
What would they think think about us
And what would I think about you

I know you think this is right
But what happens after tonight
Will you be there will you even care
I wannna know this right now

After the morning after, I wanna know, after the night before
What happens when all of the fun is over
Would you not want me no more no more uhh baby uhh baby

How will we know what we are doing
And what if we both should want more

I know it looks like it's real

Maze,"Can't understand
Why we treat eachother in this way
Taking up time
With the silly silly games we play
We've got our love
And no matter how it's said or done

We are one no matter what we do
We are one love will see us through
We are one and that's the way it is

Sometimes I feel
That we try and make eachother sad
The things we do
How we make eachother feel so bad
We've got so much
We could all be having so much fun

We are one from the very start
We are one deep down in your heart
We are one
And that's the way it is

Maze,"Everybody we've been put to the test
We been trying to change things rearange things
And we're still in the same old mess
We've got the power to turn things around
We can keep on waiting procrastinating
And we'll drive ourselves in the ground

We've gotta start learning how to do our thing
And give eachother some respect
Got to learn to give I'm tellin you like it is

I just want to be with you
Want to be with you
I just want to be with you

I've tried to forget you with all my might
But you really got a hold on me
I've been good I've been good to you
The way that I should be
You got me hangin' around
Waiting for your call
Talking about it doesn't do a thing at all

I want to be with you
I just want to be with you
Want to be with you
I just want to be with you

Don't want to tie you up
It wouldn't mean to much
If you don't feel the same
And I get so excited
At the mention of your name
I'm just a fool for you
And how I should take heed
I can't help myself
Your the only one I need

Maze,"Remember when you first found love how you felt so good
Kind that lasts forever more so you thought it would
Suddenly the things you see got you hurt so bad, so bad
How come the things that make us happy make us sad
Well it seems to me that

Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain

Love can be bitter, love can be sweet
Sometimes devotion and sometimes deceit
The ones that you care for give you so much pain
Oh but it's alright they're both one in the same

Listen, don't it seem we go through life going up and down
Seems the things that turn you on turn you around
Always hurting each other if it ain't one thing it's another
When the world is down on you love's somewhere around
And I want you to know that

Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain

Over and over you can be sure
There will be sorrow but you will endure (you will endure)
Where there's a flower there's the sun and the rain
Oh but it's wonderful they're both one in the same

Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain

Joy and pain are like sunshine and rain

Maze,"Lover's they sometimes get
On each others nerves
They can really really be so mean
Playing around with words
Wanna know why do we do it
Why we choose to break each others hearts
Why when it keeps us far apart

Ain't it funny the things we do
For the sake of pride
It don't matter who might get hurt
As long as your satisfied
We ought to be right to each other
Ooh you know the things I'm speakin' of
Why do we mess around with love

To many games that people play
To many games that people play
Far to many games that people play
To many games that people play

To many people they get hung up
On those he say she say games
We don't care who might get hurt
And you know that's just insane
We've got to stop look listen
At the way we treat each other so unkind
Why when it's just a waste of time

To many games that people play
To many games that people play
Far to many games that people play

The thing that makes it right

And there's know doubt in my mind
If you really want to be free
Love is the key

Love is the key that's so real
It's the kind of thing you can feel

Maze,"Yo I grew up like the regular thug I think I told you that
My only means of gettin money was to sell the crack
I shot a nigga did a bid nigga all of that
So now I kick back and get paid for raw rap
Nigga 'Pone ain't home not yet (not yet?)
Yo it don't matter 'cause we's all on the same set
Me and ??? kick it on the here and there
The really head to tough but the love is there
My pops died on July 3rd, '98
So now a nigga need mad herb
'cause my pops is here yo he loved his son
Matter of fact my pops the one that showed me a gun
And said Popi, you gotta protect ya moms
Even if that means that you gotta strap up arms
He used to make me hit the punching bag
My dad, he was a boxer god
And he really was glad yo the boxing the golden glove
He just a thug and I love him yo
So I'ma spread that love

Sometimes I want to cry and pray, sometimes
Sometimes I want Channel 8, sometimes
Sometimes I get drunk all god damn day
Sometimes I want to go back around the way
Sometimes I want to ride and smoke, sometimes
Sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

Sometimes I want to cry and pray, sometimes
Sometimes I want Channel 8, sometimes
Sometimes I get drunk all god damn day
Sometimes I want to go back around the way
Sometimes I want to ride and smoke, sometimes
Sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

I cock and pop 3 in the air for my niggas not here
Locked it wit me, your legacy live on with me continuously
Tremendously I blow weed deep in my memory
You still breathe, your face show through your seeds
And who know it that you go so quick
We all felt hopeless, through blunt smoke
My pen spittin and I show this
I swore an oath you would notice
I go to lengths with my rap strengths
When I think about my past friends K-Rock and D-zo
Primo from the same block as me since we was shorties
The pain and project glory
I get touched it all absorb me like a weed head rush
Keepin the thorough for my passed he-ro, I must
All my peoples street and physical
I still see you featured in my heart sometimes it might wrinkle
Much drinkin when I'm thinkin, its like I feel a hush over the skies
Touched by dead guys speakin

Sometimes I want to cry and pray, sometimes
Sometimes I want Channel 8, sometimes
Sometimes I get drunk all god damn day
Sometimes I want to go back around the way
Sometimes I want to ride and smoke, sometimes
Sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

Sometimes I want to cry and pray, sometimes
Sometimes I want Channel 8, sometimes
Sometimes I get drunk all god damn day
Sometimes I want to go back around the way
Sometimes I want to ride and smoke, sometimes
Sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

Yo from Biggie Smalls to Killa be too
??? and 2Pac, yo my twin and my pops
Hit-Hard Todd and Smiley, T-Bone too
And plus, my nigga Raheem, from ?
You know I poured out beer for Fernando too
And I still smoke my bogeys in the rest of the crew
Yo ain't nothin changed still play ball the same
I like to cheat a little bit just to run in my game
But y'all niggas ain't here, can't believe this shit
Thought you'd always be here, though we'd always be clique!
But y'all niggas not here no more, it ain't fair no more
Sometimes I get stressed and kick the door
But I maintain still holdin' in the pain
Why my pops had to go, why his kids the same
Mothafuckin mambo, yo I love my dad
I know he probably didn't realize what he had

Sometimes I want to cry and pray, sometimes
Sometimes I want Channel 8, sometimes
Sometimes I get drunk all god damn day
Sometimes I want to go back around the way
Sometimes I want to ride and smoke, sometimes
Sometimes I got money and I still feel broke

What the hell you niggaz just shot at? 
Yo they missed her blazed most fired pistols 
Now it's our turn to play calypsos 
Yo me and you meet me by the two 
A war goin' on that's involvin' the crews 
Bring both your arms Rel and Moose down in St. John's 
I wish my nigga was home the black Fonz 
Yo we rock charms as big as Vegas 
Different crews of different size try to player hate us 
Top of the league like Bulls and y'all cats is Lakers 
Trash since Magic left, but he was the greatest 
Aiyyo we call Shan, yo Shan peace God 
You and Maze got the info? 
Them cats that tried to shoot Moose's hitmen yo? 
A nigga named Ricky, from the Bronx, cold wop city 
Thugged out, shoot his gat mad sickly 
I laid low, called Big Pun and Fat Joe 
Them niggaz my click, we three amigos -- they said 
that they knew the cat, exactly where he live at 
And when I get there, just blaze God and don't look back 
Cause Ricky got no kids and no wifey 
So when I get there God it's like more than likely 
There's Ricky like Ricardo, plus Renaldo 
So when I get there, take the coat, plus the cargo, what? 
 
We strong-arm, blazin firearm long kong 
When the beef come niggaz storm on 

We strong-arm, blazin firearm long kong 
When the beef come niggaz storm on 

Yo like a day pass, I'm bandana'd up with a mask 
Just shot up the whole spot, crib to grass 
Pissed in his toilet, on his walls, in his halls 
Cut Ricky from his neck to his balls 
Anyone can bust a gun and stab a nigga is real 
Cause you gotta have the guts for the way that it feels 
Word got back, them niggaz said Ricky a rat 
All that, coke we took yea we cooked the crack 
The police don't really want us, they want the coke back 
It's impossible, just ask the word by the hospital 
Across from the mall right in Hoffman Park 
It's in tennis bags, guarded by a hundred Iraqs 
Yo we swerve low, beside the Jake, there go, Roberto 
The brother of Ricky, he 'posed to be wild, it's gettin deep 
How he knew where I'm at, how he knew how I eat? 
The fools pulled out, no doubt, Roberto grabbed the sick ? 
We hit the spot, then we hopped in the whips 
Now it's a chase on the highway, the L-I-E's 
Yo them fools ?, niggaz drive by me 
Iraq banner, not he, ? aqui 

We strong-arm, blazin firearm long kong 
When the beef come niggaz storm on 

Aiyyo we just crashed into the pole, now we roll 
another Dutchie, calm down and stroll 
on foot, my whole click, got control 
of the whole output, now we roll 
Yo any nigga be a man for a minute why'know 
Then he, turn around once he know you got dough 
It's like a cycle, that read psycho, man in the mirror 
like Michael, my whole click down to snipe you 
Since then, Roberto had beef, with melanin men 
Every nigga he hate, was darker than him 
Older niggaz than him, stay buggin on him 
Tellin him he weak, he ain't touch my skin 
But once again CNN prevail, tho-rough 
Cause even the G-est don't really understand Hell 
I did this, from Iraq, to livin the cell 
So y'all niggaz know, what? Meet you back in Hell what?

A lot of people look from the outside from in 
thinking that it's easy man 
You know what I'm saying not realizing we work too 
You know what I mean we working everyday hard 
Getting our hands dirty just like y'all 
But y'all think y'all better 
 
Yo yo yo yo yo yo 
I pledge allegiance to money weed jewels hoes and big guns 
While you dealing in crumbs and stacking funds 
Squeezing the ones, so jealous sons have em speaking in tongues 
Headed for these slums, screaming at the top they lungs 
Bitch made cats, find em wherever you at 
Your man in you face will stab you in the back 
Life's a bitch, so rub up and fuck it 
You live your life, you gotta love it 
Six double o, used to whip a bucket 
Left the strip cause niggaz like five seven tips 
Hood of lose lips, iced my necklace to my wrists 
long with the stones on my fists 
niggaz hating me, cause I got chips 
Left the hood rich 
Nutin but diamond dis, head from a bitch 
In the back of a thugged out whip 
Why not shit 
Devilish, your crabs ain't shit 
Mad at this, certain gentle wrist 

It's not a game nigga 
Me move in and move out 
Most niggaz try to follow the route 
But they can't see what we see 
Thugged out like wherever we be

Now that's that shit that I'm talking about and shit 
Same niggaz that you fucking wit 
Fucking wit them cats that you don't fuck wit 
Whatcha supposed to do? 
Both of them are part of the crew 
Can't choose side (true) 
I don't know, I don't like to go that road 
If that's your click, I suggest that you stay wit them yo 
While say break up to make up 
I say stick together god until y'all cake up 
Bitches meet me at the crown plaza 
On they period, it don't matter 
I'm in the head something serious 
It ain't a game god, yo it never was 
I get super high, while y'all niggaz get a buzz 
My associates that I use to sit and chill wit 
Now it's only family I like to deal wit 
That I like to build wit 
Get high, hold steal wit 
So let's do this, all my niggaz run through this 

It's not a game nigga 
Me move in and move out 
Most niggaz try to follow the route 
But they can't see what we see 
Thugged out like wherever we be 
M-A-Z-E, N.O.R.E., Musolini 

The money attitudes the cay in 
To many snakes in the way 
A getting paid playing laid-back on my days in 
I want to enter fortune but which way in 
Wit out getting lost in a storm 
My pen pages reflect Maze 
Why steps from his H on, shades beyond the grave 
Golden braids hang from my physical 
Bitched scare me 
Move mystical enchanting branson weed at me 
I'm like fan of be	 
Vanish from the scene in a blur 
But barely seen, clearly heard in my action 
And act civil, my palm sizzle from the heat in my hand 
We're in your land like a hard drizzle 
To reach my pinnacle is minimal 
Sinister style, thugged out, nigga sending you foul 

It's not a game nigga 
Me move in and move out 
Most niggaz try to follow the route 
But they can't see what we see 
Thugged out like wherever we be

Maze,"Yo yo 
I only ride for those that'll ride for me 
I only shoot for those that'll shoot for me 
I used to be in D.C. with my poetry 

Niggers said I'm on some other shit crazily 
I used to sell cracks from the front streets to back 
Then I got locked up wicked Jake popped up 
And the Jake he seen my style before 

But I'm stayin lyrical behind my door 
I'm in the yard God where niggas try to test me hard 
But my vocal's too powerful law, it's too potent 
I kick one verse, the whole cypher stood frozen 

Now them niggas want to parlay with me, general 
I'm smooth like them niggas that, don't blow trial 
I come on home to a new leaf, no beef 
Jose Luis yo I'm ill like an Indian chief 

And my dress code, ill like, indiglo 

[Chorus: x2]
Aiyyo we thugged out what, and we let y'all know 
we keep it thugged out, catch us at, every show 
Let's get the jump off jumped off, here's the bang out 
Yo at every fuckin club, yo we got octane out 

I need, nuttin but cash, I'm out in the stash 
Extra acres, Caribbean seeds with no crabs 
Fuck hunger, I'm gettin no younger, cop this half 
brick til my pocket just thick, sit back and laugh 

with the out of towners, keepin money around us 
Four pounders, flippin wiggies, to the sirens around us 
Cars and jewels, inside moves, three day cruise 
Booted from Beijing, ?brought? our ventures to ?use? 

The entrepreneur, droppin cock in your whore 
Keep pussy open like a nigga sniffin coke in the hall 
I do it all for y'all, basketball, or rims 
Fiberglass that hold guns when I play old friends 

Learn how to act around a playa who spike tracks 
Doublin the pressure if your Empire Strikes Back 
We savages.. break you up like marriages 
Stick you in public and hide the thrills in baby carriages 

[Chorus] 
 
The way I grace shit so swift, play it tenacious 
but smooth like a fugitive who move with a facelift 
I stay lit, passin Branson, finesse no less 
Reppin at random, forever at my best when I'm trancin 

niggas make me want to focus with emotion 
If you notice, the vultures I bring they sting so swift 
Your quotes is from Maze, my bang'll tip with any rapper 
these days, spittin venom when my wordplay sprays 

and claimin half this cash regardless, dome my target 
from the heart spittin my flow while slow niggas process 
Blow the spot rock aggressive, mac eleven shots in 
twenty seconds, flood money stashed kept in fed mint 

What is that monkey tail you trust with your math 
to lush your cash, rush in your path, bust you then dash 
That's why I'm never fast with the street shit 
Driftin in this deepness, with each step 

breath taken make you niggas speechless 
Distinctive, mad different's how I kick it 
Some niggas recognize I'm individualized when I spit it 

[Chorus]
 
What what what what what! 
Thugged out nigga 
Poet performin some other shit 
(I'm type priceless) 

On stage holdin my dick 
In front of all y'all bullshit ass niggas 
(We're ill niggas why'know) 
Probably jerk off or piss on the front row 

Throw that water on y'all, ya heard? (Word) 
We don't give a fuck (aight) 
We gonna keep it on some thug shit 
From now to whenever nigga 

If it's on let us know it's on 
Try to sleep they'll sucka punch you 
Fuck that",Thug Poetry,1998

Hace tiempo cuando yo te lo propuse
No estarías hoy sufriendo ni llorando
Por aquel humilde amor que yo te tuve
Caray cuando te tuve cuando te tuve
Caray cuando te tuve cuando te tuve

Pero tú me abandonaste por ser pobre
Te casaste con un viejo que es muy rico
Y llore, y llore y llore noche tras noche caray
Noche tras noche, caray noche tras noche

Ahora soy yo quien vive feliz
Forme un hogar cuando te perdí
Después, después yo te olvide y te perdone
Y no puedo hacer
Ya nada por ti, ya nada por ti, ya nada por ti

Con el tiempo a ti también te abandonaron
Y ahora vives infeliz y desgraciada
Muy sola y muy triste te dejaron
Y sin dinero, sin él, sin mí, sin nada caray
Sin, sin dinero caray, sin mí, sin nada
Sin, sin dinero caray, sin mí, sin nada

Todo por casarte con un rico
Hoy sabes que el dinero no es la vida
Ni la felicidad quedo muy tarde caray
Lo has comprendido caray, lo has comprendido

Ahora soy yo quien vive feliz
Forme un hogar cuando te perdí
Después, después yo te olvide y te perdone
Y no puedo hacer
Ya nada por ti, ya nada por ti, ya nada por ti

Quiero ser el amigo
Que recorre tu camino
Que le importa la sorpresa

Y de noche siempre estaré
Junto a ti

Mazz,"Gabino barrera no entendía razones 
Andando en la borrachera 
Cargaba pistola con seis cargadores 
Le daba gusto a cualquiera
Usaba el bigote en cuadro abultado 
Su paño al cuello enredado 
Calzones de mata, chamarra de cuero 
Traía colteado el sombrero

Sus pies campesinos usaban huaraches 
Y a veces a raiz andaba 
Pero le gustaba pagar los mariachis 
La plata no le importaba
Con una botella de caña en la mano 
Gritaba ¡viva zapata! 
Porque era ranchero el indio suriano 
Era hijo de buena mata

Era alto, bien dado, muy ancho de espadas 
Su rostro mal encachado 
Su negra mirada un aire le daba 
Al buitre de la montañas
Gabino barrera dejaba mujeres 
Con hijos por donde quiera 
Por eso en los pueblos donde se paseaba 
Se la tenían sentenciada
Recuero la noche que lo asesinaron 
Venía de ver a su amada 
Dieciocho descargas de máuser sonaron 
Sin darle tiempo de nada

Por una morena perdió como pierden

Que de una cesta he recogido

Tal vez partiste 
De éste mundo traicionero
O algo muy grave

Solo una cosa 
Dá valor a mi existencia

Que aunque pobre es respetada
Otros tan ricos que pueden comprar los mares
Más son mendigos si les falta en éste mundo

Y aunque no quieras este amor que yo te ofrezco
Y aunque no quieras pronunciar mi humilde nombre
De cualquier modo yo te seguiré queriendo

Yo se que nunca tu podrás jamás amarme
Que a tu cariño llegué demasiado tarde
No me desprecies, no es mi culpa, no seas mala
Porque tú eres de quien quiero enamorarme

Que daño puedo hacerte con quererte
Si no me quieres tú yo te comprendo
Perfectamente sé que no nací yo para ti
Pero que puedo hacer si ya te quiero

Déjame vivir de esta manera
Yo te quiero tal cual y sin condiciones
Sin esperar que un día tu me quieras como yo
Consciente estoy mi amor que nunca me querrás

Tal vez mañana yo despierte solo
Pero por el momento quiero estar soñando
No me despiertes tu no vez que así yo soy feliz
Consciente estoy mi amor que no eres para mi
No hay necesidad que me desprecies
Tú ponte en mi lugar a ver qué harías

La diferencia entre tú y yo
Tal vez sería corazón
Que yo en tu lugar si te amaría

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away

His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Real like the flesh that covers the grave

Wait for the storm that comes to me

That David played, and it pleased the Lord

The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Baby I have been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in with you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there’s a God above
But all I’ve ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It’s not a cry you can hear at night
It’s not somebody who has seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I don't even know the name

I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch

We'll never part (through) sickness and health 

You are my heart 

I love you more than I love myself 

But in the middle of the night 

I heard you cryin' in your sleep 

It'll be all right  I'll be there for you 

If you tell me all your secrets

Verse 1: Canibus 

Aye Yo! 

Boy meets girl, boy really likes her 

Boy loses contact with girl but he finds her 

Girl has no clue that boy is a liar, and he has no honor. 

So she dates him regardless, 'cause she thought he was harmless 

And he had her believing' he was the man she wanted. 

To spend the rest of her life with. The words ""I love you"" are 

Priceless, unpredictable like rollin' dices. 

Nonetheless in spite of the fright 

And repercussions you might get people still risk they necks. 

Of course it's nice the feelin' of courtship 

Roses and stuff, women never get it often enough. 

And the reason people love they mother so much 

Besides the fact she carried you for nine months, is trust. 

It's a five letter word, that should only occur between him and her 

Before the bees and the birds...word! 

Chorus 1x 

Verse 2: Canibus 

Aye Yo! 

I heard a soft moan in the middle of March, 

Then I felt a powerful force push me forward like a dart. 

On your mark, get set, GO! 

I was off, flagella was my propellor wiggling back and forth. 

Then I set across for the border, Mother Nature's ?comma? 

Calling me to the rock of Gibraltar. 

The compitition tried to be smart but I was smarter. 

My competitors was swimmin' fast so I swam harder. 

Submerged in water, prayin' to my heavenly father 

If I don't make it through I'm a ""goner."" 

Screaming out death before this honor, because I'm awesomely 

Stronger, my stamina last longer. I was destined to be a son 

Instead of a daughter, XY is the male chromosomal order. 

One'll stay alive, and survive, the rest'll be dead 

'cause I'm a be the one to fertilize that egg (echoes out) 

Chorus: (Sung by a woman) 

In the middle of the night 

I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight 

I'll be there for you.... 

If you tell me all your secrets. 

Verse 3: Canibus 

Aye Yo! 

Mommy I'm up in your stomach, buggin'. Whenever you 

Rub it, I love it like a comforters covers you warm as a oven. 

Your husband...stubborn, how can you love him. 

Smokin' cigarettes by the dozen when he knows that I'm comin'. 

Bad move, you hopin' that daddy improves. 

Knowin' in your heart that's bull, because he's too cruel. 

You've been abused, used, you got wounds and scars. 

Stick with your mind not with your heart, let's go to grandma's. 

Terminate the lease call the landlord. Give your job two weeks notice 

Pack up the car, and go to New York. What part. 

They got a little borough called The Bronx, Mom.. 

And I heard that's where hip-hop is gonna start. 

Yeah, I think we need to be right there. Four months 

In your stomach and I already chose a career. When you cry 

I hear, and I wish I could dry your tears, but I can't 'cause I'm stuck 

in here. 

Five months from being able to lay against your chest 

I can't even hold you in my arms, 'cause they ain't developed yet. 

But I swear to you, as the God Almighty Truth 

I'm a be there for you 

I'm a be there for you.

a grinning empty eyesocket moon hoists itself up into the pale evening sky 
and hangs there like a day old suicide

a stickey shower of radioactive moonbeams 
cascades from the tops of nearby urban structures
causing indescriminate loss of limb to several innocent passers by
as well as general madness all around
 
sample: ""hey"" 
I survey the damage from a blind alley doorway
to which i have been glued for most of the day
having been inadvertantly papered over by a bleary eyed bill poster
sometime before dawn

eventually i muster the energy to extricate myself from my predicament 
as it is time for me to make my apoiinted rounds 
of all the nearby potential sources of aluminum cans
it is my sworn duty to collect all the cans in the area
and convert them into us currency at a secret government installation
whose location is known only to me

later, having acquired enough money to keep myself in the lifestyle to which i am accustomed
i find myself back on the street 
i scan the crowds until i see someone who is obviously insane
and then i follow that person until they go into a building or get into a car
in order to make sure that they don't do anything crazy

while i am engaged in this pursuit 
a nonstop stream of firetrucks and police cars
race up and down the boulevard 
sirens blaring looking for
invisible emergencies no one seems to notice

after a while i move on to the rest of my agenda for the evening
scheduled activities inlcude a short but passionate affair with
a curvaceous bottle of my favorite alcoholic beverage

presently i find myself holding court from a bus stop on 
the corner of Commerce and Pearl
from whence i regale the passing crowds 
with my perceptive insights into the nature of reality 
an appreciative throng hangs on my every word

it begins to rain
but everyone is concentrating so intently on me 
that they are oblivious to the downpour

the water makes me light
i begin to levitate
i float up off the sidewalk and past the top of the telephone pole
a thousand eyes follow me upward
a big black cloud opens up 
and i zip through it at full tilt 
going faster all the time

look at me 
I'm above the clouds
the moon is laughing at me
look at me
the earth is getting smaller
look at me

you're a perverted evil menace to society
that's why the world is so lucky to have people like me

i'll be tiptoeing right along about three steps behind

where it gently careeses the tender skin

it ain't like your stupid car because it don't come from korea
i won't charge you for this tip but you can take it to the bank
and when your whole life starts to turn around, you'll know who to thank

thank god for mc nine oh oh, will be the first thing you say
when you are jumping out of bed, at the start of every day
dropping on your knees while you are calling out my name 
saying thank you thank you thank you 
and you'll bless the day i came into your life

from this dream you've been having and confront reality 
so shut your mouth for one minute and play attention to me

did you come to the conclusion that truth is out of style?

well i was on my way to work one day when i spied a rocket ship
some aliens abducted me and took me on a trip
to a previous existence on another astral plane
i met a real nice lady there name shirley maclaine

the truth is not an obstacle for someone such as me, she said
because you see we all create our own reality
and if a problem should arise
the best thing you can say is
don't worry, be happy, and have a nice day

well i thanked her very kindly for the excellent advice
she said she'd bill me later at a reasonable price
then the aliens brought me back and beamed me down into this bar
but i could not go to work because bigfoot stole my car

MC Alastair,"Ooh, oh yeah, listen 

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
I got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm alone now 
Pretty faces from the covers of a magazine
From their covers to my covers want to lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find, 
Just a grown man running out of time

[Chorus]
And even though it seems I have everything 
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women
All the expensive cars 
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything 
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Listen
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie 
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year-winter, summer, spring and fall 
But being without you
Just ain't livin' nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

[Chorus]

I just can't help loving you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything 
To hear you say that you'll stay.

Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run

But now I truly realize
Some people don't want to compromise
Well I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies, yeah

Well I don't want to live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away
From the troubles in my life
I'm walking away
Oh, to find a better day

Well I'm so tired baby
Of things you say
You're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room baby

Don't listen to the games they play

I'm not like them other guys

Si un jour je tombe de haut et que j'me retrouve sans rien
Si un jour je tombe et que je me retrouve sans rien
Qui sera là pour apaiser toutes mes peurs de demain?
Pour éteindre la haine qui brûle au profond de moi
Qui me rassure quand je crains que j'n'y arriverai pas?

Que la plupart de leurs promesses en fait ne sont que des mots

Du bist ein ehrlicher, herzlicher und charakterstarker Mensch 
Geh deinen Weg weiter wie bisher
Mit Herzblut
Denn deine Reise hat gerade erst begonnen

Nur der einzig Wahre weiß wohin die Reise mich bringt
Wer meine Platte kritisiert, beleidigt mein Kind
Denn dieses Album ist für mich so wie ein eigenes Kind
Wenn das Kind spricht, dann hörst du Reime mit Sinn
Manchmal weint es, die Hatershow, wie neidisch sie sind
Kriegen einen Höhenflug obwohl das Schiff eigentlich sinkt
Jede Wahrheit auf's Papier, schreibe ich hin
Auch wenn du den' die Augen öffnest bleiben sie blind

Seit mein Schwager verstarb hab ich das Lachen verlernt
Es fühlt sich an als stach das Schicksal 'ne Axt in mein Herz
Lieber Gott ich hab' aus falschen Sachen gelernt
Heute weiß ich falsche Schlangen sind mein lachen nicht wert
Ich danke euch für den Erfolg und den Kühlschrank der voll ist
Glaub daran, wenn Gott dir 'ne Chance gibt
Auch wenn der Porsche jetzt aus Chrom ist
Sag was bringt dir das Ganze wenn du dafür deinen Stolz brichst?
Und wäre ich heute so wie sie oder wie er
Dann wäre ich sicher Millionär
Ich war gerade zu meinen Mitmenschen und immer fair
Denn ich glaube an Karma und weiß das alles wiederkehrt
Man hat versucht mich indirekt in eine Ecke zu drängen
Deswegen lasse ich von euren Rappern die Texte verbrennen
Anscheinend sind eure herabwertende Sätze im Trend
Jeder redet über Drogen, über Knäste und Gangs
Sie verleugnen die Erziehung ihrer Eltern
Und prahlen damit rum das sie mehr als alle Geld haben
Mehr Geld als sie oder er, mehr als der
Der für wenig Geld trotz harter Arbeit sein Kind ernährt
Mehr als der, der vierzig Stunden ackern geht
Nur damit am Ende des Tages auf dem Tisch etwas warmes steht
Nur damit die Kinder was zu essen kriegen, rest in piece
Ihr drecks MC's habt für mich nicht ein Cent verdient

Die krassesten Gangster in der Szene mit dem krassesten Hype
Wir haben alle schon verstanden das ihr die krassesten seid
Wir haben alle schon verstanden ihr habt Waffen dabei
Ich raffe es nicht, nein, wann kriegen das die Affen gepeilt
Und mit der Zeit bete ich das eure Patte nicht reicht
Ich bete das ihr alle fällt damit der Hass euch befreit
Damit ihr endlich wach werdet und danach begreift
Das ihr ohne Parra nichts seid, ihr arroganten
Hab mich in Interviews für deutschen Rap gerade gemacht
Nur damit keiner meiner Fans eure Namen nur hasst
Doch anscheinend hat euch nicht meine Visage gepasst
Obwohl ihr älter seid, sag was 'ne Blamage ist das?
Selbst ein Hund der für Schutz bezahlt fängt an zu bellen
Doch nur ein Streichholz könnte ganze Wälder verbennen
Selbst ein Hund der für Schutz bezahlt fängt an zu bellen
Doch nur ein Streichholz könnte ganze Wälder verbennen
Sie beschimpfen Frauen Tag und Nacht
Doch vergessen wer sie ganze neun Monate im Bauch getragen hat
Wer hat euch gefüttert, als ihr kleine Kinder wart?
War es keine Frau oder warum so behindert, huh?
Alle Frauen sind angeblich richtig schlimm
Doch was kann 'ne Frau dafür wenn du dich wie 'ne Bitch benimmst
Was kann 'ne Frau dafür, bitte sag's mir
Ich schäme mich dafür was ist mit deutschen Rap nur passiert?

Sie beleidigen Frauen in ihren Gangster Parts
Doch willst du das man so was über deine Schwester sagt?
Willst du das deine Schwester solche Texte hört
Wenn du keine Antwort hast dann bin ich echt empört
Dann kommen Leute so wie du und sagen
Bilal, das ist doch kein Rap, ich meine so ein Text
Der wiegt doch viel zu nett, rap doch über Koks
Was ist mit dir los? Wo sind all die Hoe's in deinen Videos?
Werd' doch endlich böse damit alle sich fürchten
Ich schwöre ich gehöre lyrisch zu den größten
Und würde meine Würde niemals verkaufen nur damit Typen
Die Tüten verticken mich mögen
Ich lüge nicht wenn ich sage mich macht es müde
Und psychisch geht es mir besser denn je
Ich muss kotzen wenn ich all diese Rapper hier seh
Ihr habt mehr Geld als alle, wir haben's alle kapiert
Ihr habt die aller größten Eier, wir haben's alle kapiert
Ihr habt den aller größten Rücken, wir haben's alle kapiert
Was ist passiert ihr verbiegt euch wegen bisschen Papier
Und dann macht ihr mir auf mächtig, glaube mir Karma
Und merkt euch eine Sache Akhi, Yawmul Qiyama
Ihr holt draußen Araber für einen Insta post
Heutzutage wird man groß wenn man Kindern droht
Was ist los kleine Free Fighter
Doch Freunde die dein Geld verlangen sind keine Freunde sondern aller höchstens Dienstleister
Jeden Tag gibt's Beef aber nix passiert
Araber Clan Bruder aber wallah nix passiert
Böse Blicke in den Videos aber nix passiert
Harte Ansagen aus den Studios aber nix passiert
Immer wieder das gleiche von Poponasen in Promophasen
Denn sie reden von Villen obwohl sie nicht mal ne Wohnung haben
Dann zeigen sie das sie Kohle tragen sozusagen
Sind sie 'ne Hohle die ohne Drogen nix zu holen haben
Ohne Gnade ich verschone gerade Idioten die sagen
Dass sie Oberstars sind obwohl die so locker Arme vor der [?] schlafen
Und ich habe meinen Eltern eines versprochen
Bevor ich mich verbiege, wird mein Schweigen gebrochen
Ich schreibe seit ein parr Wochen dieses Meisterwerk, ah
Auf dieser Platte hörst du gleich mein Herz, ah
Auf dieser Platte hörst du gleich mein Herz
Deswegen bin ich von der Top Five nicht weit entfernt
Ich danke meinen Fans die mich supporten und das Album kaufen
An meine Fans die seit Tag Eins an mich glauben
Wissen das ich nix halt' von Gewalt oder Angst
Doch wenn's drauf ankommt, Bruder ja, dann steh' ich mein' Mann
Ich steh' ich mein' Mann, die Lügner greifen gegen mich an
Doch ich steh für die Wahrheit deutsch Rap ist elendig krank
Steh' für die Wahrheit so wie Tupac Amaru Shakur
Und für die Zeit mit Mama brauch' ich keine goldene Uhr

Ich trag' keine Rolex, nein ich bin nicht dafür geboren
Dafür hab' ich Zeit für meinen Neffen der sein Vater verlor
Denn mein Schwager meinte Bilal du schwimmst gegen den Strom
Kurze Zeit später hat der Engel ihm die Seele genommen
Seit dem du weg bist hat man mir was von mei'm Leben genommen
Ich schließ die Augen, denk an dich und sehe dich schon
Und vielleicht gehe ich mit meinen Alben kein mal Gold
Doch jede Platte die ich verkaufe ist auch dein Erfolg
Die letzten Zeilen meines Intros widme ich nur dir Naser
Du bist zwar tot, doch lebst noch in mir Naser
Ich weine gerade, doch lebst noch in mir Naser
Wir sehen uns irgendwann mal wenn ich stirb Naser
Dein Sohn ist wie mein eigenes Kind
Ich versprech dir das ich mit ihm schöne Zeiten verbring
Dem Kleinen geht es sehr gut
Dein Sohn, meine Schwester und du seid mein Herzblut",Herzblut,2018

Es war nicht immer leicht, es war nicht immer schön
Mir wurde nix geschenkt und ich wurde nie verwöhnt
Erfolg bedeutet Arbeit, den Glauben nie verlieren

Ja, viele mieten sich Autos
Doch müssen danach mit Bus oder U-Bahn fahren
Ich komme im Polo
Verbreite die Aura, das eines Superstars
Du fährst einen Ferrari und denkst
Dass du was damit draußen bewegst
Mein Polo ist süß, sieht unschuldig aus
Mit anderen Worten ein Frauenmagnet
Baby, ich fahr' einen Polo, Polo, Polo
Ich hab's geschafft mit mei'm ganz kleinen Polo, Polo
Ich weiß, ihr hättet auch gern einen Polo, Polo
Aber träumt mal weiter von einem Polo, Polo
Irgendwann ist meine Uhr echt
Und dann hol' ich mir einen Touareg
Aber bis dahin fahr' ich den Polo, Polo, Polo, Polo
Irgendwann mach' ich nur Cash
Und dann fahr' ich bis Budapest
Und tanke ihn voll
Ich meine meinen Polo, Polo, Polo
Fünfundsiebzig PS, der Verbrauch ist gering
Und die Lenkung so king
Nach 'ner längeren Fahrt
Ist sogar noch eine Shisha mit drin
Und 'ne Cola kann ich nicht garantiereen

Auch ohne den Hype, sie wollen meinen Style
Doch ich lass' euch nicht mal
In mein' Kofferraum rein
Eine Million für die Werbung
Dafür bring' ich circa neun Millionen rein
Sag, welcher der Rapper, die heute Geschäfte eröffnen
Möchten meine Vision teilen
Der Wagen ist süß wie die eine vom „Señorita“-Video
Schöne Grüße an meinen Bruder Pietro
Mann, ich fahre einen VW
Und wollte noch eins sagen
Dieser Polo wird bald mein Hochzeitswagen
Aka Frank Sinatra
An die meisten Benzer-Fahrer
Euer Kühlschrank ist leer, ich komme im Polo
Ihr fängt an zu stauen, als wär' der Fahrer ein Indiana
Ich bin der Hammer und spar' viel Para
Aber mach ruhig Welle, du Armer

Mehr Fame als die NASA

MC Bilal,"Ich hab' immer versucht, ein guter Mensch zu sein
Niemandem Unrecht anzutun

Mama sagte mir, „Nicht ist für immer da“
Deswegen sage ich vor jeder Show bismillah
Hamdulillah für alles, was ich habe
Denn ein Teil meiner Gage geht immer an die Armen
Ich danke Gott für das schönste Leben, was ich führe
Mein großer Bruder öffnete mir all die Türen
Es war nicht immer leicht, oft waren wir ohne Knete
Doch diese Visionäre werden bald Millionäre
Wurden ausgelacht von unserm Fleisch und Blut
Denn fast jeder meiner Family ist ein Hasud
Meine Onkels würden lachen, wenn ich heute sterbe
Doch das ist Gottes und nicht eure Erde
Ihr gönnt uns keinen Erfolg, keinen Porsche und Hummer
Ihr wollt sehen, wie wir vor euch dursten und hungern
Ab zur Seite, in Zukunft sollt ihr euch verzieh'n
Außer diese Sätze habt ihr auf dieser Platte nicht verdient
Ich gab euch den Respekt, denn anders kann ich's nicht
Doch anscheinend habt ihr's falsch in euren Hals gekriegt
Warum werden gute Menschen immer schlecht behandelt?
Und warum werden immer schlechte Menschen gut behandelt?
Warum diese Ungerechtigkeit auf dieser Welt?
Warum misst man die Erfolge heutzutage nur mit Geld?
Sag mir, lieber Gott, warum sind die Menschen so?
Kaum haben sie Erfolg, fliegen sie unendlich hoch
Vergessen ihre Wurzeln und die Religion
Verkaufen ihren Arsch für das Telvision
Tauschen Freunde für Bräute
Und den Wagen, den sie fahren, finanziert ihnen der Teufel
Alles, was sie essen, ist der Schweiß von den andern
Ihr seid allerhöchstens heiß im Jahanam
Und was sie an haben, ist die Kleidung von Iblis
Dafür schicken sie die Frauen auf den Strich
Für Gucci und Versace vergessen sie den Tod
Für irgendwelche Bitches vergessen sie die Bros
Das ist unsre Welt, ich hab's mir nicht ausgedacht
Weil heutzutage fast jede Ratte Auge macht
Ich bin aufgewacht und hab' eins gelernt
Wenn du korrekt bist, brechen sie dir gleich dein Herz
Deswegen achte auf dein'n Kreis und halt ihn klein
Lasse keinen rein, Bruder, sie verbreiten Neid
Ich schreibe meine Zeil'n, erkenne meinen Feind
Lasse meine Seele sprechen und fühl' mich gleich befreit
Wenn ich rappe, rapp' ich nicht über 'ne Kleinigkeit
Ich rappe übers Leben, rappe über Neid und Leid
Ich habe Rap im Blut, ich hoff', du weißt Bescheid
Habibi, was uns unterscheidet, ist ein Meilenstein
Denn keiner teilt den Leid, wenn einer weint
Ich habe nichts zu tun mit euch, weil ihr Neider seid
Dieser Text ist mehr als nur 'ne Schreibarbeit
Was bringt dir Straße, wenn vor dem Richter keiner schweigt?
Ich sage meine Meinung, auch wenn sie keiner teilt
Alles selfmade, ich erschuf meinen Hype
Was denkt ihr, wer ihr seid? Choya, jetzt ist meine Zeit
Keiner weiß, ich könnte weiter rhyme, aber leider reicht
Der Beat nicht, bevor ich werde so wie ihr würd' ich lieber sterben
Oder einsam sein

Das ist das Härteste, was ich jemals schreiben werde
Ich hoffe, ihr vergebt mir, wenn ich eines Tages sterbe
Schwester, ich hoff', dass du grade nicht weinst
Denn wahrscheinlich bist du grade allein
Mit deinem Sohn und schaust die Bilder von dei'm Mann
Das erste Mal vor acht Jahren
Kam er zu uns und hielt um deine Hand
Ich war erst vierzehn, er kam rein und hat mich richtig gedrückt
Der beste Schwager, ein gutes Herz und bisschen verrückt
Ich weiß noch, wie er zu mir sagte, „Du wirst ein großer Star!“
Ich sagte, „Iben 3ami, glaub mir, doch das weiß nur Allah!“
Er hat dich so geliebt, Schwester, und es tut mir leid
Denn in seiner schwersten Zeit stand er leider oft allein
Doch alles steht geschrieben, ja, es wollt' Allah so
Guck, euer Sohn wird ohne Vater groß
Doch ich bin für euch da und bete an sein Grab

Weine so wie ein Kind
Gucke dein Foto an und rede mit mir selbst
Gott nahm dich von mir weg und gab mir dafür Geld
Doch kein Papier der Welt kann meinen Schwager ersetzen
Ich bin nächtelang wach, ich hab' schlaflose Nächte
Letztens sah ich deinen Sohn an dei'm Grab, ya haram
Er ist erst acht, mein Neffe, und begreift nix, verdammt
Es tut mir leid, habibi, doch es regelt sich kaum
Ich höre, wie er leise sagte, „Baba, steh bitte auf!“
Doch Baba steht nicht mehr auf
Eines Tages wirst du älter und dann verstehst du mich auch, Zidan

Seit mein Schwager verstarb, spüre ich Schwesters Schmerz
Und kein Geld der Welt ist die Tränen meiner Schwester wert
Ich hab' zu Gott gebetet, gib mir den größten Ruhm
Er gab mir alles, doch nahm mir alles mit Schwagers Tod
Ich geb' zu, ich war nicht immer so reif
Ich war wie die meisten geblendet von diesem Scheiß
Die Zeit hab' ich verschwendet, ich weiß es
Was bringt das Geld, wenn dein Cousin
Seit der Geburt an einer unheilbaren Krankheit leidet?
Und sein Vater ihn ins Kindergarten schiebt
Mit 'nem Rollstuhl? Sag, was bringt das Geld, wenn du sowas siehst?
Mein Neffe ist mein größter Reichtum
Unbezahlbar, weil ich seinen Vater in ihm seh', wenn seine Augen leuchten
Und seine Augen leuchten immer, wenn ich ihn umarme
Solche Momente mit Geld kann man nicht bezahlen
Lieber Gott, nimm mir mein ganzes Geld jetzt für immer
Doch schenk mir nur eine gute Frau und zwei gesunde Kinder

Und wegen Geld verkaufen Menschen ihre Seele
Wegen Geld verlieren Menschen ihre Ehre
Wegen Geld hab' ich vieles schon gesehen
Wegen Geld fließen grade meine Tränen
Wegen Geld verkaufen Menschen ihre Seele
Wegen Geld verlieren Menschen ihre Ehre
Wegen Geld hab' ich vieles schon gesehen
Wegen Geld fließen grade meine Tränen",Wegen Geld [Instrumental] [Instrumental],2018

That love is for the givin??
So let me love you girl, yay!

Meine Heimat ist Berlin, eine Welt für sich
Denn sie blendet jede andre Stadt in grelles Licht
Die Straße scheint, wir tragen Königsketten
Wenn wir sie löhnen wenn wir betteln, weil wir böse rappen
Wir treiben uns rum, haben die Schule geschwänzt
Rum gestresst, denn jeder war im Jugendarrest
Hat einen Gerichtstermin
Das hier ist Berlin
Deutsche wollen in diese Stadt, doch haben's nicht verdient

Waren nur ein zwei Stunden in dein kleines Kaff
Doch wir nehmen euch die Schmach wie ein eigenes Land
Es ist unglaublich, man sieht Blaulicht überall
Hier ist Silvester schon am ersten Mai
Und fast jeder hat bewirkt was mit großen Tabu
Mit deinen Fehlern am Block von den Bullen im Zug
Die Lichter brennen wenn das Nachtleben losbricht lichterloh
Groupies werden hier bedroht
Ich wünsch' mir die Mauer zurück
Wenn du nicht raust kommst, wir laufen ein Stück
Jeden Tag gibt es neue Probleme (Doch keine Lösung)
Willkommen in meiner Gegend

Willkommen in Berlin, in der Stadt der Probleme
Das hier ist Berlin, diese Stadt in der ich lebe
Man steht in Berlin, Sport man die Macht der Straße
Es gibt keine Konkurrenz, wir sind einzigartig

Willkommen in Berlin, wir haben die größte Schnauze
Das hier ist Berlin, das hier ist mein Zuhause
Weil ich lieb Berlin und hasse dein beschissenes Kaff
Aus der Gosse in die Charts wir sind die Kinder der Nacht

Willkommen in meiner Stadt wo die Nacht zum Tag wird
Wo die Spack die grad' turnt nachts im Park stirbt
Es ist nichts wie es aussieht mach dich rar, Knirps
Blas' die Bars mit einer dieser Hits, die im Lauf liegt
Spits bis sie auffliegt, spit bis mein Licht in den Rauch zieht
Spit ich vernichte dich auch, Freak!
Du bist es nicht gewohnt, hockst den ganzen Tag im Dorf rum
Wo wir herkommen ist Hass oft an der Tagesordnung
Pack' die Rapsticks um ich mach Business
Hinter verschlossenen Türen wie Kabinettssitzung
Wie die Mücken auf der Bank in Bronx
Oder bar auf die Hand, oder ganz in Fonds.
Für den Rolls Royce und das Stückchen Land in France
Deine starken Strahlen strahlen wie Lampions
Und du boxt dich von unten durch
Auch wenn der Shit den du bringst nicht stimmt bist du unten durch

My mind is my thought, my thoughts is my mind
Let's see if we can get it all together

Ah!
Ich hat 'ne kurze Denkerpause, alles wurde keimig
MC B is back am Mikro und das Feld wird jetzt gereinigt
Auf irgendwelchen Covern sieht man hässliche Geschöpfe
Dicka ich bin ein Berliner Rapper tragen keine Zöpfe

Mein Vater war ein weiser Mann, ein weiser bin auch ich
Du bist ein Stricher, deine Ma' geht auf'n Strich
Sobald ich mein Dick mit Schmackes in die durchgenudelte Mumu steck
Heult sie rum als hät' sie mit 'nem schwarzen Magier Voodo-Sex

Schwule-Schlampen-Jungs talken über Business
Glaub mal nicht, dass du jetzt Nacken hast nur weil du bei McFit bist
Ihr seid dick am Schwindeln, wenn ihr über eure Autos sprecht
Der Unterschied zwischen uns, ich habe nur mit Frauen Sex

Du Pisser kriegst eine getokat wenn ich mit der Entourage auf Bühne komme
Mit TBR plus TCK, gewaltbereite Spaßkolonne
Mir ist egal, dass ich für deutschen Rap zu eklig bin
Wir kacken auf die Triple-Rhymes und zeigen uns're Penisse

Tiger was los, bist du bereit für dicken Actionrap
Auf jeden Fall, und danach wird einer weggesteckt
Ausgezeichnet, vorher noch vier Pils für den Geschmack
Das ist der ganze normale Modus, an dem weißt du was du hast

Oh!
Oh!

Looser wollen mich fronten doch chillen täglich in der Smoke-Box
Ich krieg 'n erigiertes Glied, wenn ich euch Opfer tod box'
Normal gebildete Menschen fehlt in Deutschland Entertainment
Zum Glück gibt es ja mich verkackter Spießer der sich ekelt

Die ZDF-Tanten fragen, was ich gegen Frauen hab'
Im Endeffekt sind sie der Grund, dass ich täglich Frauen schlag
Das Land wird kontrolliert von Mittelmäßigkeit und Dorfgörn
Die statt P-Berg Battletapes, lieber wieder Torch hören

Eure hohle Meinung intressiert mich nicht die Bohne
Denn Proletik ist das Label mit der ausgefüllten Krone
Os machen Stimmung gegen uns in diesen Tagen
Doch weil die meisten es verstanden haben, steigen unsre Gagen

Von Hamburg bis nach München machen Männer ein auf Elfen-Look
Geistige Umnachtung, sag Bescheid wenn ich dir helfen muss
Von da wo ihr jetzt steht, sind's noch sehr viel Meilen weit
Bis ihr nicht mehr schimmelt in der Zone der Peinlichkeit

Tiger was los, bist du bereit für dicken Actionrap
Auf jeden Fall, und danach wird einer weggesteckt
Ausgezeichnet, vorher noch vier Pils für den Geschmack

MC Bomber,"Aus meinem Pieper läuft die rote Grütze
Ich bin wieder ohne Stütze
Labelvorschuss aufgebraucht, wir cyphern in 'ner Drogenküche
Tanz den Boogie am Abgrund mit schwuler Grinsebacke
Weil ich weiß, dass ich zumindest eine gute Kindheit hatte
Keta in die Nase zuppeln, das waren noch die Jugendzeiten
Nur durch meine Arme pumpen, kann der Stoff die Glut entfalten
Nadel aufgesetzt, durchgeatmet, wieder frei
Ich seh das Licht am Ende des Tunnels wie nach 'ner Schießerei
Starke T's vom Garten Eden, jeder fühlt sich wohl
Doch mit Keta über'm Bus ist mir die Metaphysik wurst
Grade weiß ich zwar nicht wie ich heiß, doch was das Sein bedeutet
Nur, dass mir die Sprache fehlt, ums später zu beschreiben
Mittlerweile lieg ich wie ein Spasst verdreht in meinem Pennerhäuschen
Nach 'ner halben Stunde Rausch vergeht das kleine Denkerpäuschen
Die halbe Stunde kam mir vor wie eine Ewigkeit
Nach dem geilen Trip sollt ich mich schämen für meine Ekligkeit?

Ich nehme Drogen, weil ich sie so gut vertrage
Und du Engel willst mich warnen, bitte schmier's dir in die Haare
Mach auf weise, komm und misch dich in mein Leben ein
Ich kann dir grad jedoch nicht folgen, denn ich hack mein Keta klein

Ich nehme Drogen, weil ich sie so gut vertrage
Und du Engel willst mich warnen, bitte schmier's dir in die Haare
Mach auf weise, komm und misch dich in mein Leben ein
Ich kann dir grad jedoch nicht folgen, denn ich hack mein Keta klein

Ethanol wirkt Wunder, endlich bin ich wieder munter
Am Wochenende machen Spätis mit mir miesen Umsatz
Denn ich muss mit meiner Gang das Leben am Freitag genießen
In der Sonne sitzen, Scheiße labern, Weinbrand genießen
Es geht nicht anders, ich seh in Alkohol nur Vorteile
Auch, wenn Mama manchmal weint, wenn ich unter'm Tresen penn'
Mit Mädels penn' ist auch nur möglich ab 2 Promille
Nach dem dritten Wodka herrscht in meinem Kopf die große Stille
Vollgekotzt in irgendeiner Weddinger Kaschemme
Liegt der Onkel, schnarcht brumm, ohne Empfang auf der Antenne
Die Barfrau weckt mich, es ist 24 Stunden Service
Ich brüll wie ein Elch, 24 Kunden hören es
Ab nach Hause, duschen, doch der Spaß ist nicht vorbei
Nach 'ner halben Stunde Mittagsschlaf beginnt die Runde 2
Alkohol soll dumm machen und auch gleichgültig
Versteh ick nich', intressiert mich nich'

Ich saufe Schnaps, weil ich ihn so gut vertrage
Und du Engel willst mich warnen, bitte schmier's dir in die Haare
Mach auf Weise, komm und misch dich in mein Leben ein
Ich kann dir grad jedoch nicht folgen, besser schenk mir Hefe ein

MC Bomber,"Das Gebüsch ist ein anarchischer Ort
Und mit vielen meiner Freunde war ich schon dort
Frag nicht so forsch: „Wo ist 'n Gebüsch?“
Als wenn es nur irgend 'n Floristen betrifft (Falsch!)
Nennt es ein Gefühl, ein Zustand
Den ich erreichte, als ich endlich den Mut fand
Den Pint in die Mumu deiner Mama zu stecken
Und nur noch LSD statt Pappe zu fressen
Ein böser Dämon wohnt im Innern
Doch im Gebüsch verstummte die Stimme
Bomber war geboren mit dem Ernst eines Kindes
Lernt ich wieder spielen, Digga das ist der King-Shit
Obstbäume und hölzerne Ratten
Muss ich auf dem Schutt meiner Alten einpflanzen
Glaubst du an Bomber? Pilger deine Waldfahrt
Führt's ins Gebüsch, es bietet Schutz vor dem Alltag
Wozu ein Kompass mit Norden?
Auch ohne kann ich's Torten voll krass besorgen
Das Gequatsche der Weisen von Gestern
Lockt nichtmal die Dümmsten hinterm Ofen hervor
Ein mutiges Herz scheißt auf sowas
Fünftklässler feiern Rap von reichen Opas
Meine Zielgruppe, dumm, deutsch, gewaltbereit
Ich baller in die Cypher, um euch in zwei zu teilen

Stock im Arsch, aber Mut ihn zu lösen
Jenseits von Gut und Böse
Durch's Unterholz führt ein Weg ans Licht
Doch die meisten sind feige und gehen ihn nicht
Stock im Arsch, aber Wut ihn zu lösen
Jenseits von Gut und Böse
Durch's Unterholz führt ein Weg ans Licht
Doch die meisten sind feige und gehen ihn nicht (Opfer, Opfer)

Opfer wollen mich fronten, doch ich bin eine Naturgewalt
Die euch Leichtmatrosen bricht
Wenn ihr es partout nicht schnallt
Ich hab eine Käseglocke
Über meinen Kopf gestülpt
Sodass ich all den Dreck nicht höre
Um mich rum, ich hoff es wirkt!
Sonst gibt's Schellen und zwar mit der Vorhand
Im P-Berg spukt's, alls sprüh ich den Bunker

Call me on the telephone cause I'm so alone. Walked
Around the house thinking of you, see me and you hand
In hand that's how it used to be. The happy days, the
Times we shared, without you baby is so damn weird.
Please forgive the things that I've done to you, I know
I did a few but baby I'm human too. I'll take you to
The beach where the wind blows and let the waves and
The sand run through your toes. Whatever you want,
Whatever you I'll plant the seed. But do you agree? I
Should deal with that you have another man but I can't
Understand you're still wearing my wedding band. I'll
Just chill and think about the whole thing in the
Morning. So I guess I'll keep:

I'll keep on brainstorming once you get your feelings
Hurt? So you wanna be loved by me? Love my name is MCB.

Now it's daylight, the sun's bright, my mind is clear.
I can't smell the breakfast that you used to cook my
Dear. Some cold water on my face so I can come to
Reality and realize it's me. My mind is not at ease
Since you've been gone. Please come back, cause I'm so
Alone.

P.S. Yeah, you know been looking for you for the
Longest, every since you left. But now I'm real
Independent you know, just laid back chillin'. I wanna
Let you know you're really thought about every night
And day. So I came up with these words and had Boyz II
Men sing 'em to you in the background you know what I'm
Saying. But I really want you back, so come back as
Soon as possible, cause I love you.

Yeah
My name is MC Breed
I'm down with DJ Flash Technology, right?
And what we're doing here together as a team, the true-doers
Is what we call
Kicking it
Ah-ha, I said
We kicking it

Back in '86 when I started this
I said, the people told me: ""Breed, you're not an artist""
But now it's 1990, I'm serving em well
With the rhymes, rhythms, style and clientele

Concert after concert, one after the other
A man with the plan, plus a hustler undercover
A president, a guy of his own 
Said, I knew I was proper, and I knew I was strong

But all it takes is concentration, rhyme calculation
Enough crew members to carry a nation
To be exact, yo Jack, I rehearsed
The cat wants your tongue, but I'd be catching it first
And I'm kicking it

Said, it's real necessary, not lack of control
To be at the tip-top with nothing but bankroll
To develop an actual skill, son
You gotta be born a natural real one

Not high up on a pedestal, just a born idol
To me it's just a typical man-made title
To remain an architect and stand, in fact
You're startin to sweat, to eject is your best bet

Certified legal, not against the law
I'm not irrelevant, but terribly raw
I got on-the-job knowledge and puttin it on paper
No bun for those who b.s. the baker

Big Breed, I'm serving at the top of my mind
But his wax is just like 'jack, so then grind
It's like MC Kicking-It, one time like this and that
Step back, Jack, going black for black

Yeah, not wearing a Kangol, but maybe a cable
Thick shades, now you know, no looking like cool Moe

Some niggas be all up in my shit, you need to quit
Sprinkle a motherfucker that will leave you split
Tore back ass out bringing you your hat
Flat broke, talking about fuck that nigga S-P-I
But you can't go one on one Spice 1 because I'm born to die
I gets even up on they ass like punk bitches in ditches
The gangsterism resulting in murderism
Bailing up in your hooptie at the gas station
You facing the killer for real-a punk ass nigga where the scrilla
Jacking you for your shit, taking your ends pull off my mask
Hitting the corner, hopping up in my Benz with your cash
Mobbing I mash out, you ass out
Left you shot up in your seven-trey glasshouse
Because you don't know me like you think you do, I'm
Down for thefetty
Ready to die for them presidents, high powered and deadly
I ask to ball or not to ball, partner answer the question
I meet a nigga running up on my hooptie with Smith
And Wesson

[Chorus]

One time for your mind
Here to represent the pimps, playas, hustlas, ballers
All my niggas on the grind, packing nine millimeters
Nine lives like cheetahs, but your still in ?
Drug dealers peep the shit that I kick
Hustling, busting down zips making chips
If we ain't making it we taking shit
To the extreme hit the scenery with machine
Gun, get the creamery and ice cream, nobody scream
Nobody run, I come like point blank
Mobbing the motherfucking bank, looking like Benjamin Frank and Itake
So many penitentiary chances, to make
Scrilla scratch niggas must have more stack in the safe
I mean ? nigga your safe is my safe
And I'm gonna make sure that my safe ain't your safe
By putting a .38 up in your face
For running up in my place and shake the spot
And not expect to get your ass shot
Yeah, another one bites the dust, the shyster busts
Caps at your house
Matter fact, niggas don't like the Yukmouth
About to L-U, didn't they tell you
I'm a youngster trying to have something like my
Nigga L-Q
Ballin'

[Chorus]

It's the motherfucking East Bay G with the hundred
Clipper, savage thug nigga
See I was born with the lust for money, chrome plated
Triggers
Mob style haulering 187 up in your face
Put a gauge between your throat and tell you that
Your out of place
Motherfuckers don't be knowing we vicious and vicious
To get the cheese
More tickets to G's, cruises overseas
Can't be no punk about the shit that we're in
Got to be a soldier to the game or nigga you'll never get your dividends
Balling til I die, until I die I'll be a baller
Let my riders do the dirt and I'll be the shot-caller
Whatever I got to do for the lifestyle that'll pay them forever
Never slip stay on my toes nigga walk with the yellow stripe
But pull me back, because they cowards and shit
I be the nigga that take your drama and put a twist
In your the shit

You say 'Hi Breed,' tell em how I holler

MC Ceja,"Un 5 de Julio del año 1986
Llego al mundo Bull and Raice
En un pueblo de la costa norte de la isla Corl Carolina
El chamaquito conoció el lado oscuro de la isla
Viendo como los panas se mataban en el cacerio por kilo o por libra
A veces solo por poder o por guía
Y una noche sintió una música en el huesos
Y en su sistema sanguíneo
Y el chamaquito entonces tubo esta misión
Vivir de la música brother no es imposible
Cuando de la música es que deseas vivir

Any solo dream ya vivo en el siglo 25
Mami sin dinero, papi no es precinto
Y yo me acuerdo en las noches me pasaba pensando
Algún día seré rico o moriré tratando

Pero ahora todo es diferente
Ahora le gusto a la gente
El que estaba pichando
(Lo digo mamando)
Su carrera esta en peligro
(Lo digo mamando)

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Tienen que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Y hay que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Un 3 de Octubre de 1980 llego al mundo en el seno de una familia humilde
El chamaquito fue criado por una madre soltera
El chamaquito jamas permitió que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi
El chamaquito agarro lo mejor que pudo de la experiencia
Y con la música como norte
El chamaquito comprendió si misión en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi
Ahhh

Jaja
Cuando empece en esta cuestión fue sin mirar atrás
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)
'Toy viajando el mundo entero, intenciones tengo muchas
Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
Sentía que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquí estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas
Gracias al señor por la fuerza que me diste
La madre que me pusiste, la familia y lo que hiciste
Contesto sus preguntas con la dura realidad

Satan was my roommate, so junior year was hell
he lacked social skills and had a pudgent smell
when your roommate is the devil it can be extremely wack
putting posters on the wall of Trapt and Nickelback
until the break of dawn he'd be mutilating sheep
it's 4 A.M. Satan, can you please go to sleep?
I can't have girls over when the dorm smells like Sterno
when did room 56 become Dante's Inferno?
he likes death and destruction, I like radio and art
he likes holding down Christians and reading (?)
while I'm going class studying my notes
he's eating baby fetuses and sacrificing goats
he tricks the freshmen girls into eating apples
holding black masses down at the campus chapel
should of never moved in (but no) wished I were dead
should of found a place off campus on Craig's List instead

[chorus]
he was the roommate from hell
his name was Lucifier
someone call a priest
and bring the crucifer
he was the roommate from hell
leaves his pitchfork in my bed

cuz he is messing with my head

Otra vez Davo y C-Kan en una cancion
Aunque otros se junten saben bien que no hay comparacion 
Gracias a Dios subieron los precios por presentacion
Dinero, mujeres y fama, es cabrona la tentación 
Monterrey, Guanatos y Eireanbeats en los platos 
Aqui el chiste es contratos pero que no sean baratos
No vengas a decir como vivirla no seas ingrato, 
La andamos metiendo a las grandes ligas desde hace rato 
Tal vez todavia no tenga un premio en los Grammys Latin 
Y estoy sentado al lado de Maluma y Ricky Martin
Al ritmo no le doy parking, me ves fumando algo tranqui
Que en un rato tengo entrevista con el burro Van Rankin
Así es la gente te envidia cuando tienes exito
Gracias a los fanáticos tengo un ejercito
No necesito favorcitos de pendejitos
Mi nombre con letras grandes, en el rap se queda escrito 

Estoy en donde estoy porque este flow no se me acaba
Cuántos no confiaban 
Ahora que me miran ya no tiran, me lo maman
Ladran, perro; no hacen nada 
Estoy en donde estoy porque este flow no se me acaba
Cuántos no confiaban 
Ahora que me miran ya no tiran, me lo maman

Desde Monterrey 
Para todo mi lindo país 
México

Esto es algo que
Vivimos los mexicanos en la actualidad 
Pero para este tipo de situaciones 
Existen estas canciones 
Que dicen la verdad

Unos dicen esto unos dicen lo otro 
Señor presidente no creo que usted viva como nosotros 
Vamos a empezar con un par de cosas que sucedieron 
Como cuando mintieron cosa que yo creo todos vieron 
Tengo pesadillas con un pueblo que esta de rodillas 
Cada quien debe jugar su papel son cosas sencillas 
El miedo de los pobres parece te da cosquillas 
Por eso no sabes cuanto cuestan las pinches tortillas 
La revista Forbes, dice somos de los mas pobres 
No hagas algo malo que parezca bueno y despues cobres 
La ley de Herodes o te chingas o te jodes 
""Tas"" viendo y no ves México suplica no robes 
Yo no creo en las elecciones siento que es ""deoquis"" votar 
El pueblo esta enojado contigo eso lo puedes notar 
Lo quieren fuera del mapa y usted gastando en traer al Papa 
Diganos donde estan los 43 de Ayotzinapa 

La culpa es del gobierno tambien de nosotros 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Piensa bien a quien le regalas tu voto 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Cría cuervos y te sacaran los ojos 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Si no hago caso y hago todo a mi antojo 
¿Pa' qué me quejo y pa' qué chingados me enojo? 

Trump nos dijo delincuentes mírense ahora 
Necesitamos cambiar cabrones lo digo de cora 
Nuestro pueblo llora vamos de mal en peor no hay mejora 
Siento que ya es hora de hacer lo que mucha gente ignora 
No somos culpables pero estamos pagando una fianza 
Señor danos fuerza para no morir de esperanza 
Yo sé bien que tranza que con tu sueldo no te alcanza 
No por eso te pasas de lanza y vas y asaltas famsa 
¿Qué carajos pasa por la mente de toda esa gente? 
Señor presidente ¿quién es culpable de este presente? 
Yo soy diferente quiero decírselo de frente 
Porque es evidente que mexico se siente impotente 
Y se que a muchos no les afecta eso del gasolinazo 
Pero a todos nos afecta ver al pueblo hecho pedazos 
Ni con tanta manifestación usted les hace caso 
El 2017 fue la gota que derramo el vaso 

La culpa es del gobierno tambien de nosotros 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Piensa bien a quien le regalas tu voto 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Cría cuervos y te sacaran los ojos 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Verde, blanco y rojo 
Si no hago caso y hago todo a mi antojo 
Pa que me quejo y pa que chingados me enojo? 

Entonces mexicanos 
Hay que aceptar que las cosas no están bien en nuestro gobierno 
Pero también hay que aceptar 
Que hay muchas cosaque nosotros nos estamos haciendo bien 
Yo creo que antes de echarle la culpa a los demás 
Primero tenemos que empezar por ver nuestros errores 
El cambio esta en nosotros mismos 
Y aquí todo es posible

You're schiesty, keniving, skinny like a clucker
Must be smoking, you's a short motherfucker
You can't handle these things when I slang
Cheap like SWV you're too weak
Put your shit up on a hanger
Never could you fade a Compton banger
Nigga, I'm the one that'll make you cancel all your shows
Strictly for my niggas, so fuck them hoes
No sing no dance, no dance no sing
Just your bald-headed ass with your lips on my big fat thing

Nighty night, motherfucker, take two to the head
Just some more Eiht shit for that punk that I pop

Somebody snitchin ain't that a bitch
Motherfuckin 5-0 at my front door
Uhh , talkin about they got a gang of witnesses

Sellin dat candy is just the way to survive
And dealin them straps they won't take me alive
So now I gots ta play it like I say it
See the fuckin glare of the batch and I spray it
Uhh , they kickin my front door with them steel-toe boots
My face [?] so I starts to shoot
I hit 1 to the 2 starts to shout
Grab the motherfuckin yea kick the backdoor fool , I'm out
All for your dollars and some sense
Hear the fuckin sirens and I hit the back , bitch
Uhh , I start to scatter like a mouse 
Snatch the fuckin yea and I'm out to my nigga Boom Bam's house
Uhh 

[VERSE 2 ]
I guess you can chalk up zero for the blue team
Look up in the sky and see the fuckin high beam
Tab on Boom Bam's window with the fuckin strap
Wake up my nigga One-Time's tryin to peel my cap
Special report just hit the fuckin airways
Be on the look-out for the nigga hair full of braids
They say i'm nuttin but a cheater
Trippin and I'm quick fast strapped with a Nine Millameter
Gotta make it to my motherfuckin nigga Chills
One-Times on they way and they want to kill
They lookin silly cause they got clowned
Heard the whisper chief williams 2 officers down
Uhh , here comes the motherfuckin tear gas
Bam dropped the mask and hit the side door kinda fast
One 5-0 that I killed 
Jumped on the motherfuckin metro to my nigga Chills

[VERSE 3 ]
Ain't no takin me to jail no bail no wonder
Kill 'em all cause the motherfuckin hood took me under
Uhh , One-Times won't give me no Juice
Heard the barkin , yes they let the dogs loose
Uhh , runnin like a motherfuckin strap with the mack
But i ain't that lucky
Caught one in the leg and in the damned back
Now bleedin like a stuck pig
But I keep bellin ""fuck you bitches"" is what I'm yellin

Who's got paper?
But I shoot boxes
Plenty of cash to straight floss from the gate
You ain't seem grabs this green
Plenty of cream kingpins unsolved the scheme
I got my eyes on you
Geah, you want to ??? down from here to shoot
Got a crew
But you stand out
Miss thing wish I have X-rated vision to peep the G-strings
You know what I mean
Keeps the shit real live
Benz 'round town in a 3-25
Cheques in your coat and float to the arena
??? taps me on the shoulder, Tony have you seen her?
Let my Gators through the snappin'
Crystal sippin', drops along, geah baby what's happenin?
Hear me, see me
I could, uh, be your geenie, any wish comes true
Be my boo

Anything you want, anything you need
Anything you want, anything you need
Mr. Tony will deliver til your ???
Diamonds to chronic bud, oh yes indeed
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything you want, anything you need
We's be's the pimps

(Verse 2)
Independently hustlin' while you work in your stuff
Keep your condo pay so you work at MC Gruff
9 TO 5 paper chasing, geah, I can dig it 
With your 15 hundred dollar brims and your fixed up ???
No trips to the clinic
But it straight trips to the club
With your head hooked up, short skirts straight throwin' up love
Mr Tony know the game ain't playin' nice and soft
G's around ya in a circle talkin' about take that shit off
Damn niggas, swingin' on a players boss
Peeps tha Coup, hits me up with a fucked phone call
I be's the black desperado
Five carats with the golden ??
Gang of parrots, me and you
King and queen of the hill
Means the fat links, captain inch nail
Get down like you live and that's no joke
Gang of ???? to poke with the endo smoke

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Times is hard
And I can see you're a lil' rebellious
Now your homegirl kicks the rumours
In a way too jealous
Just can't stand to see ya
With a nigga with grip
They swallowin' too much dick tryin' to give you some lip
Not trip
It's too much gossip on the phone
Need to tell 'em ho's to find some dick on they own
What's wrong?
Same old song gettin' a boo
Drops your back on the block with no more packs to loot
Snatch back the dollar to diamonds
Necklace sales
Versace ?? to Armani dressers
No more sippin' Crystal anymo'
Drop a see-5 hun' with the phone
Leave me alone
Cause that's the problems nowadays
These greedy-ass ho's workin' these ways
Tony's no phony, got G's on next

Who creeps in smooth with moves like Gotti
Trips to make grips and back to the party
Million dollar holler with the Jazzy Belles
97 makes moves with the freaky tales
Hold up, stop the presses
Floats to the club and show me love in little short dresses
From 8 at night till 6 in the morn'
Intend to get ?naked?, try to put me on
Tick tock, it don't stop, clock keeps tickin'
Pour one more and wait for the liquor to kick in
Lookin suspicious cause you don't know the game plan
To the V.I.P. you peeps the ?three span?
Naughty as I want to be, so check it
Drama to the women I perfected to get naked
2 shots of the V.S.O.P. Rémy

Got to get it, cause I've never had
Takes the party back to my pad, color me bad

Weekly in the club, gots ho's to hunt
Gets mine, nose to the grind, makes cheese
Ain't never seen three niggas like these
Still gots the connects, pulls china white from Muggs
Rolex, more sex by the Compton thugs
Senoritas and peso's for the Amigos
Wherever the wind blows, you're sure to see those

Makes me want to throw my hands up and holler
It all seems like a dream
How we gettin the cream and still in Impalas, c'mon

Best not be that bitch dropped dime
Stops my money flow, where's my money, hoe?
Out the door, watch the pimp with the gangsta limp
Limo rides, westside, I keep it crackin
Thousand dollar suits while the Gators keep snappin
Bird flies in, top dollar bitches to stab
Sets up nice on Boom Bam ab
Makes me laugh sometimes... ha-ha
Fine bitches and money makes me do the cha cha
Ooh-lah-lah, 'cross the board money to spend
Open the door, bitch, get in

Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had (yeah, c'mon)
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin die together

Just me and my bitch

Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your ass fuckin around
I'ma cut your mother-fuckin dick off

Hah, heheh stop playin, hah

I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes

Yo, don't don't play with my dick

She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me 
(uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch

Just me and my bitch

Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh...
Uh, motherfucker yeah

[b-real]
I put years in this shit struggled to build the empire
Just another brick in the wall you fall tired
Who will be the one son to fall victim?
Who's on the street, who's runnin' from pigs wishing?
No way out
You can't stay out - your hook
Criminal lifestyle, you're booked in the crook
Where will you seek shelter? killafornia
What'll you do when you see the heat around the corner?
You silly fucking goner, where will you hide?
On the sick side of town facin' the long ride
Sick-ass soul assassins I keep blastin'
Cause you never know when it's time for some action
A fraction, chain reaction the crew smashin'
Through your city get the committee a ready faction
We run shit
And muthafuckas are on it
You can't call it, buster you better stall it

[chorus]
We got g-boys and ho's on deck
One times gafflin' niggas that chin check (check it out)
You see a robbery
We done it
That's just the way we run it

[eiht]
Ten years in the game, no chains remain
Heavy weights, get it straight, still bringin' the pain
First green since the b.g.
I gotta get cream
Late night hype's the fiends as I plots a scheme
Got tight with rap flows and followed the rap shows
But the streets keep callin' me to cluck the pesos
Did good
I made up tapes about the hood
Locked down that shit as nobody could
Enemies always out to get me
But just keep spittin' rhymes and they won't hit me
Street dreams always made of this
Top dollar
Bitches and switches is on my list
Leave your ass with the good night kiss
Makes moves smooth so your shorty won't miss
Never runnin' to meal, we chill on the hill
Real g's always packs the steel

[chorus]

[eiht]
It ain't a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it - in the mix
Nowadays
We be's the g's that's deadly
Bustin' raps, shootin' craps, gots the straps on ready
Common sense'll tell you, slide out
But ain't no fuckin' where for you to hide out
Got the picture?
We don't play no games
Eiht and be-real fuckin' frank & jesse james
To the limit
Watch us do what we do
Leave your whole life fucked turn misty blue
Senoritas and pesos yes yes y'all
Ball cause we to tall and never fall
We got paper fo' sho'
No doubt
Criminal mind this time you're assed out
Define it
Here's your strollin' paper just sign it
Take a walk as the eiht starts to talk

Should I kick open the door and go to war
Or should I stick my throat
Leave a pipe bomb and a fuck you note
Hallucinations of seein' lynched bodies burnin'
And all the po-po had faces like Mark Furhman
Tear gas through my glass window pane
They want to put me back up in the nut house again

Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks

With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks

I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""

Me and my nigga blast with the same gat - it's my turn
Money and the power, it's my time to earn
You're dead on arrival, to whom it may concern
Real thug from the street, yes, die for the cause
Dips the blocks with the heat, right next to my balls
I be the first nigga to jump on the - front line
Slang quarter piece rocks and dodgin - One Time
Everybody hustlin' for cash and that's real
Half of us niggas be looking for any bill
Lock down ?? my ass ??
But I bails out, another head back to coke
I gots to bang the hood, slang - till it drop
The enemies I fear not, fuck a cop
The enemies, they come close but get popped
I lasted, laughed last till your heart stopped

Chorus...

Easily I approach
The nigga who's slippin'
I ain't no joke
The tense situation
I gotta provoke
They run real fast
When they see the gunsmoke (hey - boom boom!)
I got - hot ones to test y'all, bless y'all
West y'all - at the - funeral hall
Your homies take sips as they reminisce on nuthin'
I come around catchin' you slippin', doing a dumping
One little, two little, three little suckers
Hoo-Bangin' niggas is killers, you muthafucka
???? my homie Scar when he ride
So every other day when I hit your damn side
Feel my fuckin' revenge
As I blast through your house with your family and friends (boom boom!)
Back to my block, serving 20's and 10's (what up!)
In the back of the alley sippin' 40's and gins (right)
On Sundays, church
Moms pray for my sins
And ask to protect until my life ends, geah

Chorus...

Cops tryin to set off spots and raid niggas
Just cause we some fuckin paid niggas
Zags and crack that I used to sell
To the swap meet to get my gear and straight bail
What 'll it be to they lost my loot
So 5-O wants all a blue khaki suit
Shoot if ya'll come down the block, static 
Dash like a rabbit barely escapin the automatic
Tragic is the scene that's left
Bringin the pain like Meth(od Man)
The yellow tape means death (boyaa)
Steps the fuck off or meet your maker
The Tech 9 will take ya be the back-breaker

Your lesson for y'all out there
All the thug niggas on the block regulatin'
This goes out for y'all 
(West Side)
Gangstas will rule the world in the Y2K
Check it out

Can y'all see where I'm comin from
Hoods and blocks and G's with glocks
Young thug niggas with rocks
Everyday and night cause ain't - nuthin' changed
Destiny is meant for niggas to hoo-bang
Lord have mercy - to the ones that's gone
Cause only you upstairs know was wrong
Night time hits, here comes the fire flies
One more block to catch the drive-by
Code of the streets you pack heat and skeet
Any fuckin' hoodrat bitch you can meet
Poor muthafuckas still wating - on the county
Young black niggas dodgin' the county mountie
Who got the fat stacks, the pack stacks
Slugs to your back if my clientele you jack
Knick knack - patty wack, packs straps 
Patty-wack your own homie trying to cheat on craps

From yo hood 2 my hood's all the same
Like yo hood and mine learn the same games
Thug niggas, strapped girls down on planes
If you get caught then don't say no names

I gotta flick from a homie doing ten in the pen
Gotta a little bigger since my lil' nigga went in
Lotta tales 'bout fools gettin' em up and shanked
Whose mouth tight shut? Whose shit that stink?
Gotta lil' message - 'bout the bitch you fucked
A nigga cross town got the hoodrat stuck
Me and Loc jacked that nigga last week fo' ends
I shoot a lil' paper till you up in the pen
Fools still riding - got the spot on lock
We gon' chill right here till you back on the block
Nigga still bailin round here khakis and stars
High as fuck as we throw the hood out the car
We miss the days when you used to get drunk at night
Never bailed on a homie when it's time to fight
One times jacked us the last night, face in the dirt
Tryin' to get info on who shot the store clerk

From yo hood 2 my hood's all the same
Like yo hood and mine learn the same games
Thug niggas, strapped girls down on planes
If you get caught then don't say no names

Somebody help me out the ghetto
Ya know - same story just like before
I don't want to be here just like you
I slangs just 'bout everything to start new
Do you have the answer? 
Niggas gettin' popped - dying off just like cancer
You got your enemies, you got your old G's
In the penitentiaries just want to be free
If I had another chance would I do it again?
Rewind the time and head right back to the pen
Seems like I can't escaped this world of sin
Judgement for this young thug in the end
Time's up - this thug caught a slug
In another town trying to slang drugs
My moms pray for my soul
As I lay below
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

Chorus...

Geah
You how we do it",From Yo Hood 2 My Hood,2000
MC Eiht,"[EIHT]
We sending this one out right here
To all the young thug and young hustlers out there
You know I'm sayin', grown up with their moms strugglin'
In the hood yo' I'm sayin', ya know how it is
Trying to keep it tight, you know I'm sayin' 
Geah

Born and raised a black youth, no happy days
My moms and pops went they separate ways
Now she solo with half the dough, and three kids
No house, a damn tight situation we in

Hit the streets to look for work and pay
So her kids can have it better than she had one day
Try to teach me some rules, ""Get A's in school
Keep your head up high and don't run with the fools""

That was the lesson, always listen to moms
Bible she totin, always quotin from Psalms
Young but I'm knowin' the right thang to do 
Know the things to say when times is blue

Times is hard and really unfortunate
I'm young and I really don't like the shit
But I dream nice things when I sleep at night
When I grow up I'll make everything alright
Sing

[SOULTRE]
I know it's hard sometimes
But if you can make a way, you need to hold up
I know a better way
And if you can wait today it'll be alright...

[EIHT]
Now I'm 15, my life done hit a split screen
What used to be a good kid struck a bad gene
Bad dreams, young thugs and crime scenes
Skip school, saggin' my jeans and blow green

My moms don't know where I get the shit from
If you keep trippin' you know the outcome
Laid up somewhere, or in jail
Makin' collect calls tryin' to make bail

Hell, and you know how I struggle for the cheddar
Before I give it away better get it together
My guilty conscience sayin' not no listen
The other have tellin' me, keep a good intention

Aw shit, a nigga need a mind of his own
Too much to deal with, I really don't feel shit
Young thug ready to take on the world
Who made my life take such a twirl
Come on

[Chorus]
Now my situation's changed, no chains remain
Now I try to check out the game and cause pain
Long live the days of homeboys and straps
Gang of tombstones for the ones that caught caps

Make snaps off raps, reminiscin' of days
Good part is shot up while 'More Bounce' plays
Missin the days sometimes, but keeps my eyes on the future
Keep my hands on my heat cause niggas might shoot ya

Rob a nigga blind, just like Stevie
I used to do the same when a nigga was greedy
But my come-up was wrong, flipped it, now it's strong
Now I clocks snaps, keep the street shit in my songs

Trying to make it up on a stage from doin' a bid
Trying to make a better way like she did for my kids
Right now watch out, keep my nose to the grind
Yeah boy, this world is mine
Geah

Bitch I need, nuthin but cash and weed
Out of town trips, slips my cash with speed
Don't get it twisted, no Captain
But I'm cappin' and duckin'
While a hoe hides me out and I'm steadily fuckin'
Doin your thang
While I teach you how to hop on planes
Get this cream from this fool with the country name
Same day you get back, my bankroll stack
As a matter of fact, you know I like that
Sticky bitches have niggas straight spendin' they dough
Ya know cash runs everything around a hoe
Greedy as fuck, a chicken tryin' to scheme on chickens
Greedy as fuck, to pay the bitch, she keep on lickin'
I love the hoe
She's out to get my paper fo' sho'
Anytime and place she ready to go
Love scratch
No pigeon in the world could match
Simple as fuck

Gossip you spit
Put each other up on game
On which nigga's got chips, routine's the same
Shakin' that ass with the jiggle and twitch
In the club bustin', knowin I'ma want that bitch
You ain't seein a nigga ghetto rich
Ghetto fab, ghetto star
Hop off stage, ???bless thou??
No questions asked, that's the role you play
You hit me up on Monday
Fuck the bitch anyway
It ain't nuthin'
And leave suckas say: the bitch good for somethin
Anywhere, any day, any hour
In front of anybody, in the shower
Geah   

Hood rats
I'm lovin 'em ho's, I'm lovin 'em ho's
Geah ya know how it goes...
Hood rats...
Geah, check me out

Is she or she not the top notch?
Watch the peddle pushers and rocks in a ?????
How she cop, bitch flips, trips, no sleepin
Back to the club where she strips on a weekend
You know what I'm speakin' she's out to get yo' bread
???? up, choke up, showin some leg
Get down like you live and get down on a dime 
You bring yo' homegirl, that's fine
Who is better?
I got the chedder ready to spend
With a video tape so I can record the date
Fuckin' with Eiht it's all good
Now back that ass up like you know you should

Uh, c'mon...

I'm sittin' here trippin', mind playin' tricks
Tryin' to make it hot while rubbin two sticks
Anyboby killa, several conflicts
Dead on arrival, the message is survival
Only the strong get it on
I do my creepin' nightly, nigga, with the chrome
Last place niggas get caught up first
I ain't satisfied, so I follow the hearse
Check the verse
Situation end up worse
As I release the heat on my ?label? that's cursed
Back up, bitch, my shit spits down
4-5 fully auto, never down
want to dance with the evil in the pale moon light?
Didn't know that I blast anything on sight?
Murder at night, side-busters best take flight
As they dead bodies covered in the sheets that's white

I'm a lunatic
Geah
When I bust the strap everybody...
I'm a lunatic
Geah
Your days is done
When I bust the gun
Everybody better run

I'm dreamin' more nightmares when I sleep
My steez, a nigga like me N 2 deep
Creep with me as I invade your mind
Be a killa with me as I pass the nine
Don't be a weak muthafucka, get your brain on strap
Hit the blunt one more time 'fore we hit the gat
Got to dis 'em, food on my plate, blood on my hands
Lesson number one if you plan for grands
Follow my lead as we enter the place
Shoot anything that move and aim for the face
Race against the clock, a minute to ten
Good time, everybody's tied down in the den
Listen, a killa for hire, expert
Don't talk, only point out of work
Smart move, nigga, ready to skirt
Ain't no jam, prepare yourself, cause this might hurt

I'm a lunatic
When I grab the gun
Everybody better run
Cause your days is done
I'm a lunatic
When I bust the strap
Peel a cap
Everybody adapt
I'm a lunatic
Better run
When I bust the gun
Your days is done
I'm a lunatic
When I enter your home
I bust the chrome
Geah

y'all best back on up, I act up
The blood that you spill just like a cracked cup
Your attitude, kill it, mines they want to steal it
Bitches, y'all can feel it, any caps, I peel it
Warning, killin' niggas, strike in morn'
And stay around the crime scene till the cops start swarmin
Smile in your face while I mess with the case
Through the streets a fast race while your boys gettin' chased
No mace, only shootin' gats with slugs 
Directed straight at the mug tryin' to kill this thug
I work that thing on my back, so I blast back
But that's the quick instict of how a killa react
The straight aim I possess is what they lack
Droppin'em one by one with a 80 Mac
Chips I stack, muthafuckas need to quit
I bang for life and y'all can't handle the shit

I'm a lunatic
I enter your home
Release the chrome
Straight for your dome
I'm a lunatic
Your day is done
I pops the gun
You're best to run
I'm a lunatic
Enter your home
Release the chrome
Straight for your dome

[ VERSE 1 ]
The concrete streets bring heat, it's so rough
Niggas test everyday, calling your bluff
Eiht had enough, I'm smoking my fluff
Spitting game, letting you know my turf is tough
My theme is I push music to driveby
I slide through, scoop up four and ride high
Strap under the seat my hood technique
As I destroy your block like _Dante's Peak_
Feel me, partly a killer, clocker for fun
On my turf puttin in work since day one
y'all ain't heard enough about a nigga singin the blues
Niggas bendin in two's while y'all watch the news
John Walsh, wash me up, you're crazy
Havin my face captured 180
Can't go there, ain't havin that, man, fuck
The strap turned me corrupt, so prepare to duck

[ CHORUS ]
Sometimes in the hood it's so rough
That makes niggas from the hood stay tough
Slings packs, pack straps, quarters and halfs

I guess my mind's on the track, gotta get me a stack
And in fact, homebody, you know what gun I pack
Keeps y'all enemies close that stay cheatin
When they ask make fast and start heatin
Niggas ain't fuckin around - dodge mine
Drop yours, bitch, and lay that ass down
Keep your face to the ground, don't even look
No positive ID and all the money was took
Shook the hell up out the spot and kept away from snitches
Took a trip across town just to floss my riches
Bitches turn into niggas and start yappin
One more hit on your house where y'all nappin
Dumpin one, catch you in the midnight, the late night hour
The hollow point shower
The sweet success thatt you taste has got sour
Straight, Eiht regulate my thug power

Still player-hated, wishin y'all made it
Stay down, Hoo-Bangin niggas takin over

Told ya, stop tryin to walk in our shoes
Real thugs hail from the west, first rule
In fact, we the first Bloods and Crips
First niggas to drive by sendin tricks on trips
First niggas to hit yo town and set up shop
Bring the prices down low, y'all pick the rest to cop
Copy cats, now y'all dippin lows with heats
Pepetratin Fresh Coast, tryin to roll our streets
Hate your sight, catch you on a red-eye flight
Commence the sweatin the groove just for spite
Lucky though, I give you a pass and let you go
I'ma catch you on the road at another rap show

Do some shit with my niggas from the CPT, ha ha
You ready Eiht?

[MC Eiht]
Yeah, c'mon

[Mack 10]
I was born to ride, banging, pack heat
Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""
Get the eighty eight skate, ang get your slide on
Throw the Hoo-Bang plack in the back and your ride on

[Chorus: x2]
Ride for me, I'ma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo ride on, get yo slide on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

[Eazy E]
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
Eazy motherfucking with a chrome to your dome
Cruising, in my 6-4 rag top
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fucking block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncing
More bounce to the ounce and I'm clowning
Keep the gat in my lap cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cause I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury motherfuckers in the concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I'm peeping niggas out in my left window
So I blast, and I blast, so I blast no more
Yo, they call me motherfucking John Doe

[Chorus]

[MC Eiht]
Real thugs roll cause the Westside's sick
Which enemy depicts to catch the 9 clip
Slick, but not like Rick, the gang story
G's kill and ain't shit funny like Joe Corry
Don't make me laugh cause I""m on the wrong the path
Catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath
Slang strike to make money, now ain't that simple?
That silly nigga's wearing vest's but we aim for the temple
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket
Never seen these west side G's face, we masked it
Y'all best be defeat and be discreet
Catch the hot heat from across the street
Take me in the dump schools that, wanna push me
Retaliation, straight better than hitting pussy

MC Eiht,"If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

""Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!""

""Man down
Where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?], YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recording saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin up you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump
Pickin' off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all. Duck.""
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city

""Man down
Where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""

Wake yo punk ass up!
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Real simple and plain
I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
How we do

Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice

Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where motherfuckers stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
And the price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough

Não te engana até 'tava xonando
Mas te comer muito enjoou meu pinto

Ouvindo 2PAC no pião de nave
Com os moleque chave
Avistei a novinha louca na maldade no meio da cidade
Buzinei falei fique a vontade
Falei vamos pro meu iate
Falei vai rolar uma massagem
Vai rolar sacanagem

Nós é thug life

No pião de nave ouvindo 2 Pac

Sessão de louca de selvagem
Ela sentou pros thug life
Então senta pros thug life
Quica pros thug life
Rebola pros thug life

Wir fahren über's Land, durch die Berge bis zum Strand.
So schön war's lang nicht mehr mit dir.
Wir steigen aus und bleiben hier.

Die Straßen gehör'n heut nur uns
Wir haben grüne Welle.
Hauen ab, drehen nie wieder um
Bis der Tank leer ist.
Mein Herz macht boom boom
Ich tret auf's Gas es macht brumm, brumm.
Mein Herz macht boom boom
Ich tret auf's Gas es macht brumm, brumm.

(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh) Nur du und ich, wir beiden
Und die neue Kuschelrock Doppel-CD.
Und der Pferdeanhänger
Wo die ganzen Pferde reinkommen
Die wir zusammen stehlen.
Ich hab dich lieb.

Die Straßen gehör'n heut nur uns
Wir haben grüne Welle.
Hauen ab, drehen nie wieder um
Bis der Tank leer ist.

Mc frontalot's heart's huge; let's have a housewarming.
I love you so damn much I'll sell ya CDs.
I'm greedy to get loved back like ally sheedy

In wargames. I got more sayings and turns of phrase
In my communist handbook than in my -- damn, what'd
I do with my ledger? I'll never get paid now!
That distributor promised me checks but didn't say how

He was gonna locate the Front.
It's the anonymity I'm a little bitty bit late to shun.
Hate to run; can't be tardy to my rally:
""Art Must Be Free"" is the decree. The finale

Is my lecture on the evils of the R-I-double-A,
How they gonna sue you every single time you hit play.
They're lame! must revolt! what's that you say?
Kids are pirating the frontalot? oh no, I got betrayed!

It's true
Frontalot's destitute
I need you
To buy my CD so I could buy food

I been a charity case to my fan base for years:
In tears at my show, ""somebody buy me ride home.""
Now I got something I can barter for services.
Yo don't let the major labels get word of this.

I'm girderless, free falling towards riches;
Gonna sell so many CDs that I can afford britches
And a shirt, AND a hat to go with it.
I get specific -- 'cause my fantasy is that vivid.

I'm gonna buy gadgets that don't do anything but beep
And blink, then I'll go out in public & buy drinks --
But it's contingent on your ponying up.
Wait, you got my record on bittorrent? fuck!

Might seem like there's no DRM but I'll explode
Your computer like COBRA done to GI Joe
On the episode about computer viruses.
Oh look, there's the ledger: overflowing with minuses.

My spinelessness in the face of the starvation
Projected by my cashflow erodes the hesitation
I once harbored as regards the tune vending.
If only the nerd kids' aversion to spending

Money on data got inverted somehow
I'd be making my way through all my dollars with a plow
But instead I'm down on ground on my knees
Begging y'all to believe my CD isn't free.",Charity Case,2005

Sad as ""Face of a Stranger""

Dad found me on the steps of the video arcade
Oprhan baby in a basket, seven pounds is all I weighed
And before I learned to walk well I'd mastered Donkey Kong
Q'bert, Final Fight, Master Blaster and Pong

Blindfolded, okay, yeah, I know it sounds adorable
But dollars signs in pop's eyes grew creepy and deplorable

He said, ""Play by the noises, follow the ding boing""
But can I walk the dog and do my homework?
First, collect coins

Kid, didn't I find you with a controller in hand?
Now why do you got to go and bring shame to your old man?
Same to your old fans, you were a child prodigy
Up on a milk crate at the cabinet, making cottage cheese

Out of anybody'd put a quarter on screen
My pride in you, extended like the limbs of Dhalsim
All green money motives must a back seat take
Put the textbooks down, I'm trying to make you great

Sad as ""Face of a Stranger""

Locked in the attic I was trained from my crib to the stroller
While dad beat me senseless with the NES controller
Kid, listen, I promise, it's for your own good
Wits that you've shown, should you level up? It's understood

I hadn't been out since '98 like Sega Saturn
I've been learning ten-hit combos and the speed run patterns
More play, less chatter, you're a champion, kid
Under your mattress there had better be some cartridges hid

Up up down down left right left right B A, mad scary
It's like Clockwork Orange meets Ray Bradbury
It's unnecessary to struggle, you're fated to win
But till you beat Bowser you stay strapped in

I wanna live a fun life, I've only seen the sun twice
I want real friends, dad, Nintendogs won't suffice
Why do you ask for nothing when the world could be yours?
Flesh and blood, fun's fleeting seek eternal high scores

I wanna go to school and clean my room
I don't wanna sit here playing Doom
Three, can't you see I need to go out and play, yo
Real sports like baseball, I'm sick of Halo

Then you're sick of the meaning of life at your age
Better try a little harder, you want to clear that stage
And step into the middle of an existence examined
Do it or you're grounded, make you play backgammon

Here's a list of things that I'd rather do
Than sitting home playing Super Smash Brothers with you
Eat peas, do the dishes, walk the dog, mow the lawn
Take your wii and shove it, I'm off pops, I'm gone, peace

Don't Joust with me, kid, I'll go Berzerk
After all of your talent, all of my hard work
All the winnings that you earn, you're celebrity too
You wanna put us on the streets like the TV movies do

Before we start fuckin', I want to know if this is right, or is it only
for one night
tell me, before I get open, I want to know what's on your mind, Baby don't
waste my time

Verse 1:
Gruff stunnin', just like Hev I keep it comin'
keep the Gin pumpin', freaks I'm slam dunkin'
twistin' 'em, whippin' 'em, pourin' Criss on 'em
the more I spit at 'em the more it gets to them
position 'em, explore and fish in 'em
keep them rainhats like I'm goin' fishin'n
go deep, man I ain't no lil' Bo peep
sex so sweet, lick you neck to yo' feet
we can go eat, scoop you in the Range Rov. jeep
creep to the Marriot get a lil' suite
god Damm, look at that ass on Monique
it'll have a nigga trickin' his cash the whole week. 

Chorus - 

Verse 1:
Gruffy, girl you know you want to rush me
cuss me, talkin' 'bout I ain't see you since you fucked me
I don't want to argue, I want to puff and sip Bubbly
don't be mad at me 'cause these other chicks love me
now I'm ugly? what's the matter you don't trust me?
what you mean you beeped me? I ain't get that
don't sweat that, respect that
Gruff put them Diamonds where your neck at
picked you up in Lefrak just so I can sex that
talk to you Dirty Baby, kiss you where your breasts at
can you dig that? that new attitude you need to quit that
I ain't wit' that, you ain't the way you was when I hit that
did that, girls just be givin' up the Kit-Kat

Chorus 

Verse 3:
All the Ladies want to know is where Gruff at?
they Love that smooth Harlem World thug cat
stay high until the day I die
first class is the way I fly, nothin' less
I don't want nothin' but the best of success
dough to invest, Pressy Rol's with baguettes
the whole mess, from here where we go next?
what a nigga wouldn't do for yo' sex?
Harlem Diplomat, crime hound nigga stickin' that
twistin' that, never lickin' that and that's that
I like how yo' ass phat, Chocolate Mac
hit it from the front, from the back and that's a wrap.

E olha onde a gente chegou
Eu sou país do futebol, negô

Tocou Neymar é gol

Ó minha pátria amada, idolatrada
Um salve à nossa nação
E através dessa canção
Hoje posso fazer minha declaração

Entre house de boy, beco e vielas
Jogando bola dentro da favela
Pro menor não tem coisa melhor
E a menina que sonha em ser uma atriz de novela

A rua é nossa e eu sempre fui dela
Desde descalço gastando canela
Hoje no asfalto de toda São Paulo
De nave do ano, tô na passarela

Na chuva, no frio, no calor
No samba, no rap e tambor
Erga as mãos pro céu igual meu redentor
Agradeço ao nosso Senhor

Voltei, estilo Charles Dow
Pra fazer a quebrada cantar
Memo, é tipo MC Lon
Eu vim pelas taça, pois, raça
Foi quase dois palito
Ontem foi choro, hoje tesouro
E o coro grita ""Tá Bonito""
Eu sou Zona Norte, fundão
Swing de vagabundos
Que venceu a desnutrição
E hoje vai dominar o mundo

I want her, I love her, I keep thinking of her 
I want to be her friend 
Because I'm definitely not her brother 
I'll make it clear that I'll always be near 
And for the love of you my love is here 
Not so up on, one can always be taught 
For the love of you many brothers have fought

You get, boy, no glory
Not in these crime stories
I'm tellin? you right now, no glory
Scene I

Too Big and the Hammer rollin? on a hit
Knives in our hands to the sound of the click
And now we're ready, we hit the swoove
Windows ease down we spray their crews

Eight fools dead, a baby too
You ask me how I'm livin?, this hit?s for you
But that's not all we got the prize
A mother in a kitchen, now yo, she's dead inside

Yeah, we took them suckers out
They know what time it is now

Crime stories
Homeboys, you get no glory
Not in these crime stories
You ain't gettin? nuthin' on that, no glory
Scene II, me and Too Big at the club

Too Big and the Hammer kickin? it at the club
Boastin? about the way that we pulled those sucker?s plugs
We weren't worried, naw, we didn't care
When you're in this war, yo, all is fair

A tap on my shoulder, I turn around
Too Big is dyin? fast, he's on the ground
I reach for my gat, it was too late
The knives went pointblank range in my face

Yo, they opened fire and took me out
Somebody tell my mother, I love her, man

Crime stories
Boy, you get no glory
I'm not going to mislead my brothers
Crime stories, I'm tellin? ya right now, ah, will they talk? No glory
Scene III, the pimpin? game

Now I'm pimpin? these berries, got to get that money
Those suckers still payin? for a little bit of honey
Nothin? in this world can stop my flow
AIDS ain't done nothin? but help my business grow

My babes are trained to make that dollar
To take you out, fool, it ain't no bother
You dropped your pants and you pay the price
Your money maybe AIDS, fool, and then your life

Yeah, that's right ?cause a pimp got to make it
You know what I'm sayin?

we're talkin? about crime stories
And I ain't givin? up no propers, no glory


Crime Stories, all the real brothers have been locked up
And you know they don't wanna go back, no glory
Scene IV, the pimp got took out by Barry's brother

We got this tip on some new fresh bait
Money in their heads and they could hardly wait
My girls went to their room to make the play
Two suckers at once, yeah, would make my day

Now I'm outside some suckers walk up
Talkin? real hard about smokin? my butt
He pushed the button, the blade came out
Cut me on my throat and then a bullet in my mouth

I guess the devil got all the babes in hell
Maybe he?ll let me work with him? Ssh

Crime stories
I'm tellin? ya, man, you get no glory
?Cause I'm not gonna mislead my young brothers
Crime stories, if you've ever been locked up
You know the true stories, no glory
And I?d like to say this before we get outta here

To my brothers in the game, my brothers
Who are out there doin? what they feel they've got to do
I wanna ask you one favor, let's let the young kids 10, 11, 12 years old
Let's let them go on and do their thing at the schoolhouse

let's give them a chance to make it
Let's give them a chance at a different life
You doin? what you feel you have to do
But they youngsters and they don't know any better

So we want to give them a chance to live
I mean life is precious, and you know that yourself
And you try to make a better life for yourself

So what I'm sayin? this from the bottom of my heart, let the kids be
Help the children lead to another way
And peace from you and I love you and I'm outta here

Use the sunshine in your heart, to ease the pain

Is it wakin' and shakin' and safe and sound

I flipped the stress off, good, I let it rip
Bank boys in the fat money grip, yeah
Rollin' 5 deep and on fools we creep
Half the town is down and you can't see me, really dough

What's next? A young fool on a flex
Tryin' to get a name, some props or rep
I stepped right to him let 'em know it's all good
Lights out, now his crib is wood

Broke for the dough but now I can't see
It's blood on my hands my dog, yo, G?'
I hit the flo' but my heart didn't stop
And now I see a vision of my son wit no pop

My mama's on her knees
Lord, Lord no please
And I feel cold and my health is cheatin'
It's gettin' dark but yet and still

I'm half dead, half life, what's real?
I can't breathe but now I'm startin' to choke
Off my own blood and not that indo smoke
No joke, straight up, on a serious tip

I'm losin' my life, I'm losin' my grip, I slip, s-s-slip deeper still
Help Lord, help Lord, I'm losin' my will
To live, low, stuck at the bottom
From winter to spring to summer to autumn

Help Lord, the homies in the hood
The squares, the G's, it's all good
Help Lord 'cause in the hood we sprung
And we stuck right here until you come

And bless the children of the ghetto life
No love, no hope, no hope, no life
Help Lord, help Lord, help Lord, help Lord
You hear me callin' Lord?

One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time

I'm goin' fo' mine, one mo' time
I'm gettin' my goals accomplished while the others sit back and wind
And none of y'all can fade me so don't even try
'Cause I'm the best at what I do and I'm a tell you why

So you see I'm too legit too ever quit
I started gaining momentum when they put me in the mix
You'll feel my power, the stage I'll burn it up
So put it on the hammer, then people will burn it up

To the records who tried to diss this is on yo face
I'll turn this mutha out leave you lookin' disgraced
Bet you can't touch and now you regret fo' calling
Yourself a pet instead of something wet

Now brothers went long, it's still the same song
While people rollin' on, your crew is gone
You know I got it started with a kickin' gold rhyme
Suck as betta' pray 'cause it's hammer time one mo' time

One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time

Check I peepin' over there if the fellows give me ten minutes
I'll bet you I'll be in em' 'cause growin' on the high street
Taught me how to get em', I grew on em'
So tight I'm known to hight em' and quit em'

See I step to her, she's mine in a matter of minutes
It ain't how long you talk it's what you put in em'
Spittin' this game so cold and you tellin' me
That I'm not able to pick up this freak, well, you fail to see

The hard nigga is what they call me
And every year I'm at the player's balgee
Whenever I'm next you can prepare to see a show
And whenever it comes to breakin' it up
You know I'm lettin' em' win the net

And I'm the man in command, so I'm puttin' em' in their place
And if she's lookin' for handouts then get outta' Hammer's Face
I'm not the type to wine and dine but I'm freak to blow your mind
So I guess I'm goin' fo' mine, one mo' time

One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time
One mo' time, hey, I gotta get my, get my one mo' time

Hold now, take me to the bay

I'm gainin' momentum from the 90's to the bay
And everywhere I went, I made the people say
Hey, I'm makin' em' all amazed in every phase
And rap fools I gotta serve em' but this time
The Hammer gotta hurt em'

State to state after partyin' in Casinos
Doin' and tryin' that, lougin' in Reno
I got it started in Bang cock and rocked Barbados
And watched Holy field know em' out in Vegas city

After city I left the people in shock, you betta have believed
I left the whole place rock and I love the way that the money
Just rolls out, fifteen hundred cities every one of em' sold out
Private jets, good times and bad times, suckas be tryin' to diss

So I'm comin' with mad rhymes
All of these things often come to mind
But guess what y'all? Here comes the payback to her
I'm doin' it one mo' time

Believe me, Ya man ain't Stevie so don't wonder
I hammer M-C's for tryin' to go against this

For tryin to get in my position

MC Hammer,"[Chorus 2x]
Let's get it started!

[Verse 1]
Now your party wasn't jumping and your DJ was weak
Instead of dope beats, he was spinnin them Z's
All the fly girls who came with a beat in mind
They all up against the wall like a welfare line
Do you think for one minute that this is it?
Your party is bogus, Yo it ain't legit
You better put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started
Get it started!

[Chorus 5x]

[Verse 2]
Now get up out your seat because my beat is so complete
I'm movin everybody from A to Z
And when it comes to straight up rockin, I'm second to none
From Doug E. Fresh to LL or DJ Run
They say hammer how you do it? I got it like that
My posse's ever rollin, We keep it in tact
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started

[Chorus 6x]

[Verse 3]
Now, a lot of be	-boys make em dance, Yo they fakin the beat
They hip hop on the outside put rock underneath
Before the show gets started, They shakin they boots
My posse in the end cold displayin the troops
Like a trooper, I'm down cold hooked on the drugs
808 SB12'S are expirin africans
Just put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started

[Chorus 5x]

[Verse 4]
They said it couldn't happen, that rap wouldn't last
The beat is in effect like the oil in your gas
Cause it's makin lots of money from top to bottom
Whatever in effect, Yo, be	-boys have got em
Nobody knows how a rapper really feels
A mind full of rhymes, and a tongue of steel
Just put on the hammer, and you will be rewarded
My beat is ever boomin, and you know I get it started

How in the world can the Hammer be underneath me?

For fooling around with chicks  
Because in that love department  
I know all the ladies tricks  
Now I ran across a girl one day  
She was as sharp as a girl could be  
And I wasn't surprised to hear her say  
That she really went for me  
 
She said I was The Best Man  
Whoever knocked on her door  
She said I was the best man  
The fella she'd waited for  
She said I was the best man  
At dancing and nobody can deny 
That when it came to romancing  
I was the a+ number 1 guy  
 
But then she met I best friend  
And knocked him right off his pins  
But still I wasn't worried  
Cause the best man always wins

There was no doubt  
That I was best man in the end  
Yes

Tonight I'll serve a supper, 
We'll eat some food that's rare. 
And at the head of the table, 
I'll place brother Henry's chair-
Invite all the local big dogs,
 We'll laugh and talk and eat, 
But we'll' save the bones for Henry Jones, 
‘cause he don't eat no meat- 

Today I'll go to market- 
and buy a lot of fish, 
That will thrill Brother Henry, 
Because that's his special dish.- 
Get a large can of molasses,
 so we'll have something sweet, 
But save the bones for Henry Jones, 
“cause he don't eat no meat. 

Henry is not a drinker, 
he rarely takes a nip, 
He don't need a napkin, 
‘cause the things he eats don't drip. 
One day we had a banquet, 
It really was a bake, 
They started off with some short ribs,
 they finished off with a steak. 
But when the feat was over, 
brother henry just kept his seat, 
and we served the bones to Henry Jones,
 ‘cause he don't eat no meat. 
To- he don't eat no meat.

Or we tastin like food when we get in the mood

But anything I touch come straight to the rear
I take chickenheads like the Playmate Of The Year

Pra ir pra balada pra curtir um som
A mulata não fica por baixo
E já desce do salto pra ir até o chão

A morena também tem poder
E mandar o DJ soltar um pancadão
A ruivinha não tá de bobeira
E já tá ligada na convocação

As que estão soltinhas
Que estão preparadas
As que são solteiras
E as que são casadas

Quando toca um funk
Quebram de ladinho
Chamam as amigas
Fazem quadradinho

Sabe usar a dança pra te seduzir
Tem sensualidade quando vai no chão
Chega na balada não quer mais sair
Quando toca o batidão

Vai, se prepara, mulher
Que o furdúncio já vai começar
Quica na ponta do pé
Quando o Koringa mandar

MC Lars,"My girlfriend hates you but I love your stuff. 
I listen to it all the time, I can't get enough. 
I dig your first CD (your debut), 
And â??Society of People Named Elihu.â?? 
And â??Making Loveâ?? is fresh, this much is true, 
But â??Redefining Musicâ?? is funky and new. 
And so I crank it up, turn it up, 
And pump up the bass. 
The package's synth lines are up in my face. 
I listen to it when I drive any place. 
Up yours to anyone who says I've got bad taste! 
Atom's music rocks, with nerdy soul. 
His new-wave-synth-punk is never dull. 

CHORUS
Atom, you're awesome. 

I had a dream 
When I was in grade school 
That Rob Halford, he kissed me, see fool. 
And I was welcomed to the family with Connor, 
It was undercover funny just like a longer 
Keyboard that Enya played. 
So I pumped iron and I got paid 
When I owned the Redskins 
With the Ghetto Boys, 
Breaking down the walls with kilogram toys. 
And we sang to Madonna, all night long, 
I opened up my heart, I opened it strong 
To Tim Allen, who's not that funny, 
In Philadelphia where I made lots of money 
As a goalie, sixteen-hundred pounds. 
Chillling on the ice rink so profound, 
Upside down from here on the map, 
Sick of people who give me crap. 
So I put them on an island in the middle of the sea, 
And it was just Atom, Atom and me.

Roses are red, violets are blue. 
My rhymes rhyme, but yours don't. 

Hey! I'm all up in your face like a rabid chimp, 
I'll eat shrimp on a blimp but I ain't no wimp. 
I send American flags to Ho Chi Minh, 
And Bart Simpson toys to Sam Kinison. 
If you're akin to sin, you may just win, 
Unless you buy a condom that's made of lamb skin. 
I'm down with you of course and your friend Ian, 
Although half of this rap is Indo European. 
I translated it so it would make sense 
To all you ladies and gents but there's no evidence 
If I'm going too fast or if I'm going too slow. 
You can always press""repeatâ?? on this funky fresh flow. 
Though you may not even know if I mean what I say, 
It's legit when I tell you this homey don't play. 
So sit back and relax and pop open a Coke, 
Compared to me, 50 Cent, your rhymes are a joke. 

[Chorus] 

Word, word, word to your mother and your father too, 
And props to anyone who keeps staying true. 
And shout outs to my homeys across the globe, accept diversity but diss a homophobe. 
The only way to understanding is to embrace the truth, 
We're all creatures of God, Buddha, Allah, and Zeus. 
We're only here for a bit, so make the best of it. 
Don't look back in sixty years 
To see your life wasâ?¦ garbage! 
But the point I'm trying to make is that 
My flows are so def like a big milkshake. 
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast, 
But the Sugarhill Gang is misquoted the most. 

[Chorus] 

So get this point right here, it's perfect clear, 
Props to anyone who bought""Nothing to Fear.â?? 
Shout outs to Wesley Willis, Atom G., and John Hall. 
Word to MC Paul Barman, hey return my call! 
What's up to Jerry Garcia, Hendrix, Morrison and Zappa, 
Word to Devo,""Weird Al,â?? and those girls from Abba.

I ripped one track in .mp3, ""ill Lars Ulrich came after me.

My generation sat the mecca of malls, Times Square, I'm there, Viacom installs.
So we hit the net while the Trade Center fell, New York met Hollywood, we ran like hell.
No Vietnam for us, yo, Iraq it's on. So who agree upon this cowboy Genghis Khan?
The choice made, baby. Hey we'd take it back, logged in dropped out, MTV took track.
They sold it back to us and claimed no correlation. The iMac, iPod, iGeneration.
And I'm waiting for the day we can get out. The world is ours, that's the story no doubt.
Want to be more info super highway traffic, want to be more than a walking demographic!

CHORUS
""Hey! You're part of it."" Talking about the iGeneration.
""Yeah! You're part of it."" Talking about my iGeneration.

See the iGeneration knew organization meant optimization and unification,
When imagination gave participation in creation of culture a manifestation.
The Berlin Wall fell and out we came, the post-Cold War kids laid claim to AIM.
LOL, OMG, yo, BRB. Space, colon, dash, closed parenthesis.
We sat at our laptops and typed away, and found that we each had something to say.
Web-logged our fears, our hopes and dreams. Individuated by digital means.
Fiber optic lenses, DVD, Coca Cola, Disney and Mickey D's.
Flat mass culture, the norm that took holdÉ I hope I die before I get sold.

We're taking this back, way back, nineteenth century style.

[Chorus]
Who's that (who's that) rapping?
Who's that rapping at my chamber door?
Mr. (mister) Raven!
All up in my grill like, ""Nevermore.""

Kick it! Once upon a midnight dreary, while I kicked it weak and weary,
Dark and cold just like Lake Eerie, Brand New sample, someone clear me.
While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping.
Up like, ""What?"", this thunder clapping in my brain like graphic Halflings.
Staffing me, I put down Milton. Cell phone mute like Paris Hilton.
Open window, halfway built-in. Times a changing like Bob Dylan.
Twenty-pound bird black as could be, cold feet cold eyes aimed straight at me.
Grim face, grim stare, death carnivore, quote that raven ""Nevermore.""

[Chorus]

I miss Lenore, my Annabel Lee, taken by angels from me.
Alone with books (hey that's me!), harbinger of death visiting me.
I said, ""Can I help you, evil prophet? If you got a problem, look, I'll solve it.""
He checked my hook, DJ revolved it, perched on Pallas, chalice dropped it.
""Tell me sir, please, if you can. Am I good or evil man?
What can I say, what can I do, when will I be rid of you?""
""Nevermore,"" quote he at me, hating on this fresh MC,
Satanic raven, Niche glee, killing me softly like the Fugees.
Now I feel worse, my verse is terse, joy inverse just like Fred Durst.
Call a nurse, disperse my thirst put this process in reverse.
Wish I'd had some warning first, MC Lars, '88 hearse.
Now I'll never be Slug or Murs, under that black raven's curse.
The ravens eyes still have the seeming of a demon that is dreaming,
Lamplight over him still streaming, hear my screaming, hear me screaming!
My soul still floats there on that floor and shall be lifted nevermore.
Afflicted calm, like Michael Moore, canonized piece, US folklore.

MC Lars,"Once upon a time, in the city of Los Angeles...
""Marty, Marty listen to me. Bring me something the kids will cry for.
Get out there, and get us stoked!""

Meet Marty, major label A&R scout, forty years old, gut hanginh out.
Red Ferrari, Marty livinh in L.A. bumps another line to get through the day.
Dumped by his girl, he paid for her liposuction,
His friends call him ""Money"", in his introduction.
And Marty knows nothing but claims to know it all,
Lose the flat screen TV if he drops the ball.
You're as good as your last hit, find the next big thing.
If he doesn't bring the bling, his cell phone won't ring.
What's the trend, what's new? What's a label scout to do? Office life, Marty 11:32.
The label pres. calls and yells, ""Sign more emo!""
How about screamo? ""If it sells, sign Nemo,""
""We're down 2%, and BMG knows,
My Daughter likes Dashboard, so get me one of those!""
He checks AP.net, the Scout and more,
yelling band names to his assistant through the door.
The kids like this, who cares if it's great?
So he signs a band called Hearts that Hate.

""Marty... we've got a hit.""

I won't let you die tonight.
Cry tonight. My heart's in your hands.
I won't let you...

Marty sees a girl in a Simple Plan shirt with a Senses Fail boy, that'll never work.
He finds his label friends in the corner they huddle,
An emo cattle auction, they penetrate the bubble.
They talk about Victory and signing TBS,
Dissing the same bands they just tried to impress.
So the lights go down, the crowd starts to scream,
Hearts that Hate have hit the scene.
Blake on vocals, and lead guitar,
He does a backflip, ""Look how different we are!""
They show up at the studio to record it,
A TRL, Billboard Modern Rock hit.
They auto-tune Blake, but he can't tell.
He says, ""I've got perfect pitch, damn I sing well.""
ProTools, Logic, cut, copy, paste, quantized solos and quantized bass.
Signed, sealed, deliver and sent, across the U.S. and the single went...

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Momentum builds, but it all caves in.
Industrial comes back, the pres. needs a NIN.
Marty finds a new band called ""Fetal Coil""
And Hearts that Hate try to keep their fans loyal.
They re-work their sound for album number two,
As ""Machines of Hate,"" but their career is through.
They break up and work pushing mops and brooms,
Blake gives guitar lessons in his living room.
Blake gives guitar lessons in his living room,
Blake gives guitar lessons in his living room.

STAT-60 satisfies 2C, the math GER, not the one for me.
The Central Limit Theorem? Speak English.
The Sum of Squares? I don't need this.
But I'm positive, studying hard, gotta pass this, no holds barred.
But essay due last Thursday man, Moby Dick I understand.
Up 'till five in the library, Meyer Lair, kind of scary.
Asleep at eight then up at ten, missed the lecture can't pretend,
I get the null hypothesis... on Tuesday's test, I was dissed.

Got STAT-60 on my mind,
In my notes and in my rhymes.
Chi-squared values all the time,
Easy quarter? Not this time.

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated, Professor Thomas?
Never are the quiz score grades ever inflated, but you taught this:
You get involved in radio, work really hard, get your own show.
But whoops, you slip, and play a track, uncensored as matter of fact.
The FCC gets on your back, the station manager says it's whack.
The probability that you'll loose your show on 90.1? 1.0.
Let's say that you're late for class, racing down peddling fast.
You live in A, class is at be	, integrate time and velocity.
The probability that you'll crash your bike,
In White Plaza on the way to Psych, .34 on your cell phone, .85 if you hit a cone.

Got STAT-60 on my mind,
In my notes and in my rhymes.
Chi-squared values all the time,
Easy quarter? Not this time.

Let's say you meet this hot sophomore, she likes you, you can't ignore
X the months that you date, P the probability that it's great.
You break up but you still kiss, you're not discrete it's continuous.
Late night hook ups nebulous, thin line friendship no big fuss.
Weekly sessions on the phone, made the right choice, you're on your own.
Good to be single all alone, degrees of freedom you can't clone.
But calculate E of X, you're at a party you see your ex,
The probability that your heart breaks in 2
She's with someone new and it's not you.

Am I street enough for this? Sometimes I'm ""Paranoid"" like Ozzy.
See it used to be punk rock for about four years,
I played lead guitar, we dissed Britney Spears,
Amphoteric the name, Central Cali band,
Local shows, t-shirts, EP's, no plan,
Just chilling with the crew slamming power chords,
They wanted more guitars but I got bored.

My brain on the keyboard and I'll try to resume,
Such a great story that I'll always behold,
I'll look back on this when I'm 80 years old.
London, New York, UK tour, NY demo,
Tickled as can be, when I tickle you like Elmo.
So much to say, new sounds to try,
Laptop, costumes, local buzz, and why?
Don't ask me, buddy, but you're bumpin' me now!
Amalgam for the future revolution like Mao.
You're right when I grab the mike, I do what I like,
I sit with a pen by the full moon light.
Euphonic epiphany like Keat's lyre trope,
I am it, iambic's rap's last hope.
My Grandma says I have rhyme talent, and I love her.
I flow lethal, Weapon? Lyrical like Danny Glover.
I flip your paradigm manhole cover,
Mutant reptiles, surprised what you discover.
But I still like Bob Dylan more than any MC.

Reverse them like Pi when they step to me

To run for governor before he died
He lived in California but traveled worldwide
It was a big huge hit! Just kidding I lied
There's the song about the 90's, I sampled Ace of Base
But kept it off the album in the interest of taste
“Cheyenne Rock City,” a song about touring
But rhymes about Wyoming are really very boring
As for the Churchill song, give me a break!
How many songs about England could my listeners take?
There was a track about women and the drama they bring
“Hot Girls Make Guys Do Really Stupid Things”
Remember “Geeked Out”? You don't but I do,

Called “College Is Where Girls Go to Get Fat”

But the mash-up thing was so 2002
I did an anti-Bush track, and then I did five more
But “Rock Against Bush” was so 2004
I wrote a song about China, how could I go wrong?
I rapped in Cantonese about Mao Zedong
It went um goy, neh ho ma?
Nehih sik ying mun ma?

So profound when he shrieks like a little sailor clown

They said our boat would be our tomb
Near the Mariana Trench, deep and oceanic
We spotted Moby Dick so white and titanic

You don't need a million dollars to launch a career 
If your style is unique and you practice what you preach 
Minor threat and jello both have things to teach 

I've got G5 production concept videos 
Touring with a laptop rocking packed shows 
The old-school major deal it makes no sense 
Indentured servitude the costs are too immense 

Their finger's in the dam but the crack keeps on growing 
Can't sell bottled water when it's freely flowing 
Record sales slipping down 8 percent

Changed the terrain it will never be the same 
Did you know in ten years labels won't exist? 
Goodbye DVDs and compact disks

MC Lars,"Internet relationships are not real
Your heart, people steal but identities conceal
So here's a tale of warning for girls and boys
Laptop computers can be dangerous toys

In the chat room, I inspect
Who's here tonight? ASL check
I'm 20/F from the UK
Send me an I'm and I?ll make your day

I'm twenty-two and my name is Daryl
Nice to meet you, Daryl, my name is Carol
What do you like Carol? I like to go to shows
I collect comic books and vintage clothes

What do you like? I like to skate
I play rock guitar but I'm not that great
I like to go on dates and I like to stay up late
I live in San Francisco and hangin' on the Haight

Do you like the Golden Gate? I did when I was eight
Maybe I can come and visit? Maybe you should wait
See, I'm really forty-seven, I have kids and a wife
I weigh three hundred pounds and I hate my life

Are you serious? Yes, well, I've got a secret too
I'm not twenty, I'm really thirty-two
I only have one leg and I like to sniff glue
You lied to me, Carol
Well, you lied to me too

It?s not normal to have an Internet girlfriend
Online relationships are just pretend
Unplug your heart, upgrade your system
Get, get off the Internet

Bob went on MySpace for hours a day
Talking to girls from Moscow to L.A.
But people can surprise you from behind a screen
Listen to this verse and you'll see what I mean

Hi, I'm Susie, I like your profile
I checked out your pics and I like your style
Sounds good, Susie, I?ll be your friend
We can write each other again and again

Comment on my pics and post on my page
Join my groups and guess my age
You must be eighteen, how could you not?
You can't be in high school, you're just too hot

Let me send you pics for your personal collection
I hope they inspire you and give you a smile
Susie sent Bob pics that were borderline obscene
Cops showed up at his door, she was only sixteen

It?s not normal to have an Internet girlfriend
Online relationships are just pretend
Unplug your heart, upgrade your system
Get, get off the Internet

If you don't believe, us here's a final story
About a boy named Marcus and his online girlfriend Lorie
Behind the monitor truth is hidden from your eyes
Marcus didn't know but he was in for a surprise

we've been dating for a while but let's cut to the chase
I don't know what you look like and I wanna see your face
But what does it matter? You know who I am inside
What if you're not a woman and this whole time you lied?

You got me there, I'm not really a female
I'm a guy who pretends to be a girl through email
So this is why it?s bad to meet women online
Living life behind the screen is a total waste of time

The following is an entirely fictional account.
Any similarities between people living or dead is entirely
Coincidental… just kidding.

She fell from the sky on a black October night
She wrote these funny songs and every one was tight
She asked me for advice on jump-starting her career
But I'm staring in her eyes as she's talking in my ear
Suburban rap queen, I wrote this song for you
Suburban rap queen, what's an MC to do?
Suburban rap queen, every Biggie needs a Kim
Suburban rap queen, sometimes you lose, sometimes you win

CHORUS
Rapgirl, Rapgirl, I like you a lot
You've got what it takes to rock that Lars emo spot
Rapgirl, Rapgirl, now tell me what to do
When the playback is too quiet and the
Song's already through

This is called a breakbeat!
It's the musical element hip-hop
Was founded on back in 1969.
That's educational.

She fell from the sky with a superhero icon
We battled in the studio like, “Hey, yo, is this mic on?”
I went down for the count, she went up on the beat
I told her she was hot because stuff like that is sweet
She attacked me with her similes like killer bees at a park
I came back with a metaphor, an angry great white shark
The bass line that she struck threw me flat on my back
So I came back with a track in a lyrical attack

REPEAT CHORUS

Because girls are so confusing, and I guess they'll always be
I should just become a monk, resign to celibacy
Then I'd never have to worry about what a hug might mean
See these girls who want to be your friend
May be just what they seem
We had burritos in your dorm and talked about Dizzee Rascal
We wrote a song together, recorded it, and that's all
Romantic love is fear of waking up alone
In Redwood City with platonic voice mail on your phone

[Intro, MC Nate]
hey, welcome to the orientation
my name's Nate and I'll be your homie for this year
today we'll be moving into our dorms and building community
so go get your keys from the main office
come back,and get ready to meet your roommates
alright?
(alright alright alright)

He was the roommate from hell
He was the roommate from hell

[verse 1, MC Lars]
Satan was my roommate, so junior year was hell
he lacked social skills and had a pudgent smell
when your roommate is the devil it can be extremely wack
putting posters on the wall of Trapt and Nickelback
until the break of dawn he'd be mutilating sheep
it's 4 A.M. Satan, can you please go to sleep?
I can't have girls over when the dorm smells like Sterno
when did room 56 become Dante's Inferno?
he likes death and destruction, I like radio and art
he likes holding down Christians and reading (?)
while I'm going class studying my notes
he's eating baby fetuses and sacrificing goats
he tricks the freshmen girls into eating apples
holding black masses down at the campus chapel
should of never moved in (but no) wished I were dead
should of found a place off campus on Craig's List instead

[chorus]
he was the roommate from hell
his name was Lucifier
someone call a priest
and bring the crucifer
he was the roommate from hell
leaves his pitchfork in my bed
I'm in a satanic panic
cuz he is messing with my head

[repeat chorus]

(yo)
(wut)
(pass the dope helium over here yo)
(okay, but wait... Satan, that's too much!)

[verse 2, mcchris]
boy you need a bitch slap, not my fault we're mismatched
you geek out over Beakman's World, I dig out World of Witchcraft
you thinkin' that I'm riff-raff, huffin' on a dishrag
I am just a player, play Slayer then I kick back
I know I reek of sulfer, leave the shower curtain open
I come home drunk, make crank calls to (?)
but college is like Salem, all these bitches be so smokin'
if you're thinkin' that I'm leavin' then I'm thinkin' that you're jokin'
I gotta share my bong with this post-punk chump
(?) says you've been through all my stuff
""I wish you'd go to hell"", I say ""hey that's where I'm from""
blast Death Cab and Devo, he's too emo to get crunk
I was a very nice boss down in Paradise Lost
I have very nice bling cuz my minions (?)
colleges is knowledge at a very high cost
gotta go do some blow with that ho Kate Moss

MC Lars,"Move over Kevin Bacon, ‘cause I've got a new game
It's called “Six Degrees of Kurt Cobain”
The man was an icon of Generation X
A sound between Joy Division and NOFX (what?)
Let's dissect this album called “Nevermind”
Produced by Butch Vig of Garbage not Sublime
Butch toured with U2, who wrote a song called “Bad,”
Just like Michael Jackson, this next part is rad
“Weird Al” made fun of “Bad,” and Nirvana too
It brings us back to Kurt (here we go) (round two)
Kurt was in a band with Mr. Dave Grohl
Dave was in Scream, that's the band not the movie
Courtney loved to scream for a band called Hole
She married Kurt Cobain and had a troubled soul
Some people said she killed him, but that could be a lie
Kurt wrote a song called “I Hate Myself and Want to Die”
Courtney Love landed “Man on the Moon”
Where Jim Carrey sang a song
From the Mighty Mouse cartoon
Danger Mouse not Mighty Mouse worked with the Beatles
He mixed them with Jay Z the whole thing was illegal
Speaking of illegal Jack White did some time
He hit another guy and assault is a crime
So “Get Behind Me Satan” was loved by Rolling Stone
Which leaves us with a cover: Kurt Cobain all alone.

You can take away my space ship
You can take away my space suit
You can even take away my space lasers
But you can never, ever take away my space game
I broke through the carbonite that's how I got free
Jabba, back up, because there's no stopping me
Post-modern player, sample-tastic.
Flow's ekphrastic, I get drastic
Hey, watch the plastic, yo, I name check
And leave you drowned in space oobleck
Player of the future, watch me go!
Sith girls scream when they hear my flow
These alien chicks reproduce with spores
So I go where no MC has gone before
Hey Fry, look, we can still be friends
I won't ask Leela out again. Sci-fi, I try, I fly solo
Shoot your landspeeder up just like Bolo
“What's with Lars, and what's with his name?”
Never mind that ish, ‘cause I've got space game!

Q can't stop me (I'm on fire tonight)
Even Hal can't stop me (I'm on fire tonight)

Because I've got space game and it feels all right
In 2112, all the players play on
Everyone bumps Rush and that “Tom Sawyer” song
I took the red pill, and high fived Neo
Hey what should I sample? “If it sells pick Dio!”
Yo Morpheus, look, you're a real cyber punk
But your friend Trinity has junk in the trunk
And I'm from Mars, and she's from Venus
She has ovaries and I have a light saber
‘Cause I get more play than Captain Kirk
He found out and went berserk like a jealous jerk
But no puny Vulcan death grip can paralyze me
I said beam me up Scotty, and then I got free
Princess Leia said that my flows are tight
So I said I supposed she can spend the night
A long time ago in a galaxy far away…

This song is futuristic, so hardcore
Hey T.S. Eliot! Please shut the door
Because modernism is so passé
The postmodern revolution is here to stay
In the house tonight because of Frank Lloyd Wright
The bass goes “boom!” like dynamite
“Yo, Wright was a modernist!”
Yeah I know that, all right,
But you can't rhyme “Bob Venturi' with “dynamite”
See it's Guernica Part II when I storm the stage
I draw fans like Warhol draws soup cans on the page
Did I say postmodern? Well, that was a lie!
I've been post-postmodern since junior high

Virginia Wolfe can't stop me (I'm on fire tonight)
Joseph Conrad can't stop me (I'm on fire tonight)
I excite the modern mind like a ray of light

like Game Cube and listening to pop punk bands
There's pizza boxes stacked in the living room

No mops, no brooms, and no vacuums
Open the fridge and you might see
Half a Mr. Pibb and some moldy cheese
Upstairs the toilet barely works
That's just one of the many perks

To figure out how to work his upstairs shower

But every time a tour rolls by, you know we'll stay at

MC Lars,"I met her in the thrift shop
Bumping indie hip hop
Calculator wrist watch
Shins t-shirt and flip flops

Queen of the hipster scene
Straight out of Vice magazine
Social outcast at sixteen
But now she lives her Boho dream

She came from Omaha to Williamsburg
She loved Karen O and she had heard
That Brooklyn was the hipster mecca
Packed her bags with her friend Rebeka

Said she had a thing for broke dudes in bands
Who lived by Union or by Grand
So we went down to the Bedford Bar
And bought a six dollar PBR

Hipster girl
Cool by the numbers and she rocks my world
Knows all the indie bands you've never heard
She's my hipster girl

She thinks uncool stuff is mad cool
Indie culture's fad rule
But cool stuff is uncool, right?
That's why Friday's Jewel night

She reads books no one has read
Laughs at jokes no one has said
So ironic with her taste
Her whole life is cut and paste

It's a metro sexual romance
She wears my shirts and I wear her pants
We play dodge ball, kid sports are cool
Watching Spank Rock and McCarren Park Pool

She's my trust fund baby bohemian
Her vegan humus keeps her thin
I love my L-Train girl, it's true
She always goes down on the weekends too

Hipster girl
Cool by the numbers and she rocks my world
Knows all the indie bands you've never heard
She's my hipster girl

Donnie Darko makes no sense
Your fixed gear bike makes no sense
Donnie Darko makes no sense
L train girls don't make sense
(I don't get it, I don't get it)

Hipster girl
Cool by the numbers and she rocks my world
Knows all the indie bands you've never heard
She's my hipster girl

Hipster girl
She's got her latte and some spoken word
Ironic statements on her vintage shirts
She's my hipster girl

To save the whales but they got upset

When I told him what I did to his old-school beatles

Gotta separate plastics form the glass
Even though it's a pain the morning

(I'm going green) aerosol cans are terrible so I
Spread the word with spray painted signs
(I'm going green) love animals for real, you see me
Clubbing with baby seals
(I'm going green) bought a prius to save on gas
But I fly every weekend in first class

Santa claus's sleigh will need jetskis (it's not easy)
The polar bears might need sunscreen

To make my carbon footprint half as small
I wrote this song to express how I felt

Sad as ""Face of a Stranger""

Dad found me on the steps of the video arcade
Oprhan baby in a basket, seven pounds is all I weighed
And before I learned to walk well I'd mastered Donkey Kong
Q'bert, Final Fight, Master Blaster and Pong

Blindfolded, okay, yeah, I know it sounds adorable
But dollars signs in pop's eyes grew creepy and deplorable

He said, ""Play by the noises, follow the ding boing""
But can I walk the dog and do my homework?
First, collect coins

Kid, didn't I find you with a controller in hand?
Now why do you got to go and bring shame to your old man?
Same to your old fans, you were a child prodigy
Up on a milk crate at the cabinet, making cottage cheese

Out of anybody'd put a quarter on screen
My pride in you, extended like the limbs of Dhalsim
All green money motives must a back seat take
Put the textbooks down, I'm trying to make you great

Sad as ""Face of a Stranger""

Locked in the attic I was trained from my crib to the stroller
While dad beat me senseless with the NES controller
Kid, listen, I promise, it's for your own good
Wits that you've shown, should you level up? It's understood

I hadn't been out since '98 like Sega Saturn
I've been learning ten-hit combos and the speed run patterns
More play, less chatter, you're a champion, kid
Under your mattress there had better be some cartridges hid

Up up down down left right left right B A, mad scary
It's like Clockwork Orange meets Ray Bradbury
It's unnecessary to struggle, you're fated to win
But till you beat Bowser you stay strapped in

I wanna live a fun life, I've only seen the sun twice
I want real friends, dad, Nintendogs won't suffice
Why do you ask for nothing when the world could be yours?
Flesh and blood, fun's fleeting seek eternal high scores

I wanna go to school and clean my room
I don't wanna sit here playing Doom
Three, can't you see I need to go out and play, yo
Real sports like baseball, I'm sick of Halo

Then you're sick of the meaning of life at your age
Better try a little harder, you want to clear that stage
And step into the middle of an existence examined
Do it or you're grounded, make you play backgammon

Here's a list of things that I'd rather do
Than sitting home playing Super Smash Brothers with you
Eat peas, do the dishes, walk the dog, mow the lawn
Take your wii and shove it, I'm off pops, I'm gone, peace

Don't Joust with me, kid, I'll go Berzerk
After all of your talent, all of my hard work
All the winnings that you earn, you're celebrity too
You wanna put us on the streets like the TV movies do

MC Lars,"Billy built a robot in his parent's garage
Because he had a list of problems that he needed to solve
He said, ""I'm sick of the Hills, Laguna Beach is fake and whack
Let's party like it's '96 and bring the horn section back""

Back before Gwen Stefani started rapping with Pharrell
Gas cost one fifteen and Goldfinger could sell
When reality TV wasn't scripted or contrived
The brass was phat and bumpin' and the beats were all played live

See, Billy was obsessed with third wave ska
The Mighty Bosstones, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake
He'd seen them all
He longed for a time when even Bill Clinton played the sax
On the white house lawn and kids wore shades and checkered slacks

So Billy sits back in the class and labs
Put a notebook on his lap 'cause he plans a task
To make a giant robot, how's that?
And bring the real Orange County back

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's got a cannon on his shoulder and a laser in his hand
He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

The robot was completed and it opened up its eyes
Weighing seven hundred pounds and standing eight foot five
With his black coat, white shoes, black hat, set to attack
The robot headed to the hills to give those spoiled kids a smack

Christoph Leary got knocked flat as Billy bumped the Aquabats
He ripped out Mischa Barton's spine to crank Save Ferris and Sublime
He burnt down Heidi Montag's home and to blast the OC Supertones
His scream was smashing LC's head, ska is not dead

This gigantic robot kills
He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will
He's blasting bullets from his elbows, shooting missiles from his eyes
He's gonna win the day for Billy, take the OC by surprise

He'll make you do the Macarena as you rock your Tamagachi
With your Newton down in Woodstock playing Sega la-di-da-di
He brought the 90's back and then he freed Tibet
If you can't find his jam on Napster then the warehouse sells cassettes
(Old school)

Gigantic

He's gonna win the day for Billy, make the city understand

He's gonna come down the block, he's gonna fire at will

Still rocking Capcom hoodies and that dirty A's cap
I'm still repping Northern Cali, hella non-conformist
I toured with Gym Class Heroes and then they got
Ginormous

I've drawn a lot of comics and I've rocked a lot of

I saw nerdcore come and I saw nerdcore go
I did a track with mc chris, though I kind of whish I'd

He'd be like ""I want three grand for that verse or I'll
Sue"" (true)
I opened for T-Pain he had zero production
He made my drummer move his drums, gave his stage

Manager instructions (move your drums)
I DJ-ed Johnny Phillips wedding, Gerard Way was there
I'm like ""We have the same booking agent"", he's like
""ask me if I care?""
I met Weird Al, I met Flava Flav
I met DMC but the photo wouldn't save
I'm like ""Camera phones suck,"" he's like ""I know

MC Lyte,"We came here across the great divide
Into the city, slander all eyes
We found a great love as we fell inside
They could not touch us as we'd go by
I've seen you the first time in Trogny's bar
But I'll see you later, we'll talk of black
We'll meet up for sure, oh will we not?
Away from all of the friends that you've got
Oh no, oh no

I said don't call me sir
Just call me Joe
Don't call me lady
Just call me Joe
Don't call me mister
Oh, just call me Joe
Don't call me sweetheart
Just call me Joe

You wear the best clothes that I've ever seen
I've seen your light and your poetry 
And it's the best thing that there's ever been
You're both the beauty and the beast 
That's how it is and that's how it end
Into another city where you live far away
That's how it is and that's how it end
You've seen my face but you've never heard my name
Oh no, oh oh

Regards to you about our night this weekend and I'm giving you
Information, the leaves, the leaves they like your teeth.  Come on
I'm not going to force you now I had this, this annoying dream.  This
Technology of ours..there's this place that is ever so refined that
One one knows and a storm boomer with white light action..life is the
Shadow of a fish, multiple electrical systems you fly through, traffic
Lights that may open a door...a bunch of computer systems as clear as
A cut crystal painting...infinite selections as clear as a crystal
Show...weapons, tanks, lasers, and aircraft moving across the sky, and
Huge missles, nuclear warheads that stand out more than
Anything...ultimate satellites, spy cameras, infared sensors, you, you
Can hear the thunder and positive thnking and start to say: I'll make
More human development practices..you don't have to go and stop your
Field practices..such as human rights violations, yeah come up and see
Me sometime if you never ever want to intensify all communication,
Listen to what I'm not saying over and over...

You stole the beat, are you having fun
Now me and the Aud's gonna show you how it's done
You are what I label as a nerve plucker
You're plucking my nerves you MC sucker
I thought I oughta tell you, better yet warn
That I am like a stock and my word is bond
Like James, killing everybody in sight
The code's three-six, the name is Lyte
After this jam I really don't give a damn
'Cause I'mma run and tell your whole damn clan that you're a

You shoulda won a prize as a Rakim sound-alike
Here's a Milkbone, a sign of recognition
Don't turn away, I think you should listen close
Don't boast, you said you wasn't bragging
You fucking liar, you're chasin' a chuckwagon
The only way you learn you have to be taught
That if a beat is not for sale, then it can't be bought
When you leave the mic, you claim it's smoking
Unlike Rakim, you are a joke and I think you ought to stop
Before you get in too deep
'Cause with a sister like Lyte, yo I don't sleep

When I'm in a jam, with my homegirl Jill
My cousin Trey across the room with a posse of girls
So I step in the middle, shake it just a little
Wait for some female to step up and pop junk
Give my cousin a cue, treat the girl like a punk
Now I'm not trying to say that I'm into static
But yo if you cause it, yep, we gotta have it
'Cause I ain't going out like a sucker no way
So I sit around the way for you to make my day
We can go for the hands, better yet for the words
'Cause you'll be ignored, and at the same time I'll be heard
Throughout the city, the town and the country
The beat is funky, my rhyme is spunky
There is no delaying in the rhyme I'm saying
Neither are there flaws in what my DJ is playing

So sit back Jack, and listen to this, it's 10% dis
'Cause I'm just about ready to fly this fist against your lips

But I'll wait for the day or night that you approach
And I'mma serve and burn ya like a piece of toast
Pop you in the microwave and watch your head bubble
Your skin just crumble, a battle's no trouble
Get my homegirls Joanie and Kiki to get stupid
This thing called hip-hop, Lyte is ruling it
I hate to laugh in your face, but you're funny
Your beat, your rhyming, your timing, all crummy
On the topic of rapping, I should write a pamphlet better yet a booklet
Your rap is weak homegirl, and it's definitely crooked

Others write your rhymes while I write my own
I don't create a character when I'm on the microphone
I am myself, no games to be played
No script to be written, no scene to be made
I am the director, as far as you are concerned
You don't believe me, then you'll have to learn
This ain't as hard as MC Lyte can get
Matter of fact, you ain't seen nothing yet
So never let me step into a party hardy
Talk to some people and then hear from somebody
You wanna battle 'cause you know where I am
You don't wanna come in the ninties and see me at a jam when a 
Mic is handy, ten feet away
I stretch my arm like elastic, head like a magnet
Set assure, you know I don't play
When it comes down to it, the nitty gritty
For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity

MC Lyte,"This is Lyte, and I'm just here to say
That I choose to express my feelings this way
Always alone, either with a microphone
Or just plainly emphasize the tone of my voice
'Cause yo, I know I'm your choice
So when I am speaking, show your gratitude
While I am teaching, I have no attitude
I'm just here to get the job totally done
Eighty five percent work, fifteen percent fun
Sometimes I admit, I get so excited
Rhyme for rhyme, I just can't fight it
Can't stop the flow, it's just too persistent

(Big girls don't cry)
(Big girls don't cry)	

Can't stop the flow, it's just too persistent
The level is extremely low on my resistance
By you or any other I'll never be beaten at a
Rap meeting, in other words a battle
'Cause y'all, I'm like a farmer, and y'all's the cattle
Be a big girl about it, don't you start cryin'
That'll mean I made you weep without even tryin'
Lyte takes it like a big girl, I'm no jive girl
Comin' direct, tellin' you that I'm a live girl
I'm positive', you've heard this expression before
So next time you see Lyte shine through the door
Don't talk behind my back, confront me like a big girl

(Big girls don't cry)
(Big girls don't cry)	

Don't talk behind my back, confront me like a big girl
So I can take you to all slimmies of the world
Big girls, we don't fight over men
Although there's one worth fighting for every now and then
But then I think again, it's not worth my while
And it's also not a big girl style
And I know you're thinkin 'wait, Lyte is slim and short?'
While being brought up I was also taught
Take it like it comes and proceed with the flow
Lyte is the biggest of the big girls, and now you know

When I grab the mic it's never a bore
When I'm on stage, sayin' a rhyme
I often wonder what ya think of mine
Is it fresh or weak, or is it live or dead?
Yo, it's got ta be somethin' if you're boppin' your head
To the beat, can I get an amen brother?
Liked that rhyme? Well here goes another

Hold up, hold up, hold up
Check it out, before we go any further
We gotta announce who we are
I am DJ K-Rock and this is my homegirl, MC Lyte
Kick it for 'em!

We had to pause for station identification
Now ya know my name here's some more information
Well, let's see, what you wanna know about me?
MC L-Y-T-E
(The queen) Nah, that's too corny
(The sexy) Nah, that gets the guys too horny
(The best) Now that sounds conceited
But what is true is true, so it has to be repeated
The best is Lyte, when I'm on the mic
And MC's look straight ahead cos this pitch'll make your neck tired
And I say loosen up and relax
The fiction you been livin' I'mma fill with facts
Right now

Name of the group is Me and My DJ
Kickin' it live in '88

I am woman, hear me roar
Comin' out fresher and flyer than I did before
That's right, I'm well respected
Don't get stupid, I'm well protected
If ya wanna battle I'm well prepared
Me and K-Rock are far from scared, you know what
We're brave, livin' in a cave of gold
Waitin' for the misbehaved to get bold
But as I look around so far so good
MC's behaving just like they should
Hands are folded, no whispering or passing notes
All attention to me ya have to devote
I'm like a teacher, but then again not quite
'Cause a teacher's salary I'm makin' a night

Maybe that's why the name is Lyte

MC Lyte,"I used to be in love with this guy named Sam
I don't know why, cause he had the head like that of a clam
But you couldn't tell me nothin, 'cause Sam was number one
'Cause to me, oh my gosh, he was one in a million
I shoulda knew the consequences right from the start
That he'd use me for my money, and then break my heart
But like a fool in love I fell for his game
But I got mine, so I show no shame
In Empire winked his eye, and then he kept walkin'
And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin'
The roller disco where we all used to go
Just to have some fun back in 1981
You know the place, Empire Boulevard
Is where I first saw the nigga, and he tried to play hard
But I knew the deal, 'cause I knew his brother Jerry
And Sam, he just broke up with his girlfriend Terry
So Jerry introduced Sam and I that night
He said, ""Hello, my name is Sam"" I said, ""Hi, my name is Lyte""
We dipped and we dapped and we chit and we chat
About this and that, from sneakers to hats
He said, ""Look, I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me""
(Let's go) To my house, lay back and get nice
Watch television, Riunite On Ice
I said, ""Slow down, I know you wanna shake me down
But I'm not one of the girls to go rippin' around""

Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand you

Next month I finally went to his house
I walked into the door, there was a girl on the couch
I said, ""Who's the frog, the bump on the log?
You chump, you punk, how could you do me wrong?
Singing sad songs about your love is so strong""
You said, ""Wait Lyte, you're confused, the girl is my cousin""
Your brother agreed, but later she said that she wasn't

Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test

Forgotten, next month we went to the Deuce
Well, I thought it kinda strange 'cause you had lots of juice
You knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Asked ya how you met 'em, said you met 'em at a party
Then these girls tried to tell me you were sellin' the stuff
I said, ""It's not your business, so shut the fuck up""
They said, ""Okay Lyte, think what you wanna think
But it's gon' be some shit when your man becomes a fiend""
I said, ""Look, to bust a move, I don't even know you
To put it Lyte, I really don't care to""
They kinda got mad and sort of offended
They said, ""We only lookin' out for yo best interest""
I said, ""Thanks but no thanks"" in an aggravated tone
""When I wanna find out, I find out on my own""

Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand you

Then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named C
Well I'm clawin' my thoughts, I wonder who she could be
You're spending all your time with her and not a second with me
They say you spend your money on her and you're with her night and day
Her name starts with a C and it ends with a K
I strain' my brain lookin' for a name to fit this spellin'
But I just couldn't do it 'cause my heart kept yellin'
Burning, begging for affection from you, Sam
But just like a test I cram to understand you
Thought I knew you well enough to call you a man, but

Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand you

Then it came a time you started looking kinda thin
I asked you why, you said, ""Exercise, tryina stay slim""
I bought it, even though I knew it was a lie
'Cause it really didn't matter, you were still lookin' fly but oh no
Oh no, you started askin' me for money
Butter me up, beg me and call me your honey
So I gave you 2 yards, and then I gave you one more
You picked up your jacket and you flew out the door
You came back an hour later and you asked me for a ten
I said, ""I only got a twenty"", you said, ""Give me that, then""
I said, ""Nope, I'll tell you now, you better stop slobbin'
Find you a job, or you better start robbin""
So I stepped off with a giant step
Picked up my belongings, and I just left
And now I see you in Empire every Sunday
Juicin' the girls up for some money and a lay
But every time I see you doin' it, I just ruin it
Tell em how ya on crack, smoke, sniff, and chewin' it
And as for this girl, Miss C, oh well
I was shocked as hell when I heard, Samuel
When your homeboys told me, I almost went wack
That the girl you was addicted to, her name was Crack

To Saturday night, forty eight hours done, and I still hold the mic
I try to put you down and say that I'm through
But they give it back to me and say, continue
That's the thing about Brooklyn, they never get enough
Of the rap and the music and all the good stuff
That makes your life worth livin' for

When a girl walked up with a chrome microphone
She said, ""Hey, MC Lyte, I heard about you
So here's the microphone, let's see what you can do""
So I took the microphone and I threw it to the ground
'Cause I need no assist when it comes to gettin' down
When I start to rap, she start to shake
She knew to confront me was truly a mistake
So she picked the microphone off the grey concrete
And before I turned around, she was down the street

Now kick this one for Brooklyn
Kick this one for the nineties
Now kick this one here for me and my DJ

Now when I'm on the stage, everyone starts starin'
Is it what I'm sayin', or is it what I'm wearin'?
Fifty fifty chance it's what I'm sayin'
And at the same time what my deejay is playin'
If you can get hype and sort of like loud

Do you understand the metaphoric phrase 'Lyte as a Rock?'
It's explaining, how heavy the young lady is
You know what I'm saying King?

Yes my brother, but I would consider 'Lyte as a Rock'
a simile because of the usage of the word 'as'
And now directly from the planet of Brooklyn
MC Lyte as a Rock!

Must I say it again, I said it before
Move out the way when I'm comin through the door
Me, heavy?  As Lyte as a Rock
Guys watch, even some of girls clock
Step back, it ain't that type of party
No reply if you ain't somebody
Get out my face, don't want to hear no more
If you hate rejection, don't try to score
First base?  You ain't got what it takes

Pull back the microphone, let my arms unfold
Release all the anger, all the aggravation
Convert it into words just sorta like a conversation
I am the talker, you're just the listener
Talk and I'll ignore you, is it that offensive to you?
The problem is you can't understand
The logic in my rap you can't comprehend so you
Merely step aside, what all, call the weak
But you'll also step aside when I'm, comin' down the street
You'll give me lots of room, to whistle and walk
And then everything is silent just in case I wanna talk, but I
I never do, small talk I like to hear
Other girls rap and you say that I'm wack
Comin' from a female that is totally dedicated
Every rhyme I say you ought to appreciate it

Past experience from the future, is the best kind
Of advice that you could ever receive from another
Whether it's a stranger or your night time lover
Sorry silly rabbits, Trix are for kids
Brings back memories of the things that I did
Played jokes on suckers, just for fun
But now I'm much older, those days are done
Everything is business, forget about games you see 'cause 
Once I'm finished, you're gonna know my name is Lyte and in Brooklyn
Brooklyn's where I'm chillin'
Better known as the MC Villain
No I'm not good but I'm not bad either
Come into your life it can't get no liver

Listen up everybody, listen up everybody
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC

So now, competition is taken out of my vocabulary
I don't vary, I bury
Steppin' up is like diggin' your grave
So sucker MCs you ought to save
All the mess you be talkin', meanwhile hawkin'
When I'm on the stage, audience watchin'
Suckers in the corners just keep on clockin'
The way I hold the mic, the stance I use
The rhymes I recite and the beat I choose
But it's not your fault because you don't know better
You see green I wear you go buy the same sweater
You look me up and down sight the jeans name brand
You go to Macy's and for hours you stand
Online just to buy what you saw Lyte wearin'
Don't try to lie homegirl I caught you starin' 'cause yo
The beat is dope and the rhymes are kickin'
I'm the chickenhawk and you are the chicken

Listen up everybody, listen up everybody
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC
Listen up everybody, listen up everybody
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC
Listen up everybody, listen up, listen up
Listen up, everybody, it's Lyte Thee MC

You like a female MC who can handle the mike
How do I know? Because you told me so
You instantly prefer a pro to supervise the show
So that's why I'm here, don't mean to make a case of it
This rap here, well, it's just for the taste of it

You believe it too, that's why you never walk away

MC Lyte,"When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes to my head as just chit chatter
You may take this egostistical or just or worry free but
What you say I take none of it seriously, and
Even if I did I wouldn't tell you so
I'd let you pretend to read me and then you'll know
'Cause I hate when one attempts to analyze 
The fact that I despize those who even try
To look into my eyes to see what I am thinking
That dream is over you gotta sink it
And I tell all of you like I told all of them
What you say to me is just paper thin, word

I'm not the kind of girl to try to play a man out
I take the money and the gear and then break the hell out
No that's not my strategy, not the game I play
I admit I play game but it's not done that way
Truly when I get involved I give it my heart
I mean my mind, my soul, my body I mean every part
But if it doesn't work out, yo it just doesn't
It wasn't meant to be you know, it just wasn't
So I treat all of you like I treat all of them
And what you say to me is still paper thin

In one ear and right out the other
hurt is mumbo jumbo lover
I don't pay attention I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait that it takes to hook this
Sucker you missed, I put feelings aside I know who I am
My name is Lyte is your name Sam?
'Cause if it is step off, grab your coat and get lost
Wrap your scarf around your throat and go back and catch a rope and hit the road Sam
Don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Sam, don't you come back no more

So now I take precaution when choosing my mate
I do not touch until the third or fourth date
Then maybe we'll kiss on the fifth or sixth
Time to be me 
'Cause a date without a kiss is so incomplete
And then maybe I'll let you play with my feet
You could suck the big toe and play with the middle
It's so simple unlike a riddle
It's as easy as counting to 1-2-3
In other terms, letters L-why-T-E
I'll tell you, you, you and all of you

MC Lyte,"It was a café
It was a café on the westside
It was a café on
It was a café on the westside, midtown

It was a café on the westside, midtown
Said they had the best cap of cappucino around
So I stepped in, and I ordered a cup
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said, ""Shut the fuck up!""
And I did, pronto, quick fast
How much longer would the torture last?
In the wrong place, at the wrong time
It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind
Death, it was gettin closer, right behind my back
Ready to attack
I got shot in a shoot-out, and then I died
I could feel it, I was on the other side
In between lives, I'm so confused
What do I do, oh, what do I do?
But was it really time for me to go?
Why, oh why did I need cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need cappucino?

Why, oh why did I need cappucino?
But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends
That I knew in a past life, way back when
A couple had died in a drug world
And this one guy died fightin over his girl
Another died drivin while intoxicated
Why do people make livin so complicated?
But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary
Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her
But she wouldn't listen, no one listens
I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream
Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream
So glad to be given - my life back
So good to be livin - or is dead better?
I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs
And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs
I didn't have to worry about fallin from a plane
But at this café was death still callin my name?
Or did this café even exist?
And was my name just another on the death list?
I knew it couldn't happen, even though
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of cappucino...

Cappucino
Cappucino

Bust it, to some of you that really don't know
I break it down to you, the word 'cappucino'
It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light
They charge you 3 dollars, you ask is it worth it?
But when you start drinkin... shit, it'd be workin
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best
But if everytime I drink I voyage through death
I leave it alone and just stick to tea
Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me

Why, oh why did I need cappucino?
Cappucino
Why, oh why did I need cappucino?

You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide 'cause you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-why-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light?  It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

Examine the style used in this sequence
The rhyme's the clue, the record's evidence
To the fact that I'm hypin this episode
Cold carryin the extra wide load

The beat is fat and the rhyme is thick
All over the town you hear the sound and pick
Me, the L the why the t the e
Me, and if you see the Rock, I'm sure you'll see

Me (Hey Lyte, what will you be doin?)
Kickin it, bashin down competition
And when I drop the bomb, you'll listen
Boom! Now that I've got your attention

I'm slammin what you want to hear
I just thought that I should mention
'89 is the Lyte year
Now's the time to roll like a rhinoceros

Step to Lyte, that's preposterous
I'm heavyweight, though I'm lightweight
My looks the hook, my rhymes the bait
And when I throw the line you proceed to take

The goody, the treat that I hand you
That you couldn't refuse
Damn, I cram to understand you
Your love is to Lyte to lose

[Verse 2]
I think you deserve this, you waited long enough
For a rhyme that's super-duper extra tough
Every human is lurkin and loomin
Puba on the beat and you know the shit is boomin

Tasty like pastry, fresh from the bakery
First Priority, that's the way it has to be
Feel the drum, I bet it makes your body numb
One for all, and all for one I bet you come

Hurry, hurry, step right up and see the show
MC Lyte and K-Rock are about to throw
Get on line and purchase your ticket
(Hey, don't worry) Lyte is gonna kick it

(Go on, be happy) I put you up on the scoop
Now come and watch the party hoop

[Verse 3]
I am the Lyte, and it is time for me to go
You want to beef, save that shit for the toilet bowl
I use styles, styles and much many styles
I leave smiles, smiles and much many smiles

On the people who come to see the Lyte perform
(Word is bond)
The rhyme will kick as the brain will tick
You can tell because the record'll sell

Old styles and new styles formatted together
Bold or dull, so it doesn't matter whether
Which comes first or vice-a versa
It won't make a difference, as long as you rehearse-a

Get it down pat, and come right and exact
MC Lyte is comin right and I'ma say goodnight

A friend of mine (Which one?) Cecilia
(Yeah?) has a man (so?) a dealer
(Which one?) Born - Born Supreme
You know the type (Yeah, I know what you mean)
Gold and cars (cars and gold
The more he got, yo, the more he sold
He told her he loved her (Huh, gased her head)
Her love he bought just to warm his bed
I tried to tell her, but it went out the other ear
She didn't want to hear, what I had to say
She just replied this way
(Girl, I love him, he treats me so good
He gets much respect in my neighborhood)
I cram to understand why she wants this man
(Yo, he sold the crack to Sam...)

[ CHORUS ]
	(I used to be in love...)	
	But not with a dealer
	(I used to be in love...)
	I know how it feels
	(I used to be in love...)
	You make love while he makes deals

The story gets worse, they threaten her life
A guy walked on her (Yo, come here) with a knife
And said (Being with Born is a big mistake
It's a shame your life I have to take
If you leave him now, you'll be alright
If not, you won't make it through the night)
She came to me and said (Lyte, what do I do?)
Forget about Born, or else you're through (Ahh...)
She said (But, but I love him!) Hm, I wonder
Is love worth bein six feet under?
Nope (And that's on the real tip)
I think it's time you skip
Town (Hey girl, don't hang around
Or else you'll be goin -)

[ CHORUS ]

Miss see said (No, I'm stayin with my man
He stands by me, so I too must stand)
Girl, you're stupid, you're gonna take a fall
( *phone rings* ) and then she received a call 
(Hello? Listen, baby, they got a contract on me
I know because Brian warned me
I'm outta here, goin back to Cali
Grab your stuff and meet me in the alley)
She grabbed her stuff, the gold and the cash
Headed for the door in a flash
She said (I'm outta here) Now wait just a minute
You know he's a dealer, his windows are tinted
(Naw) He has truck jewelry, and no job
(So?) Carries ducats in ??? (So what?)
Now hell the hell does he get these things?
(I don't know!) The Gucci, the Louis, the Polo rings
(Yeah?) Dealers are bad news, take it from Lyte
They say they kill you, and they might
(You're right, Lyte, you tell no lie
Just let me go say good-bye)
She ran down the stairs in a minute or more
I heard a thunderous roar
( *shots* ) Born and Cecilia - killed by Uzis
See why it pays to be choosy?

I met a guy named Tommy, damn, he charmed me
Met him at the mall, but I knew he wouldn't harm me
We exchanged numbers, hopin to meet again
We couldn't wait for the romance to begin
The relationship grew strong
I didn't want to be right if this love was wrong
But oh no, came the problems, the first segment
The dumb kid went and got some girl pregnant
The second segment: started wheelin and dealin
Didn't give a damn about how Lyte was feelin
But then he got wise, started treatin me better
Cause all of his friends said I was a go-getter
He knew he was usin me, and abusin me
He also knew that soon he'd be losin me
First I clocked him, yeah, I docked him
But I rocked him - and then I dropped him

[ VERSE 2 ]
Then there was Dave, couldn't behave
So I punished him and put him in my Lyte-as-a-rock cave
Then he got bold, tried to play insane
So Bigfoot threw him off my paperthin train
He tried to 10%-dis me, but he pissed me off
Cause I'm the boss, and you know I'm not havin it
Lyte is too dope, and you know I ain't crabbin it
Then there was Henry, way too friendly
I needed a trip, he said he would send me
Pay my airfare, if he could come with me
I said, ""Listen, honey, I don't need your money
Believe me when I tell you, I've got my own
Cause I'm MC Lyte on the microphone""

Here's another story: a dude named Corey
When I used to work, yes, I was a clerk
At the Worldtrade Center, back in high school
This little player musta thought I was a fool
He took me out to lunch, offered me a ride home
When we got there, he asked could he use my telephone
I said, ""Yeah, sure"", flipped him to the floor
Cause he said ""What's up?"" and tried to feel my butt
I kicked him down the stairs and said, ""What you're provin?""
Rolled him to his car and said, ""Get movin!""
He tried to score it, I wasn't goin for it
You can't play me, I'm Lyte Thee MC
Never saw his face again until last week
All beat up and bleedin down the street
I looked to my left, there was a girl with a pipe in her hand
Sayin, ""Why oh why can't you understand?""",Please Understand,1989

Shall I ease into the disses, go 20, then 30
Or shall I got straight to 80 percent?
Aw, it doesn't matter, when you're dissed, you're dissed

Sexin and suckin, yeah, that is your trade
Put on this earth just to distract me
Get those to write rhymes and try to attack me

You to step back, let the Lyte shine
Do not take shit till you write your own rhymes

Your mold is fake, crayola, crayon
Don't dare to sleep or even prey on
The Lyte is too wicked, too worthy, too strong
And the rhymes I create are made to last long
Let me wise you up, rappin isn't a sport
You either have to teach yourself, or you have to be taught
And being that you are not wise enough to do it on your own
The ones that write your rhymes might as well hold your microphone
Dropped a little vinyl, now you think you're large
Step aside, Lyte Thee MC is in charge
Don't sleep on me, I'm far, far, far from dumb
So roll correctly if you decide to come
MC sucker, this is what you waited for
I'm sick of the battle, let's go to war
Why do you challenge me, Lyte Thee MC
Did not you know that I am crazy?
My screws are quite loose, in fact I don't have any
But when it comes to rhymes, I've got many

Tear you up mentally, from limb to limb

I sensed it, predicted it, knew it would happen
You plopped off fast on the scene and start rappin
Now it is my duty, to all MC's
To ask you to go elsewhere, pronto, please
Now I was quite polite, nice I might add
But you insist on stayin, that makes me mad
But then again I don't mind, I've got someone to pick on
Write rhymes to diss and even play tricks on
You ain't really down, you wig-wearin clown
Burrowin money to buy an outfit
Not even good enough for a Sunday picnic
I ask you: do you know who you're fuckin with?
With those bubble gum jeans and those 2 for 1 skips
I'm MC Lyte a/k/a MC Payback
Payback is a bitch, and I'm givin you no slack

So Lyte made no attempt to strike back

Let me say next time that you feel pissed
I suggest that you don't try to diss

You better watch what you say to me, cause I can get evil
The things that I'm capable of are unbelievable
In 10% I popped your head in a microwave
I'm into blenders now, so you better behave
Or put you in a toaster, because you're gettin toasted
Better yet an oven, because you're gettin roasted
Don't listen to your rhyme writers, cause yo, they souped you
You ain't dope, you can't cope, they musta dooked you
You musta had some wack crack (real wack crack)
Sent you on a mission, and now you're comin back
But let me school ya, Lyte is runnin this show

I never lose a battle, cause I always come correct
In any case I win, again and again
You see Lyte is at the top till the very end
And even though I may be short, believe, I don't take none
Try your luck and we'll see who will get done
I mean immediately, like quick fast
Don't turn your back, cause this mic'll be in your ass
And don't take what I say too lightly
I beat you, defeat you so quietly
Sneak up and hit you like a fuckin tornado
Cause in the rap field Lyte's the fuckin a/k/a doe

Shit, give me room and I'll slay an MC
Whether it's in a crowd, or on the sneak tip
I wax you and your posse watch you trip and flip
As you drop the mic, cause you don't have the gift

You was at my show, yo, you was on a mission

No show, you hoe, no work, you jerk
(Cool, Lyte, I think her feelings are hurt)
Alright, I'll chill and I'll come to my senses
But next time you diss, think of the consequences
Yo, I am no joke, I'm sharp like barbwire
Try to touch me, yo, you're bound to catch a fire
I never lose my cool, but if I do, yo, you're lost
I be forced to show and prove exactly who's the boss
Who gets the income - and then some
I don't diss you for the money, I diss you for the fun
Don't get mad, it's just a talent I was given
What I'm sayin, I'm a slave to the rhythm

[ VERSE 3 ]
It took a whole album for you to try and diss me
And ha-ha-ha, slum bitch, you still missed me
But yo, I'm off the dissin tip, cause that takes no creation
I'm into other things that bring me commodation
So I rap about funny things, or issues that are serious
Sometimes I rap a topic that leave my people curious
And other times I diss to put one in their place
If I diss you on wax, then I will diss you to your face
Some say I'm foul, and they don't like the way I'm livin
But yo, ask me if I care...
I'm just a slave, I'm just a slave, I'm just a slave 
To the goddamn rhythm

(They call me Lyte)
(And I'm a slave to the rhythm)

(Funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to party)

'Gangstress', don't make me laugh
Ha-ha-ha
And keep your eyes on this
And keep your eyes on THIS

I'm rhymin and designin, also creatin
The dope def rhyme that is always being taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me
No trait of originality
But yo, I am not one to down another
So like I said before, just go for yours, sucker
I'm gonna take the time to drop a dope line
Or maybe even two, for you and your crew
So you can start shakin and movin all around
To the Lyte Thee MC and the King Of Chill sound
It's new and improved like a freshly cut diamond
Perfect timin, like a gem it's shinin
Or better yet a ruby, somewhat like a saphire

Drink and drive, yeah, you're probably safer
Cause when I start, I never give slack
You feel like a 'kick me' sign was pinned to your back
Yes I'm the super-duper with the roper-doper
Got the clean drawers on, yeah, I hope ya
Do, because I'm gonna strip you of your peace of mind
Now your piece is mine, damn, that's unkind
Come on, admit it, the Lyte is too fly
The rhymes that I say you can't deny
Because 100% is what I give it (Say what?) 
I haunt the house with the hip-hop spirit
I tear it, repair it
Like a hand-me-down make you wear it
Save all your crocodile tears, grin and bear it
And with all your other brothers you're gonna share it
You hear me, junior? Cause soon you'll
Be a grown man with the mic in your hand
Adn understand biting's not part of the plan
That's wrong, I thought I taught you better than that

You'll be the last coockoo to fly over the nest
Try to dis this? Nah..
You'll be the only scarface in the place
Cause I'll rip out your eyes, cut your tongue off
You can't talk no more and let the bullshit walk
In this lifetime you're no MC
You're just labelled in bold black ink as a want to-be
Now that I pulled your card and I read you
I should punish those that misled you
Into thinkin that you was just too good

When talent was given out, they overlooked ya

Because I'm hypin my rhyme to a new hype

[ verse 1: mc lyte ]
Never does one know the force that is in them
Till some puss jumps up and offends them
Then I have to subtract, minus and eliminate
Those that try to front and try to perpetrate
Like they know me well when they don't know me at all
Sayin 'hi', 'how you're doin' and 'I'll give you a call'
Then, to top it off, sayin they'll visit
When they don't know the zip code, much less the digits
Like shelly says, sometimes you have to get kuffed
Like mc lyte says, yo, you're gonna get buffed
Each and every time you try to play me
I'm not the egg to be cracked, the digem to be smacked
So when I see you, you better be fully strapped
At all times, cause it only takes lyte one time, and one time only
I'm the microphone controller, mc sucker folder
Lyte'll take you places you never would've seen
If it was dark - you know what I mean?
So show appreciation, gratitude, it is necessary
Cause when I hear weak rhymes, I am quick to bury
Those who try to know me before they meet me
You can't grow on me, so don't greet me
I'm sick of the prentendin and all the make-believe
Pronto, move back, give me space to breathe
I'm not a push-over, so don't push up on me
I'm not a sidewalk, so don't try to walk on me
I seen people taken advantage of
In situations like money, trust and love
I have no time for petty things that are trivial
Like who'll dance with me if I can't dance
I'm not a dancer, that's what leg 1 and 2 are for
I master the rhyme, that's what I get paid for
They say two extras, yo, it's all in the rhyme
And if you look hard, you can see I work overtime
This is a warning, a due day is dawning
I thought I ought to tell you, so you can start mourning
So put your black on and your best black shoes
And keep your ears open, cause this is today's news
Extra, extra, read all about it
(it's about mc lyte!) the boy shouted
First time in history you thought to buy a paper
Cause I was on the inside picture on the cover
Oopsy daisy, I should be more modest
But hey, what can I say, I was brought up to be honest
Like a rican rides a caddy I'm with this beat, chief
The only time they complain is when it's too brief
But other than that they long for me to go on
On my birth certificate it states: 'star is born'
Sample up the sound if you will
Raps by lyte, production king of chill
So watch the solar system, never stop lookin
Cause up and on the rise is the planet brooklyn
You can compare me to crackers and cheese
But don't compare me to a sucker mc
See, cause crackers and cheese, yo, that shit is good
But sucker mc's ain't as good as they should
Be, see, they lack, so lyte must tax
Not much, just enough to see if they can move it
Show and prove to see that they can get into it
Try your best, a useful strategy
And after practice, if you're still raggedy
Then and only then can you be called a sucker mc
Sucker
I hate long good-bye's, so I'll just say farewell
Any last comments, lyte fans do tell
I got you locked on, so now I'm gonna free ya
Okay, here we go, stop, see ya

I thought telling you this, you would be flattered
Well I guess I was wrong cause you still ain't widdit

But don't you dare touch me, you said you wasn't with it
You waited too long now, Lyte is not havin' it
I could of showed you things, taught you how to explore
My question is, what are you too young for?

And hot damn that excites the MC Lyte

'Cause yo I love a young buck, that give a firm {fuck}
But once in a while, they become lovestruck
But that's okay though, cause I can handle them
I love young boys on the brink, of being young men

I mold em, shape em, make em then I break em in
They get the job done, I make em get the job done
Well, swell, make em kiss and tell

You won't miss me, you know where to find me
And these words I will say finally
Never let age, restrict you from what you want to do
Whether you're young or ninety-two

Whenever I'm sad, feelin' bad

It was a date, a simple little fuckin' date
Or so I thought, wasn't that my great mistake?
He picked me up at eight from my crib
We went to dinner and he ordered Babyback Ribs

What a waste, a waste of the mind and body
And then he said, ""Lyte, would you like to go and party?""
I thought about it and then I said no
Pay for my food, motherfucker and let's go

He said, ""My, aren't we aggressive?""
Damn right and I'm also perceptive
I know your kind, you roam around the fuckin' town
You wanna slap it, flip it and rub it down

You want some booty but you're gettin' none this way
You better ask Suzy, Sally or that girl, Fay
You gets none, you hear me you cheesy rat?
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

I'm all that, yes, I'm all that
You ask how? I'm all that now
I'm all of that, yes, I'm all of that
And rollin' through your hood with a baseball bat

First I head out into the red eyed
Turn the AC on, so it feels cool inside
Step in the jam, baring good news
Although for some folks I bring the blues

Always solo, no relyin' on a posse
I see what you see, do you see what I see?
I see suckers, many pucker uppers
Asskissers as well as buttlickers

Many, many that will do me good and plenty
Don't know me from Adam but wanna get with me
Claimin' they will do or have done or have did me
Talkin' that yang, your ass'll get slapped
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

Yo, I just checked out Lyte's new cut
(That, that)
And, yo, it's all that, all that
Yo, I get with you, peace

Back, way back when shit wasn't funny
I'm talkin' L Q days, your golds and your money
If you wore gold the shit was gettin' taken
Hard rocks, don't even bother fakin'

'Cause they can sense a sucker as soon as they saw ya
And oh well, how I felt sorry for the
Razor in my pocket for my protection
Blackjack in my bag for a little selection

You got beef? Bitch, chose your weapon
I sliced and diced and then I kept steppin'
For me to go for that woulda just been whack
Because I'm Lyte and I'm havin' none of that

I'm all that, yes, I'm all that
You ask how? I'm all that now

Some say they don't like the words I choose to use
I don't give a damn, Lyte will never loose
I ain't no sucka and I ain't into pleasin'
Some critic that criticizes me for no reason

What's with the opinion it's a stated fact
I rule the pack, from the top of the stack
So fuck the stocks and bonds I'm your new investment
Pick up the album it's quite a refreshment

Compared to the day to day bullshit you hear
Pay attention and listen I'm comin' clear to the ear
For all you non believers and you perpetrators
That talk to me now but talk about me later

It's time for you to grieve, grovel in your sorrow
I'm the star of today and the star of tomorrow
I'm takin' out the old jacks, rippin' up the new ones
I don't care if it means I have to ruin

I will and I shall and I get the job completed
Those that don't belong they will be deleted
From the rap roster, I'm not an impostor
I'm comin' to you live with the forty five
Straight from the studio with a view in New York City

MC Lyte,"I got the charm and the wit of a pop hit
But I'm street, ""Catch the beat""
Don't drop it, just don't stop it
Don't you dare step off the topic
That I got a one-track mind and this track's all mind
The whole three four five six seven eight nine
In the pocket, bursting in the air are rockets
Creating lots of Lyte, get it?
How many different ways can I say it?
Piano Man, how many ways can you play it?
I spell it out, the L-why-T-E
Without a doubt, ""Got to be funky!""
And it damn sho' nuff is
It gotta be like that, in this rough biz
Of music, baby, use it or lose it
What's funky is funky, you can't refuse it
I got a grip on the groove and it won't move
An inch until I pinch this party

""Can you dig it?""	
""Right on""	
""Right on!"" [Repeat: x4]

It's my style, love it, or lump it
It's my beat, pass it or pump it
And it thumps, like a heartbeat
And when it gets old, it won't get weak
It'll get stronger, much stronger
Long live the King, but the Lyte lives longer
It's well argumented and well documented
I hold the title of the best, you can't prevent it
With a ten foot pole, you can't hold em
Born to be wild is what a song once told me
Was my destiny, so I strive to be the best
Lo and behold..
Every rhyme I write, you gots to chant them
Every song I sing, a national anthem
Is there a message in my music?
If I can do it, you can do it!

""Can you dig it?""	
""Right on""	
""Right on!"" [Repeat: x8]

The L, why, T, E, has to make
""funky funky funky hit records"" Constantly!
So in the advent of an event
I have to invent a dope style comment
I come off with flying colors
I keep my own identity, compared to no others
It's hard to do, but I pull it through
Cause I'm Lyte the MC, that's what I do
The body snatcher, yo I gots to catch a
MC head up, bring on a batch of
New ones, so I can systematically do em
The old ones, huh, I already been through em
Two by two, I do em like Noah
Yes you know the time, so let's go
The bottom line, is I'm funk bound

MC Lyte,"He knows he's leaving, not much time left
Holding on to his very last breath
I saw him last week, nervous and uptight
Losing sleep, stays up all night
Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed
to push in the bush but took his time
to get to know the girl he slapped skins with
shared needles with
Wish he could go back, change the direction
But now he's got the infection
I spoke to him, gave him inspired words
I'm sure he's heard
live by the sword, die by the sword
What's left, pray to the oh Lord
You can deny but the truth will unfold
because the eyes are the soul

	Eyes are the soul..
	Eyes are the soul..

I look into his eyes, but he's so high
from the crack, he thinks that he can fly
He has problems he doesn't like solving
Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops revolving
19, his eyes full of tears
He hasn't smiled at least for a year
His mom is gone cause he was high one night
while they killed her, because of the crack pipe
He's wanted by the law
because he's robbed at least three grocery stores
He's lost, all control
Take a look, eyes are the soul

	Eyes are the soul..
	Eyes are the soul..
	Eyes are the soul..

I look into her eyes, she's so young
but I know, where she's comin from
I've watched her grow, little girl down the street
White shirts and skirts with pleats
She cried, fear in her voice
Not knowing, she had a choice
Oh so sad, oh so lonely
If she knew that she's not the only
one in school that didn't use the caution
Facin, raisin a baby or abortion
Her mother said she had to leave
Who wants to be where a baby is not received
No ultimatum, she's goin to the G.Y.N.
to put it to an end
She's learned a lesson I suppose
I can tell, eyes are the soul

MC Lyte,"Outside of me, you try to picture me
Young and black, that ain't no mystery
But inside runs deep like an ocean
You couldn't understand if I spoke in slow motion

I'm tryin' like hell to get some results
But you can bet your ass that it's difficult
They try to keep it down because I talk to a beat
In other words because I try to teach

But if I talk that yang-yang shit
Like you can't touch this, that shit'll hit
Don't we have any morals anymore
Or did rap take the toll out the fuckin' door?

Well if it did, hardcore's back to claim it
I'ma take it, change it, fuck it, rename it
I got the plan, now let's make it effective
You hip-hoppers, you got to be selective

And stop lettin' that bullshit slide for rap
Can't you see that it's a brainwash trap?
I rap a cha, cha, cha and I sat and watched
You liked that shit, you rock around the fuckin' clock

But when I talk of education, you fear that
Drugs and such, you don't wanna hear that
First I pleased you, now I teach you
Don't you dare try to bite the hand that'll lead you

To the pot of gold, over the rainbow
Lyte'll guide you, I know the way to go
So just close your eyes and just take my hand
Remember MC Lyte has the master plan
We can go thick, in a posse
You ain't said nuttin' slick, I'm goin' kamikaze

Inside of me, you try to picture me
Can you detect, can you see I'm angry?
Well, usually Lyte don't get upset
But when I see wack shit gettin' pressed I get vexed

Turn on the video, what's this mess?
A disgrace to rap and I'm not impressed
So just leave, get out my domain
You lame sucker, you fuckin', no name

Takin' up my airtime, with that weak whack
Full of, full of bullshit rhyme
So step off roach or get stepped upon
Because my rhymes they spray like D-Con 4
Do you want more?

'Cause I floor any emcee
That wanna gets with me
So yo, pack your bags, and skedaddle
Just walk, 'cause you don't wanna battle

I got the button that'll get rid of wack emcees
It's called the Brooklynizer, have you beggin' on your knees
So quit takin' up space on the CD rack
You better prepare, 'cause Lyte gives no slack

Inside of me, dwells a hundred maniacs
Waitin' for the kickoff, waitin' for attack
Who gives a fuck? Bring your posse
'Cause in the 90's, Lyte is goin' kamikaze

Inside, there's no flipside
Outside there's more than meets the eye
So now you know not because you're guessin'
But because I told you so, I never fess

Everyone wants to rap, what's this a wagon?
Bring your band and hop and start draggin'
All you rappers, you're fuckin' impersonators
Sayin' I'll rap now and learn how to rap later

No time for that, time is too short
And the rappin' gift it cannot be bought
A solo artist? You can't be
Maybe you'll look better with a posse

But all that you're talkin', you ain't sayin' shit
So why you where you at? I think you oughta quit
Posses don't matter in the 90's
Here's a warning, Lyte is goin' kamikaze

MC Lyte,"Fifteen years old, thought I was in love
I was never told, sex is like drugs
Too much will drive you crazy, in fact
The brother was so good, had me comin' back
Took my virginity, like he took my heart
I had to find the Lyte, he left me in the dark

All alone, no one to be with
And the brothers they ask me why I riff
I got hard, grew a shell upon my back
I had to get a grip, to keep my life intact
I had to let em know, Lyte is not fragile
'Cause if they think this, brothers can get, foul

they'll use, bruise and abuse
Dump your ass and be sure to choose
The next fresh fish that steps into the place
If they desire, they forgot your face
Lovin' them and leavin' them, that was their reasonin'
Thinkin' he was pleasin' you, when he was just teasin' you

Summer was over, back in school
He said come over, that would be cool
I said okay, it?s been a year now
Some even asked why, some even asked how
Could you wait that long, for me to be with it
Some said yo hobbes, you're never gonna get it

But then the time came, you and I both came
Things would soon change, never would they be the same
Before this afternoon, took place, I was in love, I walked around
In space, I?d rush home from school just to speak to you

Talk for an hour, maybe even two
We?d just laugh though, nothing serious
I guess back then, you were just curious
To see what I was like, just to touch my flesh
I could be wrong though, that's my first guess

You was in your house, I was in mine
As long as we were chattin' on the line, it was fine
All alone, yet talkin' on the phone if you got bored you felt your bone
And as bad as I am, I talked you through every stroke
Lyte ain't no joke

you've been beggin' for some time, for me to come visit
You never got mad though, if I wasn't widdit
But this day was different, I was feelin' in the mood
For some slow type of groove or some soul food

In other words sex, yeah that's better
I threw on the Jordache, the izog sweater
That was in style then, come on don't laugh
Sergio?s, Lee?s, you wore those in the past
Anyway I arrived, twenty past five

he'd been hypin' himself, sayin' he was quite live
I said here's your chance, show me some romance
We begin' to slow dance, off with his pants
Boom it was over, damn that was quick
Too bad little homey had a widdle widdle

The only one I've seen, 'cause yo he was the first
But since I've had others, damn he was the worst
I was in love though, that didn't matter
Nothin' you could say, could ever shatter
My world, take it away, just a young little girl

Oh well, he stepped, jet, family moved
Leavin' me in the mood for some soul food
Damn I felt hurt, just like a jerk
Would somebody please just mush my face in dirt
So I can hide, from the whole fuckin' world
What the fuck is love, such a naive girl

Suppose I got pregnant, damn I?d be lost
My mom woulda kicked me out to live with jack frost
I guess I'm lucky though, lonely for sure
Waitin' for the fucker to come knockin' at my door
I didn't hold my breath though, I might be dead
Yo 45, next time I?ll use my head

MC Lyte,"Lola hopped into a cab, she went to work
As she walked into the club, the fellas went bezerk
They screamed her name out -- lola, lola
Yeah, she was the star of the copa
She smiled and danced til morning
Lola took uppers, to stop her from yawning
For the finale, she got an applause
Lola was gracious, she didn't do tours
She felt appreciated, just like a star
But for the meanwhile, she got a drink from the bar
Lola had no kids and lost her mother
Her lover used drugs and left her for another
But little did she know that she would make love tonight
She'd do it willingly without puttin up a fight

Lola.. she was a showgirl..
With yellow ribbons in her hair..
And a dress right up to here..

At the bar, his name was zeke the freak
He just moved in down the street
He introduced himself and bought her a drink
Before she could refuse, she didn't stop to think
More and more alcohol, now she was intoxicated
He picked her up off her feet, as he escapaded
Down the block then he opened the door
As he struggled to get in, then put her on the floor
He went to the door to make sure that it was locked
As he bolted all of them, he looked up at the clock
It said one, or maybe he'd be done in two
Or two and three, eventually, how freaky could he be?
He began to think what should I do firstly?
I'll get a little drink, because I'm very thirsty
He got a little oj, to make it really ok
Grabbed a wad of hubba bubba, but didn't use a rubber
They did it for three hours, he jumped into the shower
Got out and towel dried, and screamed, ""I've got the power!""
He came out of the bathroom, she was still on the floor
He said, ""heck I've got to wreck,"" then he jumped on for more

Lola.. (uh-huh) she was a showgirl..
With yellow ribbons in her hair..
And a dress right up to here..
She met this guy named zeke..
Who was truly a freak..
And she didn't stop to think..
Before she took that sunrise drink..

She finally awoke, eight o'clock in the morning
Not remembering a stroke, as she began yawning
Zeke the freak thought he was thick and slick
But what zeke did not know
Is that little lola, little lola
From the copa used to be a hoe
Now he's paid, thought he had it made
But zeke the freak got aids

Lola.. she was a showgirl.. (yeah)
With yellow ribbons in her hair..
And a dress right up to here..
She met this guy named zeke..
Who was truly a freak..
And she didn't stop to think..
Before she took that sunrise drink..
He caught a bad one..
While he was havin fun..
Took lola to his bed
And now the freak is -- dead.

No
Oh
Puppy, power

Okay, hello
Watch your drink, what? Watch your drink
No, no, I think I'm too late, am I too late?

Hit it, I'm coolin' in the sun, on a beach in the cabana
Sippin' on some vodka in a glass with Tropicana
I'm chillin' and I'm chompin' on a turkey shish-ka-bab
Too far from work to hear the phone ring at the job

Men in bikinis, G-strings should I say
Waitin' for the daddy long one to come my way
Here he comes, now, I feel I start to sweat
Blunder but I wonder just how wet will I get

He offers me his hand, of course you know, I take it
Until he tells me that he wants to swim a little naked
My eyes are bulgin', I black out, damn, it's black as tar
Woke up, I don't know when, sittin' at the bar

I know it's hard to follow, the story's kinda tricky
What I didn't know was somebody slipped a Mickey
Into my drink, which caused a fantasy
And somehow slapped me back into reality

Wish I had another Mickey, I'd go back for a quickie
Find the daddy long one that was surely tryin' to get me
This just goes to show, you must stop and think
When you're out partyin', never leave your drink, word

MC Lyte,"I met him in a club hangin out one night
He said, ""Hello I'm George.. hi Lyte!
How's everything goin, huh, how ya doin?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and umm
can I call you sometime?  Can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?""
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
cause George looked good, MMM damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin
Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission

     ""Can it be I've stayed away too long"" (2X)

I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
""She gave me the number?  Hmmm I'm surprised""
Good conversation, over the phone
He began to come for me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didn't have to compete
George was mature, he made sure
that he was the only one I'd ever adore
Girls, have you, ever had a friend
that you'd get with, every now and then?
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be
I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!
But if I ever saw one, that would be the end
He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didn't care, fine legs don't lie
See cause Georgie was into making your girls cry

     ""Kissed the girls and made them cry"" (4X)

     ""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
     ""Can it be I've stayed away too long""

     ""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
     ""Kissed the girls and...""

George was clean, no drugs and such
But once in a while, he'd drink too much
Hangin in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend, drinkin vodka
I was lookin for him, and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair
I told him he was messin up he wouldn't go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said, ""Don't drive, use your head
Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead""
We begin to argue, bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some longhaired dread
Ran into the car as if, in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didn't care, he drove off into the night
Riding for miles, without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests as the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was young, he started smokin
Paid no attention when he started chokin
Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck
Till Georgie Porgie, crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin
Wish he was here so I could say somethin
The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow
Just to say no one is promise tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
You never know when they'll be layin in a coffin
Wake up, it's important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow..
Believe that!  And don't think that it can't happen to you

One by one they fall in the darkness
I'm glad, that I could take part in this
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

Finding the Lyte means happiness
It's the best and nothing less
So I'm waiting, at the end of a tunnel
Where happiness comes in bundles

But it takes time, to get to the Lyte
To get in the Lyte, to be with the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

How you get there is this question
Honesty is my suggestion
But first you must be awakened
If you say you are, you're faking

One who has seen the Lyte doesn't have to proof
That they've been moved
They just let it be, let it rest
For that is the mental test

Within this, there's so much happiness
Sort of like lasting moments of bliss
Everyone wants to be so happy
Let me explain my theory:

Some type of grief you MUST experience
In order to appreciate happiness
'Cause if you are always satisfied
Life will just pass by, you would've never tried

To get to the Lyte, to get in the Lyte
To be with the Lyte, to go see the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

If you are not ready the Lyte can be BLIND-ING
And not worth finding
So for this you must prepare:
Stay awake, wake up, stay aware!

There are SO, many distractions
Those that see the Lyte, just a fraction
Those that don't, remain blinded
The Lyte is there, they can't find it

One by one they fall in the darkness
And it's sad, to take part in this
But I'm hoping, that you just might
Get together and Search 4 the Lyte

Now finding the Lyte is what's so difficult
And you can bet, that the results are
Splenderous, wonderful, yeah
What wouldn't you do?

What did you call me for cause I'm curious
Or did you call me just to look in my face
Now I know I didn't come just to take up space
The night is right, and the stars are bright
So see'mon now brother just treat me right
And just take it off, I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can SWING
I don't smoke and I don't get high

But if I don't I won't fall I won't fret
I'm no fool I got plenty of sense
So I just be cool, and have patience
Make up your mind, please let me know
And when you give me the green that's when I'll go

Cruising down the street in my SL
When I seen this dude who was built very well
Face was handsome, body was fine
How did I know, I was cruising behind him
Looked at the car, looked at me
Then he asked me my name, I told him Lyte the MC but
I didn't want to outplay my hand
So I talked so smooth he could understand me
He was definitely the move
I only said sweet things, that could soothe him
Opened up the door, and he got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told him take it off, I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can swing
I mean take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby until the last drop

Met this guy at an amusement park
He was good to go and it was after dark
You can guess girls what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time baby
Instead the boy asked me my sign
And I said, ""Why?"" and he said, ""Never mind.""
When the time come and it's you I'm thinking of
A sign don't make a difference only how you make love to me
You make me feel so good you're a man
Oh baby I melt like cotton candy
If I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and I'd also be your wife
So let's take a bout through the tunnel of life
Because you know what I'm thinking of,
See'mon baby just take it off

When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight
But at the end of the night, everything is alright
Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat
It'll only get as wet as I let it baby
I love hard, I've done some effed up things
from kicking them in the Nerfs, to throwin away his ring
So if you love me, love me and stay with me
But you can walk if your plan is to play me
I'm not embarrassed, nor am I ashamed
To say once in the past, I've been gamed
But that was then, and this is now
And there's no way damn it, there's no how
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love

When in love you do things that are strange
Look back and say, ""I must have been deranged!""
I'm talkin like pickin your lover's nose
cooking his food and washing his clothes
And if you thought that was goin too far
What about givin him the keys to your car?
You could be partyin and havin a ball
but you stop and check your messages to see if he called
How about sittin in the house all night
waitin for the phone to ring -- that ain't right!
But you do it anyway cause you love him to death
And if he was dyin, you'd give your last breath
You gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love (2X)

When in love you go out your way to please him
Wait outside his job, hope that you see him
And guys buy girls some serious things
like two-seater cars and diamond rings
I know what happens, she got you strung
Guess it doesn't matter long as you're having fun
Love'll make you do some crazy things
Meet a married man and then have a fling
Like Babyface said, ""Love makes things happen""
It's most important, to hear what I'm rappin
Someone in love better take your time
Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad

The why to the T, surrounded by the L and the E
Put it together and you got Lyte the MC
Deep, deep, deeper than the vein
Of the membrane, squish it, put your ass to sleep
I got octaves, not to sing but to rap so
Give me dap, perhaps admit, that I'm all that
The shit that I write huh, surely chart climbers
Don't try to run, because your mom'll come and find ya
Getcha, gotcha, getcha gotcha getcha gotcha

[ VERSE 1 ]
I got the intro along with the cash flow
Make all the bad boys seem like nymphos
Yeah, I'm hard, I get sexy like Veronica
I use sex as an instrument like the philharmonica
No, I ain't tall, but I'm small and I'm slender
Ask him who's been in, shit is like tender
If he didn't like it, then return to sender
He didn't do that, it's too fat, he remembers
Never ever have I ever said I was good lookin
Just one bad-ass bitch from Brooklyn
Not here to steal your loot, your coat, your rocks
Makin niggas drop whenever we hit the block
They hear 'Brooklyn', and we up to no good
Well, here we come, so there goes your neighborhood
Timbos scuffed up, sess bein puffed up
Mess with the wrong one, kid, you get ruffed up

	Peace to my people in

[ VERSE 2 ]
I got the rhythm that'll rip up shows
Blow down foes, they kill at will to get a taste of my flow
Vocally I rock locally and worldwide
Those that got bad wish they woulda never tried
Cause when you come from where I come from
You gotta be tough
Cause niggas'll call your bluff quick enough
Cause if your hood is like my hood, you gotta think quick
Shit stink, niggas are slick, have you turnin tricks
I gotta give it up to Mr. Cool J
For givin up the props to the girls around the way
It ain't safe after dark to throw a jam in the park
If you want to get naughty, bring your forty to the arc
Cause we get down when it comes to a jam
Just watch your backpocket, keep a eye on the man
If your town is like my town, you don't want to mess around
Wind up gettin bagged up, beat down

Everyhwere that I step they know my rep
Cause I'm sayin and doin ill shit they won't forget
Breakin down doors, although I never break laws
Come to a town that's yours, and I be rippin the whole tour
Comin hard for your section, slow up
Live in the flesh and about to blow up
So yo, come down, and then get the fuck up
Looks are hooked, you lucked up, you're booked
You gotta be hard, cause I ain't with softies
Hit, then you miss, gotta get offa this
So come with your game, cause you can't be lame
As soon as you walk, I'm forgettin your name
As long as you know all that enter are equal

MC Lyte,"Gotta who? Gotta have a what?
Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck hey!

I need a ruffneck
I need a dude with a attitude
Only needs his fingers with his food
Karl Kani saggin' timbos draggin'
Frontin' in his ride with his home boys braggin'
Lying 'bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But he's a ruffneck so that's alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Makin' noise with the boys up to no good
C-low on the down low cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin' beef is how he spells relief
Actin' like he don't care
But all I gotta do is beep him 911 and he'll be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude,the ruffneck bastard

Hey! Gotta what? Yo gotta get a ruffneck
I need it and I want it so I gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck hey!
I need it and I want it so I gotta get a ruffneck

I need a ruffneck
I need a man that's quick and swift
To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts everything is fitting large
Body ain't gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin' in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and that's slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
He's gotta smack it, lick it, swallow it up style
Drink a beer, sittin' his chair
Hands in his pants fiddlin' with his dick hairs
He's a rudeboy, a raggamuf
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks not ruff enough
Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't right
And if he ain't ruff, well then he's all wrong for the Lyte
I love my ruffneck and ain't nothing going down
Or going up if my ruffneck ain't in town

Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck hey!
I need it and I want it so I gotta get a ruffneck
Gotta what yo, gotta get a ruffneck hey!
I need it and I want it so I gotta get a ruffneck

I need a ruffneck
I need a man that don't snitch like a bitch
Shed tears or switch
Doin' whatever it takes to make ends meet
But never meetin' the end cause he knows the street
Eat sleep shit fuck, eat sleep shit
Then it's back to the streets to make a buck quick
Quick to beg even though gimme gottem here
Hit'em wit a bit a skins then he's out of there
On the avenue girls are passin' thru
Too much of ruffneck so they ain't havin' you
Hard boppin' always grabbin' his jock and braggin' about his tec
Is the wannabe ruffneck
That's the kind you gotta watch out for
Just to get a rep he'll pull the plug on the tour
Pissin' in corners
Doing 80 by funeral mourners
Showing little respect
Now that's a ruffneck

When we hit, what the heck? We puttin phony niggaz in check
Seek what I reap; follow you'll learn or get burned

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been

Way back when I've been putting it down

Spectacular on the M I C,

You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,

Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot

Why you gotta be all up on me like that,

Latin quarters, why puma suit was cool.
Now let me be caught in that and I'll be damned a fool.  Ya
Gotta change with the times like the weather.
MC's that lasts is the MC's that's clover.
You can't move too slow 'cause when
It's to time to go, you see it's no time to go.
TRG, we making that cream.
People get fooled, it ain't easy as it seems.
You can rock on till the break of dawn,
But one day, brother, your ass is gone.
TRG, we making that cream.
People get fooled, it ain't easy as it seems.
You can rock on till the break of dawn,
But one day, sister, your ass is gone.
Come back after come back; nigga came back more whack
Than the whackest wax on the rack.  What's up with
That New Jacks are coming through, taking no slack.
They hungry, and they looking for a spot to cop a squat.
You better watch the clock, it can be awfully embarrassing
To not know when it's time to let go of the rhyme.
It's about half past the monkeys ass.
You should have been gone but you
Still trying to hang on, what happens when you
Chilling at the level on the 10th floor, nobody
Knows your name anymore, aren't you?
Wait and let me think, just as quick as you
Got large, you can quickly shrink and sink into the crates and
Collect dust, don't be mad cause it happens to best of us.
TRG, we making that cream.
People get fooled, it ain't easy as it seems.
You can rock on till the break of dawn,
But one by one, your ass is gone.
TRG, we making that cream.
People get fooled, it ain't easy as it seems.
You can rock on till the break of dawn,
But one by one, your ass is gone.
To and fro, they come and go, you better change your flow
And then switch up your show, I seen some come with the
Booming ass hits, then they gone, but then they don't leave
With shit, you better tell an exec you need to be set
So when it's over, you ain't living out your Land Rover.
When you rap life dies,
And you still alive nigga, you better know how to
Survive, it ain't easy and it ain't supposed to be.
Letting niggas know what time it is
When it comes to me the L-Y-T-E,
Stronger than the ox the octane that
Knocks in your brain I sustain.
My mission is to maintain sane, know what I mean?
Keep doing my thang, you can't move too slow
'Cause when it's your time to go, you gotta go, gotta go.

People get fooled, it ain't easy as it seems.
You can rock on till the break of dawn,
But one by one, your ass is gone.",TRG (The Rap Game),1996
MC Lyte,"be	-Boy, where the fuck you at? 
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past. 
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper. 
Before I make you suffer That's when you had enough-a 
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? 
Surely I can, if you the man. 
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice. 
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang
get it on. 
You're gettin' warm. 
I can feel you getting closer. 
Now baby, down this Mimosa. 
You better believe it's time to give a toast to. 
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played. 
Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade. 
All over your body. 
Who's body? 
You're body. 
I can rock a party like nobody. 
Leavin' time to take home the loot. 
Choosy about who I let knock my boots. 
Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte. 
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right. 

CHORUS:

Keep On' Keepin On, Cause you came and you changed my world. 
Your love so brand new. Keep on keep kickin' on. Doin it right, right,
right... Ah, ah, ah....

Beware of the stare when I step into peace. 
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released.
Now who from the chosen shall I choose? 
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes. 
I found me a new nigga this year. 
That know's how to handle this here. 
Now I look forward to goin' home at night. 
Brother does mo right. 
Under the candlelight. 
Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that? 
I guess I can. 
Can I, why not? 
If I want to guess I can. Can I? 
More honey than a bumble-bee hive.
Pulling 69 ways in my archive. 
Sweet like licorice. 
Sugar for my booga. 
Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee. 
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check. 
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat. 
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to.
As I proceed to  Open up and feed you. 
I got a longing to put you where you want to be. 
Been I can, I get rid of all company.

CHORUS

Many have tried strict regulation. 
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation. 
Those that didn't perform well. 
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell. 
You're playing with my time. 
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me. 
You better work me. 
While you got the oppurtunity. 
To be in the midst of the L-why-T-E. 
Only the strong survive. 
Only the wise excel. 
Once said by my born-in-hell.
Only the lonely die slowly. 
Left all alone try to control me. 
Easy does it never ask how was it.
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets. 
Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute. 
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot. 
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it. 
Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it. 
It's natural. Never be ashamed. 
Fuck the fame. Get the name, and kick the game.",Keep on Keepin' On [T.V. Track with Ad Libs],1996

Get so corrupt, we can't give up, we got to keep on pushing
(Keep on pushing, ain't no stopping us)
Ain't no stopping us

A child of the essence, turning degrees into perfection
My struggle is now objective to meet the righteous direction
The life lessons, but what they all about?
If I took the dolo route, and I left the people out
Non-personal connects, low-cost effects
Bound to meet my doom for regrets so I just
Put all praises down to Allah, plus the block
Pull my family ties in one big knot
Respect the divine that makes me help me ride to the top
And do a trip to a past never forgot

Where do I go from here, I don't know, I don't know
Till I find my past, the life I knew, the life I knew
I'm holding on to my roots cause they pulling my leaves
I traveled over seas, got 400 degrees
It's the city life, trife concock the scheme
To play upon my dreams still fulfillin' my needs
Well I don't know, whatever happened to my past
Wait I gotta think about (I don't care) how long I can last
I don't know as long as I get over my worlds most biggest fears
Cause I'm drenched in sweat for family tears
So ah, where do I go from here, I don't know
I don't know, till I find my past, the life I knew

And deep like seashells, uh, I'm from L.A. so I gotta cap to adapt

It's waking up and facing the drama
Can't let you hang, maintain, run game, pimp thangs
And roll my land cruiser like it's on Danna Danes
Uh, it's show low, the west coaster, you know
Let you boost like I'm suppose ta

You lived closer but then you moved 
But that couldn't stop our groove 
My magic man my Brooklyn boy I wonder 
I rub your shoulders and impress that you was under

Catch a flick or two and went back to bedside

Long as we're hand in hand your my man I'm your girl

So surreal but yet picturous 
There were problems I can admit 
But we handled it and still the candles lit 
So glad that we didn't just jet 
Cause now we reap the benefits 
Who would have thought 
The cute little boy from down the street 
Would fall in love with me 
It's like a number one dream come true 
To have somebody you love love you 
And that's all that matters 
Is that we grow together make sure we never
You're the reason I live 
Because I want you to get all that I got to give 
Long as we're hand in hand your my man I'm your girl

Around the world and back again I love you that much

I keep it tight for you sexy and useful 
I told my mom when our days are through 
If you have to go first bury me next to you 
What I feel is unexplainable, 'I love you' 
Just ain't enough to say to you 
You've been there from the beginning to the end

There's a party goin' on in my hotel room
And you're invited, all you got to do is show up x2

(verse 1)
Now we done left the venue 'coz the show was done
Before we hit the hotel, make a quick run
To get the Martel to add to the fun, meet me at suite room 151
BYOB, we about to kick it off
Remember that party last year in the loft?
This'll be better 'coz we bigger now
Got mo' figures now, fit in mo' niggas now
I got about 30 of the finest
Ready to get flirty and down right do-dirty
We got twister the dots mean a lot
When you flip the dial end up with a face in your twot
Stop yappin' at the DJ, that ain't right
'Coz tonight this here DJ, he gon' save my life... (woah, woah)

Now the people are comin', and the party is jumpin'...
... and T is on the beat box
And after this song he'll rock the locks
Hotel security ain't troublin' us none
They partyin' with us, no badge and no gun
Grown folks in the livin' room showin' out
And they ain't leavin' till we kick 'em all out
Strip poker, truth or dare
I swear it's about to get sticky up in here
Back back and forth and forth
>From New York to L.A and back to New York
Of course while I'm in town it's gotta be nice
On the North-East corner they're flippin' the dice
Now the bubbly's poppin' all over the suite
Swig on this and kick up your feet
Ain't no party like an MC Lyte party 'coz an MC Lyte party don't stop, pops
And this here's better than when the ball drops

Now here's the E-low, Jackie and Mark
Done hit the back room to jump start the sparks

Scream for the cream, but holler when you see me man
You know like I know, the party don't end till I say when
Now the grub is runnin' out better get it while you can
Pick is gettin' low better find you a man
Slow jam hit and you sittin' all alone
Ain't nobody gonna take you're borin' ass home

So step up if you wanna get hurt
Milk Dee's gonna pull the skirt
I get money, money I got
Stunts call me honey if they feel real hot
That's how it is, you can ask Giz
I stole your girl while you were in prison
Jailed for MC assault

Now it's India, India, I get into ya, styles I got plenty 'a
I'm bout it bout it, you know my ones stay crowded
Fuck around and doubt it, and get that ass louded
The future me, 2003, ultra magnetic, this MC... (MCs, MCs, MCs freeze)
I'm not afraid of you niggas, I'm ready for the masses
I keep it tight like spandex do asses
Palmer's cocoa butter for the ashes, while Chanel laces up my lashes
Uh oh no, stop! It don't get hot because I locked it
Got it, give me 6 million like you gave Tupac it
Hot forever 'coz that's how I plotted

(chorus)

verse 2 (G. Salah)
I'm that are rated nigga from the films with mistique
With taste from the hamptoms but still street
Don't sleep I reach the ghetto to elite
Blessed with the vocals gifted with the feet
Pretty nigga, pearly white teethe
I can't for now 'coz my mind says from Asia
I'm unreachable, fuck a portable and pager
Made nigga, no time for posin', leavin' niggas like Moses
Front and get swollen The black italian G. Salah the chosen
I beat you down with love get you stuck frozen
'Coz I talk shit like caches, and I backs it
Can you match this my magic
Catcy like habits, digest and swallow

verse 3 (MC Lyte)
I resonate like 808s but with a ill tone
Lyte the oddesy, full blown
>From Cali to Medina, the head turner, Tina
Belle Venezuela, rockin' Argentina
Hot like heaters, swift like cheeters
>From where I stand grass remains greener
(Let me tell you 'bout a girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Brooklyn, and her shit is always cookin')
See I be flowin' yes constantly
That's why the cabbage that I stack is deep winter green
And the way that I be hittin', unlike any other sister, I get into your
System, man I make you listen
I give, give back 10 fold, Lana on the ill trio

",Break It Down,1998
MC Lyte,"Loving you madly will be forever. 
I see the ocean in your eyes when we're together. 
There are no boundaries. There are no limits. 
My heart has been embraced now that you're in it. 

Hold me closer to your dreams. 
Closer to your fears. Close to hear your laughter. 
Hold me when you're close to tears. 

Time passes by, seconds into minutes. 
Every field and flower fades but love is infinite. 
There are no boundaries. There are no limits. 
My heart's a bigger place now that you're in it. 

Hold me closer to your dreams. 
Closer to your fears. Close to hear your laughter. 
Hold me when you're close to tears. 
I wanna be the one you tell your secrets to. 
All I want is to be closer. Closer to you. 

How tight can you hold me? 
How long can we stay awake? 
How hard can we laugh? 
How much love can we make? 

Hold me close to your dreams.

Hold me when you're close to tears.

MC Lyte,"Make it last long, uha, uh

Here's a situation, skip the talk
Let me know dog if you bite or bark
What it is soldier, you ready to march
Can you make me shoot, or you just soft
Cause I got no time for the games
Just keep my spine full of pain
Hit the boost and hit turbo
In this sexual inferno
Keep my lovin', drippin' drains
Or love highway, switchin' lanes
Show me different thangs with the whip and chains
Hit you with this grippin' pain
Can you handle that, are you alright
Test me out, is it alright
Come on baby, you ain't finished
You servin' time, I ain't talkin' minutes

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Certified misses, I'm misses
Only get my time if it's
Somethin' that stay somethin'
All night, until brunch and
Hit it right, manouvre me
Take your big knot, ? me
Pull my hair back, who the ruler be
Lovin' you so tight, no room for three
Tell me you want me
My love keep you horny
I know's my mother on me
Stay away from the masculine
Thing that keep me needing asperin
Got me gaspin' in for air, pashin' and
Sheets satin and mixed with silk
Here's my love, mixed with milk

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
What does it feel like

Check me out, feminine engine
Brooklyn girl, read the emblem
Him, them, and that's hangin'
Ten, it's nine-eight and then
Till it's hot and you got me bent
On top of my thing, you win
Came nine times, going for the tenth
Think you could hang if you attempt
With energy, when you enter me, hold on
Goin' for a ride, hope you don't fold on
Me, when we in the midst
Of battlin' with my slip
No babblin', close your lips
Get close to it, nothing close to this
Feelin' what I feel when I'm next to you
I stretch for you, please stretch me too
Night got me right as we take the flight
Through the clouds of love, highest heights
My thing's tighter than a Jew's pockets
Think you used to it, go head, rock it

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong

As I scope the crowd, I spot red eyes
grippin' them Heinekens, they don't know where they been
Baby got back see, rollin' like ten deep
But you look for good luck, swing in the Expo G
I mean no harm, but that lucky charm
You need to ditch it quick, get with the Brooklyn bomb

Wherever we be, we hit correctly
It's been so long, we gotta get it on

Knowing damn well, he too could get done
But he got a partner, and that ain't too hard to fix
Once I slide up in the mix
Juggin' it baby, from right to left
Jigged out, gotta pick ya out from what's left
It's no mystery, the way ya humpin' and bumpin'
I what you comin' home with me?
I'm-gon'-get-some-satisfaction
The way you comin' at me with the action
You betta know it, when ya dealing with the poet
Whatever ? you got, you betta show it

I'm a Person that's Making Profit. See I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin
And Chevy windows be rattlin
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

Motion denied
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya

How I look working for a nigga in a kufi
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy

(yea ok)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream

Nigga you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me (get real now)
Pimp yo punk ass
Have you write me poetry
I'm from a land called cash
You too slow for me

You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than Bagets
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin ain't easy but damn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving

You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention

Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash (yep)
That shit is the past
I got my own stable (where at)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract

Girl you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

(Is that right)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Say what)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (and pimp what)
Pimp systems
Got stores called big pimpin (Where)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou (Yea right)
Bring'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

I'm laughin cause you funny
I'm make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki

Yo, what ever happened to loyalty
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher

Well there you have it ya'll
The story of pimps and hoes ya'll know how it goes

MC Lyte,"B-boy, where the fuck you at?
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past.
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer that's when you had enough-a

Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? Surely I can, if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need
A boost of energy to enter me and get it on?

You're gettin' warm, I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played

Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body, who's body? You're body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leavin' time to take home the loot

Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

Keep on, keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on
Doin' it right, right, right ah, ah, ah

Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose?
Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes

I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to goin' home at night
Brother does mo right, under the candlelight

Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that?
I guess I can, can I, why not?
If I wanna guess I can, can I?
More honey than a bumble-bee hive

Pulling 69 ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga.
Juicy like Hi-C. or an Ice
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check

'Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I proceed to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company

Keep on, keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new
Keep on, keep kickin' on
Doin' it right, right, right ah, ah, ah

Many have tried strict regulation
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell

You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me
You better work me, while you got the opportunity
To be in the midst of the L Y T E

Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell, only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it

Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
'Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it

Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame
Get the name, and kick the game

I'm giving 'em rhymes of feminine kind, keeping it tight
Knockin' the edge off they shoulder
Colder than any MC, and hotter than the next

To the left a seagull lights the truth
Kick it to the youth, pocket full of proof
Ready to raise the roof, off the vocal booth
Put hoes back on the track cause they loose
No one a never come there
I have 'em going quicker than city of angels left the air last year
Don't y'all know I scorch MC's
Leave them all toast from the neck to the knees
It's remarkable as I spark a few
Of these rhymes, some rappers find it hard to do
Goldie of the game, everything bout to change
You gettin' stripped for ya shit, niggaz thought you knew

I'm rhymin' and designin', also creatin'
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein' taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me, like me
No trait of originality, none whatsoever
Don't ever second guess me, guess me
And if you're wonderin' who could the best be

Lyte and Maad Phunk, we flamin' on
And took a vacation, some of them came and gone
When I push beef it's like flaming y'all
Tender as I serve these loose rappin' broads
She sellin' straight up sex, by the sea shore
We bang beats from boogie down to BK, New York
I sport the finest of wears, your highness is here
End your rhyming career
I spits it like you want to do but can't
Your skills iffy cause you tryna dance
Due to the circumstance, get your hands up high
You know the routine, freeze 'em like a drive-by
You know when I roll through I'm reppin' old school
Thought I told you, here let me show you, I don't know you
Fuck you, I don't owe you nothin'
Paper thin, Georgie, had 'em wildin' somethin'

I'm rhymin' and designin', also creatin'

By a sucker MC that wants to be like me, like me
No trait of originality, none whatsoever
Don't ever second guess me, guess me

None of these broads want to get on a track with me
Except for Digga and be	, they got balls, as for the rest of y'all
You ain't for me you against me
Means I'm coming for your stacks relentlessly
You see they speak on a passin', Lyte was a lesson
I'm still shakin' these hoes down, without a weapon
Got you guessin' why won't this bitch ever die
Sure as you get high, we'll never see eye-to-eye
I'm the Lytro and I might go psycho
If I'm on my psycho, act like you might know
Which way the light go, but you never will
Cause I never spill, fuck it I said it, I'm that ill
I keeps a tight lip bout what the light hits
I'm get excited bout what I'm gon' get
They mad in the studio catchin' the blues
Why, cause they still can't fill my shoes

I'm rhymin' and designin', also creatin'
The dope, def rhyme that is always bein' taken
By a sucker MC that wants to be like me, like me
No trait of originality, none whatsoever
Don't ever second guess me, guess me
And if you're wonderin' who could the best be
The hip-hop maniac, uptown brainiac
In full effect MC Lyte is back

Nah, we ain't goin [echo]
I love bein hated, it great it
Let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And as long, as you keep fuckin with us, we keep fuckin you up
And keep pullin the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up, is we enjoy what were doin
So much there ain't nothin that we love more than +Pullin Your Skirts Up+
And exposin you hoes so much, people are startin to wonder
What's up with them fuckin one dough a man under-els
Do unto others of you will have done under you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you [gun cocks]
You will ask youself, how come your mans
Didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any irrationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin
Soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin with a ..

See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searchin for you longer than the ""Legend of Zelda""
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
Captain that a bassett hound couldn't even smell ya

You get bombed like Lebanon [explosion] with my own tactic

We can have it out on any Avenue
A +Average Man+ flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles
Cannons and ammunition, reload with precision
Nigga know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Push your crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasin green is the dream, when your young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggaz and they all get down
Dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said ""all men get down"" ([gunshot], c'mon)

While your punchin and tacklin punks
I'm handlin chumps, packin a pump
That's longer than the elephant trunk [gun cocks]
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shot you and scream ""increase the peace""
A monster, pistol packin pushin niggaz off they Hondas
Starve ya, get it crackin, yankin bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleepin stuff, I was stealin the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin a nap, bleedin and Lugged up
+Who Want What+ like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleepin [gunshots]

Know much about my a land ski
Don't tustle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed

Approach us, throw heat straight from the soldiers (c'mon, [gunshot])
We the soldiers, ya'll the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster [gunshot]

You scared of the drama, bomber the monster [gun cocks, boof]
I'm back nigga (woof), I reappear
Shoot like [gunshot], homie steer clear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice

Only chewed on bringing out the thug in me
'cause you sittin' on my nerves, when we've already heard

Some chicks say they love that, well I'm above that
Calling me a ? ? ? it's two, double O two
And my crew roll thick like BIG
Act up, and be puttin' that ass to sleep
You got nothing for me, been there, smelt the dope and
Rollin' with the shelter, making niggas jail free

We walk different and we talk a different slang

You a one roof flat, I'm fifty acres of land
In Jamaica with your man laid up, gettin' a tan

Never play with the messenger, Head on Joan of Arc
When I'm coming through these parts like just cut the dark
I'm a trendsetter, go getter, bringer back
'cause I'm fed up, ready to get a set up
Oh you scurred, vision blurred

And pitch them bitches with a curse

New York hawk city playin', back in the BK bomber
Niggas in the hood call me Lyte
But brothers call me Lana Moorer the high scorer
Play fool if you want to, we closin' after quarter
I started it and I shut the shit down
Sit down, don't nobody move, I'm making haters quit now
Been a long time coming but I'm running with the torch
Race, got a lot a rats but I can't be caught, or bought
'cause I won't sell out, that's why me and the big dogs, we fell out
Not with a major, but I'm still major league
Crash ya dome with this ? then watch your nose bleed
You want it, you can get it anytime

I can't eat (I can't eat) I can't sleep (I can't sleep) no more, no more
It's like I toss and turn at night 
Memories ease my pain
I keep hearing you laughin', screamin', callin' my name
Then my eyes open wide
And I see you ain't there
Then the joy from the music turn to a permanent tear of ink

[Chorus]

My only sanity in these walls
Is just the thought of you
Paradise up in my mind
Just for a second or two
But then it's gone
And I gotta go too

Girl where do you come from
I've been looking for you all of my life
Even though I barely know you boy
I think maybe tonight's the night
Cause I've been looking for your love all of my life

It's two o'clock in the morning and I'm still wide awake
Writing letters to you girl but I throw them all away
Because I, I wanna show you what I feel for you
But these words and this paper just ain't good enough for you
How can I prove to you that girl you live inside my mind
And I could see your pretty face every time I close my eyes
Something about the way we met the day we met I cant forget
I play this song again and again and I
I tell myself that one day you gonna be my special queen
Convince myself that you feel the same way for me
And even though we just met it feels so right
It's going down tonight

Tell me can I talk to you
Girl where do you come from
I've been looking for you all of my life
Even though I barely know you boy
I think maybe tonight's the night
Cause I've been looking for your love all of my life

Girl I can tell the way you feelin' your smile is so revealing
That sparkle in your eyes got knowing that you're willing to take a ride with somebody like me
Lets take a chance girl and you can be my royalty
My loyalty from this night until the very end
Is like a game that we play but everybody wins
Si tu fueras mi reina yo te regalaria
Todos mis dias momentos llenos de allegria
You got me fienin for the taste of just one kiss
Im fantasizing what is like and I just cant stop this
I think I'm going crazy so tell me can we talk pretty lady

Tell me can I talk to you
Girl where do you come from
I've been looking for you all of my life
Even though I barely know you boy
I think maybe tonight's the night
Cause I've been looking for your love all of my life

Now I've been looking for this baby girl all of my life
The type of mamasita that is down for mine
And if you feel the same way let me know girl
Let me know mama
Come on cause I've been looking for this baby girl all of my life
The type of mamasita that is down for mine
And if you fell the same way let me know girl
Let me know mama

MC Magic,"It's the passion inside
And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach 4 the sky
It's the passion inside
I'm going to reach 4 the sky

Just get your mind right
Get your sprit up and then we can do it
Keep your mind on the prize
And keep prosing
Average people make the world go round
And average instruments make extraordinary sounds
If you got talent baby let it shine
Give it to the world
And let them see what's inside
You're like a treasure and you have the key
Every minute of the day is what it takes to be
The best of the best
So give it all you got
And maybe one day you'll be standing on the top
But open up your eyes and realize
No matter what you do you got to give it some time
I want to see you dance
I want to see you smile
I want to see you laugh every day of your life
I want to know that passion deep inside
You tried every day even if it makes you cry

It's the passion inside
And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach for the sky
It's the passion inside
And your dreams come alive
It's the burning inside
I'm going to reach for the sky

Reach for the sky but I got to stay grounded
As long as I'm breathing my heart is still pounding
I see the vision when I close my eyes
And if I stop right now than I might as well die
Let the strength and the power you posses
Take you to the limit and beyond to express
A strong mind gets high on success
A week mind gets high on bull shit
And so I keep on rhyming
Let my music and my flow get you all so excited
Make you want to change the world today
If you still got the passion inside it's never too late
You got to move
Got to show
Got to rise
You got to let the world see through your eyes
Don't let no one tell you a lie
Today is your day and it's time to shine

Don't let nobody tell you that it's impossible
Just follow your heart and your dreams
Just follow your heart and your dreams
Your dreams
Hold up

I remember when I met you
You was standing with your friends at the bar looking so fly
From the hotel suite to the bubbles in the bath tub
No matter what you want to do I got your back love
Let me give it to you baby let me rub your back
As a matter of a fact
With the lights down low with the beat that's slow imma make you loose control
Let me touch them private places
Homerun hit like four bases
Making all them sexy faces
Damn girl you drive me crazy
I won't stop until the panties drop
Foggy windows in the parking lot
Holiday inn or the Marriott
Dime lo que quieras I make it real hot

Let me treat that body like a playground
From the top of the slide to the merry go round
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Til your eyes roll back and your legs lock up
Ooh wee I know you like that feeling when I'm killing
That kitty cat cat and I break your back and you lose your breathe like a cardiac
Must me that sex maniac in me
Gotta hit it one time or maybe three
You know that I gotta make it hotter than a hundred degrees
Tell me one thing
In the morning when you wake up

Ya no quiero llorar.
Why no quiero sufrir.
Necesito tu amor.
Yo me muero sin ti.

I told you when I met you, that I had someone in my life.
""I won't tell if you won't tell"" is what you said that night.
Do you remember it started as a game.
But when you play with fire, sometimes you can't put out the flames.
You said that you's a big gurl: undertood the circumstances.
Never took for granted- sneak away romances.
Tonight's the last night, I can't go on like this.
Got you crying on muh sleeve, trying to beg me not to leave.
Por favor no llores.
Gurl I gotta go. Estoy perdiendo, tu llanto rompe el corazon.
And if I stay 5 minutes I just might give in.
It's a battle I can't win.
More than just a sin. Made a promise to myself plus someone else.
From this day 'till the end I gotta be somebody else.
Forgive me mama if I'm making you cry.
I never meant to change your life but I gotta say good-Bye.

Ya no quiero llorar.
Why no quiero sufrir.
Necesito tu amor.
Yo me muero sin ti.
Ya no quiero llorar.
Why no quiero sufrir.
Necesito tu amor.
Yo me muero sin ti.

So many times you make mistakes, lying to the ones we love.
I should've seen this coming, but I choose to be the selfish one.
Muh mind is thinking I'll just see her one more time.
No more sneaking away to the hotel, telling these lies.
But every time we see eachother, I can't let go.
Still muh thoughts are saying you got a good gurl at home.
A good mama to the kids after she works all day.
Does she deserve to be mistreated and lied to this way? No.
But on the other hand I got you on the phone.
Telling me you can't wait to have me in your arms.
DAMN. I'm going crazy, loosing muh mind.
I shouldn't see you on the side, but it feels so right.
Maybe after tonight we can say Good-Bye.
And I'm thinking to myself this has got to be the last time.
Ya no llores baby gurl, don't cry.
You deserve somebody better, that's gonna love you right.

Maybe all just wrapped up into one

Making plans to never let you go
And if we make a promise,
Girl I never lie
Be together till we 95
Maybe you never had a man that understands, the things to make you happy---girl
But I can be the one to change it all cause see to me you just so beautiful
So when you ready for somebody
Who can really
Love you right
Give me a call, and I can be the one to love you girl until the morning light.

I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me

I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far

Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father 'cause he's down with me

I don't need no family just
A big fat check of royalties
I know what I wanna do
But I just don't seem
To get it through
And I can't do anything
And I can't do anything
You live like a wannabee
In this sick society
And you sitting next to me
Can't you fuckin' see?
I know how I ended up here
I took your piece of shit for real

This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fucking with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with

I want to give you a place to release your feelings, a star beat rhythm with a standard meaning
A word and a message with a lot of emotion, with total dedication and a lot of devotion
And a lot of devotion, I want to give you devotion

Well let's start here at the beginning of my lyric, to be too bad to rhyme is not a merit
To rock to roll for soul is what I aim for, wait till I hit the goal and that's a top score
Some tunes are long others with an ease, to write my rhyme in line when there's a cool breeze
Keepin' on and on and on and on till you get the job son, job's nearly done

Hooh-hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh-hooh-ooh-ooh...
I want to give you devotion, I want to give you devotion

Well magical moments, moments are magical, star call, mystical, logical, lyrical
Magical moments are meant to be kept, don't erase them from your brain I need to inject
I have a dream, but there's a nightmare inside, it's getting me uptight for the sight is a fright
'Cause the night creeps in, creepin', creepin', slowly gassin', frightnin', spooky
'Cause a frightnin' nightmare can terrorize, poll tax came and up went the rise
Open your eyes and realize I'm a truly disguise, like hawk the slayer he came and caught me
Maggie came but now she's slaughtered

MC Miker G,"We celebrate seven weeks Miker G and Sven
We took a holiday with all our friends
It was a time to relax and let your worries behind
Exactly seven weeks or something crossed my mind
It was the shine of the time we never forget
One morning our parents kicked us out of our beds
We told them it was stupid, don't play the fool
But the answer was short you gotta go to school

G's running up and down and everybody know
Rappin', rockin', poppin' in the street-kid-show
Miker G rocks the house and you know what I'm saying
Now when he's on the mic there will be no delaying
So you better run to see him in your neighborhood
He's rappin', rockin' all the way to Hollywood
Hey, check it out, these are the words we say
Yo, scream with us: we need a holiday

We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Miker G and Sven are here to stay)
We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Hey, check out the new style we just play)
We are going on a summer holiday
If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (right)

We are going on a summer holiday
If you want to go, yo, Sven
We're going to London and New York City
And we take a little piece of Amsterdam (right)

I wanna holiday, I screamed a lot
Your only thing, school's the only thing I've got
Sven's parents told me I better go
'Cause Sven's hangin' on the street in the street-kid show
In the bar Rox what happened to you?
I told him it's my life and I know what I'm doin'
I saw the school I thought I'd never stay
Give me seven weeks again, I need my holiday

Well, this is my partner with the number one jam
Famous in the Boogie Bronx and Amsterdam
He's the fastest rapper, yo, his name is Miker G
His rap is stronger than the sucker MC's
Well, let me show you what my man can do
Rappin', rockin', poppin' and the boogaloo too
But anyway, no more delay
Just listen to the beat-box he will play

My name is MC Sven, and also deejay
I didn't like the schools, So I took another way
You like the Miker G, I use my voice
And soon I bought a big Rolls Royce

That's right, my name is Miker G
I use the holiday with the M.I.C
On the street was a party bigger than Hollywood
I grew up in this world, started in the neighborhood

We gonna ring-rang-a-dong for a holiday
(Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say)

Bite is the thing most rappers do
But I can write my own thing too
I can understand things most rappers say
Cause rappin' is my thing and I do it every day
I'm the number one rapper, yo, my name is Sven
I can rap more raps than a superman can
So I'm the guy on your radio
Also rockin' to the rhythm in stere-ereo

And you don't stop that body rock
And you won't stop that body rock
Yo, spell my name right, I'm Miker G
M-I-K-E-R and ""G, you see
Yo, M is microphone and G's genius
Miker G in the house, that's serious
And you know that, and you show that
It's time, Sven, so let's go back

Só questão de tempo
Só questão de chance

Alegria viciante

Parece coisa de novela
Um olha pro outro
E, quando vê, já era
Sentado na minha cama
O pensamento vai nela
Que coisa estranha, loucura pampa

Eu nem te dava bola
Toda simplesinha, quieta indo pra escola
Cabelo arrumado, sapato fechado

Que você tinha um rebolado

MC Pooh,"""Life.. it's all about sex money and murder.
To all those motherfuckers out there who can't deal with it;
You just a punk ass bitch!""

[MC Pooh]
Sex money and murder -- elements of the streets
You either play the role or get your god damn ass beat
See I can get the pussy and money is a must
Try to stop me -- ashes to ashes, dust to dust

The suckers try to win, let the games begin
Meet me, Ant Banks, Kenny Wayne and the mac-10's
We were born to die any god damn way
Here last week, but you're dead today

No time for the bullshit, let the bullets disperse
Hospital to the morgue to the motherfuckin hearse
Deep in the game, since I was eleven
The streets are hell, so what the fuck is heaven?

I'm one of the biggest baby and refuse to get took down
A god damn killer comin straight from the Oaktown
Step out of line, it's manditory I hurt ya
My hobbies in life -- what? Sex money and murder

[Chorus: MC Pooh]
Sex from your bitch (""run.. run up punk"")
Money from the crack (""death.. death is a cycle"")
Murder is a hobby... murder-murder is a hobby..
Murder-murder is a hobby that I had since way back

[MC Pooh]
I live the life of a criminal and hustle each day
Fool step wrong, live loose, get blown away
The ave is the only home I knew
So to get what I got, I did what I had to

Kill, deal, rob -- I didn't give a fuck
You had what I needed? You was shit out of luck
A chopper is mandatory, to lose is another story
Fools try to get with me, wind up history

You just mad, cause I got yo' bitch
And now she's ridin on the Dangerous dick
And I can tell by your face, you're mad and full of steam
'Cause now your bitch is on Pooh-Man's team

She's my bitch, was yo' bitch, come and sucks my dick
It don't stop with this young-ass trick
Run up punk -- and watch yo' friends desert ya
Because my lifestyle punk - sex money and murder

[Chorus]

[MC Pooh]
So much shit, gettin talked by the other crowd
Always talkin and don't know what the fuck about
I get criticized, ridiculed and other shit
But they go wild when I yell out bitch

So I can take a little criticism and laugh
And tell the critics they can kiss my ass
I ain't trippin, my money is made..
... I kick back and I straight get paid

Rated X is life, motherfuck PG
Death is a factor on the Oakland street
If you can't deal with life, don't fuck with my rap
It's like this, cause it happen like that

Sex from your bitch, money from the crack
Murder is a hobby that I had since way back
A hit ain't shit, I learned it in class
Creep slow, shoot fast

This is the way I live, fuck pain and torture
Believe in life... sex money and murder","Sex, Money & Murder",1991
MC Ren,"Now this is the bitch who makes straight A's,
But never got to leave out of the house back in de dayz
And when she was at school she gave people dirty looks,
She always carried books and thought me and my friends were crooks,
You always see the bitch in the classes,
She never wore pants she wore a dress and some glasses,
Teachers used to rag, she was the teacher's pet,
Every nigguz used to brag how much they want to make her wet,
Straight to her butt 'cause yo she ain't tall,
But you would say fuck her when you saw the bitch walk,
Ass hanging out by the pawn,
And that's another reason why niggaz wanted to get her panties down,
She kept to herself in the hallways,
And never looked at niggaz like old day,
And when the last bell rang she was gone,
So one day I decided to follow the bitch home,
Her mother was at work she would'nt get home 'till 6,
So it was time for ren to put the bitch in the mix, 
'Cause back in the school it was every nigguz dream,
So now it's time to get a closer look behind the scene!

""All the pimps, the hores, the pulldaggers, the cocksuckers,
 Gave 100$ bill just to see""

Now I made it to her house but she would'nt let me in yo,
So I said fuck it, smack around to the window,
She get into the room and start to undress,
Now I'm biting on my lips saying ""damn this bitch is blessed!""
The doorbell rang, it was the nextdoor neighbor,
And he was axing up could she do him a favour,
She grabbed de nigga's hand and took him in the room,
And laid on the back as he fucked her with a broom, 
She said she wanted back up so then she said,
She wanted him to eat the pussy so she grabbed his head,
And he started eating it like a thanks-given dinner,
He made the bitch come and then he put his dick up in her,
She smashed up his back with the cloth,
But she was screaming so loud he had to gaggle with his toes,
But after they finish fucking yo the bitch took a shower,
To wash off the sweat from the last half hour,
The bitch put out some bud and then she started to smoke,
Took his wicked jack daddy and made a few miles of cock,
The nigga said shit gotta go,
Bcuz this innocent little girl is a whore!
Yo BEHIND THE SCENES!

""Nobody in .. My neighborhood"" MiX

Now I went back to school the very next day,
And I knew that my niggaz won't believe what I had to say,
I told them what I saw and nigguz said ""yeah right"",
So I told the mothafuckaz to come over there tonight,
Now there's 10 real niggaz at her window,
Waiting to see a whore like alamat natio(?)
They thought that I was lying 'cause we waited 1 hour,
And when we started to leave the bitch walked out da shower,
Ass on the round the bitch do it in her bed,
Her bottomlips was hanging and she started fingerbanging,
Her daddy walked in and started beating her with a belt,
The bitch was so hot she made the leather start to melt,
But she was liking it,
Yelling ""daddy give it to me harder"",
Then he took off all his cloth and start fucking his doughter,
My niggaz outside did'nt believe what they would see-some,
But when her mama got home, they turned into a threesome,
Her mama ate the pussy while her daddy doggy sounded,
The family freak together and they also laid together,
I could'nt take them all 'cause I was too much of a man,
So I jumped back to the window with my dick in my hand,
The hand in the money kept to her neighbors' door,
'Cause now it was even it was 2 against 2,
But a couple minutes after I was in,
All my niggaz jumped in all 10 yo behind the scenes!

""This is the bitches and the ho's crew""

""Yes daddy I love you""

""She like suckin' on dicks .. And lickin' on nutts .. And they even take
 The broomstick on her butt!""",Behind the Scenes,1992
MC Ren,"Hey, hey Ren, hey check this out loc
Hey man I've been hearing a gang of niggas 
Talking a whole lot of unnecessary bullshit man, 
What if one of 'em trick ass niggas 
Come at you the wrong way loc'?

[MC Ren]
I'll beat a niggas ass on the trick just for the hell of it
There the motherfucking piece of pussy there's no tell of it
I don't give a damn I'll beat a nigga like he's stole somethin'
And then I'll let the motherfucker know where Ren is coming from
I'm from Compton everybody's on the wagon
I'm looking for niggas that's thinkin' 
That they're the shit, that's who I'm taggin'
Never asking questions I just go right in and do it
And if you're thinking that you can fuck with Ren
You bitch already blew it
Like I said before, fools want up in my shoes
But after fucking with me
They're givin' up rap, and they're singin' the blues
Me and DJ Train dropping bombs like a P2
So you should get the picture or if not, you get a preview
That we don't take no shit
Cause MC Ren ain't a nigga that you want to try and fuck with
Kick a little ass in my spare time
To keep myself occupied when I'm not bustin' up a rhyme
Writin that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Chorus]

(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(MC Ren) Ya fuck with me ya gotta fuck with a Mack 10

[MC Ren]
Now throw your hands in the air and let me see ya slap a hoe
Start the violence going on through an MC Ren show
I don't give a fuck if niggas is fighting in the crowd
I only got one concern, that's my vocals pumping loud
I'm standing on the stage I got my niggas to my right
I bust a couple of verses 
Then jump in the crowd and get with the fight
I hit a nigga off in the head with a chair
The reason for that, the motherfucker he was standing there
Then DJ Train will grab the gauge, just in case a motherfucker 
Talks shit, he'll be the victim on the front page
He's on his way to the morgue, to kick it with the rest 
Of them motherfuckers that I gave free room and board
So when ya at my show
Let me see ya throw your hands up in the air and slap a hoe
Cause that's the only noise I want to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Chorus: x2]

[MC Ren]
The final frontier makes an average nigga wonder
Why they do a couple of records and then they go up under
Try to copy Ren but Ren just can't be duplicated
Motherfuckers making pussy shit so I come in and fade it
Slap the niggas like bitches if they have to talk back
Put my foot so deep in their ass they have a hole and not a crack
The shit just makes a nigga laugh, cause niggas be coming up to me 
Asking me why did I leave size 10 Nike in that ass
I tell 'em I had to do it was part of the plan
To try to stop the fools jacking off by the hand
Putting wack records in the make
By using R&B fucking singers in the god damn breaks
Try to go commercial but they started out street
That's reason why they're still driving their two feet
Thinking they can diss Ren's flow, but singing and dancing
Don't go with the format that I be using in my show
It's just hardcore niggas acting crazy on the stage
Wearing gangsta clothes yo and spitting on the hoes
Doin' that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

MC Ren,"The year is 87'
Back in the 12th grade G
When I used to hang with CH to the IP hangin' in the halls
Tryin' to get the young bitches ridin' my ballz
We got dissed 'cause we were jog' and kept to ourself shyo
Because it's all about self
We used to try to get the number and the name
But back then - they wanted mothafuckaz in the dope game
We used to try to fuck with ho's
In our graduatin' class there was no woman givin' up the ass
We go to a dance, we see ho's rollin' eyes on my crew,
But what the fuck can I do?
They would'nt even give a nigga like me a chance thou [why?]
Because my feet was my transport
You ax 'em to dance they start to riff
And on the way home niggaz never gave us a lift
But now the tables turned around
Every mothafucka and his mom would want to be down
I see the bitches at the clubs, the same ones
They're thinkin' they're fine and also runnin' the same line :
""What's up Ren, we used to be in the same class""
I'm shakin' my head yeah, now listen to line ass
They ax me what have I been up to,
Knowin' damn well I made money for my record sales
I zip on my drink and say see ya
'cause only a four leg and pregnant mud can be ya'

People that used to hate me
Now when they see me they speak first
But used to demon raps 'cause I cursed
They used to say I would'nt make it 'cause I use profanity
And call myself a Nigga With an Attitude
But once again the tables turned around
Niggaz tryin' to be down - walkin' up like a hound
Especially the ones that never had nothin' to say
Now they talk to me like enow and everyday
Axin' me what's up with Eazy
Or Dr. Dre, yo did he marry Miss She'ly?
Or did the D.O.C get his voice back,
And niggaz think I'm mean when I say I'm not a magazine
'cause when I come around I want to kick it
The ..... is axin' me for concert tickets
The same fools, that used to go to my school
When you see my on the streets just chill and be cool
So if you really want to be down -
Don't crowd around a nigga like a hound!

The hound-dogs, they come in all shapes n' sizes
Jackin' 'round Ren with a gang o' surprises
Nothin' but a groopy in sheep's clothin'
The shit makes me lough when the homies want an autograph
I feel like I'm on a talkshow
Because they ax all the questions then say they gotta go
Never want to know how I'm makin' out
All they want to know is when my alboum's commin' out
Or ax me - 'Yo Ren, when are you goin' on tour?'
I tell 'em 'the same time like I told you before'
Then there's always one beggin' for me to kick hm down
For pissin' on my leg I never knew you you fuckin' hound!
So go back to your home and fetch yo' bone
And quit retrievin' on mine 'cause nigga you got your own
And talk about me behind my back - nigga please!
So much of a hound, all you're missin' is your flees
Scratchin' all day because you're itchin'
You're tryin' to get news wishin' you was in my shoes
But trippin' like that you'd never be down
'cause Ren don't likes a fuckin' hound - 
You straight hound-dog!",Hounddogz,1992
MC Ren,"You kiss my black ass because you sucked my dick off
My balls are fallin out of your mouth when you cough
This is for the people in the business, the people in the streets
And most of all it's to the wack muthafuckas with wack beats
Fools on the streets wish they was in my shoes
Cause every day they wake up, they see me on the news
I'm hittin number one the first week that I'm released
And my muthafuckin business and my bank account increase
Bitches ride the poke and niggas ride the sack
So I guess that you can say they're both caught in the impact
Niggas in my neighborhood ain't about nothin
The po' broke muthafuckas think I owe em something
But I don't owe em shit but a 'what's up' for a hello
And ask for a job, the answer is, ""Hell no""
Go back to the corner with your brew and be angry
Cause lookin at me crazy, that shit ain't gonna change me
But some of them are cool, and they know who they are
The ones that used to kick it with me when I couldn't afford a car
But the others talk shit behind my back
The main muthafuckas always sayin they gotta rap
Wait to make a record like it happens overnight
But the rhymes are always sloppy and they're never ever tight
Then they get pissed when I tell them that it's wack
But Ren ain't a pussy, so step the fuck back
And kiss my black ass

I'm tired of rappers with live instruments on the stage
Save the shit for parades
And while you're at it, why don't you dress like a clown
And draw yourself a permanent frown
Cause the pioneers didn't draw bands in the blueprints
Because it wouldn't make sense
Rappers doin this should retire
Niggas lookin like Earth, Wind & Fire
People don't go to rap shows, so they can hear a band
It's like a man tryin to fuck a man
It defeats the whole purpose
It's like a fish tryin to swim on the surface
A big circus, all that's missin is a tent
Because the shit ain't worth five cents
So a nigga like Ren'll take a stand
To say a real rap artist don't need a band
All you need on the stage is meat and bones
Save the band shit for Quincy Jones
And no more singin on the breaks, please
The shit is spreadin fast like disease
And for them I'll be a cure, pure
You know that I know I'm sure 
So I'ma trap on my lure
Every hypocritical muthafucka that's suckin with the rap
Give him a real nigga slap
Kiss my black ass

Now rappers in the business talk shit behind my back
Just because their shit ain't sellin and people call it wack
But when I go to clubs, I get the utmost respect
Them jealous muthafuckas know I clock crazy checks
Sayin I wouldn't sell if I didn't cuss
But while they fuss, I'm goin, gone, they goin dust
Barely standin the light of the lime
Life's a bitch with some pussy-ass rhymes
But they always on my dick when they see me
I think beneath that point, they want to be me
I don't break my neck to be in other niggas' videos
Standin around like hoes
But them other niggas gotta do it for pub'
Because nobody recognize them in the club
And when they see me they want to kick it, so people'll stare
Quit swinging on my dick hairs
And as soon as I leave, the muthafuckas start yappin
Run they mouth like a bitch, better than they do rappin
And I don't need a crew
Because a crew can't do shit that a real nigga can't do
So to all y'all niggas that's down with a crew
How does it feel ot be number two?
Kissin another nigga's ass so you can slick sign a autograph
And move people out his path
And that's the reason I'ma diss you
Stuff your mouth with tissue
And kiss my black ass",Kizz My Black Azz,1992

How de fuck can you believe, that people turns to spirits?
Don't run with that bullshit because I don't want to hear it
The shit that you learned in the church - it only was worth
A bottle of piss, now lemme tell you what you missed :
Jesus was'nt white like the lion devil told you
He's the same devil that brought you from africa and sold you!
Made you take the white men's name and now you're one with the same
Playin' all of his devilish games
Ho' runnin' 'round in 93' with your slavemaster name 
like a Fool happy as you can be
Believe it in a burnin' hot hell
But the only hell you got was in the white men's jail cell
The devil owns every fuckin' thing
I doubt you can't make it unless you can tap or fall or sing
Now niggaz will be trippin' 'bout the shit I'm 'bout to speak
How can you go from the streets turnin' to chicks and eatin' pig feet
Lookin' for dope face turnin' to a hog
Mothafuckaz happy you ain't died from the smog
Niggaz got these white devil bitches for the ho's
Don't bring 'em in the room 'cause the bitches are doomed
 ..

""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""
""And you have believed those ideas and concepts""

If you see a nigga with a white ho' beat his mothafuckin' ass
Remind a mothafucka of what happend in the past
Let me tell you somethin' that I think you oughta know
He's the same devil that came from ... 30 years ago
Then you got niggaz that's blacker than the night
Runnin' 'round town sayin' their best friends are white
Niggaz like that are gonna hang up from a tree
And burn 'em up aloud and let everybody see
'cause in 93' we'll come and burn down your store
When niggaz sign up ....... 54'
If you hate the devil you should fall right then
'cause all we're lookin' for is a few good men
So niggaz here we go here we go it's a trip
The devil separates you by a blood and a crip
'cause he knows if you're together yo we'll beat off in his ass
Go to white neighborhood and start to blast 
Nigga you believed ..

[MC Ren]
Move, now let me fall into the groove
Breakin' niggas off but I break 'em off smooth
Used to try to pimp, but the ho's got old
A nigga can't remember how much dope that I sold
In my youth, the shit is the truth, go to jail for the proof
Niggaz makin' records sellin' two copies
Tryin' to fuck with me because your rap's sloppy
Now back in your cage your wings are short
You tall, dirty motherfuckers dig the basketball courts
I can tear ya ass up in a rhyme
But I won't mention your name, 'cause that's a waste of my time
So I call my niggas, Chip and Dollar Bill
Scoop up to the hill when we move in for the kill
Never retreat you dirty nigga take a seat
Big motherfucking feet, with your wack ass beats
So train ""What up?"" cut 'em with the shape
Make the nigga walk the plank, the dirty nigga always stank
Nigga better raise like the Titanic
Ain't from Atlantic, but I'll make your ass panic
And that's only one step, pride is kept
A glass of piss weigh as much as your rep
Nigga your through

Quad is kept, I step
With the nine millimeter come
Complicated with the gat to the back of the devil's head
Then I pull the trigger till he dead
Red rum, all I can see when I close my eyes at night
Dreamin' of vision of murderers comin' with butt, while Satan's out to fight
I ain't rappin' to tight
You're fuckin' with a motherfuckin' madman
That don't take shit from a redneck chick
You can put your mouth up my steel dick
And suck until I pull my trigger come, ejaculate my gun
What'll be done, when I be makin' your blood run
Into the stretch
And motherfuck that white trigger that got his fuckin' ass beat
Many be pussy poppin' can't attail for that knee
But not so many as I gave so much a buck, buck from me
Buck, but it gets it up, I'm tryin' to defend my own skin
From a nigga who loves crackers, so come and ya jack 'em
Sleep with the enemy and get treated as such
The convicted followed no bust, and lust for you
To make that one false move

[Bridge]

But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin' motherfucker's it would put 'em in line [Repeat: x2]

[Dollar Bill]
I was never the one to run with the pack
But was the mastermind for settin' up the jack
So if they every saw my beamin' it wasn't from crack
I must of been beamin' them grubs to hit the sack
And let me remember the days of way back
When everybody was homies and no one played that
Rockin' 'em, sockin' 'em, knockin' 'em out the box now tell me what's up
Look at me wrong fool, you get tossed up
I mean fucked up, you lucked up
I didn't come out a long time ago, with the fast or the slow flow
And callin' me wack, no that's a no no
The style just so wild, while your style just so-so
Nasty, they can't pass me, it's too fast see
Niggas that blast fast I don't let 'em blast me
Usin' my mind like a nine millimeter to abuse
So don't make one false move

Many more will laugh and suffer, many more will laugh and die

You want to fuck her, do you want to fuck her, 
The bitch is a ho, yo I thought I'd let you know
You want to fuck her, nigga you can fuck her, 
The bitch is a ho yo I thought I'd let you know

The bitch is a stripper but thinks she's a star
Still rides the bus, can't afford a fuckin' car
Try to be the shit, needs a foot up the ass
Ya stanky stanky bitch get a new bus pass
I see her all the time gettin' kicks from hard dicks
Your pussy really stinks, who the fuck bought you drinks
At the club, waitin' till two
So you can have a niggaz dick shoved in you
Yo, don't know the meanin' of cleanin' your cock
Ya burnt seven niggaz, yo, around the block
You always leave a trail, 'cause your pussy, it smell
Fuckin' ho, ya need to quit thinkin' that you're the shit
Your stomach fulla nut and just flushed a baby
Ya dumb fuckin' bitch yo ya must be crazy
So get back in your place ya little bitch I ain't no sucka
'Cause all my niggaz fucked her

(CHORUS)

Well here we go in this video bitch
Crabs on her pussy, got no choice but to itch
Yo, she suckin' niggaz dick for two seconds of airtime
Went so fast, didn't see your triflin' ass
Always at the functions fuckin'
Always into somethin', fuck it, you ain't worth nothin'
You're like a disease that's what you are
Fucked the Whole Click in the back of my car
Then had the nerve to leave a stain on my seat
I shoulda slapped yo ass for doin' the same to my sheets
Every week you're on Soul Train
Lookin' like a ho, doin' the same fuckin' thing
Stretch marks, lookin' all nasty and shit
Tryin' to keep down your shirt to prevent from gettin' hurt
But 'cha brought it on yourself ya ho
Ya lost a stupid bitch and don't know where the fuck to go
So quit tryin' to pretend
'Cause you'll get broke down by a nigga named Ren
So peep it out real slow
Next time you about to pimp a ho

(CHORUS)

If ya want to fuck her think again
She might not be the type of bitch you want to put your dick in
But she might suck a good dick, yo, and make ya nut quick so
Never let her go 'cause she's nothin' but a ho
But then again she might start to bitch 'cause she's nothin' but a bitch
Shoot the bitch, a dead bitch, then bury the bitch, a gone bitch

This is a stick-up, everybody get face-down
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
Tie 'em up for the fact that I'm kickin' ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out
This ain't personal, but now I'm about
To commit a crime and go through with it
You know what, no need for shakin', because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearin' a badge, but he's a ol ass man
Pump his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know, so me and my gang just can't be seen
Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers can see
And smile, you know, cause I'm controllin' the shit
And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so

Alright
Empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny
Takin all you stupid motherfuckers' money 
Peepin at a bitch cause my dick's on hard
Laughin at the dumb ass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not sayin' a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin
And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin
Took her to the backroom, about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn"", then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind, was goin' up in her
The suspense was makin' me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn"", dropped the gat from my hand
[What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man]
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so

[Repeat x4]
[""Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt""] 

[I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot]

Stackin up the money and there's more to collect
Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see
[Three motherfuckin police starin at me; what to do now?]
Hurry up and get on
Allright, tell me, who is the motherfuckin alarm?
I'm a give ya a chance, and count to three
Or else five of ya bitches are comin with me
[Police: Allright, Allright, come out niggaz, or we're coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in]
Fuck you! We got hostages, and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sendin out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
[Police: They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage!]
[MC Ren: You stupid motherfucker tryin' to run
Now you're dead as fuck tryin' to race a gun]
[Police: Allright, this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast]
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin
With screamin hostages, runnin and chokin
Gettin away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range, by a motherfuckin cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
So, y'all know what time it is

[DJ: Yo man, where you callin' from ?]

[DJ: What's it called man ?]
[Guy1: Yo, it's called ""Radio""]
[DJ: We got it, you called the right station. And here it is...]

Eazy E rockin' non stop on the radio
with the funky fresh hip hop in stereo
Release some rhymes that you will find demandin' 
with Dre's beats that are so outstandin'
I'm gettin' busy if you know what I mean
Always settin' me a mark in the hip hop scene
On the radio the greatest of all times
like Mohammed Ali cause I punch rhymes
So tune your station, and clear all the static
and tell the truth: you didn't know that I had it 
in me, to be easy about the situation
So just kick it and listen to the station
playin' my music, it's hard to lose it
It's constantly on request cause you choose it

Your request is clear, that you're givin'
Without Eazy E you wouldn't be livin' 
with me on a top 10, or a mix show
So hit your power button, and let's go
on vacation, with your station
that's playin' live in every location
Blowin' out ya speaker
it won't get weaker
I'll keep rockin' till I hit the peek
And your station is dope E-A-Z-why
It's on the air, but you axe why
I took out the cursin', and took rehearsin'
I feel dry, you know that I'm thirstin'
to get busy; I don't quit it

On the radio you get more looser
Take my word you're a dope producer
We combine to put out hits
but jealous people, they just have fits
cause we get airplay, but we're not through
Dre, am I serious ? [Dr.Dre: Cold word] Well thank you !

Makin' a way with dope style

A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set
Hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal
Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless

But most I think know not to deal with me

Yeah 'cause this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it

And now that it's done, I know ya pleased

Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D

Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nothin' can avoid this shot 'cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckers on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y

Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it

Peepin' out their hair 'cause that spot is hot
And that's real

(CHORUS)(2x)
Nigga gotta keep my shit real
Lettin' punk niggaz know how the fuck I feel
Pussy ass niggaz always want to be around
A nigga like Ren when I put that real shit down

Randy up the street cuttin' up the fresh fade
And Compton P.D. around the corner 'bout to raid
The yellow helicopter hangin' 'round like a gnat
And hood rats yellin' out a car where the party at
My robbin' train go and get a duce
And niggaz 'round the way don't give a damn about a gang truce
But I gotta lotta love for my people
And like they ain't tryin', niggaz just keep dyin'
I won't be like most niggaz and just come 
And shoot my video in Compton and disappear for a year
We make fools like that shake the spot
One for the treble jack yo ass in the parkin' lot
'Cause handkerchief headed niggaz come around fakin'
Braggin' 'bout that money they be makin'
Boot lickin' butt dancin' niggaz just better chill
Before I tell 'em how I feel and that's real

(CHORUS)

Yeah, uh, break it down
All y'all busta ass niggaz
Do it like this, 1995
Uh, yeah, come all y'all fake ass niggaz to this

Goin' to the pad hit the beach up on the pager
Here comes Korleone up the street in the mini-Blazer
While the dominoes start to get shakin'
The same time that the barbique start bakin'
I don't eat swine, but I take a turkey burger
I can't fade worms, that books' full of terms
Homies pass by, some stop and conversate
On a gang a topics we start to debate
On why in black neighborhoods is always towed down
And white neighborhoods ain't one piece a trash 'round
So we gotta do for self and quit bitchin'
Recycle black dollars so we can roll Impalas
Every street got their own rap artist
On every cover every brother got a gun tryin' to look the hardest
But some deserve a slap 'cause they laid down they strap
When they hear that's a rap and that's real

(CHORUS)",Keep It Real,1996

God of the univers I control your soul, shaking niggaz up
from the bottom of the north pole. In my double S four
fifty four with my size ten still towe showe to the floor.
It's simple, don't want to make it complicated, 'cause ya
simple minded niggaz might get frustrated, with ya bang-
bang boogie, 'cause Ren heard enough, 'cause niggaz don't come
with the funky stuff, that I used to hear in 83 and 84,
when shit had to be hardcore, ciminal minded,
you've bin blinded, I'm lookin' for some shit like that
but can't find it, 6'n the mornin', police at my door,

'Cause my assistance was fuckin' too many dicks
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Fuck it, nigga makin' dead presidents

For a penny, all they feelin' is the jimmy
Like Rick James I'm bustin' out on the funk
Nothin' up my sleeve, the shit is in the trunk
But don't make me bop that shit, and it's on
'Cause I can get rocky like Sylvester Stallone
Niggaz shootin' stones, motherfuck a sly
If I wanted to I could hit ya with my third eye
Then you'll be in a deep sleep
So bring the band by, 'cause nigga chokin' like I mad fly
I'm still takin' niggaz out
With the shit that's droppin' out my mouth
'Cause, I'm still the same nigga

Yeah minute you win it, a nigga ain't a loser
It's a black nigga hittin' corners on a beach cruiser
Or you might catch a nigga in a Chevy
'Cause my motherfuckin' shit is so heavy
Rap skits kicked to the curb, they gets no play
When I'm rollin' in the 4-54 in L.A.
Fuck the radio and they format
I got bitch made nigga killa wrote on my doormat
So niggaz don't ring my bell
I gotta bad attitude and I'm mad as hell
'Cause I break God damn necks with my rhymes
Niggaz in the street don't want to fuck with mine
Devil's be askin' what I did
Tell 'em I make funky ass records, plus I built pyramids
But niggaz in the streets I'm a good fella
In the trench like Gotti, and the umbrella

Your motherfuckin grill, I'ma rearrange it
See my niggaz in the Regal about to be illegal
Send them to your crib like you Bennie Sigel
Fucker, you wanna be my hoe, here's a black skirt
Now shove this dick off your ass cream

With the motherfuckin pimip clinic
Your ass switchin like a bitch so my niggaz had to go up in it
Until your butt checks start to bleed
Cause these fly playin that I be droppin niggaz wanna feed

Nigga ten years passed and we still up in that ass
Will I make it or continue and
Look at all the shit you in

Niggaz in the hood be comin' up feel it
Can you set it off, for again, you know you should
Yo let's that this shit back
To 1989
Where this nigga shoot and bust and niggaz know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers
Egyptian fan base
Feelin' on the scene, all the fools got erased
Threw a mothafuckin' monkey wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't ever been the same
Opened up doors for the niggaz that be thinkin
that your flows be on tizight
Bitin' what I wrizite
Jokin' when I recite
Feelin' manuscripts
When I MC, if it ain't rough it ain't me

Yo mothafuckin' G'z, nigga like Eric Wright
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight
Cause when y'all niggaz started rappin', who'd you try and be?
I'ma slap you cause you lying, if you don't be sayin' me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tappin'
Shoot the government before you niggaz started rappin'
Now its ? city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at the shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou
Try to block it out, but you never knew how
And when I walk through the crowd
I'm seeing mothafucka's bread
I hear their bitches sayin' ask MC Ren
Makin' fools sway when I roll to King Tet's
Because I started cussin' all you fools gettin' checks
Ruthless for life, see that be my state of mind
y'all can kiss my black ass one more time

Chorus X2

I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
villain want that bomb so I get with L.T.
Ain't nothin' changed
We find 'em, fuck 'em, then flee
While you hatin', pillow talkin', with that bitch, she want me
Niggaz weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sippin', y'all niggaz be trippin'
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Invest in drug money, shit, still gettin' in
What it take for y'all quit
Ruthless got it on lock
y'all shootin' videos tryin' to look like Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowin' up your spot
My little brother Jubee and the big homie Rock
Full circle, all this shit gon' repeat
When this shit drop, niggaz clownin' in the streets

So I'm cockin up the can and ready to make them do some gas
And do some flippin, and all that
Cause niggas out here shot call, get they ass jacked
And that's the main fact, big payback for you punk muthafucks
Disrespectin the crew, it's mandatory that I buck
Ass down from comptown, mr. shot caller
Gonna be a fast faller if he ain't a fast talker
Fast walker, or better yet better be a fast runner
Chill on the scope with the cannon, finna gun ya
Dumpin 9 to the gut like ""nigga, what? ""
This ol' b.g. big baller, fuck the muthafuckin shot caller

Mhhmmm
That's right
Take a voyage
Where?
All the way down
Down where?
Down where?
Down where?

(Verse 1)
Niggas be thinkin the Villain has stopped givin Compton props
Nigga you smokin off that muthafuckin stress
That your ass was chokin
CPT, I'm straight out, that's my muthafuckin heart
You can't tear me apart, they gave a nigga a start
It's crazy niggas in that bitch, plenty hoes to match
Plenty pussies to fuck, and plenty bitches to catch
Niggas be doin what they got to do, family's a need
Compton niggas hit that pussy so hard, make it bleed
Niggas hittin switches, and movin pounds of dope
So cluck-head muthafuckas got they rocks to smoke
Niggas be killin other niggas when they get in they path
White muthafuckas gives a fuck, they sit back and laugh
These undercover tight bitches be playin the tease
Got my dick hard as fuck but she want the pennies
Niggas be hatin 'cause I'm doin what the fuck they want to do
Niggas still be havin love for you (be havin love)
Uhh!

(Chorus)
Compton (he's back to you)
Compton come back to me (he's back to you)
I know, I know baby

(Verse 2)
Niggas be at the park, tryin to set the pussy up for the night
Baby you can suck this dick just as long as you don't bite
Go back to the crib, we do that soopafly scene
Fuck your ass in the tub, rub my dick with vaseline
Make my shit stretch all down your throat
Quit tryna talk with that shit in your mouth just write a note
Or use sign language if you need some air
I'll chase your ass around the room, fuck that pussy anywhere
I'm just a Compton nigga, no matter where the fuck I be
Niggas don't get high, with me, I'm just writin what I see
It's reality that's all a real nigga know
All that ""Slob/Cuzzin"" and bullshit - it gots to go
All these niggas know, Villain kickin the real
I gives a fuck how these muthafuckas feel
Niggas hate me 'cause I'm doin what the fuck they want to do
Niggas still be havin love for you (and I know)
Check it!

(Chorus)
Compton (he's back to you)
Come back, come back to me, yeah
Ohhhhh...(he's back to you)
Ohhhhh...I know, I know

Nigga who the fuck got that street shit (LA niggas)
My nigga who the fuck got that street shit (Real niggas)

(MC Ren)
A motherfuckin fiend, before I became a teen
the villain was fuckin with bitches instead of cones or ice cream
Niggas be killing the villain like aids with whack rhymes
these niggas don't be havin no lyrics
All they talk about is nines and chronic
The villain be doing that but I can switch up
kick some unreleased shit nigga pick your bitch up
The villain be killin you niggas that's running with clicks
Ren be own em'
niggas be running with clicks cause they can't do it on they own lonesome
From CPT to NYC, I keeps it hot
bitches be worshiping a nigga with shrines and parking lots.
Ten years of damage motherfucking rap god
traded in the Dayton's on the foe with 3 tripods
The villain be travelling at the speed of light, cause I might
be uniden-tah-fied if I come whack, mothefuckers late at night
Niggas be waking up forgetting the whole thing
nigga it ain't over till the hoe sing, bitch sing it
 
(Chorus) 2X
 
(MC Ren)
Ain't shit changed, still making bitches pussy's hot
hanging with niggas from Compton carryin big glocks
Fucking em' car hops trippin off some paint and gold D'z
bitches be happy to hold these
Hanging with rap niggas like Lez and Joe Clair
niggas from Compton multiply and seen everywhere
Making your spot hot attract the feds and protest
kidnapping bitches and make the scene grotesque
Real niggas and bitches niggas hanging out
CPT dwelling shots reigning out
Selling coke, hoes taking dicks down they throat
bitch niggas coming up pissin all you find is a ransom note
New release, promotin fucking police
crooked motherfuckers hot cause I won't give em' a piece 
MC motherfuckin REN  back at cha'
niggas bit my shit the villain ain't mad at cha'
 
(Chorus) 2X
 
(MC Ren)
A nigga sittin on the curb rats catch whip lash
same hoes when I was little, fucking niggas for cash
Now they baby mommas cause they wanted niggas with dope
stuck with stretch marks and niggas names tattered by they throat
Some on they tittys, ankles and ass
every neighborhood got these stankin tricks from the past
They be at the clubs, pussy's used up
they tiitys six feet, there stomachs lookin bruised up
Real niggas turn the light out
nigga till they child's through
These hoes today be havin niggas rob you
Just to come up, so niggas can fuck em' with cheap weed
makin motherfuckers go and drop a week seed
Thinkin they max Julie fake ass macks
all the hoes shake the spot once they smoke up your chronic sack
Who's getting played nigga you or the hoe
these bitches be fuckin you and your doe
Niggas fuck it!

(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

And he said i was the one, ha realizing the deal Heaven done

Now they blast me but they all miss
I do my 3D dance and remain undaunted
Then simply reverse the process
As the hot slugs hit their chest-plate, checkmate

Suddenly you hear there can only be one, well just X

Take ten paces and draw, but I'm sneaky with mine
Turn around at nine and blast you in your spine

Long before Charlie got knocked, until Madonna died
Young and not givin a fuck 
There ain't a nigga I ain't hit when I buck and left 'em shit outta luck
I'ma gangsta like my daddy was, hittin number spots
Sendin me to my room while he was puffin pot
Still I use to peak from the door, couldn't believe what I saw
Stacks of money on the bed and the floor
It wasn't long til I did what he did
I was an innocent kid and got exposed to the life that he lived
I went from grams into O's, pounds to bricks
On the strip pimpin hoes on some goldie shit
I'ma gangsta by destiny, OG's selected me
I earned my spot, my whole team elected me

I wanna be a gangsta
My daddy was a gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta
I wanna be a gangsta
My daddy was a gangsta

Yeah, uh, yo, uh 
Here goes this chick doing ten in the bing
But 'less we rhyme time we see her do it again
She started out fuckin dudes that resembled her father
Mom knew shoulda schooled her but the bitch didn't bother
You couldn't blame her 'cause she got it from her
She was a rider from jump, her pop's died in the hands of a chump
Now she's mad at the world, no more daddy's little girl
Now she's rockin bandanas, no more Shirley Temple girl
Now she be runnin wit some scramblers that be down in Alabama
Packin twin hammers, screamin ""Life doesn't matter""
It's a vicious cycle, her game is pretending to like you
Thinkin you getting head but she's just duckin so they can snipe you
Movin from state to state, runnin everything from guns to trains
And pushing packs from eight to eight
You know I can't say her name but she was a looker
Pretty thing, such a shame how this life has took her
Now she's raising hell in the cell, no more his are hollering
You might suffer the same fate if you repeat the following..
Sell drugs, use drugs, get caught up in the mix
End up locked up or dead in a casket, that's it",Gangsta,2005

Hey man I've been hearing a gang of niggas 
Talking a whole lot of unnecessary bullshit man, 
What if one of 'em trick ass niggas 
Come at you the wrong way loc'?

I'll beat a niggas ass on the trick just for the hell of it
There the motherfucking piece of pussy there's no tell of it
I don't give a damn I'll beat a nigga like he's stole somethin'
And then I'll let the motherfucker know where Ren is coming from
I'm from Compton everybody's on the wagon
I'm looking for niggas that's thinkin' 
That they're the shit, that's who I'm taggin'
Never asking questions I just go right in and do it
And if you're thinking that you can fuck with Ren
You bitch already blew it
Like I said before, fools want up in my shoes
But after fucking with me
They're givin' up rap, and they're singin' the blues
Me and DJ Train dropping bombs like a P2
So you should get the picture or if not, you get a preview
That we don't take no shit
Cause MC Ren ain't a nigga that you want to try and fuck with
Kick a little ass in my spare time
To keep myself occupied when I'm not bustin' up a rhyme
Writin that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren
(Black guy) Who is it?
(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren

(White guy) The black nigga that they call Ren

[MC Ren]
Now throw your hands in the air and let me see ya slap a hoe
Start the violence going on through an MC Ren show
I don't give a fuck if niggas is fighting in the crowd
I only got one concern, that's my vocals pumping loud
I'm standing on the stage I got my niggas to my right
I bust a couple of verses 
Then jump in the crowd and get with the fight
I hit a nigga off in the head with a chair
The reason for that, the motherfucker he was standing there
Then DJ Train will grab the gauge, just in case a motherfucker 
Talks shit, he'll be the victim on the front page
He's on his way to the morgue, to kick it with the rest 
Of them motherfuckers that I gave free room and board
So when ya at my show
Let me see ya throw your hands up in the air and slap a hoe
Cause that's the only noise I want to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Chorus: x2]

[MC Ren]
The final frontier makes an average nigga wonder
Why they do a couple of records and then they go up under
Try to copy Ren but Ren just can't be duplicated
Motherfuckers making pussy shit so I come in and fade it
Slap the niggas like bitches if they have to talk back
Put my foot so deep in their ass they have a hole and not a crack
The shit just makes a nigga laugh, cause niggas be coming up to me 
Asking me why did I leave size 10 Nike in that ass
I tell 'em I had to do it was part of the plan
To try to stop the fools jacking off by the hand
Putting wack records in the make
By using R&B fucking singers in the god damn breaks
Try to go commercial but they started out street
That's reason why they're still driving their two feet
Thinking they can diss Ren's flow, but singing and dancing
Don't go with the format that I be using in my show
It's just hardcore niggas acting crazy on the stage
Wearing gangsta clothes yo and spitting on the hoes
Doin' that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

Cansei de sofrimento, cansei de ser humilhado
Vou dar volta por cima, escapar da falsidade
Vou esquecer que existe a palavra dificuldade

E no dia a dia, correria, coisa séria
Passado cabuloso, me esquivando da miséria
Pedras pelo caminho tentaram me atirar
Mas deus me iluminou com o talento de cantar.

Desacreditaram, duvidaram, criticaram
Mas nunca me entreguei, nenhuma delas me abalaram

Vem sem medo, pode agarrar
Vem delícia, sente a pressão

In the night in your dream, of love so true.

Back to the grill again, the grill again 

[MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optomistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip lines that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery

Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And that will get you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the cark, parked it
Big fat blunts, if you got it then spark it

And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hitlist
Went back to the 70's and brothers got on grants
'Cause they can step to some sisters and say ""Slap me some skins""

Honey dip, and take the squad to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick em in the grill

[Chorus]

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewin
I'm a drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it

So, so, so, where did you go, what do ya know
SO many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)

R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like sasquatch (Not!)
And George Bush gets nuff props

Well, anyway, Imma slay slay lay
Pull a hoe around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me a part of history
Kicking em in the grill

Finesse, keep a Tech-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter

This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book

For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with ghonnerea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that why'all) That why'all, kick em in the grill

[Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks ?stabbabi? fakes, steady rate h
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of ""The Dialect, The Derelect""
The murder licks, Vanilla kicks alive on the crucifix

Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell more record bums
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're
Hummmmmmming, the door rings, yo I'm coming

To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guinness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
'Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder

Lyrics on a diet cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gewn to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious

Rapper dapper sapper, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some Coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill

[MC Serch]
So here's a true and false, tell me if it's factable
You want to kill the Klan, shoot the fans a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ah-yo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey

Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
'Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring

Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
To to G I'll put you in a tree like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the hoe
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio

'Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a bar called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but gave it back cause I was stingy

So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say ""Yeah I fucked your moms""
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick em in the grill

All up and down your spine I'll send the shivs
It's gettin' mighty nippy
Nipsey Russell I remember sellin' Jiffy
Hit me two times then hit me two times more
Hey yo chill, what'd you hit me for?
Oh yeah for the groove, but not the groovy train
I feel the vibes, but what does that pertain?
It's how I rock the hoodies with the hoods but I never did no hoodin'
And saw ""Gladiators"" cause of my man, Cuba Gooding
Jr., Sr., Mister Mister Big
Shake a leg, break a leg but stay, hip to the jig

Uh, c'mon now, come come now
C'mon now, can you dig it?
Uh uhh, c'mon now, come come now.
Yeah, c'mon now, can you dig it?

I've seen times change, watchin' the rhymes change
From good to bad to worse from worse to hearse
Why is it the hearse makes all the papes?
I know you're mad phony ya know like counterfeit tapes
Hit one, strip one, rip one to the bad boy and ya find
There ain't nothin' there no more
You're blowin' smoke up, where there ain't no sunlight
And I don't need K-F-C to show me how it's done right
I rip mics I grab mics I wreck mics until I'm hoarse
And when I can't rhyme I'll go home and read The Source
Peace to the streets the thugs the vandals and the hoods
You dig it, you dig it, you dug it? Good

Then c'mon now, come come now
You've got to c'mon now, can you dig it?
C'mon now, come come now
C'mon now uhh, can you dig it?

Diggin' the vibe cause the vibe is what I'm diggerin'
Triggerin' samples bigger sounds Serch must begin again
Did what I had to dig, a tractor-trailer and a rig
Cannot get this big; your voice is foul, stop smokin' cigs
And put your life back in order
Met Chantelle at Taco Bell and made a, run for the border
Saw all the dust and ma and pa doowops is who I trust
And some old school kid tried to come back but his lyrics were all rust
And mustard ketchup, sauerkraut and relish
Sell this crap I like to rap but hey yo that's my fetish
Kick the smooth style, I hope that y'all can get it
And if you don't you dig it you got it come on and kick it

C'mon now, come come now
C'mon now, can you dig it?
C'mon now, come come now
C'mon now, can you dig it?

I'm hip to the dig, I'm hip to the dig
I'm hip to the dig, I'm hip to the dig

I can be paid, and don't have to have money
Jump off a bridge, and don't have to use bungee
I like Cypress Hill, and don't have to smoke blunts
And when the beat comes in, you don't have to jump
Oh yeah, it don't have to be 'oh no'
Serch rides the rhythm, but it doesn't have to flow
You can be beefin, and not be a Tom
Go get skins, and don't have to be a John
I can raise the roof, and not have a home
Go solo, and don't have to be alone
I can be Simon, and don't have to draw
Step to the a.m. and not sit by the door
I can have pockets, and don't have to be swollen
Fat-ass beat, and it don't have to be stolen
Went a 1000 places, and didn't have to be hike that
World full of hate, and it don't have to be like that

I can come ghetto, and don't have to be a bastard
Hold a conversation, and don't have to have the last word
Shoot the gift swift, and not miss the street
Even - ehm - and not come off the beat
Oh yeah, be ??? without shootin at the earth
Even be gold, and not have any worth
You can beat beef, and don't need utensils
Write ruff rhymes without pens and pencils
Mad low end, and I don't have any treble
Be like rock, and it don't have to metal
Be in Detroit and don't have to be a Piston
Tell me a white lie, yo, I don't have to listen
I can walk, and I don't have the need
Catch a cut, but I don't have to bleed
Go to a club, and I don't have to sweat
Chill, time to go, but you don't have to get up yet

I can be the U.S., and don't have to war
I can get open, and don't need any door
I can get loud, and don't have to scream
Peace to Dr. King, and don't forget about the dream
Oh yes, oh yes, I don't have to be a yes-man
Go get married, and don't have to have a best man
I can be positive, and don't have to be a plus
If you're not gettin papes, then you're not down with Rush
I can have skills, and don't need a trade
I can be in London, don't have to like rain
Nots, nots, nots, and not have any rope
Go take a shower, but don't need any soap
Point me to the mic, I need no rehearsal
Yes, I'm the man, there'll be no role reversal
I can be blue, and don't have to be the jeans

MC Serch,"""This is probably the most challenging record
 you have ever put on your turntable..""

[MC Serch]
The facts, the facts get fried like your eggs scrambled
truth until it falls off the ledge lays dead or vexed
Tennis feds(?) need the last price, gassed ego
He don't show or know about the last nights and days
of a brother who went for his
My land built on hatred and sent to kids
Ice Cube killed his own and it was square biz
So if I say fuck you to a jew, you know what time it is
Of my own kind but not of my own mind
Came to America but became blind
Chased from the four corners of the earth
But over here it's alright, at least your ass is white
So sit down and mingle with the devil over supper
The only difference between us and a brother is the color
Instead of hittin the last nail in the coffin try to pull it out
And find out what the hard but true is all about

[Chorus]
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
So hard.. but so true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true

[MC Serch]
Hard, what?  Truth sometimes too hard to be true
So I'ma make it stick like glue
Too many times too many crimes get backed up
Case comes up, oops!  Switch all the facts up
Three kids rape a sister at St. John's
and become graduates, instead of cons
Instead of washin drawers or be somebody's whore
College wack buffed and polished and they kept the doors closed
Jail time (yeah?) Wasn't even fazin 'em
Probably one of the fathers gave the school a gymnasium
Korean kills a girl and claims insane, and gets a pardon?
Bring her honor to the court of Nickerson Garden
And get a lifetime sentence of the bent over
Tell a fool, tell a friend and then sent over
Hollow point slugs made of nothin but lead
The hard but true is takin you straight to the head

[Chorus]

[MC Serch]
Reggie McBride, yeah..
Asalaam alaikum to a Muslim
Shalom alaikum is the same to a Hebrew
Peace akeem, akeem peace to a Zulu
Tell me what's the difference why you riffin what's the point of view?
Universal greeting is the same
The game is three-sixty it don't matter what the slang
Gangs of thugs carry slugs use the mind as a glock 9
Wake the ones then shake the ones
then make the ones come into the daytime
And spark the mark labelled X
And knowledge the text
Use the wit not as a whip reload the clip then shoot from the hip
Cause yo!  This is some ol' next shit
One circle, one hurdle, one jump
One nation under the groove, and then over the hump
of racist dogs, that keep barkin in the street
Serch'll bring the hard but true to your feet, complete!

It's hard.. but it's true
The hard but the true
It's hard.. but yo, it's true

It's hard.. but it's true

So hard.. so true

Yeah Wolf & Epic, cool
Ay you, ay you ay you, ay you ay you
Ay you, it's hard but it's true

Check it...

Here it, comes!
Yo, here it is or there it was
But where was it when you need it?  Because
You fall to the waistline when you waste rhymes
Serch got it flowin when it comes to fat beats and basslines
I heard the rumors and the fables
Remove them like tumors on the tables
Boomers for the willing and the able
So turn to the next page in your manual and flim-flam, all over the jam
Chill
Lounge
Kick your ten little toes up at the end of this
Razor blade and save your spade
As the groove pummets you to another dimension
May I just mention
This is a map, it's for all made for climbin
And you're stuck to your grip like an aluminum sidin
Hiding in the back is for crumbs
Hon, here it comes!

Hit it off
Kick it off
Hit it off
Here it, comes!

be	-boys, decots will try to destroy
Delpoy the truth in black hoods and black boots
Caps get rocked only when they're fitted
Lyrics get dropped only when they're lifted
So swing time is one up, the vo-chords run amuck
Whatup?  Whatup?  I got mine and you got yours
War's a factor, we'll perspire
And someone in the crow yells fire fire
we don't need no water, let it burn yo burn yo
We don't need no water let it burn... so it burnt
Learn your lesson well, if I don't then I guess you get jelled
Swell, heads go down like the sun and here it comes

Chorus

Fiddle-fee, fiddle-fie, fiddle-foe, fiddle-fum
I smell the blood of an English
muffin, huffin and puffin
sellin his soul, J-E-L-L-O, ya know?
Roll with the squad who makes back flips stack
Hits upon this so play at your own risk
Tisk, tisk, tisky, ya shoulda used Wisk
Now you shouldn't appeal to be a Biff
Insist that your motor's on scramble
Remember the skips and enter the sample
Ample flow is created by the tears and years
Of proved and blue, perched on the front steps
Checkin for the bass loop
So the troops pulled out and the tows are paid, set and done
And here it comes...
I said here it comes!

Chorus",Here It Comes,1992
MC Serch,"Parties all around start checkin for the substance
The context you suspect, but I expect
when Serchlite hits the break..
.. headache, BREAK FOOL
with the groove that's strictly metropolitan
Past go, I'll let you go again the pen emulates
what's heard from the four wheel
And Babyface ain't never seen this crazy whip appeal
Sealed with the hits and blow cause I got hits to go
fists to flow Michel'le Michelle-low under the mistletoe
I let my missile go, yo
Hands get pound, when it comes down to slick rhymes
No respect in the deuce cool I'm vickin mines
Burnished in New York kids that rolled diesel
Kids swoll big like they were shootin up an AIDS needle
So cling to your mom's memories, calamity's a remedy
to recollect childhood memory lane
Envision, the picture, the frame
The beat that rumbles into the brain
Stains grim gloom carefree feelin, up a buildin cap peelin
Slash from the unwillin blastin off, passin off
to the prevention, locked in detention
Wielding fiends, your dome starts STRETCHIN
To hit the hot spot, and stomp hysterical
The groove that makes you thank God for miracles
Pinnacles are peakin there you find Serch..
.. hittin heads until the head hurts

Migraine, motherfuckin migraine
Migraine, motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine

Rhythm rung gets designed for the kind
that's the deaf the dumb and blind seen here and stated with that
And if you're not gonna hit that, let me rip that
rhythm hit the rhymes, we give 'em, we leave 'em
Then we'll ghost to the most so the concrete is secured
to endure, three-hundred and sixty-five days of the unsure
is the way the crumb comes clompin
That's why these boots were made for stompin
Comp is little to none, when the riddle is sung
When who is rappin no beats gets paid
The answer as he gets sprayed by the kids who survived
the playground, of the steel
Who used a fat and funky, as a sort of shiv
Deal to the crew that rolls in batallions
If water was slaughter I'd have to order by the gallon
Pestacides killed the pests, the rest are out the back
like sweats so jump out the projects, out the building
Out your condo, out your crib, out your co-op!
And let me rip the hip-hop again
Oh shit, Skeff Anslem, he gets props again
Let out the grunt, let out the funk, from out your trunk
Feel the bass and let it PUMP PUMP PUMP

Migraine, motherfuckin migraine, migraine
Motherfuckin migraine, migraine

I ain't got no DJ, but that's alright
I ain't got no dancers, but that's alright
I ain't got no choir, but that's alll-riiiiight
All I got left is the mic..
.. SO STRIKE UP THE BAND MAN, as I command man
Float up the damn damn, wash away the flim-flam
Knick-knack quick wack paddywack, give a dog a stick
Then hop off my dialect quick
to the throat I choke, I I need a Coke
cause I got somethin in my throat.. AHHA-AHEM!  Better?
Let no one get no one up gassed here
on the throttle catch a back of a forty bottle
Models can't roll put a toll into the parkin meter
Crowds around two kids in a four seater
Pack attack crunch from the boom
To give a brother ROOM, TO BREATHE, LEAVE
And pull the card our your sleeve, you're free to roam
as the beat hits the head until you gets home

MC Serch,"Once upon a time ago, long before commercialized
Beats became sysnthesized and little girls were mezmerized
There was one mic and one light in a hip-hop shack
And you moved the masses or they moved you out the back
Slack with the skills and you'll never pay the bills
Buying up the brands with the octaginal frills
But when a brother flexed, we called him the Flexor
Beats were the melody, lyrics were the texture
Rhymes were webbed and the Serch light got stuck in
So follow for the record or keep keep on truckin'
Maybe you need the method of finding what the vibe is
Recollect the whole nine just like the Prince of Tides did
Playing what's funny with Muhammed, Tip, and Phife
It's keeping it alive, not a dive from the live
But the dead so selector rewind
To the scenes that are imprinted in my mind

	Recollect, the recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect
	The scenes from the mind

Swing with the groove that got you swinging from the rafters
808 state for the kids to the gafflers
Make an impact the community can check for
And if you're on the legend tip, nuff respect for
Coming back to the crew and not to every but T-shirt
Every lunchbox, wack record, don't give a damn
Fan club, yabba dabba doo dud
You can make the fattest record yo, and still be crud
Brothers want to keep you in the heart where the home is
Where the dome is and definitely where the microphone is
Serch knows the one light is bright and don't stench and
Don't bend, so friend, I'll send the flowers to
The funeral home of the hip-hop devoured by the
Mass appeal, you get the seal of removal
Not approval, cause only Woodsy Owl gives a hoot
So nice casket nice suit
Loot can be got for the long haul by the six recs
Down the road and you can still hit the long ball
Out of there, over there to the spectators in aisle nine
Who ain't heard Quest when they told them ""Check the Rhyme""
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
I ain't eating no green eggs and swine
As I recollect the scenes from my mind, flute time

	Recollect, the recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect
	The scenes from the mind    (Repeat 2x)

Back to the mic to the stand to the light
>From the globe to the lobe to the inner ear so all night
Different tracks can be heard in different arenas
For the clubs, the heads, the rides, the Beemers
Somebody starts checking for the fact Serch is long gone
So I rip clubs from LA to Strech Armstrong
Along the tribal road we lose parts too easily
So I say peace to Eric and Beasly
Bobbito and the '97 street crew
Sec Lover, my brother Honululu
Which and proper Tom is the call for the firm grips
Serch fixes his rhymes, shoots 'em on the sperm tip
Milky is the flow, I hope it stays protected
A&R gets respect for being more selective
Cause gone are the days of the deaf, dumb, and brain dead
And I close the book on the scenes from the head

	The recollections, recollect
	The recollections, recollect

Once again, this is your brain
This is your brain on drugs *egg starts frying*
This is your brain on social narcotics
Any questions?

Do you sell drugs (No) Do you carry drugs? (Never did)
But you ain't talking about the drugs inserted in the crib
Of the mind of the youth, young and trying to adapt
To the circles and hurdles and the craps, it's on map
Get the backslap and the ""Everything's all right"" lecture
Then in school BAM! sit 'em right next to
Mister David Duke, triple K white Aryan
Who tells you pops told him that you were the lesser man
Because of drugs that were put into the books
By the crooks of culture, the truth has a mother's looks
Who blesses and loves every single day
Words from Papa triple K and 66 right way
Take the troops here Mr. ""Only Way to Stop It""
I ain't checking for the crack, I'm worried about the social narcotics

	This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)
Grumble grumble growl, toss and tumble, ow
How's he living kid (Foul!)
Spoon-feeding is deceiving because I need a fork
And if white people are superior I was delivered by the stork
Taught me that I was superior
Others are inferior, but what's important is the interior
Goddamn it, don't blame it on Janet
The nation got rhythm, but the rhythm ain't good
Not in my neighborhood
But will that change the devilish global way of thinking?
Homeboy, as fast as the eye starts blinking
But I'm just one man, one man one sister one brother one cousin
That helps another, to change change a place and change a pace
So the rats don't win the rat race
Cause every time a clock goes ""tick"" anoter falls vic
To the social narcotic

	This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)
[Fatal]
Yo social narcotics, a dangerous way of life
Talk to the young which will now deal with strife
Parents teaching their kids to be racist
So they grow up tricking, show hate to some faces
Inside the effects get me real vexed
Seeing people trying to flex case they got a color complex
Innocent children I see stay addicted
Getting high off of hate, that's why pain stays inflicted
To another color, it's a black and white fight
In Fatal's sight, that's why I gotta enlight
The blind minds of those that fell in this harsh reality
A social abuse that attacks the mentality
Cause race against race only brings friction
Pain and infliction, cause that's the addiction
Those that fall victim walk around headless
Cause the drug that they took made them an addict to prejudice

	This is my land (Nah, this is my land) (Repeat 8x)
[MC Serch]
This land is your land, this land is my land
>From the streets of Compton to the Brooklyn island
>From my people in prison to the Red Fern projects
This land was made for you and me supposedly
You never taught me true history
We killed the Indians and showed it as a victory
Original man, pilgrims saw him as a caveman
Convert to a Christian or become a slaveman
Indian brought the corn and the bread and in return
We gave 'em muskets to the head? Damn
Right back to the have-nots
Now in '92, lowered to be mascots
The Redskins, the Indians, the Atlanta Braves
What if we called the team ""The Atlanta Slaves?""
Brothers would have a field day
Don't you understand now we got to turn the right way?
Cause every time a clock goes ""tick"" anoter falls vic

[Hard Black]

Peep the math

Mau Mau be about land and freedom

Reperation and apologies, for Africa to America oddesseys

Guerilla-type tactics on them socialistic fallacies

It be about, the devestations of the social doministic thought

Keep a brown man down sport

They wantin to keep our (?) set nigga

The way Franz Fanon put it, you lucky I ain't ""wretched"" yet


[Big Black - Mos Def]

Yo, you fucked up in the game now

It's Big Black, Mr. Chairman of the Mau Mau

I hear the world in all-black surround sound

Barricaded so you can't move around now

Doin this for my clan that ain't around now

Buried six feet deep beneath the ground now

My loud sound pound down make the earth crush in and bow down

There's faultlines in the ground now - shake 'em down


[Smooth Black - Charli Baltimore]

Black Chevy, Mau Maus, gats ready

BLAOW BLAOW, black deadly, femme fatale

Underground, rats in this rat race

and black race cats sell out to the blackface

and rag grin, laugh not my light skin

be S-M-O-O-T-H from pH

UHH, backseat strappin in

cause I'm the only bitch with Big Black and them


[Chorus]

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, gun ready

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

Well how black? BLAK HEART, BLAK MIND, BLAK SOUL

Who the crew? M-A-you, M-A-you, aim fire

Bout to attack the track when BLAK IZ BLAK

How black? BLAK WOMB TIL WE REACH THE BLACK HEARSE

What's black? - SHADE OF THE UNIVERSE


[Mo Black - Canibus]

Yo, yo

Yo when Mo Black start to black out bitches pass out

Stick my black dick in they mouth and dig they back out

Black monk like Thesalonius, the government got a black phobia

That's why they tap my black Nokia

Black fathers, black mothers, black brothers

handcuffed to each other, goin upstate in black buses

Black thugs, wrap drugs in backwoods

Smoke til they got black tongues, black lips and black lungs

Blak iz blak, wack MC's get smacked

Forced to go home and dial 1-800-I-CAN'T-RAP


[1/16th Black - MC Serch]

Aiyyo who that? Yo right there; blue eyes, and black hair

Kill 'em with a rhyme, or the bottom of my Nike Airs

So quick son pick one, you don't want me to finish

or I'll quickly take you to 1950 and do you like the British

Head on a spear, contusions ear to ear

For Africa Maxima, I'ma drive you out of here

Mr. 1/16th, born to kill your self esteem

Born from part devil, part cracker from Queens

Knowledge that we drop, you don't even build with

That's like me winnin a rap Grammy, givin it to Lyn(?) Smith


[Chorus]


[Jo Black]

Yo, yo

Everything black is wack and shit

Blackheads, blackmail, black cats and shit

Funerals, niggaz gotta wear black and shit

Black cars, black clothes on they backs and shit

Blackballed, if we don't kiss they ass and shit

Blacklisted see ya nigga, and you're gone that's it

White bitches, they wanna be black and shit

Tan lotion on they white flat ass and shit


[Double Black]

Aiyyo all the Mau Maus gather up and let's attack

because they're tryin to fuck with our images

and I think that shit is crazy wack

And as a matter of fact, they want us niggaz

to smile and laugh - I guess they never seen a bloodbath

Brothers and sisters are dyin, babies are bein taken out

So what the fuck they want me to rap about?

About how happy I am, to be livin in the slum

where little shorties walk around totin big guns


[Chorus]


Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll

Hard Black droppin science, born to roll

Mau Maus droppin science, born to roll

Nigga, nigga you think these rhymes?

You think they fuckin rhymes? This this this this PHILOSOPHY

This the end of redneck-ass catastrophes

Puttin a plunger in the, ass of my history!

Forty-one shots of reality for the generations to come after me!

As it be, hell hath no FURY like a black man scorned

Nigga BLAK IZ BLAK, you've officially been warned

Nigga - you've officially been warned

You hear me? You've you you've OFFICIALLY BEEN WARNED

You've been TOLD nigga, you've been fuckin OFFICIALLY been warned

He looked at me and replied with, ""No""
I said, ""Fuck it,"" and left him there

I came back five days from then
To my surprise I seen my friend
To let you know what this thing does
He was sitting in the very same spot he was
I walked over, ""Want more?"" he said

Now I remember Jane from back in the day
When she used to go to school, get all straight A's
Now you see Jane on the street corner
Stoppin every car anytime she wanna
Whatever went wrong, the facts remain
But who could think this woulda happen to sweet old Jane

Jane's lifestory was a tragic one
She started gettin high, cause she said it was fun
There was no party, just a meeting of friends
And then the question arose: who got ends?
It went around, they had 300 in all
Somebody yelled out: ""We're gonna have a ball!""
Steve grabbed the money and ran down the block
Came back and said, ""Y'all, take a look at this rock!""
Jane was gettin into somethin heavy that night
""Hurry up quick, somebody give me a light!""
[Name] said ""Hold it!"", he was pullin too fast
But Jane was amused by the smoke in the glass
She was tickled to death at the faces they made
""Puttin fire to the glass, don't you think it won't break?""
In a flick of a flash the torch was lit
She put it to her mouth, and she took a hit

She almost broke her neck cause she thought I said ""crack""

But the body that she had just wasted away
When she used to walk by, we used to say she looked chill
But now as she passes, everybody go (ill!)
The girlie we saw hop off Mercedes Benz
She was on it so hard, she started stealin from friends
To all the drug dealers she was so in debt
That she sold her VCR and her TV set
Jane used to live the life as the storybook tells
Now everything she gets, she eventually sells
Sneak around the corner when you see Jane comin
She'll be touchin on your clothes, the girl be crumbin

If you know a girl who was the quiet type
Who acts kinda funny and a bit too hype
These kinda actions only mean one thing
She's only buggin like that cause she's suckin the thing
Not only the girls, it can happen to guys
But the fellas try to beat you, then they greet you with lies
One day Jane coulda been my honey
I just couldn't wait till the girl made 20
I see her nowadays, and all I do is sing

Coincidental how I met her
But when I seen her I knew that I'd get her
Can't let her step, she look too good
But my wears made me seem like a stone cold hood
I'm a lucky guy, so I press my luck
I step to her, ah what the fuck
Went her way, took a few steps past her
Got the nerve, and then I asked her
I said, ""Yo baby,"" and she started to reach
I said, ""Whoa, don't get excited, that's a figure of speech""
She told me her name, gave her number and all
And when I stepped, she said I better call
It took about a month, but she was finally mine
Everything was going smooth, we were doin fine
After a while it wasn't no thing
We were either holding hands or she was under my wing
She used to whisper in my hear I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[ CHORUS: TJ Swan ]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say
Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
I never did you wrong
And it seems we had such a love that was so strong

[ VERSE 2: MC Shan ]
On the day she broke out, would you believe I cried?
And it hurts so much to think of how she lied
I shared everything to the very last penny
Somethin that you really can't do with many
Since this young lady was such a big winner
I'd treat her all the time to a candle light dinner
Have a violinist play a real sweet song
And she never showed a sign that somethin was wrong
My boy used to say (Man Shan, I'd quit her)
But she seemed so happy everytime I'm with her
We used to hold hands and walk in the rain
And on the days I felt down she eased my pain
This was just too far-fetched to believe
To think that my girl would just up and leave
Imagine that - I just couldn't
Cause I knew deep down in my heart she wouldn't
All of a sudden a lot of things changed
She started actin funny, I mean a bit srange
We had little squabbles, arguments, fights
Wild stories in the days and stayed out nights
I'd say, ""Baby, where you been for all that time?
She cuddled me close and say that I'd
Be the one that she call her only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[ CHORUS: TJ Swan ]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say

[ VERSE 3: MC Shan ]
She put it to me plain, couldn't put it no clearer
Lipstick written on the bedroom mirror
Said, 'I'm leaving you now, and I know that you'll miss me
You're probably saying: Damn, man, why she dissed me?
But you see, I felt that it was time to go
Then I packed my bags, and I'm leavin, so
You take care and I hope you live long
And don't worry, there's nothing that you did wrong
You'll find the right girl someday, you'll see
Why I'm the type of woman that must be free'
I said, ""Why me?"" and fell to the bed
Reached for the 9 and put it to my head
And thought about the words that she once said
(Shan, you know that you're my one and only)
But she ran with another man and left my lonely

[ OUTRO: TJ Swan ]
O-o-o-oh girl, oh my girl
Why'd you have to leave?
Leave me so sad
Girl, you broke my heart
Oh, you drive me wild
You leave me by myself
All by myself
Girl, I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Ooh so wild
Baby drive me crazy
Leave me by myself
Leave me all alone
By the phone
I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Oh so wild
When I saw you leave me
Makes me want to cry
Girl, I'm breakin down
Breakin down
Yo, I don't know what to do

There is no implication hip-hop is wrong
Beats tapped out, played back in songs
Consider hip-hop as a verbal sport
It brings pleasure while expressin one frame of thought
Those that don't like it, then you're psychotic
To my point of view hip-hop has got it
Rhymes being written everytime you blink
With no vital signs of becoming extinct
Try to demolish, it will not be worth
Killing all hip-hop fans on earth
Don't try to compare it, there's no relative
The word to describe hip-hop: creative
Once you're at a party you're in hip-hop's lair
To downgrade all, how could one dare?
Once upon a time they used to play soul
>From there they went to rock 'n roll
Rock died down, then along came pop
Now you're livin in the world of hip-hop

I am the creator of my hip-hop style
With a level of college understood by child
Hip-hop is being moved on a one-way course
Up and being led by an unseen force
You try to hold it down, won't be no good
The more it gets exposed, the more it gets understood
It's all fantasy, yet all realistic
Often complicated, other times simplistic
Lyrics so sharp, they can cut like a knife
I'm sworn by oath to the hip-hop life
Less live drums, less guitar strumming
Hip-hop is the life of the up and coming
Not by force, by want and choice
Persuaded by the beat and the MC voice
There are people who love it across the land
And there are those that think that it should be banned
Well I say I love it, it comes from my heart
Very thankful for the day that it got its start
Now that it got started, you see it won't stop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop

Is take away my pen and my hip-hop pad
Take that away, I have nothing left
So let it go free or sentence me to death
I know you had troubles with your moms and dad
When you were growin up goin through your childhood bad
Some parents think that hip-hop means
Wearin fat shoe laces and name brand jeans
It really doesn't matter just what you say
Hip-hop will be around till you're old and grey
They're just all lies created by nerds
You think that I'm playin, you mark my words
Just like man sends rockets to Mars
Hip-hop living is ascending to stars
The more it gets accepted, you'll see it won't drop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop

Runnin neck to neck in the music world race
You don't have to listen if it isn't your taste
It's becoming worldwide, internationally known
Have you ever heard the saying 'to each his own'?
People like jazz, cause that's their taste
I prefer crisp highs with an earthquake bass
There are hip-hop songs that make you tense
And then there are those not worth 2 cents
But still hip-hop's gonna make its mark
Cause you used to only hear it in your neighborhood park
To all non-believers, you should know your name
Since the parks, don't you see how far the hip-hop came?
It's been around for years, and you ask yourself how?
For the very same reason that you're listening now
You might have been hooked from the very first line
Cause raps like these cultivate one's mind
One day your resistance level might drop
And you'll admit: it's a world of hip-hop

[VERSE 1: MC Shan]
Where I come from, we never heard of bite
We can write the freshest rhymes at the speed of light
All my planet, we're the real McCoy
And it's you Earth MC's that I wish to destroy
When I rhyme I'm never out of place
I take you on a voyage to outer space
Every rap I make, you know it always sells
I fly the galaxy wearin laser Cazels
I can fly from place to place quicker than you can snap
I'm known as the space wizard of rap
Depend on how I feel, if it's only for fun
I take my mic off of 'kill' and I set it to 'stun'
Sometimes my rhymes do inflict pain
Sends electrical impulses through your brain
In your Earthling ears my rhymes are caught
Transmitted to your brain is what's known as thought
I can see the devastation as I look in your face
Listen to how the deejays rock up in space

[VERSE 2: MC Shan]
To call yourself MC, are you out of your mind?
You have to have a golden voice similar to mine
But when you have a jam that is cold set
You play the same old records, one right after the next
For you to win the battle, Earth will have no chance
With the spinning of two records, and you call that advanced?
To do that on my planet you'd be taking a risk
Because the beats we play out live, and that's not on a disc
The first time that they see it, they might be amazed
And say, ""Why should we commit ourselves to permanent waste?""
That's why it is impossible for us to lose
Plug in the microchip of any beat that we choose
One thing where Earth and my people might match
That is the similarity and sound of the scratch
We have stamina, and also have poise
The only difference is our scratch is no sonic noise
To take Earth MC's out is what I wish to achieve
Once this is accomplished I be destined to leave
When I leave they'll call me an ace
That cool MC from outer space

[VERSE 3: MC Shan]
Although my color just might be green
I'm the flyest space MC that you ever seen
It might be in your future cause it can't be your past
But the reign of Earth MC's don't have too long to last
All you fresh MC's, you should feel ashamed
The wack around the world, you put em down with the game
They get on the mic and be coppin a plead
About how good they rock on the m-i-c
On my planet you must take a test
I'm at the top of my class because I'm the best
I use my rhyming skills for what it is worth
That's why I'm here to battle all MC's of Earth
If you take me out which ain't been done before
You might just start a interplanetary war
The war won't be to kill John and Steven
The whole point of it is to get even
The war's to get even, I will say indeed
And I will come back every year till the day I succeed
I hope I didn't stand here and offend you too much
If you ever wanna battle, then get in touch
So I can come back and dis your face

They just came from off tour and they want to tell you a little story
about where they come from

You love to hear the story again and again 
of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit you're ass had better run
Cause you're in

Dimples be the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was sucker dj's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me 
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn 
Out
By any place any part of the world
And while i'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
When she's in

The Bridge(scratched) (8X)

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you're made
Don't ever listen to what ? say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause i'm reaching for mine
And i'm from

MC Shan,"Come on y'all
Get down

It might've took a while
But you knew I had to hit you with a brand new funky rhyme
Guess you already know, so I'm ready to go
Marlon, hit me with the beat one time
Right now I'm gonna introduce myself
So y'all know just who I be
All you suckers in the house stay quiet as a mouse
Instead of Shan call me Mr. MC
I'm goin' back to the basics

When I was just a young boy, who ever would've thought
I'd grow up to be an MC
But my rhymes are so nice that they paid my price
Because fortune and fame ain't free
These words I'm recitin' are written in a style
That you ain't heard in a long time
And a song like this'll make a rapper reminisce
About the days when he was in his prime
I ain't never lost no battles yet
What made you think I would?
How many times does it take, all the rappers I break
And you still don't think I'm good
This girl in my class tried to move too fast
When she tried to pull down my zipper
Well, things got strange when the whole scene changed
And I all out tried to strip her
Teacher stepped in between, sent me straight to the Dean
That's where I thought my journey ended
Call your moms up to school, are you some fool?
And forget about bein' suspended
You went back to the basics

Here's the story on how I got started
Yes, way back in the day
With my man Infinite, Jazzy, Akim
And fly girl Roxanne Shanté
People used to hear that our crew was nice
But rappers just had to be convinced
And those who walked through 12th Street tried to say a rhyme
You seen or heard from em since
We sent em back to the basics

Yes yes y'all, it's like this y'all
MC Shan with a brand new twist y'all
One day when me and Marley Marl was playin' in a ditch
We made this jam that we knew would slam
And some day it would make us rich
Marley Marl had be thirty-six bass bottoms
And he cut you up on the spot
And with my rhymes combined all the papers got signed
And the be, be, be, be, Bridge got dropped
We went back to the basics",Back to the Basics,1988
MC Shan,"(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 1 ]
It's been so long and I paid my dues
And with rhymes like these, yo, Shan can't lose
You won't believe the strange thought that occurred to me
So intense, it absolutely startled me
I knew that I was buggin when I stopped walkin:
""I think that you should hear me, I'm your conscience talkin
If you don't want to listen, hey, it ain't no thing
You rap for a living, but you wish you could sing
You think your life is complete, there's a lot that you're missing
You enjoy making music for the people to listen
Hip-hop is your life, by oath you've sworn
Now it's time to start the mission for which you were born
You've acquired a rep, now you're labelled a villain
But I don't really care, Shan'll always be chillin
That's why I'm tryin to say, that's just part of your style
You were (born to be) wild, wild""
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)	--> Steppenwolf

(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I couldn't forget, no matter how I tried
But my conscience just wouldn't let a day go by
All day long I watched and observed
No, I gotta be jokin, that's word to Herb
I can take a lickin and keep on smilin
Who needs a license to ill, I was born to be wildin
Rhymes sweeter than a premium vintage grape
>From the paper I knew it'd sound dope on tape
Never in a rush, I'm Cold Chillin'
And the next perpetrator I find, I'm killin
Just ask your boys how many heads I flew
And that's why I roll with the Juice Crew
That voice in my mind taught me one lesson
I was born to be wild, and only suckers be fessin
I knew I had a purpose since the days of a child
I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The meaning of 'wild' is not screaming and yelling
It's 'bout showing and proving and not showing and telling
All you counterfeit rappers, you might as well quit
You'll never hear me say I'm bad, bein wild is the shit
Rap symbol, and never been defeated yet
If rap is a crime, how much time I get?
The best impersonator couldn't copy my style
And even if he did, you know what I'd do, I'll -
As a matter of fact, it's what I already did
I pulled out a rhyme and cold blasted his lip
Most opponents get on, they're guilty as tried
They're diggin and stripped of whole manhood and pride
Don't be brave and save yourself half of the bill
You can't chop me with a saw cause your ass should chill
When they're slippin on the cuts I gracefully smile
Cause I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 4 ]
Born to be wild, I'm takin command
While you're performin people screamin out: ""We want Shan!""
I'm colder than ice and hot as a flame
And my rhymes are always clever, but they're never the same
What's wrong with your girl? Somebody ought to stop her
For bein in the presence of a low-life rapper
This rhymin was pressed as a special edition
I was born to be wild and you're the one on a mission
Allow me to say that I weaken resistance
Makin examples just to prove my mortal existence
Born to be wild means a prototype
And the roar of the crowd increases the hype
You have to be bold to try and steal my rhyme
Or even to dis cause you think that I'm
A sucker, a softie, or even a child
But I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

MC Shan,"I myself I'm called a hood because I walk with a limp
Would you believe they even call my boy a hip-hop pimp?
Like Dr. King I had a dream, I couldn't sleep too long
If I had to stand alone, I'd still be strong
Men are all equal, we're the Father's creation
What used to be the distand land is now my nation
How long will it be, how many suckers must die?
There's only one answer to the question why
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

Unalikes attract and a-alikes repel
And if you buy dead dreams I got plenty to sell
All the money in the world couldn't buy my knowledge
My teacher was experience, the streets was college
It's a shame that many had to learn this way
So I never take the word of what the next man say
Head-a-arm-arm-a-leg-a-leg-a
Supreme High Being, Sole Controller, not a beggar
My true manifestation of Shan
I never fell, I held my destiny within my hand
On the day that I was born I received strike one
Because my culture was an Asiatic native son
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

My foundation is strong, so I had to destroy
Do y'all remember Cheetah, that was Tarzan's boy
My main motto is self-satisfaction
Life's a movie with no cuts, all straight up action
If you roll as a sucker, then a sucker you die
And six feet up above you is the heavenly sky
I haven't heard of any comin back to tell
Dyin must be heaven, cause livin is hell
You sit around and wait for your wish to be granted
And the next thing you know you're being buried and planted
Your body is the temple, the brain is the center
A door to explore, but you're scared to enter
Mind means many in either direction
And the dictionary listed in the poverty section
You're nothin but a novel on a bookstore shelf
And see the title of mine reads 'Went for Self'
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

You say you're sick and tired of bein rejected
And you think you do better bein crime-connected
Just for example let's say that you're twenty
Got a Benz, fly girls and doo-doo money
Moms ask: ""Where you get it?"" What you gonna tell her?
You dropped out of school, became a drug seller
You say you knew what you were doin, you say you were smart
Next week they beat you down and bust a cap in your heart
Your knowledge is the sun, you better let it shine
No matter what you do with yours, I'ma teach mine",Go for Yours ('Cause I'm Gonna Get Mine),1988
MC Shan,"The hip-hop sound went through stages
Embark on a trip as I flip through pages
This particular part 'bout a bridge on the Hudson
I first got hand by the rhymes and the cuts and
If I'm not mistaken makin two records mix
And certain deejays had a few dope tricks
If you asked to be on you would be their guest, y'all
Say a few 'ho's and a 'yes yes y'all'
They had battles of the neighborhood jocks
And I used to take the jam right straight to the box
Every now and then you'd hear gunshots ring
Just duck, what the fuck, yo, it ain't no thing
What I thought was shots was just a few pranksters
Were pow-pow-pow men juicin the gangsters

This was a time MC's used to bug out
Yo, what happened? (Yo, somebody pulled the plug out)
Just about the time when you jumped for joy
(Yo, you take my stage, I'ma kill you, boy)
Answer back and gettin smacked and your friends made jokes
(Hey, pack it up and get out of the park, folks)
But only to the cops we made some commitment
I was shocked when the stick-up kids took the equipment
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)

Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park

In the winter time they moved the jams to the ????
Do you think that the cold made the whole thing cease?
I recall sein Flash one time - no, two
Can't forget about the Queensbridge Crew
For this is the place which I made my mark
And those who resist or try to dis get sparked
In the park after dark things really got cookin
I seen the titles of idols and many chains get tooken
I seen the scatter of pack, letter for letter
If you wasn't from the town they'd beat you down
But these are just pieces of the ancient ways
But the rule still applies to the rhymes nowadays
Just wave your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
If you used to do it out in the park
Let me hear you say 'oh yeah!' (oh yeah!)
Oh yeah! (oh yeah!)

Dead dreams - still bought and sold
I strive and I strive to receive my goal
I'm still not happy up until this day
But I'm chill and I don't care what nobody say
Livin and learnin about the straight up deal
And got by cause I went by just what I feel
Cause I refuse to be mislead
By puttin pipes to my lips and smoke in my head
Think about it, much, much later
Go to school and expand because knowledge is greater
But she chose to lead that fate
Eye to eye with a dick on a $5 date

You love to hear the story again and again 
of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit you're ass had better run
Cause you're in

Dimples be the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was sucker dj's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me 
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn 
Out
By any place any part of the world
And while i'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
When she's in

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you're made
Don't ever listen to what ? say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause i'm reaching for mine

MC Shan,"My name is M.C. Shan, my destiny is the stars
Being driven around in the freshest cars
All his beats and my rhymes are chill
Now I'm back once again ready to get ill
The beat's not fake, the rhyme's hardcore
My name is M.C. Shan and I'm down by law

There's been this rumor going around
About low life crab saying I ain't down
But all MC's will feel my wrath
The system is my power the mic is my staff
I have the power of command, the power of lust
At the battles all papers read

All across the country I know I'm hated
Not only by crews I've devastated
Don't ask how I know, I just can tell
By the tone of your voice as you wish me well
Filled with so much envy that your face turns green
Cause my name rings bells on the hip-hop scene
So pull out a bottle let the champagne pour
Fly rhymes so that makes me down by law

Creeping across the nation like a midnight storm
Always rock a jam every time I perform
Records I make are not distorted
Made in New York and not imported
Have never been known to make an error
Crews see me coming, their heart full of terror
Dip out the back when I step on the scene
Watch the back door, you'll see what I mean
I love to rock a party every time I can
My DJ is Marley Marl and I'm M.C. Shan
We make the freshest jams that you've ever heard
Marl, ain't we down? (Word!)

Now that we've come to the very end
His beats my rhymes are a perfect blend
We are the ones all others admire
To be like us is their desire
Never get angry always stay calm
Yet do as much damage as a nuclear bomb
Do or say anything we may
We destroy all objects in our way
As expensive as diamonds, as precious as pearls
Rap so strong, take all y'all girls
Make cold cash money, make much much more

MC Shan,"(What's wrong with you, man?
You crazy)

I don't claim that Shan's the epitome
Your rhymes can't ban so you can't get rid of me
Line after line has a cause and effect
But I first test the mic with the 1-2 check
The hip-hop world made the Juice Crew orphans
Gained our respect sealin up much coffins
We're all obligated to Juice Crew Laws
You'se a perk if you let a man take yours
Number 2 is not to follow, yo, you must set trends
And if you ain't down with us, you can't be friends
Many of my so-called boys just flipped
But the thrill of it all - you're on the tip
Glad there is no tricks
On ours so hard we wrote your name on out
Mix after mix every record we make
To prepare or scare, so I dare you to take
Any part of the rhyme or the kickdrum sound
I be meetin you, defeatin you and beatin you down
My name rings bells and make rappers petrol
God help you, kid, when I get upset, yo
???????? bid your fans farewell
Cause the chance of you winnin is like snowin in hell
My rhymes are more than a tasket, a tisket
Too clever, yo, I never go out like a bisquit
Don't try to take my spot and not be legit
Try to vic my shoes and your feet won't fit
You're good, but compared to me you're not nearly
You think you can serve me? Come on, really
Till I can't breathe, yo, I'ma be with it
When I hear three words, you got it, I get it
My style is wild but strong and you're temporary
Violate the Juice Crew Laws and I bury
???? to the land a piece of tranquility
Suckers have the nack but they lack my ability
Those who tried to dis in the days behind us
Are back gonna dis us, brother, sign up
Make the mistake and I'm breakin your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

Never too alert, but I'm always cautious
And if you were on it you would save for some Porsches
Suckers get paid by means of distortion
My rhymes ??? your mind by means of a fortune
Rhymes clear and ????, time can't fly on
Mic, what you bring on stage you'll die on
Sit back and watch your life ???? and
If rhymes were juice I'd be Con Edison
???????????? accustomed
A sucker tried to snatch my chain and I bust him
I didn't cuff him and read him no rights
I knocked out his service and turned outs his lights
Be a ??????, don't let your boys divert you
Soup you up to battle me, kid, and I hurt you
Superior intellect made me a phenomenon
And I can go on and on and on and on
You can be blind but my rhymes still focus
And sucker tried to violete Law and I broke his
???????? tapes and his compact discs
And his boys stood around sayin (yo, he dissed you, kid)
Straight up, and I flip while a hype man 
Cuts you to pieces without puttin a knife in
You won't bleed, it feels the same
Now answer me right, boy, what's my name?
(Shan) These words respond any ???????
Guaranteed to decipher the mice from the men though
Now that I have the power make a refinement
Revealin the snakes is my next assignment
Make the mistake and I'm breakin your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

For those who betrayed me picture me ????
A few I know wish they woulda never come played me
So I'm ?????? you can't play ?????
Teach you how to rhyme, say ???????, dummy
The same period, the words don't fit
And got the nerve to get on stage and want to sing that -
Wait a minute, wait just a second
You know that's not my style - sorry, just checkin
But don't it make you sick when they be kickin la-di-da-di
But I got what it take to make you want to cold rock a party
Too hot to touch, too cold to hold ????? sadness
Junk you pop gets you dropped, stop the madness
My style is wild, my son, my child, selective
?????????? tough, ???? rough and effective
I tangle ya, mangle ya, strangle ya and then maw ya

Rhyming is a thing that I do at will
Be glad to rock a party just to prove my skill
J-u-ice is what I'm gaining
With a style so fresh that it's self-explaining
Never bite a rhyme, I don't live that way
But when I get dissed, violators pay
I'm a crowd motivator, MC annihilator
Never front the move cause I'm not a perpetrator
I don't really mind bein criticized
But those who try to make fame on my name - die

I devastate the crowd while the record spins
So call, competitors have no wins
I laugh at MC's who call me wack
You ordered, and now I'm gonna serve you, Jack
We're respected by all, treated just like kings
How could you have the nerve to say such things?
If you knew at the time what you were saying
You wouldn't be on your knees - praying
You gotta understand I'm not the average MC
At the first sign of trouble grab the mic and flee
Grab the mic, plug in the beat box jacks
Prepare for the battle, then proceed to wax
Takes much time I feel is ample
To deafen an MC, to make an example
This goes for all sucker MC chumps

To get up on stage and pop so much junk
I'm not worried cause I don't get waxed
And you wouldn't believe how hard I max
School's in session, I'm about to teach
Versatile with a style that you just can't reach
Lesson number one: first strike aim
You shouldn't do things to degrade my name
Your records won't sell cause the people won't buy em
A sucker MC's like chicken - I fry him
I started with a smash, I'ma leave with a bang
And to put it to you bluntly - MC's can't hang
Your boys and your family will be grieving your death
Weeping while they're sweeping up the pieces I left
You can come all alone or bring all your boys

Yo Shan
I didn't hear you say hip hop started in the Bridge on your record?

But her man can't understand, so he gets pissed
Like a preacher at ??? when she hurt I'll heal her
I'll leap, you sleep, and believe I steal her

I used to always wonder why she named me Shan
Not hard to pronounce, easy to spell
And oh how I love it when the ladies yell
Her man better chill when my jacket's unzipped
I got a .25 with an 8 shot clip
You're sayin to yourself: 'that's a b.b. gun'
But the place that I'ma shoot ya it'll take just one
I'll blow you into parts, little pieces and specks

It will never be repeated, so listen well
And if you been around the way, some of you might know
This girl we label as the project ho

Project ho (variations on the phrase)

If you looked half decent and you kicked it right
She was bound to be yours for at least a night
See, I was introduced to her by my cous'
But that was before he told me who or what she was
Me not knowin about this freak
Pulled her off to the side and began to speak
She had jet-black hair, big brown eyes
She seemed to be smart conversation-wise
I said, ""You look so good, as a matter of fact
Here's my number, I ain't home, baby, call me back""
I didn't know if she was poor or filthy rich
Cause my cousin didn't tell me nothin bout the bitch
One thing I did know: I'm gonna get my thrill'
Then I cold stepped off, and said, ""Baby, you chill""
You know that old saying 'if you're slow you'll blow'
She was fast, so they labelled her the Project Ho

I heard stories on the things that they said she'd do
But when I seen her, I said, 'Nah, it can't be true'
She was fair game, so I thought I'd play
And never in my life will I forget this day
I was chillin one night, I was all alone
Noddin off but awaken by the ring of the phone
To protect the guilty party, cause they mighta been stemmed
We won't say her name, so we'll just say Kim
What I heard her, goosepimples ran up my skin
I said, ""How, how you're doin, and how have you been?""
She said, ""I'm doin fine, I hope you're doin the same
Do you know who I am?"" ""Yeah, I remember your name""
I thought deep down that I peeped the card
Kept sayin to myself she was on it hard
I tried to be nice, tried to treat her kind
But she had only one thing on her mind
It always happens, well, wouldn't you know
She said, ""I see you later, cause I got to go""
My cousin came home and said, ""Are you some fool?
Being seen in the streets with a gardening tool""
I loooked up at him, cause I did not know
He said, ""Kim, that skeezer, she's the project ho""

Me myself thought homie was dissin
Despite all that I did not listen
Wouldn't you believe it, she called me again
And this was the line that I kicked then
""I love to see you, girl, and I don't know why
Don't try to play post, cause you know you're fly
So I'd like to come and see you if I may""
I was surprised as you when she said, ""Okay""
Now that that part was over and done
""Baby, what do you do at times to have fun?""
""Depending on the weather and the mood that day
Sip Dom Perrignon at a Broadway play
The other things are not good to mention
Like comin to my crib and relieve my tension""
I told her I was in love from the day we met
After talkin for hours Kim said, ""Bet""
I had to let her go just to clear my line
""So I see you on Friday, let's say about 9""
From the things she said, why didn't I know
The girl on my line was the project ho

I took her out - fine's how it went
But I better got somethin for the dough I spent
Turned on the radio and heard (a world premiere)
Turned to her and said, ""Where we go from here?""
The best part of it all, that thing that made it so treach
The clothes we wore were the same as the stretch
I recognized the look that was on her face
And I yelled to the driver, ""Homeboy, my place""
We made it there in at least a half
""I got a choice of wines and a jaccuzzi bath""
You'll scream when I tell you what homegirl said
""Show me to the room with the king-sized bed""
I was rested real well, so I felt strong
I knocked those boots that whole night long
Right after she left, I started to itch
Then I thought of what happened, then I said, ""That bitch!""
I went to see the doctor later on that day
Cause when somethin is wrong, Jack, I don't play
The doctor came over, this is what he said:
""You can't cure it with soup or layin up in your bed
You're lucky that you came to see me early, my man
Cause I guess that you know that you got it, Shan""
I said, ""Well, my man, that only goes to show:
Believe em when they tell you she's the project ho""",Project Ho,1996
MC Shan,"[ INTRO: MC Shan ]
She used to tell me that she loved me all the time
I'd turn to her and say that, ""I'm
Infatuated by your lovely smile
And some day soon we're gonna walk the isle""
She'd say, ""You're my everything, my strength for life
Be the mother of your children, as well as your wife""
She used to tell me all the time, I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[ VERSE 1: MC Shan ]
Coincidental how I met her
But when I seen her I knew that I'd get her
Can't let her step, she look too good
But my wears made me seem like a stone cold hood
I'm a lucky guy, so I press my luck
I step to her, ah what the fuck
Went her way, took a few steps past her
Got the nerve, and then I asked her
I said, ""Yo baby,"" and she started to reach
I said, ""Whoa, don't get excited, that's a figure of speech""
She told me her name, gave her number and all
And when I stepped, she said I better call
It took about a month, but she was finally mine
Everything was going smooth, we were doin fine
After a while it wasn't no thing
We were either holding hands or she was under my wing
She used to whisper in my hear I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[ CHORUS: TJ Swan ]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say
Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
I never did you wrong
And it seems we had such a love that was so strong

[ VERSE 2: MC Shan ]
On the day she broke out, would you believe I cried?
And it hurts so much to think of how she lied
I shared everything to the very last penny
Somethin that you really can't do with many
Since this young lady was such a big winner
I'd treat her all the time to a candle light dinner
Have a violinist play a real sweet song
And she never showed a sign that somethin was wrong
My boy used to say (Man Shan, I'd quit her)
But she seemed so happy everytime I'm with her
We used to hold hands and walk in the rain
And on the days I felt down she eased my pain
This was just too far-fetched to believe
To think that my girl would just up and leave
Imagine that - I just couldn't
Cause I knew deep down in my heart she wouldn't
All of a sudden a lot of things changed
She started actin funny, I mean a bit srange
We had little squabbles, arguments, fights
Wild stories in the days and stayed out nights
I'd say, ""Baby, where you been for all that time?
She cuddled me close and say that I'd
Be the one that she call her only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[ CHORUS: TJ Swan ]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say

[ VERSE 3: MC Shan ]
She put it to me plain, couldn't put it no clearer
Lipstick written on the bedroom mirror
Said, 'I'm leaving you now, and I know that you'll miss me
You're probably saying: Damn, man, why she dissed me?
But you see, I felt that it was time to go
Then I packed my bags, and I'm leavin, so
You take care and I hope you live long
And don't worry, there's nothing that you did wrong
You'll find the right girl someday, you'll see
Why I'm the type of woman that must be free'
I said, ""Why me?"" and fell to the bed
Reached for the 9 and put it to my head
And thought about the words that she once said
(Shan, you know that you're my one and only)
But she ran with another man and left my lonely

[ OUTRO: TJ Swan ]
O-o-o-oh girl, oh my girl
Why'd you have to leave?
Leave me so sad
Girl, you broke my heart
Oh, you drive me wild
You leave me by myself
All by myself
Girl, I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Ooh so wild
Baby drive me crazy
Leave me by myself
Leave me all alone
By the phone
I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Oh so wild
When I saw you leave me
Makes me want to cry
Girl, I'm breakin down
Breakin down
Yo, I don't know what to do

why'all niggas love to hear the stories again and again
Of how it all got started way back then
See it was Marly, MC Shan, the Juice Crew
Queensbridge, hip-hop land, those niggas blew (up)
Nobody said it started there
But some playa hater tryed to end a party there
Niggas didn't care they burned it, put it in the air
I took it personal readied up for warfare
Shit, yeah, what?
But time passed by, shit died out
But niggas got paid off my hood no doubt
Now everybodies rhymin, other hoods start shinin
that's ahight ''cause the Bridge'll keep risin

Niggas from every hood felt the new vibe
The word spread quick, the Bridge is still live
My dun went gold, then he went platinum
My niggas Mobb Deep had the streets right afta him
OH MY GOD, shits off the hook now
Killing kids, in the Bridge carry rap books now
Another chapter about to dominate
I guess its just in our nature, Queensbridge gotta set it straight

MC Shan,"[ VERSE 1 ]
M.C. Shan's what I'm called, I stand tall and brave
And me and Marley Marl is as close as a shave
My rhymes lock jaw like a pitbull bite
Suckers always try to sleep on me cause I look light
See, a lotta wack rappers try to rack their brains
To feel a style of MC, come on, break these chains
Speak now or hold your peace when I decide to pass this
But every rhyme you ever had could never surpass this
If rhymes were food, the main source for livin
You would swear that every line of my rhyme was Thanksgiving
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy - give me my freedom

[ VERSE 2 ]
I want to break away clean, I mean virtually spotless
And all year long I been schemin and plottin this
If beats were cakes, then my rhymes'd get frosted
This is '88 and I still ain't lost it
For all of those who still got a doubt in their mind
There ain't a rapper livin bad enough to take mine
There ain't no studio-illusion and no scratch-syncin
Stop - if that's what you're thinkin
Write rhymes simultaneously, say em in pairs
And I would hate to have a rapper proclaim they're theirs
Instead in comin in a limo, bring a casket and hearse
Before we speak we'll hear the preacher from the deacon first
We won't be gathered that day to unite no couple up
Marley, are we gettin this on tape? (Yup)
All you dirty low-down better slow down faster
Your technique isn't good enough to hang with the master
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my freedom

[ VERSE 3 ]
I'm the opposite of what you say a slob is
Dumpin suckers off is exactly what my job is
I'm feared like Napoleon and blessed like Buddah
You couldn't face me solo, you'd have to bring your crew to
Dump me off, I don't recollect the mumble
I ain't soft, homeboy, and picture me crumble
And forget all of those that don't like my rap
I don't be kickin that old shooby-dooby-doo-wop crap
Rappers often brag about their bitin deejay
But they can't do Marley nothin, no how, so hey
It's clear to the ear what I'm sayin, son
That's why we feel like slaves on the freedom run
And each and every time a wack rapper walks by me
His head starts singin: Come on and fly me...
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my freedom

[ VERSE 4 ]
We can do this like Brutus, I'm not mad, I'm pissed
This parade of mine I doubt that you can rain on this
You couldn't place my rhymes amongst mortal men
When I be rhymin on beats that set the hip-hop trend
I will always exist because I'm bein preserved
Don't agree to set me free, then you gotta be served
I earned a name amongst society as lyrically ill
But yet I'm loyal, see, cause Marley hooks the beat up still
There's no way that you could say there's a day I'd fess
Hamana-hamana-nothin, you can kill that mess
My rhymes are ruthless, no heart, and totally wretched
And if they was to fall down, then the beats would catch it
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my freedom

Give me my freedom or not
I DON'T GIVE A F-

MC Shan,"Gangs usually roll as a savage pack
Once sworn in, there's no turnin back
Initiation, manhoods are tested
Do crime, you'll fail by becoming arrested
Get beat down the line, cautiously steppin
Always watchin your back with your hand on your weapon
You blink for a minute and get brutally beaten
Every time you diss the colors it will keep on repeatin
When you say you knew somebody that was a gang member
You can't say you know him, you can only remember
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Just a walk on the block, they tell you it costs
Willingly pay - or be forced
Once your color is set you gotta be stern
A bad influence for the young that are eager to learn
The rules of a gang is fightin and killin
Did you ever stop to think that was blood you were spillin?
Duckin from the cops most the time
Because you live life devoted to crime
Gangs are mainly based on colors and races
Not everywhere, just in particular places
Hang on the corner or on the stoop
Fightin people lookin just like a terrorist group
Gangs give a rank at society level
Wear a tatoo skull with the mark of the devil
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you want to be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

No turnin back [repeated]

Had many bad dreams, nights stayin awake
Joinin a gang was the fatal mistake
Just to fill your head with knowledge till your mind goes blank
And rumble with boys and dispose of the shank
GANG can be spelled with capital letters
Yo, while you're sweepin the streets, does it make you feel better?
Some gangs lack action, they're basically talk
Until their brains get scattered on the sidewalk
Your obligation is to serve as a marionette
And by society you're treated like a homeless pet
You want to live the life of crime doin negative things
When Al Capone died, so did gangster kings
To live the life of a gangster is all out of place
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Gangs are always violent but jail is rough
You go a man and you may leave a cream puff
You say you do crime cause you're poverty stricken
And so is everybody that you're robbin and vickin
Gangs ain't gonna be around much longer
If 5 out of 10 become mentally stronger
My mother said bein in a gang ain't nothin
I didn't listen to her cause I thought she was bluffin
I thank her from my heart that she stayed on my case
Made sure my mind didn't just become another waste",A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste,2001

Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight

And if you start some shit you're ass had better run
Cause you're in

And the title of it was sucker dj's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me

MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig

Now he is down with us and he got the juice

You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you're made
Don't ever listen to what ? say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak

Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals

Forêt amazonienne, paradis sur terre
Virée sur compte en banque sous forme de billets verts
Amnésie, trou de mémoire, trop tard
La couche d'ozone est victime de l'histoire
D'hommes stupides ne pensant qu'à court terme
Mais le 494 + seven traîne
Dans les parages et fier de sa stature
Une fois de plus la terre paye en nature
Un conquistador est un con qui s'adore
Sa seule devise est d'acquérir de l'or
La conclusion que je donne à cette analyse

Est que la seule devise reste la devise

Une secte abjecte injecte dans l'économie
Le narco-dollar et Solaar en est l'ennemi
Un homme en blouse blanche
Fabrique de la poudre blanche
Et dans l'ombre le cauchemar commence
Le cinq cents one blâme, l'infâme dealer de came
Don't le siège social se trouve sur le macadam
Donc stop, tel est mon vote sans équivoque
Ça te choque, je m'en moque, la vie n'est pas un jack pot
L'homme en blouse te blouze, il te pique ton flouze
Qu'il cherche à investir dans l'Europe des douze
Because, sa cause est la dose qu'il propose sans pose
En un mot, il impose l'overdose
Accumule un pécule qu'il calcule sans cesse
Il vole les imbéciles mais bref
La conclusion que je donne à cette analyse

Est que la seule devise reste la devise

Doublement, triplement, indubitablement hardcore
Forts soyons et mettons-nous d'accord
Je, tu, il, en fait nous sommes

Elle bat de l'aille la belle, see'est un fait
A cause de la folie meurtrière

A l'heure où la joie laisse place à la douleur
Où l'inquiétude laisse place à la peur

Impossible, inaccessible pour tous ces tocards

Cette fois le ciel est beau, je squatte en solo
Sur un banc public près de Campo Formio
Je pense à L'Sos issu de mon esprit
Allo papa tango Charly

Le père de celle qui partagea mon Dunlopillo
Avait des idées proches de celle de J.M. le stylo
Hostile à mon style j'ai filé passé composé
Pour créer le plus que parfait

Elle suit son chemin, je suis le chemin
Tous les chemins mènent à l'homme dit le parchemin
Le papa gaga a pour dada des thèses cacas
Laarso néo-dada fait du prose combat

MC Solaar,"See'est avec la fluidité qui me caractérise
Que Bambi coule sur le tempo,
Comme le caramel sur un Flandise
Il why a trop de violence au ciné, see'est moche
Ça déteint sur les mioches qui se battent lorsque sonne la cloche
Ils volent les répliques des truands, en font leurs idoles
Dupliquent leurs attitudes qui déplaisent à l'école
Tandis que leurs mères leur inculquent de bonnes manières
Ceux-ci rêvent d'avoir un frère comme Schwarzenegger
Tels sont les effets do grand écran sur les petits
Observe les faits divers, je vois que tu as saisi
Oublie un peu ta vidéo don't la haine est le thème
Et commence à vivre de vraies Relations humaines

Underground et populaire est Laarso
A l'instar de la star des transports, le métro
Classe je me place en place avec classe
Parce que Laarso casse la masse au son de cette basse
Piner Derechef celle qui opinait do chef
Etait l'occupation principale de mon amie Steph
Le black méga mac était pris dans un micmac
D'un coté le cœur et de l'autre crac-crac
Je ne lui demande pas d'avoir des amours platoniques
Mais que le coté cœur soit plus tonique
Moi j'aime la province évincée par le système
On why trouve le vrai, le beau, les relations humaines

Je suis tenace, me mets en face do micro
Casse le tempo où passe ma voix qui l'enlace
Laisse de l'espace à celui qui soudain flotte
Comme un astronaute sur la musique et évite les fausses notes
Invité à une party dans mon voisinage
Je repère une fille puis passe à l'abordage
Au départ elle rechigne, trépigne
Puis cligne de l'œil, see'est un signe
Ses copines lui glissent quelques consignes
Nos anatomies collées sur cette musique que l'on aime

MC Solaar,"Elle se baladait en chantant la, la, la quand
Je l'ai rencontrée j'aurais aimé être Lacan
Dés les premiers rapports, elle me fit du mal
J'étais le mâle et la femelle fait mal

Dieu sait qu'elle, sait quelles, séquelles
Acide et douce telle la citronnelle

La Miss me laisse par son acte con,
J'ordonne l'abscisse mais cela reste abscons.
J'ai un esprit sain dans un corps très sain
Je fais le bien mais elle est allée voir plus loin

J'en garde des séquelles mais je sais qu'elle sait
Que le silence est d'or, est d'or, alors je me tais.

Sur la plage des costauds jouent aux dominos,
Elle me fait constater que j'ai moins d'abdominaux
Que je n'ai pas les triceps de Sylvester Stallone
Mais ça me froisse le cortex: ""Je m'appelle Claude.""

Dieu sait qu'elle, sait quelles, séquelles
Vive ou vivote dans mes aires sensorielles.

Pourtant classé non-macho, je n'étais pas collabo
Des mythes d'infériorité dont te taxait Rousseau
Mais Miss me nomme Lilliput comme chez Swift,
Du fait de mon mètre soixante-dix-huit
Oh ! Belle, elle est belle, elle est bonne, elle a du bol la demoiselle,
Elle se trouvait des défauts, je trouvais qu'elle était belle.

J'en garde des séquelles mais je sais qu'elle sait
Que le silence est d'or, est d'or, alors je me tais

Aujourd'hui, je sais que j'ai été un imbécile;
Elle était presque ma presqu'île
Les beaux parleurs ont beau parler
La belladone reste à mes yeux de toute beauté.

Seul Dieu sait quelles sont les séquelles
Incrustées dans ses yeux de miel

J'ai tenté de répondre à ses besoins,
En m'inspirant du fin du fin
Cela fait des années que je suis classé dans les bons,
Mais bon, le son de son silence me fait monter d'un demi-ton.
Elle m'inspire,
Tout comme le souvenir de son sourire

Que le silence est d'or, est d'or, alors je me tais...",Séquelles,1994
MC Solaar,"J'avais jadis un pote qui ne pensait qu'à ses groupies
Une fois dans le show-biz il a tourné comme une toupie
Il a sorti un disque et s'est pris pour une superstar
Oubliant ses amis et les traitant comme des clochards
Sa vie n'était faite que de bluff et de meufs
Pour lui c'était routine il n'y avait rien de neuf
Vivant sur la gloire au lieu de vivre sur la qualité
En moins de quelques semaines il s'est pris pour une sommité
De la rime et des mots dans l'art d'arrimer les mots
Mais je sais que son album n'était qu'une démo
Je n'étais pas le seul mais j'ai fermé ma gueule
Parce que ses groupies ne voulaient pas le laisser seul
Autour de lui se créait un monde hors monde
Fait de rousses, de châtain, de brunes et de blondes
Ce sont ces points de détail qui flattent son ego
Il en oublie le texte, il joue au gigolo
'Disrespect' les femmes et frime
Une de perdue, dix dans la limousine
Je pense que sa place est à l'adresse qui suit
Au seize de la Faisanderie dans le seizième à Paris

Beaucoup de tes amis me disent que tu me jalouses
Au lieu d'en être fier c'est pour toi que j'ai le blues
Tu analyses mes textes pour avoir de l'intellect
Je m'aperçois qu'en fait tu jalouses ta bibliothèque
Mais rien ne sert de copier l'originalité
Si tu te modèles au modèle tu deviens pâte à modeler
Au départ tu critiques, aujourd'hui tu imites
Ton intelligence grandit, voici ton seul mérite
Car imitation égale limitation
Demande à mes muses elles te diront
Que l'art ne fait pas l'armistice avec l'arnaqueur
Tu ne fais que suivre la vague, espèce de surfer
Souviens-toi de l'histoire de l'art
De Jina Penn, Duchamps, des compressions de Solaar
Constate que je te fouette avec poésie
Et prends cette anti-phrase toi mon meilleur ami
Les amis de mes amis sont mes amis OK

Tu fais des duplicata de mon art, j'irai te voir ici

Als Kind spielte ich Fußball
Sie war der Ball, leider gab es einen Torwart
Wenn ich reintraf, jubelte sie
Mit ihrem langen Kleid war sie einzigartig
Vielleicht war ich zu brav
Ich hätte sie abends auf dem Hügel streicheln sollen
Ich stamme vom gesitteten Menschen ab
Gab ihr nur einen Abschiedskuß, bevor sie umgezogen ist
Alle meine Freunde fanden das schön
Ich brauche wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.

Wahre Liebe. Jetzt und auf der Stelle.
Jetzt sieht man mich I'm Fernsehen

Von der Moderne zum Mittelalter
Trotz meines Images bleibe ich vernünftig
Was ist der Sinn des Lebens?
Ist die schönste Schönheit nicht die einer Freundinn,
Frage ich mich oft. Umberto Eco. Notizbuch:
Die Seiten sprechen von Zeiten des Irrtums
Zu Hause betrachte ich die Wand

Une caméra avance gros plan sur Dominique
Seule devant la glace elle ausculte son corps
Puis crie machinalement encore quelques efforts
Tous les régimes sur elle furent testés
Toutes les tentatives ont été des échecs complets
Mais elle persévère et pour plaire à son homme
Dominique a décidé de suivre la norme
Elle emmagasine, des magazines
Dans lesquels elle pense trouver le recours ultime
Maso, à l'assaut de ses formes rondelettes

Elle était occupée à couper du pécu
Car on lui piquait les fesses, une victime de la mode

Tellement d'efforts et pour quels résultats ?

Qu'elle veut être la réplique d'une créature de clip
Ainsi font font font les petites filles coquettes
Elle suivent un modèle qui leur fait perdre la tête
From London, Washington, Kingston, Sharengton ou Carcassonne

À l'analyse logique de cette situation
Le régime, le jogging, la liposuccion
Sont à tester mais il faut faire attention
Espérons que vous aurez compris
Les bases très claires de ce code de déontologie
Prendre ou perdre quelques kilos
L'essentiel est d’être vraiment bien dans sa peau
Ma tactique attaque toute éthique avec tact
Dominique pas de panique
Écoute bien ce funky beat
La quête de l'image la laisse dans le stress

Comme par hasard elle me commande un pan-chorizo
J'ai compris le complot cuando la fille me dit te quierro
Amigo, dans le barrio on se pavanait sec.
Sex six jours sur septembre Tequila, pas de prise de tête
Mais ça n'a pas plu à certains pistoleros
Bagarreurs tel Valera de vraies têtes de vils héros
Expulsé de la ville tel un sans pap
Seul sans barillet, isolé tel un catho sans pape
Quand je pense à toi Rachel Esmeralda
J'en ai la gorge serrée mais bon j'ai des valda

Eso es amor sin dolor
Hasta la próxima mi amor
Eso es amor sin dolor
Hasta la vista mi amor

On est en Californie, bien avant be	-Watch
J'marche solo tel un orphelin dans la poche de Bihac
Why a des noichs Kwan Chang Ken et des gringos
Dégringolent why a des panchos sous les sombreros
À contre-jour Esmeralda déesse
Les yeux pleins de liesse sort do Poney Express
Elle me dit vamonos, je réponds yes
See'était Bonnie et Claude dans notre Dame de Barbès
Hasta la vista, générique final
Hasta la próxima, on part vers l'ouest à cheval
Tout le monde se lève il n'why a plus personne dans le ciné
Le film est terminé mais j'entends chanter

Eso es amor sin dolor
Hasta la próxima mi amor
Eso es amor sin dolor
Hasta la vista mi amor",Hasta la Vista (Intro),2001
MC Versatile,"I feel you moving close closer to me now 
Now that I am free now I'm not in need 
Where we were before where we were before 
I was not content your messing with my head 
So why should I let you back in? 

Tellin' me that its all cool 
But I wont be a fool for you 
No more no more 
Tellin' me that we're alright askin' 
Why I said goodbye that was kind of obvious 
Its kind of obvious 

[Chorus: x2]
Tell me what it is tell me what it is 
That's got me down like this what is it you do? 
I'm losing all control 
I'm weak when I am not by you 

I feel yourself work again 
But I don't wanna be let back in why you makin' this so heard 
I feel like I'm out in his head 
And it hurts so bad that your well aware but I am so helpless 
I'm helpless for your love 

[Chorus: x2] 

I love you, I need you, I want you, I miss you 
I cant live without you oh baby I feel you 
U mean the world to me but what do I mean to you 'cause 
When I'm all alone all I want is you 
'cause you know your my lady lady but you drive me crazy crazy 
I wanna kiss you I wanna held you but will you b my baby baby 
I'm yours and your mine so baby go ease your mind 
Just take the time to un-wind 
'cause true love is so hard to find
